You're out in the middle of nowhere, thanks to a wrong turn you made somewhere on your way back to a vacation to Niarga Falls.  To make matters worse, you don't have a good map so you can make it back to a city.  And your car has broken down in the middle of a spooky-looking forest.  You know how to fix cars, but your car refuses to start at all...and everything is connected, so it should be working, but it's not.  You're completely baffled at this.  After 30 minutes fiddling with your car and trying to fix it, you hear a noise somewhere in the woods.  Luckily, you packed a flashlight in case something like this should happen.  You turn on the flashlight and you shine the light out into the woods to see what is making the noise.  You see nothing, but this forest is thick with trees.  You shrug your shoulders and forget about the noise...it's probably an animal snooping around. You continue to work on your car. <br>\r\n       Five mintes passes, and you give up starting up the car again.  It looks like you need to walk to a nearby house and call in a tow truck...if you can find a house.  You haven't seen a house for hours...in fact, you haven't seen any sign of civilization for about 2 hours now.   You sigh and look up the road that you're on.  The road that you're on is little more than a dirt road with a thin layer of gravel on it.  As you look down the road, you hear a low hooting of an owl off in the woods somewhere.  Luckily it's a warm night, or you would really be in trouble.  It's a clear night, and a half-moon is high in the sky.  You're so far away from any city that you can see the Milky Way in the sky...looks kinda neat.  You sigh again and make your decision.  You'll have to walk and hopefully find a house that has a phone so you can call for a tow truck.  So, you make your way up the road, whistling a tune as you walk.   <br>\r\n         After you've walked about a mile, you see the forest is thinning a little and you can see a huge Victorian house coming up.  The Victorian house is on a little hill that the dirt road goes to.  The house looks spooky at night, and you can see several lights in the house...meaning, they might have a phone.   <br>\r\n      Another half a mile, and you come to a sign nailed to a tree.  You shine your flashlight at the sign to see what's written on it.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"This is the house of Cassandra Von Fel Lyaniak.  Go back if you value your mortal soul\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        The sign is written in red letters that are 12 inches tall and faded.  Below the writing is another language that you can't read at all.  It looks as if it saids the same thing in the other language, but it's impossible to tell.  This sign makes you uneasy at once and you feel as if you don't wanna go to the house.  You also feel like you're being watched, but you see nobody around you.  What to do?  </span></div></div>",

As you make your way to the house, you see someone looking out of the windows of the house.  It's a shadow of someone, and it's not a shadow of a human.  You take another look and the shadow is gone.  You shake your head again, and continue your way to the Victorian house.  <br>\r\n       The Victorian house has 5 stories, has a single tower and looks to be well-kept.  Despite that look, the house looks spooky still.  You see the Victorian house has a porch and something hanging on the door to the  house.  You walk up the stone steps up to the porch and you can now see what is hanging on the door; It's the head of a bat.  It looks like the bat's head is attached to the door by something you can't see.  As you walk up to the door, the bat head's eyes suddenly open and it begins to talk to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"The Lady Cassandra is busy at the moment.  Please wait here\" said the bat's head in a polite but gruff voice.  <br>\r\n     You have a good mind to run away right now.  This is seriously making you uneasy. You now regret ever coming to the house at all, and start to head off the porch.<br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

I\u2019m hurt.\u201d You turn and find your gaze being sucked into the silver eyes of the most stunning woman you have every seen. Your eyes seemingly move of their own will as they take in her face before traveling down to study her body. Your breath catches as you see indications of her obviously inhuman beauty, and you try to step away from her, but your body is not listening to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips quirk into a grin. \u201cDo you like what you see?\u201d she asks and does a little pirouette, body twirling tantalizingly in front of you. She laughs at your slack jawed response. \u201cHow adorable, but you came here for something sweetie?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026need to use the phone.

And yet, something else beckons you forward, something dark, seductive, and hungry.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This woman isn't human at all, yet you feel like you can trust her...despite the sense of forbodding you feel.  The woman has hoofs for feet and talons istead of hands...and dragon-like wings on her back and the sides of her head.  This didn't make her unattractive.   <br>\r\n         \"So\" the woman saids in her honey-dripping voice.  \"are you coming in or not?\"<br>\r\n         You shake off the sense of forbodding and enter her house.  You enter a long hallway that opens up to a huge room.  You enter the room, and you're followed by the inhuman woman.  The large room has a grand staircase in it, much like what the Addams Family has in thier house in the movie.   The room also had several bookcases and pictures on the wall.  All of the pictures were of that inhuman woman.  The room is lighted by a chandlier that dominates the roof of the room.  You take a closer look and realize the chandlier has real candles in it.  <br>\r\n       \"Where's your phone?\" you ask.<br>\r\n        \"Through here\" said the woman, heading to a room off of the large room that looks to be a living room.  You follow her in the room, now seeing a scaly tail coming from the woman.  The tail ended in a shovel-shaped stud.  <br>\r\n          \"By the way, my name is Cassandra\" said the woman.  \"as you can see, I'm not human\"  <br>\r\n             \"Umm...yeah\" you say.<br>\r\n          The living room has two sofas in it, pointing at each other.  In the middle of the room there stood a long squuare table.  The table looked to be made out of some kind of dark wood.  You look around the room.   You see booksleves on three of the four walls. A huge fireplace dominated the fourth wall.   The phone--which was a French phone--is resting on the table between the sofas.<br>\r\n          \"The phone is there\" said Cassandra.  <br>\r\n          You pick up the phone, but Cassandra gives you a look.  Again, your body is out of your control and you put the receiver bsck on the phone.<br>\r\n            \"What's your hurry?\" asked Cassandra.  \"it's almost dinnertime...would you like to stay for a meal?\"<br>\r\n             The sense of forbodding is increasing, but you nod your head.   Cassandra smiles.  <br>\r\n            \"Look\" you say, back in control of your body.  \"I really need to get out of here and...\"<br>\r\n           \"But you must stay for dinner\" said Cassandra.   <br>\r\n          \"Alright...I'm hungry myself\" you say, and It's true.  You haven't eaten since that afternoon and you feel ravenous at the moment.  <br>\r\n           \"Who said you'll do the eating?\" asked Cassandra with a smile that sends shiver down your spine.  That question makes you want to leave this house right now, but your legs refuse to obey.  <br>\r\n           \"Don't worry\" said Cassandra.  \"I'm sure you'll like it in my stomach\"<br>\r\n             </span></div></div>",

You look up at the smiling face of Cassandra.  You start to run when she reaches for you.  You don't get very far when Cassandra grabs you and lifts you up to her face.  You unsteadily stand on her open palm, feeling like you're in the hand of a goddess...but this woman is no heavenly being!  You began to plea to Cassandra not to eat you, getting on  all fours and groveling before her.  <br>\r\n                   \" Too bad I'm hungry\" said Cassandra.  \"see you later, tiny mortal\"  With that, she tosses you into her open mouth and you land on her slippery tongue.   The tongue begins to roll you all over the mouth.  Cassandra making \"hmmm\"ing sounds while she does this, savoring your taste.  After about 2 minutes of that, Cassandra swallows you down.  You fall for what seems like hours (although its really five minutes), until you're forced through a ring of muscle and enter a large chamber--the stomach.  This is how you're gonna meet your end it looks like.  You close your eyes and wait for death to embrace you.  You land with a squishy sound and wait to die a horrible death.        <br>\r\n                   \"Hey there\" you hear a voice.  \"get up.

Or at least that what you thought you were doing. Instead the instant you step out of the room, you find yourself running not into the front area with a door that leads to the outside, and safety, but back into a mirror image of the room you\u2019d thought you\u2019d left. Scratch that, it is the same room as Cassandra is standing before you, wide grin on her lips, arms opened wide to receive you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crash into her at full speed, and she doesn\u2019t move, or stumble in anyway.

She smiles down at you as she shreds your underwear off of you.  She then does something that makes you panic.  She begins to give you a blowjob.  You try to stop her, but your body isn't listening to you.  You're willing your cock to stay limp, but it isn't working.  Cassandra keeps sucking until you explode in her mouth.  You now seem to be able to 'keep firing' for much longer than it seems possible.  When Cassandra is done, you feel drained of energy, but you're still alive.  She looks at you in the face.  Her lips are covered in your cum, and she licks it off with her forked tonuge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yum\" said Cassandra.  \"I do like the taste of semen...well..time for the main course\"  She then opens her jaw impossibly wide and you see a row of sharp teeth.   You see her forked tongue glistening with salvia.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Don't eat me!\" you plead.  \"I'll do anything!  Just don't eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Cassandra stops and closes her very wide mouth and looks at you with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Anything?\" she asks and looks you directly in the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     God, those eyes are amazing.  You can just lose yourself in them...drown in thier depths.  You don't seem able to blink when you look at her silvery eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Anything\" you nod.  \"just don't eat me please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Oh right\" said Cassandra.  \"Then be my slave\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Be my slave\" said Cassandra.  \"if you don't want to be my slave, I'll eat you....would it really be so horrible to be eaten by me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       It's either being a slave, or becoming dinner for this demonic woman.   Talk about choosing between two evils.  You have to admit that being eaten by this beautiful, yet evil, woman would be a desired fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Cassandra frowns at you.  \"Who says I'm evil?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Why, if anybody wants to eat me, they gotta be..\"  you trail off, realizing that you haven't said anything about evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Not out loud\" said Cassandra.  \"but you thought it.  That's not nice calling someone you don't know evil\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"But--!\" you say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"I'll admit that I'm a succubus\" said Cassandra.  \"but that doesn't make me evil\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"A succubus drains the life out of people\" you say.  \"and that's not evil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"When a whale eats plankton, it's not evil...it's feeding\" said Cassandra.  \"me draining away life from mortals is my way of feeding and sustaining my life...evil is a point of view\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       You don't know what to say to that.   You ran into a \"good\" demon?  Can there be a \"good\" demon...with all that you know about demons, it seems highly unlikely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Humans only get the abridged version of the Bible\" mutters Cassandra.  Louder, she says;  \"Anyway, that's beside the point.  You're just trying to delay my eatting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"But...if you're not evil, then why eat me?\" you ask.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"I'm hungry\" said Cassandra, who smiles.  \"and anyway, who says I'm going to digest you.

Sure, she says that she doesn't have to digest you, but what if she's just lying to get you to submit to her belly? Regardless, you remain stunned, unable to respond to her cryptic statement. Cassandra, the hungry brute that she is, finds herself unable to wait any longer. Her talons lock onto her shoulders and pull your upper body forward, setting your head just before her gaping maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last chance, kid.

Her skin stretches without issue, painlessly engulfing it. Her rows of dagger-like teeth scrape lightly against your exposed skin, leaving only superficial wounds. It's a hot, moist environment inside, though that was to be expected. Surprisingly, her breath doesn't even smell, considering the blowjob she had just given you. Her forked tongue reaches forward and runs across your face, tasting the delicious salt of your sweaty skin. It must be good, your surmise, as she devotes a good deal of time to licking your face down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, she's had enough. Her tongue stops and you feel her talons lift the rest of your body up. They push it upwards, drawing more of you into her mouth. Again, it stretches without issue to accommodate your broad shoulders. From there, she continues on, dragging your chest and ribcage in as well. At this point, you have been brought far enough in that your head is now pressing against her upper esophagus. The tiny tube, just like the mouth before, expands quickly and becomes just big enough for your noggin to slip in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin your trip down her esophagus,  Cassandra has finally reached your lower body. Your hips, thighs, and calves pose no issue and slide right in, leaving only your feet exposed. With one powerful, inhuman inhale she manages to bring them in. With your entire body inside her, her natural processes take over and drag you the rest of the way. You fall into the stomach with a sickening plop, landing in stomach acid. It doesn't burn immediately but you feel that it is only a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra, feeling a fullness she has not felt for a while, reclines on the couch rubbing her massive belly. It is a glorious feeling, one that only a predator such as she could ever truly feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Miss...\" a voice in the doorway calls. It is Dennis, her personal slave and attendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, Dennis, have you finished the yard-work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, Miss. What would you have me do next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" she trails off as she digs her talons into her belly, \"How about you go run a bath for me. I've had a meal and I want to relax it off, if you catch my drift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe departs in an instant, a determined man. Cassandra, meanwhile, has a decision to make. She had told her meal that she might not digest him since it was in her power. As she rose to go take her bath, she decided that...</span></div></div>",

Dennis continues to shrink down until he's about 3 inches tall.  Cassandra is holding him in her hand, and she smiles down at him.  She then lifts Dennis high above her open mouth and drops him into her mouth.  She plays with Dennis in her mouth, covering him with salvia..and then, you hear a \"gulp\" and see a small lump in Cassandra's throat going downwards to her stomach.<br>\r\n        \"Dennis, you are delicious\" said Cassandra, rubbing her stomach.  \"now, where were we?\"<br>\r\n         She sits on the couch next to you and you sudddenly are able to move again...but you don't get up and try to escape.

You resist at first, but you return the kiss just as passionately.  It's like you're under a spell and you can't break free of it...not that you want to.   You know that she's a succubus and she's just after your body and you don't give a shit about it.  You know that she'll suck the life enengry out of you,  but you gladly give her that if she asked for it.

You stop struggling at once and you look at her.<br>\r\n           \"What is it with your mortals?\" asked Cassandra.  \"you meet a succubus, and you run for it...you should be lured to me like a fish is lured to a fishing pole\"<br>\r\n          \"I...want to keep my life energy if you don't mind\" you say.  <br>\r\n          This makes her laugh.  \"Good luck with keeping that from me.

You hear the trap door close above you, but you can't see anything at all.  The stone silde ends in a pile of hay in what must be the basement of the house.  The basement is lighted with lamps and light bulbs alike and seems to be just one big room.   In one corner, you see what must be the furance to the house...but it looks to be not working at the moment.  The big room looks to be a living area...a family room or living room.  There's 2 loveseats and a very long sofa in the middle of the room, pointed towards a big-screen TV.  <br>\r\n       \"Hello?\" you yell.  \"anybody home?\"<br>\r\n       A sound of footsteps comes from the floor above you, and what sounds like two people talking to each other.  One voice belongs to a male, and the other voice belongs to a female. The two voices seem to be having an argument at the moment.<br>\r\n        \"Okay, okay\" said the male voice. \"I'll go check the stanger in the basement\"<br>\r\n        In a few moments, you hear someone coming down the stairs in the opposite corner of where the furnace is.  It turns out to be a man that looks to be in his late 20's or early 30's.   He has red hair and blue eyes, and is wearing a bathrobe with stars all over it.  The bathrobe itself is black, and the stars on it seem to shimmer before your eyes.  <br>\r\n          \"Who are you, then?\" asks the man.<br>\r\n          \"Steven\" you say.  \"Who're you?\"<br>\r\n           \"Dennis\" said the man.  \"what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n         \"My car broke down and I came here to call in a tow truck\" you say.<br>\r\n         At that moment, a woman appears from behind Dennis.  The woman is stunningly beautiful, and you can't help but stare at her eyes.  The woman has silver eyes, making it appear that she has no pupils.  You try to look away, but you just can't stop looking at those wonderful eyes.  <br>\r\n          \"Cassandra!\" barks Dennis.  \"did you bring him here as well?\"<br>\r\n          This snaps you out of your trance, and you suddenly realized that this Cassandra isn't human at all!  She looks just like Morrigan from the Darkstalkers video game, except for the blue hair and silver eyes.  She also has hoofs instead of feet, and she had talons instead of hands, each with a deadly-looking claw at the end of it.<br>\r\n          \"Welcome to my house, mortal\" said Cassandra.  \"Once you've entered my house, you can't get out ever again\"  She says this with a cruel smile that sends shivers up and down your spine.<br>\r\n          \"Cassandra, did you...?\" started Dennis.<br>\r\n          \"No, I didn't call him here\" said Cassandra.  \"he just found his way here after his car broke down.

Suspicious you await her reply as you peer at her slightly pointed ears and pore over her arched spined back, you notice that she has silvery glinting eyes which seem innocent, but you spot a slight canine over her pert rosy lip and decide to shut your mouth. Her violet shoulder-length hair streams over her pert rounded shoulders, greenish emerald scales glinting in the dusky half-light.

On the wooden signpost, there's a drawing of what looks like Morrigan from the Darkstalker games...but with blue hair and silvery eyes...those silvery eyes make it look like the woman has no pupils.   You gasp as the drawing on the signpost comes to life and begins to talk to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Welcome, mortal, to the Forest of Lady Cassandra Von Fel Lyanik.  In this forest, there are five paths in which to follow...but you have to choose which path to take.  If you like to meet the Lady Cassandra, stay on the path with this signpost next to it...if not, then good luck leaving this forest alive.  You may ask me 5 questions\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n       \"Who's Cassandra?\" you ask before you know what's happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Lady Cassandra Von Fel Lyanik is a succubus, daughter to Zorhta Klanik and Lord Seth Von Fel Lyanik\" said the signpost.  \"Lord Seth is the 3,320th son of Lucifer.  Zortha Klanik is the leader of the Order of The Succubi, which Cassandra is a member of.  1 question down, 4 to go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"What...is in this forest?\" you ask.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Many things\" said the signpost simply.  \"2 questions down, 3 to go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Wait, wait\" you say.  \"you say that Lucifer really exists?\"  You just remember what the signpost said out Cassandra's father.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Yes\" said the signpost.  \"and Heaven help you if you run into him, mortal.  2 questions are left\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"What is the quickest way out of here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"By seeing the Lady Cassandra\" said the signpost.  \"as long as you're in this forest, you'll never get out unless you go to Lady Cassandra.   Some mortals that have come in here, are still here...even after 300 years.   1 question remains\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"You're saying that I'm immortal when I'm in this forest?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"No\" said the signpost.  \"in this forst, Cassandra's magic keeps mortals like you alive...her magic causes you to age slower than normal.  All question have been asked....walk past me and choose your path\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You walk past the talking signpost without moving your legs at all....as if you're a puppet on a string.   A little ways past the signpost, the path splits up in 5 separate paths.  Each path has a signpost next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Path 1 -- The signpost is of a succubus...must lead to Cassandra<br>\r\n <br>\r\n   Path 2 ---   The signpost shows a incredibly fat man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Path 3 --  The signpost shows the head of Bugs Bunny <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Path 4 --  This signpost shows a candy cane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Path 5 ---  The signpost looks as if something has shredded it to ribbons, making you unable to see what had been on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Choose well\" said a melodic male voice out of nowhere.  </span></div></div>",

You shrug your shoulders and make up your mind.  You take a step on the path that will lead to Cassandra.  The path seems to be leading you deeper and deeper into the forest and not back to the house.  Does that mean that Cassandra is in the forest?   <br>\r\n                        The path winds through the forest and double-back on itself a few times.   At one point, the path crosses a thin creek which you hop across.  This path seems to be really long....like miles and miles long.  Every five miles or so you see a signpost with Cassandra's picture on it which hopefully means that you're getting closer and closer.  <br>\r\n                           At long last, you reach a wide clearing that has no trees in it.  It does have a rather large bonfire right in the middle of it...and in front of the fire stands a tall figure.  You hesitate before walking up to the bonfire.  You see several benches surrounding the bonfire as well as what looks like a porta-potty like what you see in some national parks.  The figure standing in front of the bonfire is clearly chanting something...is that language Latin?    You clear your throat as you enter the clearing.<br>\r\n                   The figure stops chanting and whirls around.  <br>\r\n                    \"Ah, you've come at last\" said the figure in a melodic voice.   Then the figure starts walking right towards you.  As it does, the features of the figure come into focus.  It's none other than Cassandra!  <br>\r\n                          In person, Cassandra looks a lot more sexy.  She's the carbon copy of Morrigan from the Deathstalker games save for her hair color...and bust size.  Cassandra has large breasts--probably Double D's or even bigger than that.  She wears  skintight clothes that shows off her curves.  She's taller than you are and just oozes sex.  <br>\r\n                          \"Welcome mortal\" said Cassandra, opening her arms wide and embracing you tightly.   \"to my forest\" <br>\r\n                          \"H-h-hello there\" you say.  \"My name is Steven\"<br>\r\n                           \"And I'm Cassandra\" said Cassandra.   \"but you've probably guessed that, right?\" <br>\r\n                           \"My car broke down and I need to call someone to fix my car...\" you say.  <br>\r\n                          \"I do have a phone back at the house\" said Cassandra.    \"but what's your hurry?  We can wait until morning to fix your little problem\"<br>\r\n                          \"Look I'm seriously freaking out here\" you say.    \"I just want to...\"<br>\r\n                            Right at that moment Cassandra leans forward the kisses you.  When she does your mind goes blissfully blank.   All of your worries just seep out of you...and you have no concerns at all.  All that matters now is pleasing your mistress....to please Cassandra....<br>\r\n                                 The kiss ends.  <br>\r\n                                    \"Whoa..\" you say.   \"w.w.w.....what was that?\"<br>\r\n                                   \"The power of my kiss\" said Cassandra, smiling.   \"if I kiss you two more times, you'll become my willing slave\"  <br>\r\n                                  \"I don't want to be your slave!\"  you yell.  Then you break the embrace between you and Cassandra.   When you do you notice that you're naked and so is.....my god, Cassandra looks even sexier nude!<br>\r\n                               \"It's alright if you don't want to be my slave\" said Cassandra.   \"but I am going to make love to you right here.  It's the only way to get out of my forest...to become my lover for tonight\"<br>\r\n                            \"What happened to my clothes?!\"<br>\r\n                             \"I can show your pleasures that'll make your brain bleed\" said Cassandra.   \"just make love to me\"<br>\r\n                               </span></div></div>",

Keep in mind, You won't die when you enter the Land of Anthro-toons, but you can still feel pain. You will heal in moments, though.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let go and the letter went back into the sign. You pulled down the pull-string of the 'Human' sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The human path leads to shows like Flintstones, Jetsons, Simpsons, Family Guy, American Dad, King of the Hill, Daria, Futurama, and various other shows that have either a full human cast or a mostly human cast. This path also includes the animated versions of Star Trek, Happy days, Laverne and Shirley, Gilligan's island (which went by the name 'Gilligan's planet') Jeannie (Info here <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://hanna-barbera.wikia.com/wiki/Jeannie\" target=\"_blank\">http://hanna-barbera.wikia.com/wiki/Jean...</a> ) And various others that may have been forgotten by the public. Unlike the 'Anthro' path, you will not heal in moments unless someone uses magic or some special technology to do so. You do have the possibility of dying, but the begins that live down this path are far more reasonable than the ones that live down the 'Anthro' path.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let of of the 'Human' Pull-string and the letter went back into the sign.

The signs read 'civilization' and 'wilderness'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the Civilization path lead to what looked like either a town or a city. It was hard to determine from this spot. Your memories of the cartoons that took place in towns or cities let you know that if you were polite and didn't try to force anyone to do anything they didn't want to would let you go unharmed. However, you, on the other hand, could easily be taken advantaged of by Toons that had less-than-noble intentions and they had a good chance at getting away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wilderness path vanished into the woods, though it seemed like there was a lake with a river leading away from it. The cartoons you recalled taking place in the wild gave you the knowledge that you could be a bit more forceful than in the city, but not by much. In the city, you had protection whenever the law was around. In the wild, you did not have that. If you ticked off the wrong being, you could run, but it had a chance of you getting caught and beaten up, unless you somehow aroused a female anthro in the wild. Then you'd be winding up in a shotgun marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad for you, a warning sign had been smashed to pieces and hidden. If it hadn't been, you'd know that within a few hours, it would be ladies' night and you'd be at the mercy of any female.</span></div></div>",

Izzy squabbled around, but couldn't keep up the struggle as he soon gave in, swallowed the potion, and gasped for fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt, you really don't have to be so rough with him,\" Mimi chided after taking a look at Izzy, who looked a little sick and nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill out!\" Matt snapped, giving Izzy a slap on the back, somehow curing him of his nausea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is serious,\" Izzy cried, shaking off his nausea, \"I can't only wonder what's going to happen to us now since I have no idea exactly WHAT Mimi put in the formula- poison, toxic waste, who knows!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Mimi cried, \"I only used the stuff you had around here.

It normally took a lot more to bring his anger to this point. Even Izzy seemed nerved up. Maybe the potion was affecting their temper, you wonder.

Izzy glanced at the blond rockstar wannabe with anticipation: whatever happened was going to happen to him too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Matt cried amid the rumbling, \"I feel kinda funny. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he gonna blow?\" asked TK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Matt's stomach started to billow outwards and stick out. His firm abs grew more lax and less and less chiseled. It grew bigger and rounder and soon his shirt was beginning to ride up and show the thinnest sliver of pale exposed flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly kept on swelling and getting softer, as the pale 'sliver' of exposed belly grew wider and rounder and soon formed a roll of flab draping below the tight waistline of his black pants. His shirt kept on riding up, higher and higher as his belly expanded bigger and bigger. His black tee was tight as it soon held his chest which had developed into a set of boy breasts and even his arms were swelling up like warm bread in an oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt's getting fat!\" TK cried in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother's cheekers were round and cherubic now, both sets of them. His face was decorated with a double chin. His butt was pressuring and threatening his designer pants to tear asunder. Now his shirt made stretching noises in protest and rode up well above his now deep navel. His belly was now an enormous mound of flab that jiggled on down almost to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt had just blimped up from a svelte 118 pounds to an incredibly fat 318.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Mimi gasped, \"How about I set you up on a diet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt fumed, \"How about I shut your face?!?\" mad as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Izzy began to rumble too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh,\" went TK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't good...\" Izzy sighed.</span></div></div>",

She was carrying all the potions she was supposed to, but was guzzling down a yellow potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boys,\" she smiled, taking a swallow, \"Having fun? I hope I got what you wanted, but I found this cool lemon-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already freakin' established that that's not lemonade!\" Matt said, pushing her, making the bottle shatter all over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again...\" TK sighed as Izzy flittered around nervously, not picking up very far off the ground due to his hefty weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt growled, \"You're so dumb. . . what should we do now, Izzy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy shook his head and replied in his high voice, \"Mimi drank one of the potions we needed. . . now things are only going to get WORSE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt cursed as he hit the table and. . .</span></div></div>",

His gut drapes out of his black shirt and seems absolutely enormous from your viewpoint, appearing to be the size of a hill. His paunch blocks your view of the lower half of his face. You only see his eyes narrow spitefully in your direction- but they're different! No longer are they icy blue like they were before... Now Matt's eyes are yellow and catlike with long, slitlike pupils. You recoil in shock, and he chortles, thinking he shot you a nasty glare. Maybe he doesn't know about what's happening to him- certainly he doesn't pick up his attitude change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My head sorta itches,\" Mimi winced, removing her larger than life cowboy hat so she could curiously scratch her caramel-colored locks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt it's an effect of the potion you drank,\" Izzy chirped, flittering around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if we're lucky, that means it will blow off any second now,\" Matt smirked, crossing his chubby arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look!\" TK exclaimed as something caught his eye. He pointed at Mimi, \"She's my size now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. Mimi stood eye to eye with Matt's nine year old brother.

You spotted her, and waved a paw, \"Uhh... hi there,\" you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi started to break into tears, but Izzy could only shrug, \"It can't be helped now. I'll just have to find someone to get the potions. I guess I can figure out how to mix them in this state as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Matt outbursted, beaming at Izzy, \"What's wrong with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP! A sound like a popcorn kernel busting exploded into the air, making TK yelp and leap into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" he asked, recovering from the shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked around to see what it could be. Figuring your stature, you looked up, ruling out the possibility that anything had happened in your three inch height zone. Immediately, your eyes dart to the largest thing- Matt's collosal gut jiggling in the air above you. It's a pale peach color... for the most part- you see something darker a few inches above his crater like navel. Was it some kind of scab? It wasn't there before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is again!\" TK stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we know that!\" Matt yells, \"It's not like anyone really cares. God, sometimes you're so dumb, TK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up you spot another scab on Matt's belly. Obviously he didn't know.. or care. What's going on here? Is some kind of rash developing on him? Are those... scales?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down, and as Matt began to change...</span></div></div>",

Once he hauled his huge, bulging butt down he ripped the paper off the first burger, and smashed it into his mouth with his fist and almost swallowed it whole. He grabbed another one with his hand, gobbled it down, and continued to go back and forth, alternating on handfuls of fries and guzzling down pop. Then his mouth exploded with an earthshaking belch that revealed his teeth were sharpening into long fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...

You go up to another one, It shows you as The Incredible Hulk. You decide to go with that one and step closer to it. Immediately you feel your body start to change, everywhere your muscles become more defined, veins are starting to pop out of your massive forearms. Your skin turns green, you become taller as well, much much taller. Your new friends stare in awe as your transformation becomes complete with a six pack and huge pecs. You look yourself over, \"....Cool!\" you say in a deeper voice than usual. \"Oh....I wish I was so lucky...\" Sora says sadly. You put a hand on his shoulder, \"Don't worry Sora...If you don't like your new form you can always change right?\" You say trying to encourage him. \"....Oh yeah I forgot!\" Sora laughs. \"Maybe I can go back to my normal size!\" Sasuke shouts up to you. You nod as you all continue your journey down the hallway. Sasuke sees a mirror that shows him as a giant and he points to it wanting to try it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy takes him up to it and immediately Sasuke starts to grow. He grows big enough that Izzy can't hold him anymore and collapses underneath him as Sasuke continues to grow. Sasuke grows so much he outgrows the house of mirrors itself! His head pokes out of the roof and he waves to Mokuba who is roughly the same size as he is now. He steps out of the house of mirrors and walks up to Mokuba, accidentally demolishing the funhouse with all of you inside it! All of you are now standing in the rubble of what used to be the house of mirrors. Sora looks dissapointed, \"Aw man! I was planning on going 3 more times!\" Sora says poking his massive gut. \"Aw well....Lets go on some of the rides guys!\" You say beckoning your friends to follow you. \"No thanks, Me and Mimi are gonna go try to find Matt and TK.\" Izzy says as he walks off with Mimi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to Sora, Mokuba, and the now giant Sasuke. \"So...anybody know anything we CAN do without breaking something?\" you ask to your large companions. They shrug. \"Me and Sasuke are gonna go tease the little people!\" Mokuba says as he and Sasuke go off roaring and stomping their feet at the tiny people. You and Sora laugh, \"Well...It's getting late. Hey, Ya wanna come back to the hotel with me?\" Sora says. </span></div></div>",

You see other video game characters along the way; Mario, Princess Zelda along with Link, Kirby, King Dedede, Wario, etc. Sora is easiest the most fattest person around, so he makes a hole in the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of walking, the two of you come to the hotel. The hotel is an old brick building that's 30 stories tall. The hotel's name is above the main entrance in fancy writing: \"The Tipsy Vixen Inn\". There's a door big enough for Sora to enter the hotel...while you go through the normal-sized door. The lobby of the hotel is filled with anime and video game characters, who hardly notices you enter the lobby. The clerk at the counter is a rather sexy vixen, who looks up as Sora and you approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is my room ready yet?\" asked Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is\" said the vixen. \"have a filling meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asks Sora, then looks at his massive gut. \"oh no, this is from my trip to the carnival.

Cuz, I kinda lost my wallet before I came here.\" You say as you both hop into the elevator. Sora just laughs and says \"Sure do! You wouldn't believe the rewards you rake in just for saving even one world! But of course thats not why I do what I do.\" Sora says becoming lost in thought as he pushes a button. \"....So....Wheres Kairi and Riku?\" you ask causing him to lose his train of thought. \"Oh Kairi is up in our room. And Riku says he's had enough traveling to last him for awhile.\" Sora chuckles. \"And Goofy and Donald?\" You ask. \"Back at the castle of course! So are King Mickey, Daisy, and Minnie. Yep, Everything is back to normal for now!\" He says putting his hands behind his head as the elevator begins to go up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where am I gonna sleep? On the floor?\" You joke. Sora just giggles a bit, causing his gut to jiggle. \"Naw, Theres two beds. Of course, Kairi will have to sleep with yours truly!\" Sora says with a grin and blushes after he says that. You just rib him and say \"Don't be trying anything funny, Okay Sora?\" You both laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to the room Sora pulls out a card and puts it in the locking mechanism and the door automatically opens. Inside there is an Xbox 360 complete with a large Plasma Screen tv. And the window offers a beautiful view of the carnival, AND the swimming pool outside! \"Wow! This place has everything!\" You say in awe. Its then you notice Kairi, She's sitting on the bed looking at you both. \"Uh....Hi! I'm Steven.\" You say waving. Kairi comes over and shakes your hand, then glares at Sora. \"Sora! What happened to you!? What have you been doing now?\" She says eyeing his large belly. Sora laughs sheepishly, \"Uh...Would you believe me if I told you that this was the effect of a magical Funhouse?\" Sora says scratching his head. \"Well, In a place like this I wouldn't doubt it!\" Kairi says rolling her eyes. \"So...Who's up for room service?\" Sora says patting his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh....Boys\" you hear her mutter under her breath as she walks over to the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later a man comes in with three trays of pizza, cheeseburgers, and sodas. Sora gobbles his food up, you assume he's trying to get all the fun he can out of being fat while the night is still young, You and Kairi are much less ravenous when it comes to eating your food. \"So what kind of games they got on this thing?\" You ask turning on the 360. Sora just gives you one of his trademark grins and says \"Only every video game known to man! Ain't this place great!\" he says grabbing a controller as the game comes on. \"Whoa.....It's even got Super Mario World! How did they get this thing to play all these games?\" You ask dumbfounded. Sora and Kairi laugh, \"This isn't just any ordinary game console......It was specially made by the mayor himself! He ordered that this hotel should have everything the guest's heart desires....And since everybody loves videogames.....Well you get the idea!\" He says as he selects a game: Gears of War. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate into the night you take down Locusts and sometimes if you're in the mood, each other! All the while you laugh and think, \"This is the most fun I've ever had!\" <br>\r\n\"Hey boys! Care to join me?\" Kairi says. You both look over to see her clad in her swimsuit and relaxing in the jacuzzi that neither of you noticed before. Sora jumping at the chance says \"SURE!\" as he runs toward the hot tub stripping his clothes off as he goes. He is left clad only in his underpants as he jumps into the jacuzzi. He comes back to the surface laughing and splashing Kairi playfully. \"C'mon in Steven!\" He says beckoning you to get in. \"No thanks, I don't have any swim trunks.\" You say not as bold as Sora and somewhat unwilling to strip down you your boxers in front of your new friends. Sora just grins toothily, \"....Neither did I, But look at me!\" Sora says as Kairi giggles her girlish laugh. \"Um...Okay!\" You say stripping down to your boxers and sliding slowly into the hot water. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The jacuzzi hot tub is big enough for all three of you...barely. Sora's girth takes up most of the room, but you and Kairi have room. You three splash each other, laughing playfully. You and Sora arrived at the hotel an hour before sundown, so its right around midnight now. The view of the carnival and the rest of the town is breathtaking; you're on the 26th floor. While in the elvator, you noticed that the hotel has a 13th floor. None of the other hotels you've been to has a 13th floor....at least, not a marked 13th floor. There probably is a 13th floor in every hotel, but that's likely to have the laundry on it. At around 1 o'clock in the morning, Sora gets out of the jacuzzi and decides to have one more round of Gears of War before going to sleep. You and Kairi soon join him. <br>\r\n\"Say, I meant to ask earlier\" you say. \"but what's on the 13th floor?\"<br>\r\n\"They call it the \"Supernatural Floor\" here\" said Sora. \"It's said to be off-limits to anyone but supernatural beings\"<br>\r\n\"There's no way to get there\" said Kairi. \"the stairs just skip the floor; as far as I know, the only way to that floor is in the elevator\" <br>\r\n\"Why do you ask?\" asked Sora. <br>\r\n\"Just wondered\" you say. \"we don't have a 13th floor in every hotel where I come from\"<br>\r\n\"How odd...\" said Kairi.<br>\r\n\"Well, time for bed\" said Sora. He then flops on the bed, which sags down to the floor with his weight. He competely covers the bed! <br>\r\n\"Wow...\" said Kairi. \"and where am I suppose to sleep?!\"<br>\r\n\"On my belly?\" suggests Sora. \"or...in it, if you're okay with that\"<br>\r\n\"I think I'm gonna sleep on your belly\" said Kairi, who climbs atop Sora's massive stomach. \"ohh...you make a good bed, Sora\"<br>\r\nYou decide to sleep on the other bed. That's when you realized what Sora just said.<br>\r\n\"IN your belly?\" you blurt out. \"won't you digest Kairi if you eat her?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope\" said Sora. <br>\r\n\"How does that work?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"One of the many perks being a video game character\" said Sora. Kairi has fallen asleep. <br>\r\n\"Goodnight\" you say to Sora.<br>\r\n\"G'night\" said Sora. <br>\r\nThe two of you then fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up the next morning, you find that Sora is no longer his fat self. Kairi is beside him, fast asleep on the bed. Sunlight floods the room via the window that overlooks the town and the carnival. You see that the Funhouse at the carnival is up again like nothing had happened to it. There's nobody at the carnival, although its hard to tell from this distance. <br>\r\n\"Morning!\" saids a bright and cheery voice. You turn around to see that Kairi and Sora is now awake. <br>\r\n\"The carnival is still there...\" you say. <br>\r\n\"It's a week-long carnival\" said Sora. \"today is the last day of the carnival, as a matter of fact\" <br>\r\n\"Has Kairi been there?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I only got here yesterday\" said Kairi. \"so no\"<br>\r\n\"I've been there all week\" said Sora. \"I keep going to that Hall of Mirrors...its fun!\" <br>\r\n\"Have you ever been through that mystery door?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"No\" said Sora. \"so, you're saying that you wanna go back to the carnival?\"<br>\r\n\"Only if you want to\" you say. <br>\r\nSora thinks for a minute before he answers...</span></div></div>",

Sora scratches his head, \"Well...Good thing I brought extra clothes!\" You and Kairi do the same, but of course you all take turns going into the bathroom to do so. After Kairi FINALLY gets out you and Sora ask what took her so long, She just smiles and says \"None of your business. Now c'mon! What do you guys say we hit the pool? Then maybe you two can take me to the carnival?\" She says skipping out the door and down the hallway. \"Sweet!\" you and Sora say together as you rush outside and into the elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back on ground level you all toss off your clothes (Save for undergarments) and dive into the pool. Sora, being a showoff, Climbs up onto the diving board and dives right in with a huge *SPLASH* getting you and Kairi even more wet. In the pool you meet Goku and a preteen Gohan from DBZ, Cloud and Tifa from Final Fantasy, And even Shake, Frylock, Meatwad, and Harvey Birdman! You swim over to Sora, \"Hey, I thought this was just anime and videogames?\" You whisper. \"Well for the most part it is, But visitors from the other places always come for the year round carnival. And sometimes they just want to come for the heck of it. We're kinda like neighbors you see. Theres Cartoons, Anime, Videogames, and sometimes even books and comics!\" Sora says. \"How come I didn't see a book sign when I came here?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora laughs, \"Well duh! Of course you didn't! The way to the book character's world is located somewhere in the Anime world. No one knows exactly where, It's kind of complicated to explain. But there are magic spells protecting it.\" Sora explains. \"Protecting it? From what?\" Sora gives you a dark look all of a sudden, \"From the several villains that lurk somewhere in each of these worlds. You see, there are good characters and bad characters in these worlds. Just like there are good people and bad people in your world.\" You nod. Sora continues, \"A long time ago, the villains came together and made....a plan. One that could destroy the very fabric of reality itself. No one knows the exact details of this plan, except for one guy. And he died trying to protect us all from it.\" Sora says looking sad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And their first target....Was the world of literature! In other words, they hit the book world first. So after the guy I told you about had sealed up all the villains in a magic sphere, The guys over at the literature world were so scared that they cast a magic spell on their entire world. And you have to have special access to be able to get to it, And after someone has been there, it moves to a totally different location every time. Kinda like Hogwart's charms that make normal people see it as a ruined old castle. So as to keep it safe. They advised us to do the same, Meaning us videogame, anime, and cartoon characters. But I don't think we had anything to worry about. We're all more heavily armed than them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora finally finished his story, leaving you with a feeling of impending doom. \"B-But can't the villains escape?\" you ask shaking. Sora shakes his head, \"Naw, They're locked up forever...\" Sora says as a grin spreads across his face, \"Now C'mon! Lets go hit the carnival eh?\" Sora says getting out of the pool.</span></div></div>",

It's somewhat less busy than it was yesterday...maybe because it was later in the day when you arrived yesterday. You see Sonic the Hedgehog speeding around, calling out for Tails. You also see Scooby Doo and Shaggy, each sporting huge bellies. <br>\r\n\"I forgot this carnival never ends\" said Sora. \"it used to be a week-long, but the mayor made it all-year round\"<br>\r\n\"That was nice of him\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Where's this magic Funhouse,anyway?\" butts in Kairi. \"I want to try out the Hall of Mirrors\". <br>\r\n\"So you can be 1,000 pounds?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Maybe\" said Kairi. \"If I weigh 1,000 pounds, nobody will be able to kidnap me\" here, she giggles. <br>\r\n\"Well, it's the Mystery Door for me\" said Sora.<br>\r\n\"Where does that go?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I already told you\" sighed Sora. \"it's random. It might lead you to your own world...or it might lead into another universe alltogether. You spend a day whereever you end up and you go back here\"<br>\r\n\"Awesome\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe funhouse is there, and it has a sign on it that says: \"New Mirrors in the Hall of Mirrors!\" <br>\r\n\"Cool!\" said Sora. \"they don't usually get new mirrors\" <br>\r\n\"Let's go check 'em out before we go through the Mystery Door\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan\" Sora says happily and you once again end up in the Hall of Mirrors. There are 20 new mirrors in the hallway. One new mirror shows you with a *huge* butt...while another new mirror shows you as a female version of yourself. Kairi quickly finds the mirror that makes you 1,000 pounds, and she has some fun bumping into people with her newly big gut. One of the new mirrors shows you when you're 20,000 pounds! Sora is tempted with that mirror, but he's tired of being big, so he moves onto another mirror. <br>\r\nYou don't want to be the Hulk again, so you look for another mirror. That's when you run into a weird-looking mirror with runes all over it. It looks like the Twilight Mirror from Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess! In the exact center of the mirror, you see the Triforce. Some unknown force is pulling you closer to the mirror. As you get closer to the mirror, you start to see yourself as the one and only Ganondorf! You reach out to touch the mirror, when someone grabs your shoulder and whirls you around. It's the 1,000-pound Kairi. <br>\r\n\"Don't touch that mirror!\" said Kairi. <br>\r\n\"I was only...\" you start to say.<br>\r\n\"What's this mirror doing here, anyway?\" asks Sora, who looks like a horse. \"I thought this mirror was shattered long ago\"<br>\r\n\"This mirror shouldn't be here\" said Kairi.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you ask. <br>\r\n\"That's where all the villians are locked up\" said Sora. \"if you look into the mirror, you'll turn into a villian!\" <br>\r\n\"Uncool\" you say. \"well...why is it here then?\"<br>\r\nThe Twilight Mirror is somewhat out of the way, so its not like everyone is gonna find it. <br>\r\n\"Come on\" said Sora. \"let's go through the Mystery Door. I'm feeling adventerous today\" <br>\r\nOn the way out of the hall of mirrors, Sora walks up to the mirror that makes you into the Hulk. \"Always wanted to try this one out\" said Sora in a deep voice.<br>\r\nYou quicky find the mirror that turns you into the Big Bad Wolf. Then, all of you make it to the Mystery Door. <br>\r\n\"Here goes\" said Sora, as he opens the door and all three of you walk in. <br>\r\n*******************<br>\r\nYou, Sora and Kairi all wind up on a deserted island. Luckily, it's a big island that has lots of food on it. You three explore the island, and quickly find a big tree house. It's a sunny day, and not a cloud in the sky. Endless blue ocean surrounds the island.<br>\r\n\"Not that bad for my first time through that door\" said Sora.</span></div></div>",

I wonder where it goes?\" Kairi says running after Sora, leaving the now wolfish you behind. You just shrug and run after the two transformed video game characters, \"Wait up!\" You say running into the dark cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Sora carried with him a small flash light that he uses to find his way farther and farther into the darkness. Suddenly you hear a scream (which you assume comes from Kairi) And all of a sudden the two overly large characters are rushing towards you, Before you can tell whats happening you feel yourself being picked up by Hulk/Sora you look behind you to see that there are hundreds of bats chasing after you! Their red eyes are all that you can see in the dark, you all jump out of the cave entrance and duck as all the bats fly out into the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on you, Sora, and Kairi are drinking some milk from a couple of coconuts. It isn't very good, but you are thirsty and you need something to quench it so you tolerate the gross taste. \"So Hulk...\" You begin until you hear Sora laugh in his new deeper voice and say \"You can still call me Sora!\" He laughs. \"Okay, So Sora.

Sora then stands up, towering over you....He looks mad. \"Now listen! Look at us! We're a wolf, Hulk, and really fat....No offense Kairi\" Kairi wasn't even paying attention anyway though. Sora turns back to you, \"Look at our situation guys! The possibilities are endless! Look at all the fun we could have!\" Sora enthused. \"You-You're right Sora! Lets go make something of this!\" But just as you say that, you spot a monkey in a tree. \"Hey.....MONKEY!\" You say running after it, it seems to panic as it sees a wolf running towards it, screeches, and hops off into another palm tree. \"Hey wait up! I'm not gonna hurt you!\" You say looking up into the tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to get him down for ya?\" Sora says. You nod, Sora then grips the trunk of the palm tree....AND LIFTS IT OUT OF THE GROUND! He then lowers the tree onto the ground. And you grab the monkey before he can run away.

But when you grab the monkey, your wolfish stomach starts to growl. Then you have a hunger...for the monkey in your hands...err..paws. The monkey looks like a nice juicy steak to you, and you lick your lips. The monkey is panicing, but you have a firm grip on the hapless creature. You then open your mouth and toss the monkey into it. Sora gasps and takes a step backward as you swallow the monkey down whole. You can feel the monkey's struggles within your belly, and boy does that tickle! You then turn to face Sora and Kairi. Kairi is a nice big meal...and so is Sora. You start to walk towards Sora and Kairi. The monkey was delicious...but you're still hungry! You feel like you could eat more...a lot more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That mirror has that effect on you\" sighs Sora. \"I've been the wolf before...it gives you a wolfish appetite\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that\" said Kairi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't really hear the two talking. All you can hear is your growling stomach, demanding to be fed more food. You stalk Sora and Kairi, looking for your chance to strike. Sora looks to be worried for about a minute, but then a grin breaks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you wanted to have some fun?\" asks Sora. \"well, me and Kairi can have fun in your stomach\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg your pardon!\" said Kairi. \"I'm not becoming a meal for a wolf\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem solves itself as you sniff the air and realize that this entire island has got monkeys on it...and a lot of 'em at that. You quickly bound off into the thick jungle on the island to go and eat every monkey on the island, leaving Sora and Kairi behind. The next few hours are a blur to you; you eat countless monkeys until there's no more. After your big meal, you fall asleep to digest your feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you find yourself in the clearing of the island. Your belly sticks out a good ten feet! <br>\r\n\"Well, at least I'm not the only one who's fat\" said Kairi's voice. You look around to see Kairi and Sora looking at you and your bloated belly.<br>\r\n\"Sorry about before\" you say. \"I couldn't help myself\"<br>\r\n\"I can understand\" said Sora. \"when I was the wolf, I ate an entire high school!\"<br>\r\n\"And I'm still hungry\" you say. <br>\r\n\"Here\" said Kairi. Sora and Kairi have gathered a bunch of coconuts and other island fruit for you to eat. You greedily gobble down the fruits, but you're still hungry for more. That's when you notice that the monkeys are still alive within your stomach!<br>\r\n\"Another side effect from being the wolf\" said Sora. \"you don't digest your meals...you just stuff yourself silly\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm still not being a meal for the wolf\" said Kairi. <br>\r\n\"Why not?\" asks Sora. \"it'll be fun!\"<br>\r\n\"Why don't I eat you and see how much you like it\" said Kairi. \"looks like there's no more food on this island anyway...and I'm hungry too\"<br>\r\n\"Some choice\" you chuckle. \"being eaten by me, or we get eaten by Kairi\"<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't be the first time for me\" mutters Sora. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when something incredible happens. Something that solved all of the food problems; an ocean liner has sunk near the island and there are lifeboats coming to the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What are the odds of that?\" asks Kairi.</span></div></div>",

Somehow she managed to stuff a wolf and a gigantic Hulk like Sora inside her mouth. \"So Sora, What happened to those High Schoolers you ate?\" You ask Sora. Sora just grins, \"Don't worry about them, They weren't digested, I spat them all up after awhile. You'll have to do the same to the monkeys and Kairi will to us eventually.\" Sora says reclining against the stomach wall. You do the same, The place is surprisingly big for a normally skinny girl's stomach. \"So how long til' we get outta here?\" You ask. Sora just grins even bigger, \"A good long hour at least!\" Sora says before he falls asleep. You can feel your eyelids getting heavy as well, it feels like a car ride inside Kairi's stomach as she walks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you both wake up you can see stars in the sky, That must mean Kairi spat you both up. Your belly isn't bloated anymore, You can hear the screeches of the monkeys not too far away. Thats when you notice Sora and Kairi laying beside you. Kairi is sleeping on top of the enormous Hulk-Sora. You rub your eyes and roll over. Soon you are asleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up again you notice you're no longer a wolf, and Kairi and Sora are no longer in their fat and Hulk forms. Sora is half naked, his pants being ripped and all. It reminds you of those Hulk comics and movies where when Bruce Banner wakes up his pants are ripped. You also notice that you're back in your hotel room. The mystery door must have transported you all back to your room. You carefully get out of bed and turn the tv on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cartoon character you don't recognize is hosting the morning news. You turn the channel and your world's News comes on. \"Wow....Didn't expect this place to have our world's stations.\" You sit down in front of the TV and watch the news, Bush is rambling about something concerning Al Queda and Bugs Bunny. You don't really pay attention and decide to play the 360. The menu comes up and you choose Rock Band. Like magic a drum set, A microphone, and a guitar appear! \"This place has everything!\" You say as you begin to sing Tom Sawyer as quietly as you can.</span></div></div>",

It starts out as a gentle quake, but it builds up as a major quake, which wakes up Sora and Kairi. Everything in the room topples to the floor and its hard to keep your balance. You then notice something odd; the quakes feel a lot like footsteps! But who's big enough to make the whole hotel shake? Could a giant be walking around, causing the quakes? You make your way to the window, only to discover that the window is blocked by some flesh-colored wall. The glass is gone, pushed out of its sill by the wall of flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" asks Sora, coming to see the flesh wall out of the window. \"hey, who's blocking the light?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know anyone that tall\" said Kairi. \"could it be Godzilla?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong color\" said Sora. \"Godzilla has green skin.

Oh great Destiny, what lies in store for you now?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*YAAAAAWWWWWWWWWNNN*...ZZZzzzzzz...\"<br>\r\nYAY!!! MIMI'S ASLEEP! HALLELUJAH! YOURE SCREWED! Thanks a lot, Izzy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis big organic chamber the 4 of you are trapped in is starting to feel up with strange fumes that are starting to fog up your field of vision. All you can barely make out are the pulsating red walls and barely the other 3 victims while the gurgling sounds in the background get louder and louder..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried about the heat in the room you squeak, \"Hey Izzy! How long do we have until the acid kicks in?\"<br>\r\n\"Well judging by the rate of the temperature rising,\" Izzy says,\"Id say about 2 hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours to think of an escape. Hopefully at least ONE of you can come up with an idea by then!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MIMI!!!\" TK begins to shout, \"WAKE UP!! We're gonna die if you dont let us outta here!\" He clenches his fists and is about to pound the walls, but Izzy quickly flies in his way and stops him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Izzy screams, \"That might agitate the stomach and cause it to eject acid much sooner!\"<br>\r\n\"Well...\" you look over to the tight-opening in disgust. You dont wanna do it, but you got no other choice! \"We COULD go out the long way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about ME?!\" Matt shouts, \"Im like 400 lbs! I cant squeeze through there!\"<br>\r\nYou just mutter under your breath, \"...like I care..\" Thankfully, he didnt hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wish to essssssscape your fate?\"<br>\r\nJust then, you hear a voice comming from somewhere. It didnt sound like Izzy, TK, or Matt! The other 3 seem to be arguing, so they probably didnt hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They cant hear me, Ssssssteve. It isssss their fate to die here. But not yoursssssss.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... who's there?!\" you ask this hissing voice. It kinda reminds you of a snake... which might be a BIG threat to you in your current form!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your lassssst salvation,\" it answers, \"The misssstress does not want you to die. Do you wish to return to the House of Cassandra?\"<br>\r\nChances are it would be better than dieing here. But you cant help but feel sorry for your new friends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to return,\" you answer, \"but what the other three?\"<br>\r\nSadly, you do not like the answer to your question: \"They cannot be helped. They shall die here. They are of no concern to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor guys. You cant just leave them here! Dont they deserve to live just as much as you?<br>\r\n\"They are just figmentssssss of Cassandra's imagination. Do you wish to leave alive... or join them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTough question. You really value your own life, but maybe... just MAYBE you can still be able to help them out! However, this voice might be your ONLY shot of escaping digestion if youre unlucky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's more important: Their lives or your own?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The human half of the naga has red hair and large breasts...clearly it's a female!  The naga looks to be around 20 feet long or so.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"Greetingssss\" said the naga with a smile.  \"My name issssss Carmen and I'm in the employee of Casssssssandra\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"I thought she wanted me alive?\" you gasp out, as Carmen's coils wrap around your torso.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"Drat!\" said Carmen, and her coils loosen around you and she withdrawls 'em.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"Ssssssorry\" said Carmen.  \"my instinctsss are hard to control\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n          </span></div></div>",

The only way you know it's Deathscythe is because Duo Maxwell himself is overseeing the group of people that are working on it.

You manage to get Deathscythe in a standing postition and walk to the huge cargo bay doors that are opened.  You make it out of the cargo bay and out of the ship.    Quickly, you run Deathscythe out of sight of the starship and away from Aisha who would've eaten you.  You run Deathscythe for a couple of miles, when you come upon a wide canyon.  The other side of the canyon seems to lead to ToonTown from \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\".

You open your eyes to find one Aisha Clan-clan grinning at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you really think you could run from me?\u201d She taunts as she darts inside the open door to wrap you in a bear hug, nearly crushing your ribs. \u201cI had plenty of time to hitch a ride on Duo\u2019s toy before you got it moving. All I had to do was wait for you to pop the hatch.\u201d Her tongue licks your cheeks and she purrs at the taste. \u201cNow you\u2019re all mine!\u201d And with that she flips the switch that closes the hatch, sealing you in with her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Aisha pushes you into the wall of the cockpit.  That's when you hear a faint clicking sound from somewhere above you.  Aisha heard the clicking sound to, for she looked up to see what had made the noise.  You feel the wall behind you start to give way.  Must be the escape hatch.  Without another thought, you push with all your might on the wall and find yourself falling through the escape hatch.  The escape hatch leads to a back hatch on the back of Deathscythe, which opens as you near it and you end up in the river.   It's a slow river with little or no current. You start to swim for shore when Aisha jumps out of the escape hatch and comes after you.   Once you make it to the shore, you start to run for all your worth.  Outrunning Aisha is impossible, but you really don't want to be lunch.  Suddenly, your PDA makes a bleeping sound.  You really don't have the time to look at your PDA now.  <br>\r\n       The canyon was as wide as the river is, but there is a shore you can run on.  Aisha is gaining on you and you hope and pray for a miracle to happen.<br>\r\n     Just then, you hear a splash from behind you and you look back while running.  Aisha has fallen into the river.....no...she didn't fall in...something has a hold on her in the river!  You see a huge tentacle wrapped around Aihsa's middle and she's fighting whatever has grabbed her.  You then make a choice to keep running...Aisha can handle things by herself and she's trying to eat you.  You really don't wanna help someone who's going to eat you after you save them.  So you keep on running down the river.<br>\r\n           After 15 mintes of running, you see a small village in the distance...on the other side of the river.  The small village is populated with anime and cartoon characters.  You see one or two hippos from Fantasia fishing in the river, and you see InuYasha fishing as well.  There's a bridge on your side of the river that leads to the village.  Up ahead, the canyon and river go on as far as the eye can see.  Will you go to the village or go on down the river and see where it takes you? </span></div></div>",

It's clear to you that you're in another world now...a world popluated by anime and cartoon characters.   <br>\r\n         You come to the village, which is named Hidden Springs.  The  village has a population of about 4,000 give or take.  Most people of the village are anime characters, and cartoon characters from movies or on TV.  There's May from Pokemon going into a beauty shop ran by Captain Planet.  You walk on and you spot another human like you!    The human looks to be in his mid to late 30's.

You enter the shop too and see a total of 15 people in the shop.  One woman catches your eye.  She has long gray hair and is tanned.

The Oilano live in the Endless Ocean near Oilano Falls to the south and near Quahog in the north.  <br>\r\n       The Oilano can reach sizes of 700 to 1500 feet in length, or even bigger out in the Endless Ocean.  The Oilano is a omnivore, eating whatever it sees in the ocean..even people..or other smaller Oilano.  <br>\r\n      Oilanos can speak in English and can speak it fairly well.  Oilanos are friendly, but rather easy to anger.  The best advice if you run into a Oilano is; be polite as possible  or you might end up in its stomach.<br>\r\n        There's also rumors about Oilanoilo, but these  rumors are so fantasic that it can hardly be believed.  Oilanos are said to be the offspring of a much bigger whale, An Oilanoilo.  An Oilanoilo is a whale so big that it could swallow the world.    An Oilanoilo is also called \"The Space Whale\"...but it's just a rumor that such a being can possibly exist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Giant whales...?\" you say, hardly believing on what you just read.  \"why can't I run into some normal people?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"All you have to do is go see Cassandra and she'll return you to the real world\" said a voice from behind you.

Why are characters from different animes, manga, books, and cartoons all in the same place?\" You ask.  Pak'Tor laughs heartily, \"My dear boy, right now you are at what we call the crossroads. It's where all the universes are connected. Where everyone is free to come and go as they please. All they have to do is find the right path leading from their universe.\" Pak'Tor says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this information is giving you a headache, Everything your beliefs were based on....What was the fictional and the nonfictional...Has just received a very hard blow to the crotch area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more hours (Which you sleep right through)  Pak'Tor announces, \"We are here my little friend.

They could be bleeding internally right about now! And if you thought THAT was painful, the moment she finally let go of you and stepped back from you, you thought you'd be spared her wrath, but-<br>\r\n*POKE!* *POKE!*  She begins poking one of your aching ribs with her razor-sharp nailed finger rather demandingly!<br>\r\n\"Clothes taste awful,\" she stared at you with a look of impatience, \"take 'em off....

You nervously start unbuttoning your tattered shirt while Aisha starts tapping her fingers against the control panel. What a bummer... ever since you started watching Outlaw Star, you always wanted to get naked with Ms Clanclan... but not like THIS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wait a sec! That gives you an idea! ...Eh, why not? Youre probably gonna die anyway... but if this works... IF this works...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W... wait! Wait just a minute, Ms Clanclan!\" you plead. Aisha crossed her arms and sighed, \"...What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed one hard and began, \"You shouldnt eat me. That would be a waste of potential!\" Aisha raised an eyebrow at your response, \"What do you mean a 'waste of potential'?\"<br>\r\n\"I mean such a lovely lady like yourself shouldnt be prowling these all by her lonesome!\" you say with a grin.<br>\r\n\"...Huh?\"<br>\r\nYou step closer to her with a little grin on your face (although deep down, you hope to God she doesnt claw you to pieces for getting too close!), \"You are such a beautiful creature! Im suprised you havent got a little 'friend' to keep you company!\" or at least you hope she doesnt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough kinda suspicious of your actions, Aisha slowly steps back from you while blushing until she's stopped against a wall. You even step in as close as you can to her and stare her straight in the eye, even though she could easily overpower you! Yet for some reason, she doesnt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you continue your flirting, \"How's about sparing my life... and I can make yours worth while!\" you say as you gently stroke her long white hair, \"I can easily cater to your... OTHER cravings if you know what I mean! And not to worry, I dont bite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Whew! That's about as smooth as you can get! Her blue eyes widened with intrigue as her cheeks went red. You gotta admit, that was VERY bold, but anything to avoid your fate! Now all you can do now is hope... hope that your little flirting worked! Did it?

Not a rough one like you would expect from the tough as nails Aisha Clanclan, it was very gentle and enticing. She pulled away slowly, and you were to dazed to notice her open her mouth extremely wide. That was until you entire head was crammed into her mouth. You struggled wildly as her sandpaper like toungue lathered your face with saliva. Aisha grabbed hold of your arms and swallowed, bringing your head into her throat and your shoulders into her mouth. She purred at your taste causing the throat to vibrate around you. Another swallow brought your chest into mouth. She licked it all over before taking another swallow. Now you were halfway in, your head meanwhile popped into her stomach which smelled rank. Deciding to keep her word about leaving you with what little dignity you had, Aisha left your boxers on and moved passed them quickly, as to get back to your succulent flesh. With nothing but your legs left Aisha tilts her head back letting gravity lend a hand. You tried kicking your legs, but that only made it worse soon enough all that was left of you was your feet. Aisha playfully pushed them in and swallowed sending you deep into the depths of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were soon forcefully bundled up into the fetal position. It was cramped in Aisha's stomach, but there was still room to breath. You just sat there, stuned at the fact you were just eaten whole and alive. Meanwhile on the outside Aisha's stomach was HUGE, it stuck out four feet out and fell halfway down her thighs. She gave a sigh of relief and gave pat. Feeling full she sat down in the pilot seat causing her belly to wobble. Inside when you felt this you snapped back to reality. You struggled violently, punching and kicking. Outside Aisha sighed. \"Would you calm down in there it's not like I'll digest you or anything.\" After hearing this you stopped immediately. \"What the hell are you talking about?!\" \"You'll be fine I'll just keep you there for a couple of hours and then let you out.\" You were about to ask what the point of eating you in the first place, when she wispered just loud enough for you to hear. \"And then maybe I will take you up on that offer of yours.\" Her voice was seductive and like velvet. This made you stop right in your tracks, and make you think about what she just said. After a few minutes of thinking you came to a decision.</span></div></div>",

Aisha's heartbeat has a calming effect on you also, and you feel safe.   After a minute of just sitting in the stomach, you shift to a more comfortable postition. making sure not to upset Aisha.  When you're shifting around, you feel something come in contact with your bare back.  A piece of paper.  You shrug and manage to grab the piece of paper off your back and pull it closer to your face to read it.  You can tell that it's an advisement of some kind, but you can't tell what for.  It's pretty much pitch black within Aisha's stomach, but there is dim light coming from somewhere...much too dim to read by.   You have a feeling that you've seen this advisement before, but don't remember where.   You shrug again and soon drift off to peaceful sleep.  There isn't much to do when you're in a stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                              Hours later, you wake up to find yourself still in the stomach of Aisha.  The stomach is sloshing from side to side, which could only mean that Aisha is walking.  You start to demand to be let out, but decide against it.  If you yell at Aisha, she might digest you after all!  So, you just sit and wait in the stomach.  You hear nothing from the outside world, save someone on a PA system.  You listen closely and catch the phase  \"With Jumbo Gro, you can have the biggest plants this side of Sayima!\" ....an  advertisement?    You don't know where Aisha is, or what Sayima is.  You sigh and wait patiently to be let out of your fleshy prison.  <br>\r\n                         Outside, Aisha hums to herself happily as she strolls down the halls of a large mall.

You notice some anime and cartoon characters on the streets below.  You look up to see some mountains in the distance.  Hmmm...a blue mountain.  It takes you a minute to realize that there's something funny about the blue mountain, but before you can figure it out, the hotel door opens and in enters Aisha. <br>\r\n       <br>\r\n                  \"I see you're awake\" said Aisha in a husky voice.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n                \"Um...yeah\" you say.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n           As much as you do like Family Guy you want to go exploring some more. So you start to walk away from the Griffin house and all those that live on Spooner Street.    You decide just to walk around aimlessly and take in the sites.  The air has a salty tinge to it and the sun is out.  You spend a good ten minutes just wandering the streets when you spot a sign that's pointing down an alley.  The sign reads  \"The Ink and Paint Club\".  You look down the alley; it's a commonplace alley.   <br>\r\n           \"The Ink and Paint Club\" you say.   \"why does that name sound familiar?\"<br>\r\n            You shrug and headed down the alley.  It's a short alley to be sure and the walls of the alley are barren and free from any doors.  You reach the end of the alley puzzled. You look around and spot a subtle color scheme to a section of wall.  You walk over to it and look at it.   There's graffiti on the wall that simply says  \"Walt sent me\".<br>\r\n                \"Walt sent me?\" you ask.  \"What's that supposed to...\"  And then it finally hits you!  You recognized the name Ink and Paint Club.  It's from the movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit!  You frown.  Why would this be here in Quahog?  Shouldn't it be somewhere in Los Angeles?   <br>\r\n                    You decide to take a chance and knock at the discolored wall.  Maybe thirty seconds go by when a slot opens up in the middle of the wall revealing two eyes.  <br>\r\n                     \"Password?\" asks a gruff voice.<br>\r\n                      \"Walt sent me\" you say.<br>\r\n                       The eyes go wide for an instant before the slot closes and the wall opens up.  The door to the Ink and Paint Club is no bigger than any other door.  You enter the door and the door is closed behind you by a eight foot gorilla wearing a suit and tie.  <br>\r\n                      Once inside you see a flight of steps heading down  so you head down the dozen or so steps that leads to a long hallway.   You walk down the hallway until you come to another door.  You open the door and enter a large room filled with people. <br>\r\n                               The Ink and Paint Club looks almost exactly like the club in Roger Rabbit but this one looks to be slightly bigger.  There's a stage where a band is currently playing a jazz number.  You look around and spot cartoon and anime characters everywhere;  there's Scooby-Doo eating a large sandwich, there's Uncle Scoorge and his nephews eating sundaes...over there is Soul Evans and Maka Albarn from the anime Soul Eater.  You almost expect to see Jessica Rabbit--perhaps the most sexiest cartoon character ever--to be here.   You see a sign that reads  \"Please seat yourself\" <br>\r\n                                Your stomach growls reminding you that you haven't eaten for a long while.  You pick a vacant table near the stage.  About a minute later a waiter comes up to you and slaps down a menu.  The waiter is not a penguin like in the movie but a wolf.  <br>\r\n                                        \"Can I get you anything before ordering your meal?\" asks  the wolf.<br>\r\n                                        \"Root beer\" you say.  The waiter nods and walks off.  <br>\r\n                                      The jazz number ends...and nearly every male in the place rushes to tables nearest the stage.  <br>\r\n                                     The question that was forming in your head goes away as soon as you hear the sultry voice of none other than Jessica Rabbit starting up singing.  The song is unfamiliar to you but sounds like a song from the 40s.  You can't help but gape at the sexy Jessica.  She looks just like she did in the movie...perhaps a bit bustier than she was in the movie.  <br>\r\n                         <br>\r\n                                       </span></div></div>",

A red ring with the word, 'FOOD' had been stamped around their photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAisha now was bouncing a strange, plump looking apple up and down in her hands as she chuckled darkly.

When the bright light went away you see that you were now in beautiful glade filled with flowers of every color.  It's night out which makes sense since this is Ladies Night.  You look around until you spot the goddess Peorth behind you.  A sudden breeze that runs through the glade makes you feel a draft.  That's when you look down and see that you are stark naked.  You quickly look around but the only female you see is Peorth.<br>\r\n                           \"Where are the others?\" you ask.  <br>\r\n                            \"I managed to ditch them\" said Peorth.   \"It wasn't that difficult for a first-class goddess like me\"<br>\r\n                               \"And..where are my clothes?\" you  ask.<br>\r\n                              \"You won't be needing them for the evening\" said Peorth in a sultry voice that makes you melt.  Peorth is wearing her regular outfit--which is not a lot.   As you look at Peorth you notice that you're getting turned on; Peorth is an extremely attractive woman after all.  <br>\r\n                            \"So..I'm all yours for tonight\" you stammer.<br>\r\n                             \"Oui\" said Peorth.  \"and isn't this the most romantic place I could've picked?\"<br>\r\n                            You take a look around the glade.

The tongue-wrestling really turns you on and you find yourself fondling Peorth's sudden bare breasts.  Peorth leans forward until she knocks you over onto the soft grass.  You two keep kissing.  Peorth then reaches down and starts to stroke your erection.  Finally the kiss ends.<br>\r\n                                       \"Wow...\" is all that you can say.<br>\r\n                                     \"You want to make love to me, right?\" asked Peorh.  \"you wanna stick your cock deep into me and make love?\"<br>\r\n                                       \"More than anything\" you say. <br>\r\n                                       \"Worship me, then\" said Peorth in her sultry voice.  \"worship me like the goddess I am\"<br>\r\n                                         \"I...worship you\" you say.  \"I worship your very being.

All of a sudden, you felt hornier than you ever had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my my!\" Peorth exclaimed as she felt your dick grow as hard as it possible could when it slapped her ass. She crawled off of you and said, \"Well, Urd, that probably is your best pill ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrd's smile had a wild gleam as she said, \"Let's have a competition.

More than likely that meant sex on a daily basis..on a <i>hourly</i> basis even!  Or..it could mean that they tend to keep you as a slave and do their bidding until you die.  That doesn't sound too bad; being a slave to a....<br>\r\n                         Your thoughts are brought back to the here and now by a ear-piercing screech that comes from above somewhere.  The screech is so loud that Urd, Peorth and you are forced to cover your ears.  That's when you see a humanoid shape swooping down from the skies above.  You don't believe your eyes!  It's none other than Morrigan Aensland from the Darkstalker series of games and anime.   She looks just as lovely in real life then she does in the anime.  She swoops down with the help of her wings and snatches you up from the ground before Urd or Peorth could do anything.<br>\r\n                         \"HEY!\"  yelled Urd.  \"HE WAS OURS!\"<br>\r\n                          You're taken high in the air, heading in a western direction.   Morrigan is holding you tight and flying quite fast.   <br>\r\n                           \"Um...where are you taking me?\" you ask.  <br>\r\n                           \"To a place where we'll be alone\" said Morrigan.  <br>\r\n                            Morrigan keeps on flying for nearly a hour when you see your destination; it's a castle that's on top of a rather steep and  rocky mountain.  The castle looks to be 1,000 years old.  It doesn't look like anybody lives there but as you get closer you start to see there are tons of people there; most of them are women with men in various states of undress.  Some are naked like you while other men have loincloths...while still others wear a full set of clothing.  Morrigan lands in the large courtyard of the castle.<br>\r\n                             \"Welcome to Castle D'argoto\"  said Morrigan.  \"or....Castle of Sex if you prefer\"<br>\r\n                              \"Castle of Sex?\" you ask raising your eyebrows.  <br>\r\n                              \"This castle belongs to Lady Cassandra\"  said Morrigan.   \"well, actually...it used to belong to someone else a very long time ago...Lady Cassandra just moved in just a couple of years ago\"<br>\r\n                                Morrigan then drags you into the castle proper.   There, she leads you down several corridors and up several stairways.  You try to remember the route but you quickly give up.  The castle is filled with women of all sizes and shapes, each with a hapless male in tow.   <br>\r\n                                    \"Ladies Night is sure busy tonight\" said Morrigan.  \"it seems that every woman got a man tonight\"<br>\r\n                                      Morrigan and you finally enter a large bedroom at the end of a very long corridor.  Morrigan closes the door behind you.  <br>\r\n                                    The bed in the room is large enough for ten people to be on it.  You turn towards Morrigan and plant a kiss on her lips.  You're still effected by Urd's pill so you're super horny.  <br>\r\n                                     \"It seems that goddess did me a favor in giving you that pill\" said Morrigan breaking away from the kiss.  When she does you notice that she's suddenly naked.  <br>\r\n                           \"You're beautiful...\" you say faintly.  </span></div></div>",

Whenever Felicia's eyes landed on your dick, she licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That door cost more than you can imagine, pussycat...\" Morrigan said, clearly sounding annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a male, an unclaimed male.... Give him to us...\" Felicia said as she sauntered in with her hands on her hips. Behind her was that group of catgirls that sometimes appeared with her in the Darkstalker games when she used that 'cry for help' move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's mine. Besides, aren't you a nun?\" Morrigan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still have the habit for some nun play if he wants it...\" Felicia said with a grin as wild as the look in her eyes. Looking over at her group, you saw that each of them were just as sex-crazed as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you aren't going to listen to reason... Damn catgirls... You all get into heat at the worst possible times...\" Morrigan said as she lept off the bed, her clothes re-forming on her.

You can't do that!\" one of the catgirls said with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough. winner gets him...\" Morrigan said before rushing at the cat girl group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Morrigan and the cat girls were too busy fighting each other and you still easily entranced by any sexy female, Two portals opened up besides you. A feminine hand came out of one portal and shoved you into the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>elsewhere...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra took her hand out of a portal and then closed the portals. She and a guest were busy watching you in a crystal ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guest? Hild from Ah! my goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you have planned, Cassandra?\" Hild asked. \"And don't say that you were acting on a whim. Whim doesn't apply when you contact both Morrigan and Felicia and tell them where an unmarked male is located.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra chuckled before she said, \"Oh, I just wanted to see how big of a mob I can create, all chasing after a single man.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why aren't you snatching him for yourself?\" Hild asked, a smirk on her face like she knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can always step in and take him away whenever I choose. In fact, if he somehow lasts Ladies night without having sex, I think I might reward him personally...\" Cassandra replied. \"I have a question for you. Why aren't you helping your daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a goddess and too proud to accept my help.\" Hild answered. \"So where did you place loverboy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra smiled. \"That would be telling. So watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I will. Your schemes do tend to be very entertaining. Any predictions to how big your so-called mob might get?\" Hild asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows? At the moment, There's Peorth and the nine others that invaded the turtle's lair, your daughter, Morrigan, and then Felicia and the six catgirls that are always with her.\" Cassandra answered.</span></div></div>",

You take a look around at your surroundings and discover that you're in what looks like a dressing room.   Well at least you can get dressed now.  You open the closet and see nothing but clothing for a woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"Just my luck\" you say as you close the closet and look around.

Jessica Rabbit, one of the sexiest animated women of all time?!   You hear voices coming from outside the room.  In a panic you rush over to the walk-in closet and go inside. You close the door of the closet just when two people enter the room.  One of them is Jessica, looking even sexier in real life.

Her frown slowly changed into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here...\" Jessica Rabbit said, before she quickly walked over to the changing room door, shaking her delightful derriere at you as she did so. A slight cold chill went down your spine as you watched her grab a key nearby the door and used it to lock the door. She looked at you and then the key a few times. She then dropped the key in her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her hands on her hips, she sauntered over to you, her breasts bouncing up when they bounce down for a human woman, like in the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part of you still effected by Urd's pill was making you go in that hypnotized aroused state as Jessica Rabbit grew near you. The other part of you was pondering if there was going to be another interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well normally on any other night, I'd have you thrown out... but tonight is not any normal night...\" Jessica Rabbit said, a grin on her face as she tried to hide her enthusiasm that she was going to have some sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she neared you, she grabbed the costumes around you and pulled them away. She then placed her hand just above your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ladies night...\" Jessica Rabbit said, before she closed her eyes, puckered her lips, and started to move in to kiss you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So hands off my new man!\" Another female voice screeched before its owner grabbed Jessica Rabbit's hair and dragged her away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw that it was Holly Would of the movie 'Cool World'.

You deserve all that executive meddling, trying to please Basinger!\" Jessica Rabbit said before she punched Holly in the stomach. As Holly bent down and covered her stomach while Jessica Rabbit went looking for either a frying pan or something else that could be used as a weapon, you started to look around for an escape route. No way were you staying in the Ink and paint club when it could possibly be filled with sex-crazed women, all stronger than you could possibly be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna let him escape?\" Hild asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra made a mock-thinking pose for a few moments before she said, \"A chance to.

Looking over at the two, you noticed that Jessica Rabbit seemed to be winning, and only suffering some clothing damage that showed off the bra she had on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Huh.. didn't expect her to wear one... guess it might help with her Victoria's secret compartment...'</i> you thought. You then looked down at the ground... and spotted the key. <i>'Jackpot!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you managed to grab the key and then made your way to the door.</span></div></div>",

Nobody is in the dressing room but you do see clothes for a man.  You rush into the dressing room and get dressed.  <br>\r\n              The only clothes you could find are 40's-style clothes; a white and black striped suit complete with jacket and a wide-brimmed hat.

You open the door and end up in an alley.  The right leads to the street and the left seems to lead to another street.  You shrug and head to the right.  You make it out of the alley and onto a sidewalk.  You seem to be in a city...but which city?  Could this possibly be Los Angeles or are you still stuck in cartoon world?

I am the epitome of sexiness with the perfect sized breasts! You on the other hand are so oversized that you turn men and women off, even if they have breast fetishes!\" Urd yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Heh! All I hear is talk from a jealous Goddess whose about to give me her power!\"</b> Kirika announced before tossing Urd in her mouth. Kirika smiled before she swallowed.... or attempted to. Her eyes and cheeks puffed out before she spat Urd out, the Norn landing somewhere in Kirika's bosom. <b>\"Dammit... Now I land in a situation where my breasts are a hindrance...'</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirika tried to reach for the valley of her bosom, but the size really was too big for her to reach inside. Either she had to wait until Urd left the bosom or Kirika stood up. She didn't want to stand because that risked killing the only man she met that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?

I bet that Urd will be able to keep Steven from being eaten,\" Cassandra said before snapping her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" Hild asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra smiled as she answered, \"The pill that Urd fed Steven? In a little while, the effects will be... increased... Your Urd will find it even harder to keep her hands off of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHild looked confused. \"How is that a problem?

The taste of Kirika's skin seemed delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were interrupted when something wet slammed into you. You looked at the offending object with anger at interrupting your time to worship your new goddess... until you realized that the object had Kirika's scent on it. You started to hug it until you realized it was Urd, who looked less like a goddess and more like a drowned rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urd? What happened to you?\" You asked as your arousal started to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping away some of Kirika's saliva, Urd tried to smile at you as she said, \"Well, The problem with trying to eat someone against their will is usually...\"</span></div></div>",

It locks automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk... so she locked the door. That's typical. Wouldnt want anybody busting in... or busting out. The darkened skin goddess even went as far as to cram the card down her shirt, squeezing it right in between her breasts!

Normally, it'd be hella awesome for you... however, think about it! Youre locked in a hotel room with a hot goddess that can probably kill you with a flick of her wrist! It seems your goal is clear at this point: Keep her happy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...um..\" you begin sweating and blushing... then you look over at the alarm clock, \"Aw, geez. Look at the time!

But it's only 9pm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know,\" you shrug, \"..but I havent gotten any sleep for probably about two nights straight!\"<br>\r\nPerhaps after getting your well-deserved rest, you can think about how youre gonna deal with your oh so merciful goddess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUT then again, it IS Ladies' Night.

Nonetheless, you finally come to... and look up at Urd's humongous face fast asleep. That keycard seems to be beside you.. You have a damn good guess where you are!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the plus side, being that she's asleep, you can probably escape that tight and uncomfortably snug prison of yours without her knowing!<br>\r\nYou slowly and carefully slip out of your goddess's cleavage and fall on the fuzzy carpet.<br>\r\n*PUFF*<br>\r\nYou hit the ground with a loud PUFF, but at least it wasnt enough to wake Urd. The door doesnt seem to be too far away. At your size, you might be able to squeeze through the bottom. Better hope that Urd's shrinking spell is only temporary...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take gentle steps toward the door trying to keep as quiet as possible...<br>\r\nGood. And the tight squeeze under the door is no tighter than the space between Urd's tits! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoure not exactly sure where youre gonna go from here, but it probably wouldnt matter at this point... since youre probably a LOOOOONNNNGGG way from home. But you dont believe what Urd says... there's GOTTA be a way home somewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PREPARE TO DIE, VERMIN!!\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" by the time you wondered where the scream came from, a huge sharp knife was pointed between your eyes!<br>\r\nYou lean back away from the sharp point. Though youre sweating in fear, you dont scream. Making a loud noise could cause your attacker to flip out and stab you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of attacker, it's that receptionist from earlier! That ninja girl, Yukimaru!<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" she tilts her head and stares at you in intrigue, \"Youre not vermin, zam. Youre that guest Urd brought over... only smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say a word or move a muscle, she picks you right off the ground and asks you, \"What are you doing outside your room? Arent you Urd's partner, zam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... um... well....\" you finally sigh and just let it out, \"Look, as much as I enjoy this place, this place isnt my home. I really need to get back home. Back to-\"<br>\r\n\"But you cant leave, zam.\" Yukimaru interrupts you, \"those who enter the forbidden forest are not allowed to leave, zam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" Yukimaru looks up at the clock in the middle of the hallway, then grips you just a little bit tighter, \"It is still Ladies' Night for the next couple of hours, zam!\"<br>\r\nGreat... it's STILL Ladies Night??!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT, I-\"<br>\r\n\"Come with me,\" Yukimaru starts to walk off with you in her hand, \"You still have a job to do. Dont you, zam?\"<br>\r\nYes you do... you cant break free of Yukimaru at this point. All you can do is wait... wait for her to be a loyal employee and do the right thing by handing you over to her tenant and your partner...</span></div></div>",

You're about to get punished by a lightning flinging goddess.  You just hope that you die quickly because you don't want to suffer a long and painful death! Urd closes the door and returns to the king-sized bed, all the  while looking at you while you avoid her eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Look, I can understand why you tried to escape\" said Urd in a soothing voice.  \"this isn't your home...but it is now.

Probably a bad bad bad bad BAD thing for you, cuz being eaten alive might be quite a scary way to die...<br>\r\nBut then again, Urd said you were indestructable in your tiny state. You cant escape from her at this point, and even if you could, Yukimaru would bring you RIGHT back and Urd might give you an even bigger punishment! Out of other options, you just hope that she aint lying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" Urd smiled over your submitted state, \"Now be a good boy.. and I might let you out before Ladies' Night's done!\" Yippidee-dee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, her hand's grip on your body is gone.. however, now she's dangling you just above her head with two big fingers. As youre hanging, you look down and get a nice good look of the front door of Urd's digestive tract... her open mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little scary... yet a little intriguing. Her teeth, though strong and very sharp, are practically glittering clean white! Not a single cavity or plaque stain on them! Her breathe isnt even that bad either. Very minty fresh.. like youre about to dive into a bottle of Scope!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnndddd.... NOW!\" the fingers seperate from your foot, causing you to fall onto that big wet, yet not so slimy or sticky tongue with a splat! The tastebuds feel a little rough on your skin, but it's not that bad.<br>\r\n*GULP!* Unfortunately, you dont get long to bask, cuz Urd quickly swallows, squeezing you down the big dark pit in the back of the throat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's too dark so you cant see a thing, but you can feel strange sensations all over your body pulling you downwards. It must be the throat muscles, doing their job! Normally, this would be the part where you scream in terror of your horrible predicament. But you dont. You LAUGH!<br>\r\n\"Aheheheh... HAHAHAHAHA!!\" The muscles tickle. The bizarre feelings against your skin tickle all over as youre being sent to your next destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Beeeeeeee-LOOINK!* You hit the 'ground' with what sounded like 'beloink'! The rubbery white ground that feels kinda like taffy. It's not wet, sticky, nor does it even smell bad. It's pretty dry, the walls are smooth with no juice pumping out of them, and you can detect a fragrant scent of cinammon in the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is definitely not what you thought a stomach would be like! You probably shouldve excepted that, since Urd IS a goddess after all! And since chances are you might not be digested in this big white chamber, might as well make the most of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zzzzzzzzz....\" just then, you heard light snoozes coming from somewhere. It wasnt Urd, because it sounded like it was coming from in this room! Someone else is in here with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head to see someone about your size fast asleep just around the corner. It was a woman... with wings. Black and white wings, actually. Her hair was both black and white, too.<br>\r\nShe wasnt really wearing much to cover her slender light toned body, except the white bra to cover her breasts and white robes to cover the... ahem!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the parts of her that are exposed was practically covered in black markings over her white body. If you had to guess, this black&amp;white woman must be Urd's angel, World of Elegance....<br>\r\nLots of questions fill your brain at this point, but it doesnt look like any of the answers will make any sense! That forest you stumbled into must be a lot more bizarre than you think!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevermind that. What about the angel? Should you wake her up? She's the only person youve got to talk to inside Urd's stomach... but then again, youre not exactly sure how W.O.E. (Coincidence?) would react to the likes of you! You ARE a stranger... in a strange, strange place!</span></div></div>",

It would be pointless to try to escape again...Urd might kill you then, or place you somewhere MUCH worse than her stomach!<br>\r\n       \"Enjoying yourself I see\" saids a voice behind you.  You yelp, and whirl around to see a mini version of Urd looking at you and grinning.

The only way back home is talk with this 'Cassandra'... and even then, you might risk losing 10-40 years of your life in exchange for your freedom. It'll cost you a portion of you life to return to your life! Quite a paradox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the mini-Urd lets out a yawn, \"YAAAAWWWWNN... my, it is getting pretty late. We better get some shut eye! G'night!\"<br>\r\nYoure still a little lost in thought about how youre gonna deal with the succubus about requesting your freedom. You still have plenty of life to live... would it be worth losing several years of it? There HAS to be an alternative! But what is it? And how are you-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHEM!!\" Urd interrupted your little train of thought, \"I said good night, Steve!\" You sigh and little and reply, \"Good night, Urd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a snap of her fingers, she quickly disappears. Aside from the sleeping angel, youre all alone. Despite what time it is, you still cant sleep. You keep pacing around the big white chamber lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you take gently quiet takes trying to avoid waking your roomate, W.O.E.<br>\r\n\"What am I gonna do?\" you wonder to yourself, \"Give up my youth for my freedom? If she only saps out 10 years, Id only be 36... Id have plenty of time to live it up. But what if she ends up taking 40 years of my life? Id be old... too old to start a family...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a while of pacing, you stop in your tracks at just lie down on the rubbery surface. Coincidently, next to the sleeping angel. Her light snoring doesnt bother you, but you still have a hard time getting to sleep. With nothing better to do, you just stare up the opening in the ceiling that you fell out of... wondering what you'll be doing when you get out (or IF you get out!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you felt something cold pressed against your cheek. Worse even, there's a bit of weight pressing against your chest and white hair in front of your face blocking your view! You'd try to get up, but unfortunately there's a big white wing pinning your bottom torso down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thing that's pinning you down... is your lovely roomate, World of Elegance. However, she is STILL fast asleep! She mustve accidentally rolled on top of you in her sleep! Great. You can imagine how damn awkward it'll be when she wakes up. And of course, if the angel were to, say... freak out... you could probably be in d.s. with Urd, or the this obviously powerful angel might kick the shit out of you and you'll STILL be in d.s. with Urd!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo waking her up will NOT be a good idea. The only choice would be to remain perfectly still and hope she eventually rolls off you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOPE! You dont get that luxury! World of Elegance's fingers begin to gently pinch your cheek as if they feel something out of place. Her other hand begins to tap your chest as if the 'floor' she's lying on feels harder than normal.<br>\r\nFinally she lifts her head up off you and slowly awakens... the first thing she sees with those shining blue eyes of hers... is you looking back up at her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares back down at you in suprise as well as shock but nothing comes out of her mouth. You dont know whether it's good look of suprise or a bad look of suprise, so you just swallow hard and smile nervously, \"...Uh...h...hi!\" you greet her, hoping you dont scare her....</span></div></div>",

Maybe this angel's embrace could cure you from Cassandra.  <br>\r\n         The rubbery chamber starts to slosh back and forth gently, meaning that Urd must be walking.  The gentle rocking is hardly noticable,but it does wake up World of Elegance.<br>\r\n         \"Morning\" she says brightly in your head.  <br>\r\n         \"Er...good morning\" you say.  \"Urd is getting us breakfast\"<br>\r\n         \"Getting you breakfast\" corrected W.O.E  \"I don't need to eat like you mortals do\"<br>\r\n         \"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n        \"We get our energy...in a different way\" said World of Elegance slyly.  Does that mean angels get thier energy from..<br>\r\n         \"Hey! That's MY angel you're thinking about there\" said Mini Urd, suddenly in front of you.<br>\r\n          \"I would never, ever sleep with W.O.E. or you\" you say, sweating bullets.  <br>\r\n           \"So you don't find me attractive?\" asked Urd.<br>\r\n          \"Yes, I do\" you say.  \"but..\"<br>\r\n          \"Relax, kid\" said Urd.  \"I know you didn't pull anything last night.  It's just that World of Elegance is a little...forceful\"<br>\r\n           \"Like you are?\" you ask dryly.<br>\r\n            \"Yep!\" said Urd.  \"World of Elegance is my higher self...and I always did like sleeping with mortals\"<br>\r\n          You feel like you're going to have a nosebleed.<br>\r\n            \"Don't tell me you're like Keiichi\" said Urd.  <br>\r\n            \"I..\" you start to say.<br>\r\n           \"Now there's a head case if I ever saw one\" said Urd.  \"Keiichi says he loves my sister, Belldandy, but doesn't want to take the next step.  How boring!  I would...\" Urd stopped short when she noticed your rash on your arm.<br>\r\n           \"It's happening already?\" asked Urd, staring at the rash. \"usually, it doesn't strike so soon\"<br>\r\n         \"What?\" you ask. <br>\r\n         \"Looks small\" said Urd.  \"that means it hasn't progressed as fast\"<br>\r\n          \"Do you know where this rash came from?\" you ask.  <br>\r\n           \"You get that rash from being in this world\" said Urd.  \"well...I should congraduate you\"<br>\r\n          \"Why?\" you ask nervously.<br>\r\n         \"You're becoming an anime character\"  <br>\r\n          It takes a full five minutes for you to react.<br>\r\n          \"I'm becoming WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n          \"An anime character\" said Urd.  \"it happens sometimes to a mortal here.  If you spend another month in this world, you won't be human anymore\"<br>\r\n          \"How...can that be?\" you ask, stunned to hear this nevs.<br>\r\n            \"Humans don't belong in this world\" said Urd.  \"so, this world changes you into what belongs here.  Most people turn either to an anime character or a cartoon character.   It's too soon to tell with you\"<br>\r\n          \"So...everyone that's wandered into that forest becomes animated?\" you ask.<br>\r\n           \"Not everyone\" said Urd.  \"about 9 out of 10 remain human\" <br>\r\n          \"So why am I being effected?!\" you ask.<br>\r\n         \"Because you had sex with an anime character\" said Urd. \"that tends to change humans\"<br>\r\n           \"But..I never..\"  you stammer.  \"that was all in a dream, though!\"<br>\r\n           \"Explains why the rash is so small\" said Urd.  \"usually, you would be at least half human by now...but since you didn't have PHYSICAL sex, the change is effecting you more slowly than normal\"<br>\r\n          \"Is there a cure?\" you ask.<br>\r\n          \"By leaving this world\" said Urd.  \"if you become a full-fledged cartoon or anime character, you won't ever be able to return to your world\"<br>\r\n           \"And the only way to leave this world...is by talking to Cassandra\" you sigh.<br>\r\n            </span></div></div>",

Not only are you not fond of being trapped in the cursed forest forever, youre also not fond of turning into the one thing youre a huge fan of!<br>\r\n\"Aw, cheer up!\" she smiles at you, \"It's not so bad! You get used to it really quick. Hey, youre probably just hungry! I'll go get you some breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoure anything but hungry right now. Youre a little sad, angry, moody, excited, emotional, stressed out, calm, annoyed, even a little horny... but not hungry.<br>\r\n\"No thanks,\" you reply, \"I...Im not hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mini-Urd just shrugs her shoulders, \"Allright. Suit yourself. But if you start to get hungry, let me know! Im always here!\" She tells you with a carefree smile before turning her head to her Angelic higher self, \"Youre THIS close to getting your tubes tied! THIS close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the mini-Urd disappears leaving you and World of Elegance alone once more. Normally, you wouldnt mind some more alone time with the angel, but after the side-effect from what you think is her method of 'feeding'... it just isnt the same!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you mad?\" you can hear her voice call out to you in your head as she smiles nervously at you.<br>\r\nYou just smile back at her... not a happy smile, a sarcastic smile. \"Yeah, kinda! You did practically seal my fate!\" you show her the rash on your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorld of Elegance's eyes drop to the ground and she begins to frown... \"Im sorry. It's... it's difficult for me to control the urges created by my alter. Im still not used to harboring these type of feelings.\" but then she looks back up at you with a smile, \"Besides.. it is so hard to resist such a cute face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually blush a little after hearing that. Just hearing the angel say youre mood kinda softens your mood JUST a little.<br>\r\n\"Well, I uh... youre not so bad looking yourself,\" you tell her, not really giving a damn what Urd would think, \"And honestly, at any other time I would love to... you know... but, Im still a mortal human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" her voice continues, \"But in case you ever change your mind...\" a little mischievous grin appears on her face, \"...I'll be happy to make the dream come true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldnt that violate so many laws of nature?\"<br>\r\n...That voice you just heard did NOT come from W.O.E. Nor did it come from Urd! It sounded male... youthy, yet stern. You look around the chamber to see where the voice came from, but no one else is there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W.O.E? Did you just hear someone a minute?\" you ask her. Unfortunately, you get no response. \"W.O.E? Are you listening to me?\" You look back at the angel and STILL see that grin on her face. She's not even blinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W.O.E? Are you allright?\" She doesnt even move a muscle. \"W.O.E?!!\" you snap your fingers in her face, but still no response! She's frozen in place, but why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? So that we could talk!\" there's the voice again!<br>\r\n\"WHO ARE YOU?!\" you shout, \"SHOW YOURSELF!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who am I?\" the guy's voice asks, \"Im you. Well, that is, Im going to be you... when the change is complete!\"<br>\r\nThe change? He must be talking about the rash! You look down at your arm and see that the rash is glowing! Could HE be... in there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about leaving!\" you hear him tell you, \"Accept your fate. No one can escape the Mistress's cursed forest. So give it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arrogant tone sounds SO familiar, but you cant quite put your finger on it! \"Goddamnit, who are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dont recognize me? That's just plain pathetic! Im practically the reason you started watching the show! Now you get the allmighty pleasure of being me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...NOW you start to remember!

And even worse, it's been replace by some bizarre, furry, brown bear-like claw with long white razor sharp fingernails!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs THIS supposed to be worth defeating a wicked sorcerer through self-sacrifice?! \"Wha... what the hell happened to my arm?!\" you shout.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Urd just smiles as if it's not even out of the ordinary! \"Oh that? Not to worry, it's just a little side-effect called the 'Neppis Bane Effect'. It's what tends to happen whenever an anime character's soul is extracted from a human body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can safely say you never heard of this Neppis Bane Effect, but it does leave you with one big question, \"Uh.. is this permanent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Urd shakes her head! \"Nope! Usually it only lasts for about 24 hours. But sheesh... Im more suprised that after all these years, a mortal actually passed my test! I am impressed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W w w w WAIT!!\" you nearly jump up, \"Your test?!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" she answers, \"after you gotten the curse in your arm, I had to test to see whether you were worthy enough to be cured... so I had to use Mozenrath to determine how low you'd sink to be cured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMozenrath?! She used Mozenrath?! \"You.. you used Mozenrath?\" you asked. Just then you heard that certain family sinister voice... come out of Urd's mouth! \"Actually, Stephonavich... there is no Ruler of the Black Sand!  I happen to be the master of Ventriloquism! AHAHAHAHAHA!\" She actually puts her hand to her mouth and laughs in Mozenrath's voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow... so all of this was just a test to see if you were worthy enough to be cured. Guess you shoulda expected it! Typical of a god...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*YAAWWWWWNNN!* Just then, you overhear your sleeping roommate behind you wake up with a loud yawn. Wait until World of Elegance hears the good news!<br>\r\nShe can actually notice the positive mood youre in. \"Hm? What happened?\" you hear her voice ask you in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news,\" you tell her, \"it turns out it was all just a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-TEST?!!!\" W.O.E. jumped up in the air flapping her wings around! Apparently it took her by suprise! \"You mean to tell me I cried my eyes out because of some stupid test?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh dear. Apparently, she's mad too! But can you blame her? Come to think of it, that was pretty cold.<br>\r\n\"Relax, Elegance,\" Urd tries to calm her down, \"the important thing is that he's gonna be just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo youre not. Now that you think about, that wasnt pretty cold. That was damn stone-cold! \"Wait a sec. If Mozenrath was a lie... what about when you said mating with an angel would melt my balls off?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrd's eyes immediately widened when you said that. And judging by the glare on the angel's face, she was PISSED! \"You... you told him WHAT? THAT is a blatant lie!! Urd, how could you tell him that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I can explain. I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" you shudder to yourself, \"that IS messed up.\" You dont know what kind of game Urd is playing with you, but damn if youre gonna keep playing it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could even protest, you look down at notice your feet are no longer touching the ground. That's because the black &amp; white angel is carrying you off of it!<br>\r\n\"W...W.O.E!!\" you shout, worried about what she's up to, \"Where are you taking me?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesnt answer you. She just continues flapping her wings as she seems to heading toward that big opening in the chamber's ceiling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse for you, you hear Urd's voice coming from everywhere. It's as if her real body's the one shouting, not that mini-Urd!<br>\r\n\"HEY!!\" said the voice, \"YOU CANT JUST LEAVE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dont even want to, but it's not like it's your choice. W.O.E. seems to be determined to get out, and with you! You dont wanna leave, but it's not like you have much of a choice.<br>\r\nAfter all, you do know how upset World of Elegance is.

Unfortunately, she wont exactly tell you both of them... instead, she'll make you choose which choice you'd rather pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im afraid it doesnt work that way,\" she says, \"You can only choose which alternative you want to go through.

You'd assume youre near Agrabah, but you dont even know WHERE Agrabah is!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n666 miles... to the land of the black sand... on foot. No vehicles or anything to take you there! Just swell. It's probably been only a couple miles through the desert and already youre feeling the effects of fatigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...we need to stop... and rest..\" you sigh. Although Elegance doesnt say anything (nor THINK anything), you can tell she agrees with you as she rests beside you...<br>\r\nAt this rate, you probably have about 636 miles to go! Normally, you'd suggest that W.O.E. simply fly the two of you toward the land of the black sand... however, just by the overly tired look on her face, she doesnt look like she can manage it! Your angelic friend seems to be getting weaker. She seems even less active and headstrong anymore... if you had to guess, it's probably due to being away from her goddess for too long.<br>\r\nWell... there is actually the certain ALTERNATIVE to restoring some of her power, but not even you have enough strength to endure the process! Besides, that's what got you in this mess in the first place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigh... where is Urd when you need her?<br>\r\n\"You called?\" said that familiar voice breathing down your neck only a few inches behind you! You slowly turn your head and back away from the godly presence whom you escaped and inadvertinely stole an angel from!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... nice to see you again, Urd!\" you smile nervously. Unfortunately, the smile isnt returned.<br>\r\n\"Right. Now care to explain to me what youre doing here?\" she ordered, \"and without ME?!\" There is no time to start to fight, so you just get straight to the point. \"Look, we're headed for the land of the black sand to pick a few dozen Jizzarl flowers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jizzarl flowers?\" Urd raises an eyebrow, \"Youre actually going over 600 miles to a cursed desert of the undead to pick flowers?! Why?\"<br>\r\n\"It's a deal with Cassandra,\" you answer, \"so that she'd cure me of this!\" you point to that beast arm of yours, \"that way, I wont turn into Mozenrath...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M...MOZENRATH?!!\" Urd lets out a loud shout of suprise that could possibly be heard in the land of the black sand! \"But... but that was just a joke! It's not true! Youre not gonna turn into Mozenrath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, I hope not ALL holy divinities are that stupid.\" a colder, stern voice came out of your mouth as you said those words. Worse even, you didnt even THINK about saying them! You quickly put a hand to your mouth! \"Oh crap did I just say that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrd, on the other hand, seemed a little recourse of your little outburst, \"EXCUSE me?! What did you just say?!\" You want to apologize for whatever made you say that, but all that comes out is, \"Oh... so theyre deaf AND stupid! Heh, guess that means they'll be easy to take down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap! That arrogant smug tone sounds vaguely familiar...<br>\r\n\"Mozenrath?!\"  you shout in your normal tone... which quickly changes, \"Not exactly. But I can assure you, it is not Urd... although I did enjoy her ventriloquism! She might make for some fun entertainment later!\"<br>\r\nNOT EXACTLY Mozenrath?! If it's not him, but it's not you... who is it?<br>\r\n\"Steven?\" World of Elegance looks toward you in concern, \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elegance. Return to me,\" Urd commanded to her.<br>\r\n\"But Steven-\"<br>\r\n\"NOW, Elegance!\" Not given any other choice, she sighs and returns to Urd's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you,\" you can hear Urd sound much less carefree and much more demanding, \"as soon as we free you of this curse... you're going to work your ass off making me VERY happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo... someone's in trouble!\" your other voice mocks you.<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" you shout back at it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's get moving!\" Urd ordered, \"We need to get there by sundown!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You instantly cover your mouth with both hands.  Urd turns around and is giving you the evil eye.  Since Urd is half-demon, she CAN give you the evil eye...and you try to look anywhere but Urd's eyes, but you're glued to them.  Urd comes over to you and slaps you across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"OUCH! THAT HURT, YOU LITTLE WHORE!\"  There's go that stern voice again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"WHAT DID YOU...?!\" asked Urd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"It's wasn't me!\"  you yell in your normal voice.  \"it's Mozenrath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"NOT QUITE Mozenrath, you twit\" you say in the stern voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Not quite Mozenrath?\" asked Urd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Let's just go and get the Jizzarl Flowers\" you say in normal voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"NO!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"We're going!\"  yells Urd, grabbing you by the sruff of your neck and forces you to walk with her.  The endless desert is all around the three of you, and it's tottally desolate.  The stern voice is still protesting, using your voice to insult Urd and her parentage.  After you insult her mother, Urd throws you down...HARD!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"I had it with you, mortal\" said Urd.  \"you've gone too far this time!   THIS MEANS PUNISHMENT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"But it's not me!\"  you plead to Urd, getting on your hands and knees and pleading with this goddess.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"Urd!\" yelled W.O.E.  \"it's not his fault!  It's the curse\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"Yeah\" said the stern voice.   \"trust the little angel whore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"You can pick those flowers by yourself\" said Urd, walking away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"Good riddance\" said the stern voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"NO!\"  you yell in your normal voice.  \"don't leave me, Urd!  Please!\"  But Urd is out of earshot by now and it looks like she's not coming back!   You start to cry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            ----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Later, as you walk in the desert, you feel yourself loosing your strength.  You're going to die out here in the desert, with that stern voice as company!    As you crest a large sand dune, you see that there's a village off in the distance.  No...it's not a village.  It's the remains of a fairly large county fair.  Who would have a fair so far out in the desert?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"DON'T go there\" said the stern voice.  \"you'll regret it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Like I would trust you\" you say.  \"and WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"You'll find out\" said the stern voice slyly.   \"just don't go to that fair\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Why shouldn't I?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Because it's the home of a rat named Templeton\" said a voice from just behind you!  You whirl around to see Urd standing there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"You came back!\"  you say, glad to see the norse goddess.   Urd doesn't look pleased, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"The Big Boss Lady sent me back to make sure you don't die\" said Urd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"The Big Boss Lady?\" you ask.  \"who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Someone who is extremely short\" said Urd, looking skyward and raising her voice slightly.  You look skyward, but the only thing you can see is the sun.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"You don't need you\"  said the stern voice.  \"leave!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n               \"The Big Boss Lady told me about you, Mr. Stern Voice\" said Urd.  \"Mr. Not-Quite Mozenrath--whatever that means.  Now, we should steer clear of that fair down there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"Why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"It's the home of Templeton the rat\" said Urd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"So...?\" you ask.  \"Wait...Templeton?  You mean from Charlotte's Web?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Bingo!\" said the stern voice.  \"give that boy a cigar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"So what's that gotta do with keeping away?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"Templeton eats everything and everyone that gets near him\" said Urd.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"That little rat?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"He isn't so little anymore\" said Urd.  \"we should get out of here before he sees us\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             </span></div></div>",

The quickest way out would have to be through it, but then again, youre most likely to be caught by Templeton. Besides, Urd said steer clear of it, so that's what youre gonna do.<br>\r\n\"Wow, when are you ever gonna grow a pair?\" the voice whispered to you. \"SHUT UP!\" you whisper back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, as all of you continue walking down the path (with the exception of World of Elegance who was hovering around Urd's side), you still feel bad about what happened earlier.<br>\r\n\"Um... Urd?\" you try to speak up. All that comes out of her is \"Hmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, uh... Im really sorry about earlier,\" you apologize, \"I didnt mean any of those things that came out of my mouth. Especially about Hi-\" Before you could mention HER name, Urd immediately turned her head to you and glared at you with that near-demonic stare of hers! After edging the point-of-no-return, you decide the best option would be to shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry Steve,\" thankfully, you hear the angel's heavenly voice sooth your pain, \"She'll come around.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Elegance,\" you thank her in thought. But the stern voice whispers again, \"You REALLY wanna nail that thing, dont you?\"<br>\r\n\"For the last time... SHUT...UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BAAANNNNGGG* Before you and the voice could go at it, you heard a loud sound that sounded like a bang.<br>\r\n\"Whoa! What was that, Urd? ...Urd? .....URD?!\"She doesnt answer. You assume she's still pretty pissed off, but when you turn your head to see her, she's face-down on the ground, not moving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URD!!\" you lean down and check her. She's still breathing. The woman's still alive, but out cold! What the hell did that?<br>\r\n\"Heads up!\" the stern voice warned you. \"Huh?\" you look up... JUST in time to see a big furry first hit you STRAIGHT smack in the face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POOOOOOWWW!!* Everything goes black....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! Wake up you worthless sack of rat shit!!\" that pleasant sound of that bastard voice wakes you up from you slumber! \"Ughh....\" you slowly wake up aching... mostly your face is hurting from that fist to your face. If you had to guess, that was probably Templeton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn rat,\" the voice mutters, \"I'll skin that fat waste of-\" You ignore HIM and look around at where you are. All you see are reflections of yourself all over... it's a room full of mirrors. Could you perhaps be in the Hall of Mirrors? Well, it beats waking up inside the stomach of a giant rat...<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, you realized something. Urd's not here! Neither is W.O.E.!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urd?!\" you look around only to spot your own reflection all over the place, \"Where's Urd?!\"<br>\r\n\"Who cares?\" the voice replied in his uncaring tone, \"let's just get outta here before that rat finds us!\" Although youre worried about her (or more worried about the angel), there's not much you can do. But before you can even think of getting out of the park, you gotta get out of the House of Mirrors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want her. She will grand attraction to the KaibaZoo Im opening up.\"<br>\r\n\"No way! Not MY daughter! She's coming home. Back to Hell where she belongs! No more following that little midget's orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell? You can overhear a conversation going on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever she plans on paying you, I'll double it! I need that angelic creature as our signature display! We'll have the very first angel in captivity...\" said the familiar smooth-yet-demanding male voice.<br>\r\n\"PST! Take the angel! I dont care, just give ME Urd.\" said the familiar carefree feminine voice.<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Do what you want with the women....Just give ME the boy,\" said another familiar voice, but sounds a little more dark and sinister..., \"Or rather, just give me his cursed arm. I dont need the rest of his body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently two of the voices seemed to be talking about Urd... could the third be talking about you?<br>\r\n\"Heheheh! Relax, everybody!\" said that weasely voice you recognize as Templeton, \"We can all come to some sort of agreement. After all, sales arent final!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sales arent final'? What the hell does that mean?<br>\r\n\"It means that rat is planning on selling you and that divine whore like used cars,\" the voice answers! ....WHAT?! Templeton's gonna sell you?! Well, I guess you'd understand, since he IS a dirty rat... but who is he planning on selling you to? Those voices did sound familiar... Maybe you should sneak closer toward those voices to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORGET IT!\" the voice already knew what you were thinking, \"let's just get out of this place! Ive had enough fun for tonight...\" Perhaps he's got a point. Maybe it'd best to just run... but then again, what about Urd? And W.O.E?<br>\r\n\"...God youre soft.\"</span></div></div>",

You don't wanna be sold like a used car.  Anyway, isn't Templeton suppose to eat whoever enters the fair?  Or...is that fat rat not hungry?  Well, you're glad that you didn't wake up in Templeton's stomach.   You get off of the floor and begin to walk down the hallway of mirrors.  You manage to get quite far without walking into a mirror.   You still hear the voices coming from somewhere in the hall of mirrors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"What do you mean, 'all sales aren't final', you  little fat rat?\"<br>\r\n      \"I ain't so little now\" came Templeton's response.  <br>\r\n       \"Yeah, yeah.

I Just want Urd.  Take that angel whore away and eat her for all I care...I just want Urd\"<br>\r\n         \"Hmm...angel food\" said Templeton thoughtfully.  <br>\r\n          \"And I want that cursed arm that kid has\"<br>\r\n         \"I'm gonna sell the kid\" said Templeton.  \"arm and all.  I need money, after all\"<br>\r\n          \"How much for the kid, then?\" asked a new voice.  This voice sounds female and it has a slight echo to it.   <br>\r\n          \"Well, well...if it isn't the Big Boss Lady\"  said Templeton. <br>\r\n         The Big Boss Lady?  <br>\r\n          \"You can't sell the kid to her!\"<br>\r\n         \"Yeah!  She only wants him for herself\"<br>\r\n         \"Please\" said the Big Boss Lady.  \"I want him just to set him free of this place\"<br>\r\n         \"I'd be willing to sell him to you for $500\" said Templeton.<br>\r\n         \"I'd be willing to pay $700!\"<br>\r\n         \"$1000!\" <br>\r\n        \"$2500\" said the Big Boss Lady.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           You are steadily going away from the voices.  It sounds like there's 4 or more people, including Templeton.<br>\r\n          \"I wonder who's the Big Boss Lady\" wonders the Stern Voice aloud.<br>\r\n          \"Be quiet!\" you hiss.  <br>\r\n          <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"You only want him as a sex toy!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            That voice belonged to Templeton, and it was quite loud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          5 minutes later, you manage to find the exit to the hall of mirrors.  The hall of mirrors is in a building that looks like a clown and the entrance is the clown's mouth.  The building is heavily graffitied, and the clown has a red bull's-eye for an eye..wheater it was make-up or graffiti is hard to tell.  Regardless, you make a run for it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Behind you!\"  warns the stern voice.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n         You glance back and see that a woman with light brown hair is chasing you.  The first thing you notice about the woman was her eyes.  The woman's eyes were blue with red pupils.  As soon as you look into the eyes of the woman, the woman orders you to stop.   Your body then stops and you didn't want to stop...but your body didn't listen to you!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             The woman comes up to you and she smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"A-are you the Big Boss Lady?\" you blurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"You could say that\" said the woman.  \"actually, I'm the sister of the Big Boss Lady...in truth, all three of us are bosses...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              Your body is frozen and you can't move, no matter how hard you try!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"What do you want with us?\" asked the Stern Voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"To help you escape\" said the woman.  \"here\"  The woman places several flowers in your hand!  The flowers look a black rose.  There's at least a dozen of 'em.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n              \"Jizzarl flowers\" said the woman.  \"and no dropping them.  That goes for the two of you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"TOKIMI!  You little bitch, I knew you would pull something like this!\"  yells the unmistakable voice of Cassandra from behind you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"You're free to go\" whispered Tokimi.  \"run for it.I'll take care of Cassandra\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               Your body can move again and you say thanks before running to the exit of the fairground.  </span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, it wasnt a bean-bag... it was a big black furry belly... TEMPLETON'S big black furry belly! In how many languages can you say the word 'screwed'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, WELL!\" Templeton glared down at you with his hands to his hips, \"trying to ditch my ever-so generous hospitality, slave?!

The big fat rat greeted you once more with his furry fist across your face! \"AARRGGGHHH!!\" Before you knew it, a furry foot collided to your side just under your armpit knocking you back to the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you lifted your head back up, BOOM!

Whatever it is, you have a bad bad BAD feeling of what would happen if you used this eerie power in your cursed arm on the big rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, you know what's gonna happen if you dont!! Templeton might break you in two, then eat one half of you and sale the other to the highest bidder!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUse the arm or not use the arm? THAT is the question! </span></div></div>",

What could that rat be eating to make him so fat..and strong?  No matter.  You aren't gonna be defeated by a fat mouse...or rat...or whatever Templeton is!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"I'm surprised you got up from all that\" said Templeton, readying to punch you again, but you punch him instead with that cursed arm of yours.  Templeton not only went back, he FLEW back a good 40 feet!   You look at your cursed arm in amazement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Tempeton lands on the ground with a loud thump.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"What the hell--?!\" asked Templeton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Wanna dance, fatso?\" asked the stern voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"You betcha!\" said Templeton, coming at you again.  You punch him again, knocking him back 50 feet  this time.  You punch him right in his fat belly, and it sounds like you've knocked the wind right out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"What is this arm?!\" you nearly shout.   It's like Ashitaka with that cursed arm in Princess Monokoe! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Templeton is trying to get his breath back.  Now it's time for you to escape. You pick up all the Jizzarl flowers around you and run off into the dessert before Templeton  (or anyone else) can stop you.  You wanted to stay and kill Templeton..or at least a part of you did.  Is this cursed arm taking over you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          You ran blindly, not caring where you're gonna end up.  You put the Jizzarl flowers in your pockets, making sure you have them on your body  now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"What are you?\" you ask as you run towards a mountain in the distance. You clearly see the snow-capped top of the mountain.  \"you're not Mozenrath...are you a demon?  Am I changing into a demon?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Yes\" said the stern voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"You said something about Neppis\" you say.  \"is that your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"No\" said the stern voice.  \"I'm just a servant of Neppis.  Call me Mundus\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Mundus?!  Wasn't that the name of the main enemy in \"Devil May Cry\" ?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        As you get closer to the mountain, you notice that it's not a mountain after all; It's a person!  You know its a person because you can see tiny arms.   The person--whoever it was--was as big and fat as a mountain!  Who could possibly eat that much food??  HOW could anyone eat that much food?  It's impossible to gain that amount of weight...but then, you ARE in a cartoon world where anything is possible.   Hell, you just meant a goddess--several goddesses to be exact--so the sight of a mountain-sized person isn't all that shocking to you.  You just hope that the mountain-sized person is friendly.  Suddenly, the mountain-sized person tips over and is coming down towards you...or, at least, the face of the person is.  You're far enough away that you  won't get squished.  In a matter of moments, you're face-to-face with a woman with crab-like red hair! <br>\r\n              \"Greetings, Steven\" said the woman cheerily to you.  You just stare and wave.  The woman has three jewels embedded in her head.  Each jewel is about the size of you.  <br>\r\n            \"You know my name?\" you ask.<br>\r\n             \"I know everythng about you\" said the woman.  Suddenly, the mountain-sized woman shrank down to 6 feet tall!  Your jaw drops in awe. The woman just smiles at you.  <br>\r\n                \"Who the hell are you?!\" snaps the stern voice, and you slap your hands to your mouth.  <br>\r\n                 \"My, you have a sharp tongue\" said the woman.  <br>\r\n                \"It's not my fault...it's my arm...!\"  you say.<br>\r\n               \"I know\" said the woman.  \"Mundus must've sneaked into you when Mozenwrath went away. A sneaky little demon, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n                 Just then you reach back with that cursed arm of yours and make to punch the woman in the gut.  You aren't in control of that cursed arm, and you can't stop it from punching the woman.   However, the arm ran into some kind of force field that surrounded the woman in front of you. <br>\r\n                   \"What the-?!\" you and the stern voice ask at the same time.<br>\r\n                  \"That's quite rude, you know\" said the woman.  \"now, allow me to introduce myself...I'm Washu, one of goddesses that created the universe and all dimensions within it.  Well, the term 'universe' is something that you mortals came up with...it's actually called a multi-verse, where....\"<br>\r\n                   \"You....made the universe?\" you squeak out.<br>\r\n                  \"Yep\" said Washu.  \"I also made the human speices, and all the other races that live within the multi-verse\"<br>\r\n                 \"But..I thought....\" you stammer.  \"should I worship you...or...\"<br>\r\n                 \"Do that if that's what you want\" said Washu indiffently.  \"you're free to do whatever you want.  I'm a big fan of what you call 'free will', you know?\"<br>\r\n                  \"So....we got it all wrong?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                  \"Let's not bring up religion\" said Washu.  \"I'm not here to discuss religion.  There's more religions out  there than stars in the multi-verse.    I'm not saying that you did wrong with Christianity..that's one of my favorite religions by the way\"  <br>\r\n             \"Uhh...\" you say.   <br>\r\n            \"What do you want?\" asked the stern voice.<br>\r\n             \"I see that you're being chased by that gluttonus rat\" said Washu.  \"I'm here to send you back to Cassandra's house so you can get out of here\"<br>\r\n             \"Thank you\" you say.  \"All I wanna do is get the heck out of this place..and get rid of Mundus\"<br>\r\n             </span></div></div>",

Washu has your cursed arm in check for now... and you could not wait to get rid of it AND get the hell out of here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Im ready,\" you tell 'God', \"take me to Cassandra's place.\" However, judging by that odd stare in Washu's face, she seems a little reluctant to take you there...<br>\r\n\"WAIT just a second there!\" she raises her hand about a few inches away from your face! \"I did you quite a tremendous favor! Wouldnt it be fair that I get something in return?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounds fair enough. \"Uh...ok. What do you want?\" you ask her, wondering what someone like you can give to someone who already has everything in the multi-verse! Judging by the raised eyebrow and eerie smirk across her face, you have a abysmal feeling about what she has in mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im uh... going to need to um... test our your mortal endurance,\" she answers.<br>\r\n\"How?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"You know, I'll need to sample your ability to perform the task involving satisfaction,\" she tries sounding intelligent.\"<br>\r\n\"But what am I gonna be doing?\" you ask, still unable to understand her.<br>\r\n\"I would like for you to engage in a rigorous but sacred ritual of procreating one's climax with me.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh....what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear Mundus' voice groan... \"Uggh... SHE WANTS TO FUCK YOU!\" Oh. OOOHHH!!! Geez... why didnt she just say it in English? Well, you do seem rather curious about having sex with the almighty... but are you willing to bet 1000-to-1 odds that it's going to be painful?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... do you think youre up for it?\" she asks you, \"or is your puny mortal body far too inferior to satisfy one such as I?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh God, here they come...\" you heard Mundus voice grumble to himself as if he knew something was just about to happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah! He's far too weak to ever dream about satisfying the great Washu!\" said a very high pitched voice! A high pitched voice coming from that little mini-Washu puppet on her left shoulder! \"Yeah!\" the mini-Washu puppet on her right agreed, \"maybe he should just quit fantasizing about it now! Washu is FAR too much woman for him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat... even puppets are mocking you! \"Now now!\" Washu waved her finger in front of one of them, \"We shouldnt just assume that he's not able to perform! Who knows? He might surprise us!\"<br>\r\n\"I'LL say surprise! Take a look at THIS!\" said the other puppet... but it wasnt on her shoulder! You looked down and saw it hanging onto the center of your pants looking down it!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAH!!\" out of instinct, you quickly batted it off you! You immediately blushed as Washu giggled. Great... God is playful! But so far, everyone you met in this place is playful! Nonetheless, you let out a long hard sigh and look 'Crab-head' straight in the eye and say, \"I'll show YOU who's inferior! Bring it on!\" Best even, it wasnt even Mundus's voice that said that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAY!!!\" the puppets cheered at Washu flicked her red hair back and smile, \"Well, what are you waiting for? An invitation? HAVE AT YOU!\"<br>\r\nYou grinned back and prepared to began to unbutton your shirt.... BUT...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a blink of an eye, Washu's figure disappeared and appeared in it's place was that black and white angel looking back at you with a sad look in her bright blue eyes...<br>\r\nWorld of Elegance....<br>\r\nYour smile immediately dropped out of regret for what you were about to do!<br>\r\nBut the moment you blinked again, World of Elegance was gone and Washu was still there in her place smiling back at you! Oh crap... you almost forgot! Urd... and her angel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Washu then tilted her head and frowned at you, \"You seem very hesitant. Did you change your mind?\" You didnt want to answer her question. You just wanted to lie and say that nothing was wrong....BUT...<br>\r\n\"Apparently, this vessal cant get that little angelic creature out of his head!\" the stern voice answered for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is THAT all?!\" Washu's smile quickly reappeared, \"Not a problem! I am capable of changing my physical appearance to whatever you desire! It can be anything! Urd, W.O.E, Bulma, Aisha, Shampoo, Kagura, Tsunade, Officer Jenny, Renamon, Gardevoir... ANYTHING! You name it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow... that's quite an offer! Anything you want! \"Sounds good to me,\" Mundus's voice replied in your head, \"How about you, Steven?\"<br>\r\nBut then AGAIN.... it just wouldnt be the same. Even if you got World of Elegance, it wouldnt really be her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn this miserable heart of yours!</span></div></div>",

NO SPOILERS! READ IT YOURSELF!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"World of Elegance.\" It didnt take more than a few second to answer that question. Hopefully, you didnt offend her... lord knows what she's capable of! Thankfully, Washu merely snickered... not exactly sure if that's a GOOD thing, but surely whatever's gonna happen to you will be better than what would happen to you if she's mad, right? ...RIGHT?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! Made up your mind pretty quickly, have you?\" the crab-haired immortal laughed, \"instead of falling in love with a goddess, you fall for her little tool she carries with her like a dead fetus? What kind of a weirdo are you?\"<br>\r\nHer words dont exactly strike you as 'charming', but before you could shout in protest, once of her puppets shout!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! THAT'S NOT FUNNY!\" Dummy #1 snapped, \"So what if the guy has a crush on a supporter? Edward Elric thinks I'M hot!\"<br>\r\n\"Tsk! Please!\" Dummy #2 snapped at her, \"he also thinks Colonel Mustang is dead sexy in a mini-skirt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your current situation, you couldnt find this 'CUTE' little moment the least bit funny. Believe it or not, there was some sort of rage building up within you, though youre not sure if Mundus had anything to do with it. You ARE pretty sure that it has something to do with your arm.<br>\r\n\"Can we just hurry this up already?!\" you didnt shout, but your tone was very lenient and on the offensive, \"I rather not spend another minute longer than I have to in this hellhole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely a moment of silence past and regardless of who/what Washu is, you STILL dont regret standing up to her! Dont nobody diss the WOE! It is a shame that you'll never see again, however...<br>\r\n\"Pst!\" Washu psted, \"alright fine, ya big baby! Close your eyes!\" So you close your eyes...<br>\r\n*THUD!* \"OW!\" only to get pushed to the ground while you werent looking! However you have a very hard time getting back up because of some excess weight not only keeping you down, but PINNING you down! Not only that, but you can feel a bright, warm aura flowing around you followed by blissfull angelic music playing in the background.It sounded good and felt good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when you opened your eyes, it looked VERY good, too! There she was... the World of Elegance smiling down at you! Just looking into her lovely blue eyes made all your built-up rage go away.<br>\r\n\"WORLD OF-\" she put a finger to your mouth and shushed you. And with a sly wink, she gently grabbed the bag of your head and pulled it toward hers... or rather, to her LIPS. Her lips are so soft and warm pressed against yours and you can even feel her ticklish tongue play around with yours! Just seconds later, the floating robe around her torso quickly drops and her wings gently wrapped around your back and began squeezing your body as close to hers as possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd moan if your mouth wasnt full! The lukewarm rubber-like and slightly wet twaut was smooth and comforting to your exposed member as if it was MADE for you! The way it constantly vibrated and 'massaged' your C0&lt;I&lt; welcomed your inevitable orgasm and constantly demanded for it! Wow... so THIS is what it's like to make love to an angel conscious (or 'God' disguised as an angel!) All this fun made you feel hot... burning hot... scorching hot... a little less scorching hot... somewhat burning hot... kinda warm... just room temperature... now it's kinda cold... ice cold.... freezing cold... chill down to your SOUL cold!! Ok, what the hell's going on?! Not only is it cold, but the bright warm aura is gone, her lips and tongue felt completely dry (not even gonna DESCRIBE her no-no place!), and even the angelic music sounds bizarrely distorted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Washu! What the hell are you-....!!!!\" by the time you opened your eyes, you noticed World of Elegance was no longer there. Neither was Washu! Instead, you saw an extremely pale female face with white hair and glowing red eyes glaring into your soul as her mouth was still locking yours! You quickly pulled your mouth away, but you couldnt get up. In fact, you couldnt move period! You could stare in horror at the new woman mounting you. While her top-half was humanish with a feminine face, chest, and arms with extremely long fingernails on each hand, her bottom half was completely blackened with long 'tentacles' binding your arms and legs completely still! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...wh...are you-OMPHH!!\" another tentacle slipped into your mouth! Whoever this demonic bitch is doesnt like idle chit-chat during her tentacle-rapin'! The world around you was completely developed in absolute darkness... something tells you ya aint in Cassandra's place anymore! And this... THING doesnt look like any goddess YOU know of! You'd scream, but you cant even do that! You could barely cry at the intense pain your feeling of her intense, bone-crushing inside as well as her long fingernails scratching your chest with each key thrust! Her demonic howling sent chills down your spine while her long blackened wings flapped, trying to 'speed up the process'!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long LONG time of intense pain and muffled screaming, everything goes black. Thank God you FINALLY passed out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally started coming to. Aching everywhere, but youre still alive. When your eyes fully focus, you quickly observe the new room youre in. Someone's bedroom... definitely not yours. The bed itself was far too tiny for you. Your legs were leaning right over the edge.<br>\r\nRegardless, the first question you asked yourself wasnt 'Where am I?', 'Who was that creepy woman?', or even 'Where's Urd and Washu?'. The very first question you asked yourself was \"Is that damn curse FINALLY gone yet?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked in the mirror...</span></div></div>",

With a sigh of relief, you look around the bedroom you woke up in.  That's when you see that this is YOUR bedroom....kinda.  The details are all wrong;  you never had a bedside TV in your room, nor did you remember getting that painting of Washu that's hanging on one wall.  The bed was way too small for you, so you hop off the bed.   This must be Washu's room, you're thinking...or perhaps someone else's room.   You walk to the door of the room, and notice that it had a golden padlock on it.  The padlock has a large letter T on it and the letter T looks to be made of solid emerald.  You  try the door, only to find that the door is indeed locked.  What the hell is a padlock doing on THIS side of the door?!  Are you a prisoner?!   You look around and notice that there's another door in the room;  a door that's too small for you or even anyone your size.  The door seems to be the right size for a mouse, and the door looks like a mouse hole.   Suddenly, the door with the padlock opened and in stepped....Tokimi,  <br>\r\n                               \"What a curse that was!\" said Tokimi.  \"you owe my sister a favor\"<br>\r\n                                \"What bullshit!\" you yell.  \"I was raped by a...\"<br>\r\n                               \"That demonic bitch was the curse made flesh\" said Tokimi.  \"If Washu didn't do anything, you would be a demon by now....so you owe Washu\"<br>\r\n                                 \"What kind of a favor?\" you ask.  \"and where am I?!\" <br>\r\n                                   \"You're in.....Itajanvald\" said Tokimi.<br>\r\n                                    \"Where?\" <br>\r\n                                   \"Itajanvald\" said Tokimi.  \"it's a place between dimensions....a Nexus, if you wish\"<br>\r\n                                   \"What am...?\" you begin.<br>\r\n                                    \"Cassandra has opened many portals to other dimensions' said Tokimi.  \"and that causes trouble.  Your task shall be to close these portals with this\"<br>\r\n                                     Tokimi hands you a box-like device the size of a regular key.   \"When you're near a portal, this will close it\"<br>\r\n                                    \"Where's Washu....and why isn't she telling me this?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                                    \"She's very busy\" said Tokimi.  \"do this task and we'll reward you in any way you wish\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since day 1 of godknowshowlong, from the very moment your car crapped out and left you stranded in Cassandra's 'funhouse', you've been through quite a bit of hell and dis. You get played with by a goddess, cursed by an angel, your ass kicked by a giant rat, and raped by the very curse that leeched off you! NOW youre expected to apparently save the universe?! You would totally say 'Hell no' and pretty much end the adventure here if you didnt think there'd be a tremendous downside if you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity, you asked \"What if I refuse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTokimi thought for a bit, putting her finger to her chin and looking up in the air, \"Hmm.... how do I explain this in a way a mortal would understand? Goodness, this is tough... uhhh... AH! You ever seen the ending to Berserk?\"<br>\r\n\"...Yeah?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, ah.... imagine that very scenario in the last two episodes. Replace the Hawks with your entire family and friends, replace the God Hand with the 4 Great Fiends, replace Guts with World of Elegance, replace Casca with you, and replace Griffith ala Femto form with your curse made flesh and visualize that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes a little trying to visualize SOME sort of scene that she just told you about... but either way, you could pretty much assume well enough that it was gonna be bad. REAL bad. ...Wait. Did she say YOU'D be Casca in that little mental image?! Eh, maybe she made a mistake and W.O.E. would be Caska and you would be Guts.... right? ...RIGHT?!<br>\r\nNonetheless you just groan and put the key in your pocket, \"Can.... can I have a little while to think about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the way Tokimi was crossing her arms and glaring at you, she is NOT a very patient person! \"You better make it quick!\" she commanded, \"I'm expecting company with a few very important higher-ups in two hours and I really dont feel like babysitting a deflowered mortal with a mental break-down in the middle of it! When I come back, you better have a decision, THEN I'm kicking your ass out! Got it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheesh. Touchy. Still, you nod, \"Yes ma'am.\"<br>\r\nShe smiled sweetly, \"Good. I'll be back in a little while,\" she said as she reopened the door with a huge padlock, \"please think carefully about your decision. Remember, the fate of not only YOUR world, but many many others rest on this little decision. Please think hard and choose well!\" and with that, she slammed the door shut behind and relocked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, you were alone again. Just you, the bed, the mirror, and that little rat-hole with a door. If you were smaller, you'd probably sneak through that tiny door and escape this madness... but you have a feeling you wouldnt get far anyway. Either way, no matter what choice you make, youre a prisoner. A prisoner of your fate. You can either take the task and risk getting yourself again or refuse and expect it all to come back and bite you in the ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... what am I gonna do?\" you ask yourself. Thankfully, you dont hear a voice coming from your arm anymore. Your loneliness is a little relieving, but still! You closed your and kept talking to yourself, \"Well, so far I've been through so much shit. What's a little more? I mean it's not like I havent experienced any of my worst fears come to life yet! But... but why am I still scared? I... I just wanna go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aheheheheheh</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coulda sworn you just heard giggling a moment ago. Dont tell me your cursed arm's back! You open your eyes and looked at it. Your arm's just fine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's just probably just my imagina-\" the moment you lifted your head back up, you noticed something odd about your reflection in the mirror. You... you looked MUCH different!<br>\r\nYour hair was wilted and grey, your clothes were your body was extremely skinny, your skin was pale, your nose was bleeding, and your eye-sockets were missing eyeballs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAHHHH!!!\" you screamed off the top of your lungs at the very moment you saw THAT 'you'! But when you looked back at your own body, you were still the same as before! \"What the?!\" and that 'odd' reflection in the mirror was gone. Just regular you again.<br>\r\n\"T....t....that was.... weird.\" Was that just your imagination, or was that some sort of sick warning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, maybe it's about time you make your decision. Will you choose to accept the task or refuse?</span></div></div>",

You don't really know if that was your imagination or some kind of sick warning from Tokimi, but you've come to your decision about 3 minutes after you saw that reflection in the mirror; you'll accept this task and do it...no matter how long it takes.  That could prove tough...let's face it, how many dimensions could there be?   There couldn't be an infinite number of dimensions...could there?  Let's face it, you just met a goddess, is it really that hard to believe in an infinite number of dimensions after that?   You sigh deeply, and you say loudly  \"I accept the task!\"   At first, nothing happens.  Then, the room vanishes around you and everything blacks out.  You're surrounded by blackness for 2-3 minutes (although it feels much longer) until the background comes back and you find yourself in the middle of New New York of Futurama!   It's nighttime, and the streets are all but deserted; you see 4 or 5 cars drive by when you're walking down the sidewalk.  You have the box-like thing in your hand and you have no idea how to locate these portals.<br>\r\n                         \"You're helpless without me, I see\" said Tokimi, suddenly appearing right in front of you!  You almost walk right into her, but she manages to stop you.  She's wearing a sweet smile and you find yourself staring at her eyes.  They say that eyes are windows to the soul....if that's true, Tokimi has a piercing gaze.  Tokimi is not only looking at you, she's also giving you info how to locate the portals directly into your mind!  As you stare on, you see flashes of your life pass you by....and even into the future, where you're old and surrounded by your grand children...which is insane, because you don't have any children yet!  You also feel a sense of what only can be described as purity.  The stare lasts for a timeless amount of time, and then suddenly its over and you find yourself alone on the sidewalk.  <br>\r\n                       The box-like device in your hand is called something that's totally unpronoucable to you or any other human.  Tokimi just called it \"the keystone\" while she was sharing the info.  The keystone should vibrate should you near a portal...the harder its vibrates, the closer you are to a portal.  To close a portal, all you need to do is stick the keystone into the portal and it should close it.   Tokimi also mentioned via the stare that you are tasked to close up 10 dimensions.  When you close a portal, you'll be teleported to another dimension that needs to be sealed.   These portals can be anywhere in the dimension; in the sky, in a building, in outer space, or even in a belly of a creature that lives in the dimension...well, that's comforting!   If you lose the keystone, just call Tokimi and she'll give you another one. <br>\r\n                All righty then!  Time to do this task!   The keystone is vibrating only slightly.   You walk down the sidewalk and as you do, the keystone vibrates a little more.   Well, at least you're going in the right direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            </span></div></div>",

You hate sewers... ever since you were a little kid and accidentally fell into an open man-hole, your experience in sewers was never the same. And the experience inside this one is just as bad as you remember it.<br>\r\nIt was dark with very few lights, there was very little walking-space that wasnt knee-deep in brownish sewer water, moss was growing from the ceilings, and you could see a few rats scamper here and there. On the plus side, at least you got over your fear of rats thanks to your encounter with Templeton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, lord only knows what lurks within the sewers of the Futurama universe! Still, perhaps fate has brought you here of all places for a reason. For the fate of the universe and your life, you suck it up and bear it. Well, actually you hold your breathe and try to follow down the path... taking instant breaths every once in a while.<br>\r\n\"You better be worth it!\" you yelled at the box in your hands, \"cuz I'm having a mind to just drop you in that shit-pool and high-tail it!\" Of course, the Keystone doesnt response. It just continues lighting toward the direction it apparently wants you to go. To ease your troubled mind, you try thinking happy thoughts...<br>\r\n'World of Elegance... World of Elegance... World of Elegance... World of Ele-HOLY CRAP A TENTACLE!' You jumped back the moment the moment a big long purple tentacle popped out of the water! It slithered around up on the surface as if trying to feel something. You wanted to back away, but you were already back at the wall and the purple thing was just a few feet from you! You shivered a little, but you didnt scream. You kept quiet and waited for it to pass by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt slithered to the left, then to the right, then to the front, then to the back, then-<br>\r\n*SMACK!!!* It smacked you right across the face and dove back into the water! You could almost hear watery giggling coming from it. The hell?<br>\r\n\"Sonovabitch!\" you snapped as you tossed a rock into the brownish pool. Yeah... you LOVE sewers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEEELLLLPP!!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you hear a shout for help. Not far from you, you could make out somebody tied up and hanging from on the ceiling in the middle of the yuck-pool. A lovely young girl with long blonde hair, sky blue eyes, wearing a blue and white striped church-skirt with black shorts underneath.<br>\r\n\"Somebody? Anybody?! HELP!!\" the poor girl continued to scream. Because you were never the type to abandon a damsel in distress, you jumped into action!<br>\r\n\"Hang on, lady! I'm coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me, sir!\" the girl continued to call out to you, \"a couple of really mean guys jumped me a while ago while I was walking home from church and tied me up and left me here! I just wanna go home... I want my mom and dad...\"<br>\r\nAww... what kind of horrible brutes would do that to a poor little church-girl? You were completely compelled to save her. Luckily, there were quite a couple of large stepping stones that lead to her, so it's easy enough, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the 2nd stone you stepped on triggered a trap! The moment you stepped on it, a net sprung up from the floor and snagged you! To make matters worse, you dropped the Keystone in the process! It was right below you but far outside your reach. What could make such a bad situation even worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! PSYCHE!\" the 'helpless' girl shouted as she easily squeezed out of her ropes and dropped to the ground. Ugh... why didnt you see this coming?! You shoulda known the little 'innocent church-girl' was a bit more than meets the eye!<br>\r\nSpeaking of, you noticed her voice suddenly changed a bit lower-pitch... still kinda girly, but not GIRLY girly!<br>\r\n\"Haha! I did it! I caught him! I, Bridget, THE world class bounty hunter actually caught the renown keeper of the Keystone, Steven Johnson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget?! BRIDGET?! ...oh no...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-or rather HE snagged that box of yours on the ground, then pointed up at you with a big grin on his face! \"Alright, Steve! Youre coming with me! The Great Fiend Laharl promised a huge cash bounty on your butt and I'm gonna claim it!\"<br>\r\n\"Grrr!!!\" you struggled to break free but to no avail, \"Let me go, ya scrawny little she-male! I got a job to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" he snapped back at you, \"the only job youre gonna be doing is shoveling rocks!\" As if the little weirdo wasnt weird enough, he pulled out a little teddy bear and started talking to it, \"Can you believe it, Roger? I actually caught THE Steven Johnson, the guy who actually escaped the House of Cassandra the Succubus! Everyone said a guy like him would be next to impossible to catch, BUT I CAUGHT HIM!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, what a little freak,\" you mumbled to yourself... which didnt go unheard by Bridget!<br>\r\n\"I SAID SHUT UP!\" he cut a rope that caused the net you were in to drop on the ground!<br>\r\n\"OW!\" safe to say it wasnt a gentle landing. But by the very moment you werent entangled in the net, your hands were tied together behind your back by yo-yo strings. STRONG yo-yo strings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, Mr. Johnson,\" Bridget smiled sweetly as he spoke in his more feminine voice as he spun a yo-yo in your face, \"you stand guilty of galactic governmental conspiracy. That's a very very big crime. One that deserves a really really big punishment. However, the sooner you cooperate, the less horrible your punishment's gonna be.\" he finally stopped spinning that yo-yo and his sweet smile quickly changed to an angry glare, \"NOW MOVE IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheesh. You've only been outside your world for a few hours and already a bounty's on your head by those who are trying to stop you! To make matters worse for you, your at the hands of some little smart-mouth transvestite with yo-yos! If you still had Neppis's Arm, you could probably drop this little brat with ease, but now that youre no longer cursed... you dont really stand much of a chance, do you? And even if you could run, the little brat's got your keystone. Youre pretty much useless without it. How-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SMACK!* \"AAAHH!!\" you screamed in pain at Bridget belting your butt with a yo-yo!<br>\r\n\"I said MOVE IT!\"</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, Bridget doesn't seem to know her...his way around the sewers, as you're just wandering down random tunnels.  You don't pass any manholes that would lead back up to the surface either...which is very unusual.  You aren't traveling in  circles, that much you know....the tunnels look the same, but you're sure that you're not traveling in circles.  You ask your question when you pass a wooden sign that says  \"The Ruins of Old New York -- 1/2 mile\".  The sewers of the Futurama show were filled with mutants and the ruins of Old New York.  You see a mutant every now and then, but they have left the two of you alone.  Are the mutants on the same side as Bridget?  Come to think of it, you don't know where the cross-dresser is taking you.   <br>\r\n              \"Do I look like a sewer expert to you?\" asked Bridget.  \"the Ruins will have a ladder that'll lead up to the surface, mark my words.  Now, would you kindly shut up?\"<br>\r\n                 The two of you continue to walk down the tunnel until it comes out to a huge room which has the ruins of Old New York within it.  The ceiling is so high that you can't even see it.  The smell of the sewer backs off a bit in this chamber as you and Bridget make your way to a ladder that seems to lead to the surface. <br>\r\n                  \"Spare a dollar?\" asked a mutant, coming right up to Bridget and you.  The mutant is wearing a cape and a hood, so that the features of the mutant are hidden....yet, you think the voice of the mutant is familiar.  In a minute, you realize that its one of the mutant children that you saw in the show from time to time.  <br>\r\n                  \"Get away!\" snapped Bridget, waving a hand in a dismissive gesture,  <br>\r\n                 \"Cheap ass\" muttered the mutant child as he stalks off. <br>\r\n                  The two of you walk through several  ruined neighborhoods.  There's the Empire State Building, still standing tall.  Most of the buildings are in ruins, and are covered with moss and vines and what look like rejects from Little Shop of Horrors.  In  fact, the two of you pass a small flower shop.  You glance in the window and see a plant that looks uncannily like the plant from the Little Shop of Horrors (from the '86 movie)  As you pass by the window of the shop, the two of you are tripped by a long vine that's connected to the plant in the shop!  Before you two can do anything, the two of you are dragged into the shop and towards the man-eating plant.<br>\r\n                     \"Lookee at what I have here\" says the plant in a faux southern accent.  \"two meals for the price of one!\"<br>\r\n                      \"Let me go, you overgrown flytrap!\" yells Bridget.<br>\r\n                     \"I think I'll have the girl first\" said the plant.  \"I've always been parcel to the fairer sex\"<br>\r\n                      Bridget gets out a yo-yo and manages to tie the plant's mouth shut just when the plant is about to eat him.  The plant tries to break the yo-yo strings, but that yo-yo is strong enough to hold the mouth shut.  The plant throws the two of you clear across the room, where you black out when you hit a counter squarely in the middle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                            When you come to, you're just in time to see the plant devour Bridget.  You're in the clutches of the plant and the plant is moving you to its open mouth...looks like you're gonna be desert!  You struggle and manage to free yourself somehow.  The Keystone is lying on the floor, near the door of the shop.  You sprint out of the shop, and grabbing the Keystone as you do.  You hear the plant yell  \"I didn't order no fast food!\" as you leg it away from the shop.  <br>\r\n                          The plant has freed you of the yo-yo strings that tied your hands behind your back.  The Keystone leads you to a large theater.  According to the marque of the theater, it's showing  \"Friday the 13th 3000\"....but you doubt that.  The theater is run-down and there seems to be nobody in it. The Keystone leads you into the theater itself.  That's when you see one of those blobs that ate people in that one commercial.  The blob is talking to a very tall man in black robes.  As you enter the theater, the blob and the man in black quickly duck out of sight.  You shrug and head towards the screen itself.  As you get closer, you see the portal in the screen itself.  The portal is just big enough to allow one person through.  You can't see what lies beyond the portal.  You hold up the Keystone to the portal, which emits a thin laser.  The laser closes the portal in a matter of seconds.  One portal down.  <br>\r\n                  SNAP!<br>\r\n                 Just like that, you're teleported to yet another dimension.   At first, you don't know where you are since it's very dark....a bit too dark in point of fact.  It's as if you're in a cave with no light in it.  The only light comes from the Keystone,  which is pointing in a north-eastern direction.  Nothing to do but follow it, so you walk in the direction.  After you've walked a good half mile, you finally see a faint light straight ahead.  You eventually exit from a cave opening and see that you're somewhere in the mountains.  A dirt path leads away from the cave.  You follow the dirt path for a good two miles until the path enters a forest.   <br>\r\n                        \"Dead men tell no tales!\"  cries a voice from deep within the forest.  The voice sounded like Buster Bunny from Tiny Toons.  <br>\r\n                         \"Oh, will you just stop?\" comes a second voice;  its Buster and Babs Bunny (no relation).<br>\r\n                        You enter the forest.  <br>\r\n                   </span></div></div>",

Even after retracing your steps, there were certain paths, certains trees, certain ways the rocks in a pattern, etc. that you dont recognize from earlier. Oh well. It could be worse... you could be ambushed or something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Phew!* *THHHUUDD!!* You stopped in place the moment you saw a shiny blade fall from the sky and crash into the ground just a few feet in front of you! It was almost as if it was aimed at you!<br>\r\n\"Damn! Almost got him, dood!\" you heard a rather high-pitched shout come from up in the air, possibly from the direction of the blade shot! Your attacker dropped back down to the ground, landing on it's and looked up at you right in the eye.<br>\r\n...A short blue penguin with wings? You got attacked by a little blue talking penguin with wings and stitches across it's chest?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally you'd find it cute, but the really sharp swords he was pointing your way wasnt! It slowly stepped toward you glaring at you, ready to slice you into ribbons! Fearing how sharp those swords were, you slowly stepped back.<br>\r\n\"Like, HEADBUTT!\"<br>\r\n\"OOPH!\" another penguin jumped you from behind and headbutted you in the back, knocking you to the ground! The keystone flew out of your hands, but was caught in the air by ANOTHER penguin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it! I got it!\" the high-pitched penguin cheered, \"Great Fiend Laharl will totally give us a bonus for this!\" MORE bounty hunters?! First transvestites, now talking penguins?! Yikes, how many MORE weirdos are after you?!<br>\r\n\"Yeah, dood! He might end up giving us a 5-minute break!\"<br>\r\n\"Or even better! He might even start paying us minimum wage!\"<br>\r\n\"MINIMUM WAGE?! AWESOME SWEET!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you lifted your head off the ground, you found yourself surrounded by a whole group of sword-wielding penguins. At least 20 of 'em! None of them you recognize from Tiny Toons... in fact, you mightve recognized them from-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALRIGHT, DOOD! LISTEN UP!\" one of the penguins pointed his sword between your eyes and ordered, \"youre in Prinny territory, now! That means youre a prisoner to the Prinnies!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" another prinny agreed, \"we know about you, Steve Johnson! Youre like... that guy who trying to stop our bosses, so... we gotta stop you first!\"<br>\r\nWith no other choice, you raised your hands in the air, ready to surrender!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, dood. That was easy,\" one of the prinnies scratched his head, \"we didnt even get to the part where we threaten to cut out his balls and play ping-pong with 'em yet.\" They woulda went THAT far if you resisted?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart move, Stevie!\" another prinny pointed at you, \"youre gonna pay for your crimes!\"<br>\r\n\"What crimes did I commit?\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"The bad ones, dood!\" he answered.<br>\r\n\"WHAT bad ones?\"<br>\r\n\"REAL bad ones!\" The prinny smirked a bit as if thought he zinged you! This was getting you nowhere. It's not like you could reason with these dumb birds at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be taking that shiny box from you and giving it to our boss where it belongs!\" a prinny announced, \"As for you... uh... um... youre gonna... well.. uhhhhh...\" Another prinny whispered something in his ear. Whatever that other prinny told him, it caused an eerie smirked to appear across his face, \"I know of a fitting fate for you, dood!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" another prinny grinned the same exact grin, \"we've been reduced to cheap, low-budget slaves for too long. It's about time WE get a low-budget slave of our own!\" ...Slave?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, dood!\" another prinny nodded, \"Youre gonna start cooking US breakfast and dinner!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah! And clean OUR pigpens!\"<br>\r\n\"Shine OUR swords!\"<br>\r\n\"Scrub OUR feet!\"<br>\r\n\"Serve US booze!\"<br>\r\n\"Brush OUR teeth!\"<br>\r\n\"Fetch OUR foodstamps!\"<br>\r\n\"Pick the fleas off US!\"<br>\r\n\"Read US bedtime stories and kiss US goodnight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere these little creeps serious?! Youre gonna let yourself be reduced to being a slave to these little throw-away minions? Unfortunately, youre outnumbered and unarmed. You have no choice, especially since you value your testicles! Besides, you have a GOOD feeling someone or something'll rescue you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZTTTTEEEOOUUUUWWW!!!!!* \"YAAAHH-\" *BOOM!*<br>\r\nJust then, a huge laser blast fired out of nowhere and hit one of the prinnies, blowing it the hell up! Literally, the prinny exploded into little prinny bits the moment it got zapped!<br>\r\nThe rest of them jumped back and freaked out at the sight. \"WHOA, DOOD!\" one of them even screamed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over to the direction of where the laser blast came from.... you saw...</span></div></div>",

The green alien is wearing his trademark clothing from the show.  You look around wildly to see if any other characters from Dragon Ball are there....but you don't see anyone but Piccolo. The other prinnies are holding their ground, although they didn't look happy about it.<br>\r\n           \"I thought Templeton got you\" said the prinny who spoke. <br>\r\n            \"No fat rat is going to defeat me\" said Piccolo coolly, walking closer to you.  \"now, I suggest that you leave Mr. Johnson..or should I start killing more of you?\"<br>\r\n               \"We have our orders, dood\" said another prinny.  Piccolo grabbed the prinny in question and threw him in the air and out of sight.  As luck would have it, that prinny had the keystone...and he didn't drop it!  Oh GREAT!  Not only were you captured by these freaky little guys, but you lost the keystone!   All of the prinnies ran away then.<br>\r\n                 \"We'll tell  our boss about you!\" is the last thing you hear from the prinnies.<br>\r\n                  \"The Keystone!\" you yell.  \"I got to find it!\"<br>\r\n                 \"Relax\" said a voice right above you.  The Keystone drops from the air and you catch it.  You look up and see Vegeta hovering in the air!  <br>\r\n               \"How in the hell did you get him to help?\" you ask to Piccolo. <br>\r\n               \"He didn't\" said Vegeta.  \"I  just happened to be in the neighborhood\"  <br>\r\n                  \"Yeah, right...well, thanks a bunch\" you say to Piccolo. <br>\r\n                 \"No problem\" said Piccolo.  \"we were sent here to protect you from more bounty hunters\"  <br>\r\n                  \"Just who is after me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                 \"Someone named Laharl\" said Vegeta.  \"we don't know who---or what--he is.  He likes to go by the Great Fiend Laharl\"<br>\r\n                \"The only thing we know for sure is that he's a demon\" said Piccolo.  \"and he has sent several groups after you\"<br>\r\n                 \"Why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                 \"Beats us, kid\" said Vegeta, landing right beside you.  \"we weren't told everything\"<br>\r\n                \"Who sent you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                \"Dende\" said Piccolo. <br>\r\n                 \"Which way?\" asked Vegeta.<br>\r\n               \"Uh...\" you say, holding out the keystone.  It's pointing to the north-west...deeper into this creepy forest.   <br>\r\n                \"Good\" said Vegeta  \"you walk and we'll be right above you\"<br>\r\n                \"I'll walk with him\" said Piccolo.    <br>\r\n                 \"As you wish\" said Vegeta, taking to the air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n              The forest gets more dense the further you go.  Piccolo is a great body guard.  The two of you talk about how you winded up in this mess.  All the time, the keystone keeps leading you to the northwest.  Finally, you come to a clearing in the forest.  In the middle of the clearing is a small platform made out of stone.  Sticking out of the stone platform is a sizable sword.  A familiar emblem is on the sword, as well as the stone; its the Triforce!  As you enter the clearing, something enters it from the opposite side as well.   You squint to see who it is, and are delighted to see that its none other than Link!   Link walks towards the sword in the middle of the clearing and yanks it out of the stone.  </span></div></div>",

What the hell? Yukimaru is walking away from the door with YOU still in her grip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Ms. uh... Maru?\" you look up to your captor and speak, \"Uh... isnt Urd's room back over there?\" you point back at that door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct, zam,\" she answers without even bothering to look at you. Hell, she even starts to swing her arm with you in it a little, as if she's almost excited to be holding you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then where are you-\" you immediately shut up when you see that big exotic slide-in door in the corner of the hallway with big Japanese symbols all over it. Yukimaru reached in her pocket with her free hand and pulled out a keycard sliding it in the card reader!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap... this must be HER room! That means youre gonna be in MORE trouble with Urd if and when she finds out youre missing! Now you totally regret trying to escape!<br>\r\nBut you gotta relax and calm down... listen to the lovely Eastern music playing in the background, stare at the huge shining samurai blades hanging on the wall, and look at the piles of scrolls in the corner of the room probably in a language you dont understand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukimaru looks down at you, actually showing a little sadness in her eyes, \"F...forgive me for what I have done.\" She gently steps you down on the floor. \"Please enjoy yourself, zam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" you scratch the back of your head, \"...I hate to question someone much bigger than me... but why didnt you take me back to Urd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I....\" you can actually see the bashful expressions on Yukimaru's cheeks, \"...I was jealous. Everyone in this town has a partner for Ladies' Night, zam.\"<br>\r\nYou notice her pull out a few kunai knives from her pocket. She closed her eyes and with a flick of her wrist, tossed one at the door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EVERYONE!\" she tossed another at the door, landing just a few inches above the last one,  \"Zam!\" And ANOTHER a few inches above the LAST one! Finally, she sighed and continued \"No matter where I looked, someone had someone. I was but the only one with no man... as you can imagine, it is VERY lonely taking care of a hotel all by yourself... especially when all your tenants have partners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. The ninja girl has a point. It must be very lonely for her... However, you cant exactly feel sorry for her, because youre more worried about yourself! After all, youre someone ELSE'S partner. And not one that'll take very kindly to kidnappers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be tired,\" you hear Yukimaru say to you, \"Stay where you are, zam. I will make you some fresh green tea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks,\" you tell her, \"Im not thirsty. In fact, Id rather get back to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*TWOONNNKKKK!!* Unfortunately, youre cut short (not LITERALLY, thank god!) by one of the ninja girl's kunai that just hit the ground about an inch away from your body! Although it didnt impale you, it pierced right through the hood of your jacket, pinning you where you are! You cant move as the ninja looks down at you with a stare that kinda gives you the creeps!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I INSIST,\" Yukimaru stares down at you showing no emotion on her face, but a bit of eerie lust in her eyes, \"...ZAM.\"</span></div></div>",

Not good. What's better, you think, be torn apart by a goddess or stabbed to death by an insane ninja? Or just be her plaything? Maybe it wouldn't be so bad...hopefully she doesn't have any of those really nasty fetishes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay! I'll stay with you!\" you gasp, shrinking back onto the kunai. Her gaze was scaring you shitless! As soon as you said yes, she smiled gently, the eerie aura of lust gone. Her eyes were back to their normal color, and she seemed to be really happy. Yukimaru reached over to you and you shuddered. What game was she going to play? Turns out, she was simply removing the kunai from your hoodie. You sigh, safe, but then she surprises you and picks you up, carrying you by the hood like some sort of hairless kitten. Dropping you on her bed, she gazes lovingly at you and falls down on the space beside you. You fall on your ass because of her impact on the soft futon, wondering what she's going to do to you. Yukimaru then picks up a box of chocolates and opens it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I'm really into?\" she asks gently, taking a chocolate and sucking on it. You notice her outfit get tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\" you answer, watching as her combat kimono gets tighter and tighter. She seemed to be expanding before your eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuffing!\" She says with relish, and she takes a large bite out of the chocolate. Again, her body swells but it's even more noticeable this time. Her matabiki are getting tighter too as he legs appear to fill out with flesh. Yukimaru pats you on the head with her free hand. \"I love it when I stuff myself full of this special, endless chocolate I bought. But, I've never known how it feels when another does it and I've always wanted to try. The thing is, this chocolate in particular is instantly fattening, another one of my *ahem* fetishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a mental sigh. She isn't into femdom or something bad like that, thank God. \"S-so what d'you want me to do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I just explain it? Stuff me, stuff me to the brim with these delectable treats until I'm huge! Make me so full I feel like I'm about to explode.\" She really was going crazy over this, but you didn't feel scared. Not now at least that you knew she wasn't going to use you as a \"toy!\" Picking up one of the mystical, dark brown confections, you place it in her mouth, hearing her moan in delight as she bites down and swallows it, her body swelling again. You do it again, and this time she moans even more, her belt straining now because of her growing gut. Actually, now you're starting to feel really hot as she grows. You never were into larger women, but seeing Yukimaru like this is such a turn-on! Much better than Urd's dominatrix. You stuff chocolate after chocolate into her mouth, but the box never empties. Yukimaru continues to swell and moan, her belly flopping out about 5 inches from her waist. Her pale peach thighs are beginning to bulge through her matabiki, and her once-modest B-cups are filling out the top portion of her gi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More...more...more!\" she cries, her now-erotic voice driving you to do as she pleases. This little game you play goes on for quite a while...</span></div></div>",

She soon enters into the neighborhood of 200 pounds and she's noticeably fatter...but she still cries for even more, and you keep on feeding her.  As you feed her, you begin to wonder how big could she possibly get.  The idea makes you a little horny....feeding her like this is actually making you horny!  When she passes the 300 pound mark,  she still yells for more.  You keep right on feeding her for what seems like hours and hours, and all the while she's getting bigger.

Even now, her beautiful, double-chinned face was content, set in a grin so wide it could've defied any natural law. Yukimaru's breaths kept heaving you up and down, and you see her immense, perky breasts bounce and jiggle as she breathes out. An enormous, pale-peach belly flows from her torn top, still gurgling from its chocolate feast. Her plump hands caress it, the fattened yet slim digits grasping it delightfully. Fatty cankles were draped over the edge of the futon, their smooth forms almost enticing, along with the fattened kunoichi's plump little feet. Engorged thighs, hips, and derriere spilled out of ripped matabiki, the blue fabric left over clinging just to the plumpened calves. Pillowy arms ended at adipose-encased forearms, her gauntlets having ripped off long ago. You could see her bandage-bra underneath what was left of her top. And at least a foot of non-enhanced cleavage spilled out from it. Yukimaru now, far from the uninviting stick earlier, was a full-blown ice goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it isn't so bad being stuck in Hell, I guess...\" you whisper to yourself before climbing back onto Yukimaru's gargantuan tummy and promptly falling asleep. You swore as you fell back into serenity you hear Yukimaru giggle and sigh, completely content. The next two hours pass without much happening. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...Mr. outsider...wake up...I want a little something, zam...\" You could hear Yukimaru giggle as you groggily open your eyes, gummed tight with sleep. You immediately feel yourself surrounded by plush fat. Oh no, did she outgrow the hotel? She must've been thinking along those lines, as she simply giggled again. \"No, no, zam! I'm not that big...yet. Just look...<img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you did. She had you in the warmest, softest hug ever. In the history of hugs. Who knew fat women were this kind of wonderful! You kind of figure out what she wants as she pulls the mystical chocolate box out again. Laying back down, she releases you and points to the box. \"Stuff me. Again. I had soooo much fun last night. I want to do it again.\" She was smirking, not unkindly, but excitedly. She was anticipating something. But you refrain, suddenly remembering Urd and all of her goddess fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Yukimaru? What about Urd-?\" You begin to ask before being pulled back into an embrace by the fatty kunoichi. \"Shush...when the time comes, I'll deal with her in a special way...zam,\" she assures you before kissing you full on the lips. You realize then that she smells faintly of dusky pine and wintery breeze...an intoxicating combination! \"I'll make sure that Urd gets a nasty kick in her skinny ass from me! For making me suffer all this time with her sick games! Zam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukimaru truly loved you. And now, you seemed to be developing major feelings for her. But in the meantime, as  you wonder how she's going to deal with a frickin' goddess, she points to the box and you begin to stuff her yet again, feeling hot as you enter bliss yet again...</span></div></div>",

The box suddenly jerks away from your grip, and the box is heading towards Urd.

Yukimaru tries to grab the box, but her arms are too weighted down by fat to reach the box.<br>\r\n                  \"You like fat women, huh?\" asked Urd as the box of chocolates comes into her hands.  \"well...in that case...\"  with that, Urd eats a chocolate and gets fatter.  \"yummy!\"  You climb down Yukimaru's stomach and try to take the box from Urd, but Urd dances away from you and eats another chocolate.  <br>\r\n                    \"Okay\" said Yukimaru.  \"time for something drastic!\"<br>\r\n                     Before you could ask what she meant by that, you suddenly see a shadow coming over you.  You look up to see Yukimaru's stomach coming right at you; she's turning over and going to squash you and Urd with her girth!  You and Urd don't have time to get out of the way as you're squashed by the immense stomach.  You don't die, but you get the wind knocked right out of you.  You're now under Yukimaru's fat!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You slowly crawl towards the edge of the room underneath Yukimaru's wondrous fat, going to where it bunches it up. On the way, you find the magical box of chocolates that Urd had stolen. It miraculously had closed up, not allowing one of the highly fattening delicacies to escape and make their way to Urd. That crazy goddess was big enough! You'd much rather be staying with the now completely fattened Yukimaru. At least she's less obsessive. And her body made the most comfortable bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually make it out, Yukimaru's beaming, chubby face being the first sight you see. Raising the chocolate box in triumph, you fall between her massive breasts, now the size of large beachballs completely inflated. She giggles as you climb her fattened form, enjoying the sensation of gentle hands grasping at her fat. \"Well, that was unexpected, Yukimaru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to do something about her, zam. Every year on ladies' night she would just flaunt her catch in my face. It made me so miserable! I'd have to hear his screams and Urd's taunting throughout the night. I wanted to help the poor things, but by the morning they were exhausted and were already thrown out by her. And every night, as she had her sick 'fun,' I would stuff myself out of misery. I liked it, but felt very lonely. Then yesterday, when I saw you running from her, I thought it would be my chance to finally have someone. And it looks like that little wish came true~<img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. You were the first to escape Urd? That was quite an achievement, and you can see why. But now, with Yukimaru being as big as she was now, you were doubtful Urd could escape from underneath the kunoichi's massive belly, even with mystical powers. She simply giggled. Immediately you understood what she wanted. You open the box of chocolates delicately, afraid to damage one of the lovely confections. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now please, let's continue out little stuffing session, shall we?\" Yukimaru said, opening her mouth. You comply, and she swallows it, chewing it ever so slowly. <br>\r\n= = = = = = = = = = =<br>\r\nIt was bout five hours later, and Urd still hadn't moved. Maybe she had suffocated under Yukimaru's pillowy form. At least that's what you hope. Yukimaru appears to have grown about another three to four hundred pounds, adding more to the obese ninja's beautiful body. You could see her tummy grow around the edges of her room, covering her belongings in a three-foot thick layer of flab. She was well over a ton by now, you think, putting one more chocolate into your evergrowing girlfriend's mouth. Now you realize how pretty she is. Long, silky black hair...pale peach skin...deep blue eyes...and now a goddess's body to boot. Perhaps you could take her back with you; if only you had a crane or truck that could take her massive form. You slack for a minute or two, lost in her beauty, before Yukimaru gently pokes you with her chubby hand. You smile and continue feeding her, laying on her massive belly and in between her cavernous cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next chocolate, probably her last for the day as she seems to be falling asleep, is taken lovingly from your fingers by her careful lips, sliding it from your fingers so she doesn't bite them. Next, she chews slowly, feeling the chocolate melt in her mouth, the dark chocolate mousse inside making her taste buds dance with delight. Yukimaru swallows delicately, the melted sweet sliding down her throat and into her vast belly. She sighs in satisfaction and smiles at you in a dreamy sort of way and beckons you closer. You comply, getting right up to her face. With what's left of her arms' mobility, she wraps her engorged arms, the massive upper arms feeling softer and warmer than a heated downy pillow. You instantly fall asleep as she does, your cheek and her plump cheek touching as you both slip away into the delightful grasp that is sleep...</span></div></div>",

Your against her massive cheek and it feels just like a pillow.  Your feet are standing on each of the ninja's fattened breasts.  Yukimaru looks to be in the deepest of sleeps.  You try to wiggle free of her grasp, but the  weight of her arms holds you down.  You look around and spot the box of chocolates resting atop of Yukimaru's breasts.  Yukimaru takes up most of the room now, and if she still wants more chocolate, then she'll outgrow the room itself.  You wonder just how big she'll be able to get on these chocolates.  You don't really care, as long as you go on being her feeder. Yukimaru mutters in her sleep; you can't make out what she saids but you do catch the words  \"..Bow before me, puny mortals\"   She then stirs in her sleep, bringing you in front of her lovely face.  You don't start to panic until Yukimaru licks your face and makes \"hmmm\"ing sounds.  She then takes your head into her cavernous mouth.  Oh no!   You struggle to free yourself, and you manage to get free just when Yukimaru is about to bring more of your body into her mouth.  You slowly crawl out of her mouth.  Your covered in salvia right down to your belly button.  Yukimaru continues to sleep soundly.  After a few minutes, you're completely free of her grasp and you grab the box of chocolates and wait for her to wake up.<br>\r\n                     \"Finally!\"  <br>\r\n                     You snap your head around to see Urd, climbing out from under the flab of the ninja. <br>\r\n                    \"You're still alive?!\" you ask.<br>\r\n                     \"Of course\" said Urd.  \"it'll take more than that to get rid of me.

Go get your own!\"<br>\r\n                     \"I said give me that box!\" said Urd, making a grab for the box.  In the action of jerking the box out from the reach of Urd, you throw the box from your own hands and into Yukimaru's mouth, which was slightly open from earlier.  <br>\r\n                        Urd makes for the box, but you manage to cut her off...but Yukimaru had closed her mouth!  Next thing you hear is a gulping noise as Yukimaru swallows the box of chocolates.  You and Urd simply look at each other.   <br>\r\n                        \"You want  it that bad, go and get it\" you laugh.  <br>\r\n                        Yukimaru woke up just then and blinked her eyes a few times.   \"Did I just swallow something, zam?\"<br>\r\n                       You tell Yukimaru what had happened.<br>\r\n                         \"Well, go and get it\" said Yukimaru.<br>\r\n                         \"What?\" you ask.  <br>\r\n                        \"Go and get it\" said Yukimaru,   <br>\r\n                          \"Fine by me!\" yelled Urd, who rushed at Yukimaru's mouth and was instantly swallowed.<br>\r\n                          \"Get the box before she does, zam\" said Yukimaru.  <br>\r\n                     </span></div></div>",

But before you enter Yukimaru's self, a rattling sound comes from Urd's room. \"What is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukimaru thought about it for a second. \"Urd-san has some really weird tastes, zam. I heard one night that she had captured some sort of robot, for who knows what purposes. Every time I went past it rattled the bars of the cage, and half the time when Urd was in there it said it wanted to kill her for trapping it. Maybe by releasing it may help you, zam.\" You nod and head into Urd's room quickly, remembering that your life and Yukimaru's depended on getting that box before the megalomaniacal goddess did. Reaching Urd's hotel room, you immediately find a cage made of iron, and in it was the smallest robot you had ever seen. It looked like something from a video game, and was obviously very pissed. It was trying desperately to get the latch on the cage, but its wrist joint appeared to be too large. It spotted you as you came over, the red visor dimming slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hey, could you unlock this please? I've been that sick woman's fetish slave for the last ten months. I need to get out of here!\" it pleaded. You notice it had a girl's voice. You also notice a bundle of electronics beside the cage that might've been its weapons. You think for ten milliseconds before forming an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you help me stop her if I let you go?\" The answer came immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! That sick bitch has been screwing with my mind this entire time. The kunoichi that I hear every time must've not understood that I could talk. Then again, Urd(I believe that is the goddess's name), is a scary mystical being. I almost killed her before, but she pulled some crazy mojo on me that stripped me of my power until I got in this cage. If you get me out, I promise I will not back down, I will leave you and the ninja girl alone, and I will kill that femdom-fetish fueled crazy!\" You nod and trip the cage lock. Another thing you notice is that the robot is clearly designed after a specific video game you heard about: Armored Core Last Raven, specifically the one that appears in the trailer. Yet the thing is only 4'6\". She grabs her weapons(massive tri-rod plasma cannon, blade, rocket pack and multimissile), straps them on and waits. You look at her for a minute until she says, \"Well, lead the way! I wanna kill her and get it over with.\" You comply immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukimaru was waiting, her cheek propped up on a fist, tapping one of her large breasts. Seeing you and the robot approach, she opens her mouth. You explain to the robot(maybe you should address it as a 'her' now) that Urd is trying to get something to exact revenge on them. And that he threw that something into Yukimaru's gut to prevent Urd from getting it. She nods simply and jumps in. You follow, slightly disgusted by the saliva. Now, to get that box before Urd makes Yukimaru blow up or something...<br>\r\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = <br>\r\n\"Ha! I found it!\" Urd triumphantly shouts at the edge of a pool of stomach acid. She almost picks up the box before a rocket almost blasts her hand off, landing in the acid and not causing any harm. Growling, she turns to who fired it: you and the robot. She's radiating an aura of absolute hate, and the 'bot is doing that too, a slight snarling sound coming from it. The 'bot clearly hated Urd with a passion. \"You won't stop me from earning him back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? I'll kick yer ass up and down, lady! Just try me,\" she snarled back, raising the plasma cannon. It sparked and roared menacingly as blue energy built up, the insane goddess in her sights. Before she fires, she whispers, \"Hey. Grab the box and get it to the receptionist. I'll take care of her. Just grab it while I keep Urd busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and she fires it, the recoil knocking her back a bit. Urd is hit and spins around, her clothing burning from the intense heat. She seems to be dazed. Taking the opportunity, you rush to the chocolate box, steal it right from under Urd's nose, and rush to Yukimaru's esophagus, beginning the grueling climb. The 'bot looks back and watches you before dropping the cannon and rushing towards Urd, blade extended and preparing to slice her. Urd recovers and blocks it, sending her off balance and leaving her vulnerable.<br>\r\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =<br>\r\nYukimaru felt a tug at her throat. You were coming back up! Opening her mouth wide, you crawl out, sticky and stinky with her saliva. But she doesn't care and as soon as you get out, she hugs you. \"Oh, you're safe! I was getting worried that Urd had killed you, zam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were happy to see her smiling, plump face with her massive cheeks. They made her look very cute. You place the box of chocolates on her left breast and she smiles happily, glad that you prevented Urd from getting it. Who knows what might've happened! \"Yeah. The robot told me to go ahead and grab it while she finished Urd off. I hope she's going to be okay...oof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukimaru, with surprising agility and strength, pulled you into a hug that you would never forget. Your body immediately goes limp as she hugs you. \" i think she'll be all right, zam...\" Just as she said that, you hear a rumbling in her belly. And then it happened. She began growing, her belly's flesh spilling out more and more in a cascade of fat. Her breasts balloon up, trapping you in between their soft masses as they reach past even X-cups. Yukimaru grows worried as her arms begin almost doubling in size, panicking as your head sinks into her arms' blubbery forms. She feels her thighs growing even larger, the pillowy flab billowing out into two huge masses of fat. Her already large derriere grows huge as her hips bulge out as well, growing almost to the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. Cankles begin swelling enormously, her plump feet sinking into the mass of flesh. Her door creaks, and finally breaks as Yukimaru's body spills out into the hallway. Her even fatter face begins to cry, hoping that she wasn't suffocating you in her immense flabby hug. She now weighs about 3000lbs, judging by her own immense size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukimaru, please don't cry,\" you say, muffled by her pillowy arms. She gasps and lets go, allowing you to breathe freely. \"I'm all right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I thought I had killed you, zam! I thought you had suffocated underneath my body...\" She nuzzles her big fat cheek against yours, happy to see that you're alive. But something bothers her. \"Hey, what happened to the robot?\"</span></div></div>",

You don't much like getting covered in salvia, but you were also curious as to what was the outcome of the battle between robot and goddess.  Yukimaru's stomach is big on the outside, as well as in the inside.  Her stomach resembles a cavern.  The stomach acid was on one side of the stomach, in a huge lake of acid.   Strangely, you could see within the stomach, even though it ought to be pitch black.  The acid was bubbling softly in the background as you look for the robot girl...or crazed goddess.   After five minutes or so, you spot the robot standing on a raise that overlooked the lake of stomach acid.  You go to the robot and find out that she had pushed Urd into the acid.  <br>\r\n                  \"Think that finished her off?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                  \"Well, She hasn't come back out of the acid\" said the robot.  <br>\r\n                 You could see straight through the acid and to the entrance to the intestines.

It didnt take a rocket science to figure out your omni-plump galpal was in pain! She even groaned as she gripped her stomach in pain, \"Nggh....nnggghh....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukimaru? Are you alright?\" you asked her.<br>\r\n\"I....I'm fine....\" she lied as she gripped her aching sides, \"J...just a....stomach ache....zam!\" You were pretty damn sure it was more than a stomach ache. You could see veins start to pop in her big fat exposed belly button! Maybe MAYBE this kind of thing is common in this twisted land of... twistedness, but where youre from, that's a seriously bad thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for some reason, your robot friend didnt seem the least bit shocked. In fact, it looked like she was enjoying the site! \"Oh ho boy!\" she jumped a little in anticipation, \"Here it comes! Here it comes!\"<br>\r\n\"Here WHAT comes?!\" you shouted at the robot, \"What's happening?!\"<br>\r\n\"Watch!\" she pointed at Yukimaru.You could see a big bright aura flowing around the aching gelatinous kunoichi, possibly mixed with terror from the excruciating pain and confusion from the golden aura surrounding her body. Sparks flew out of her every once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were distracted, the short robot grabbed your collar and pulled you back! \"You might wanna stand back!\" she warned you. You tried to break free of her, but to no avail!<br>\r\n\"BUT...

Yukimaru didnt burst. The sounds of crackling sparks stopped, yet you could still feel some sort of angelic aura coming from her direction. As scared as you were, the aura feel soothing and warm, as if trying to draw you into it. Out of curiousity, you opened your eyes.<br>\r\nYukimaru... is not only alright and not exploded, but all that extensive fat on her body from all that chocolate eating was gone!  She lost over 4000 pounds in 30 seconds!<br>\r\n\"Wh... what happened, zam?\" Yukimaru checked herself out, wondering the exact same thing you were... minus the 'zam' part. All that weighed she managed to gain in mere hours and quickly disappeared and reduced back down to that short little pipsqueak form from when you first saw her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! Watch who youre calling a pipsqueak, zam!!\" she immediately snapped at you for some reason!<br>\r\n\"Huh? I didnt say anything.\"<br>\r\n\"I just heard you!\" she snapped again, \"and for you information, zam, I only weighed about 3600 pounds, NOT over 4000!\"<br>\r\n\"But I never said you were o....huh!\" Weird. 'How is getting these strange assumptions from you?' you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n\"What strange assumptions, zam?\" Yukimaru's rasied an eyebrow, \"...and how did you talk without moving your mouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot snickered to herself, hinting she knows something about this! \"Heheheh... isnt it obvious? C'mon! What do you think happens after you digest a goddess?\"<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n\"Think about it! What happens when you digest food? You absorb their nutrients! So what happened after you digested Urd?\"<br>\r\n\"I absorbed her nu...OHHHH!!!\" it seems as though both you and her realized it, \"I...I'm a goddess, zam?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound as if this kinda thing is common,\" you interject to that all-knowing robot.<br>\r\n\"It is,\" she states, \"those that manage to consume and digest a god absorb the powers of a god. This kind of nifty trick is how so many lowly organic meatbag mortals gain such incredibly ungodly powers! Heck, how do you think the countess Cassandra originally got HER powers?\" Cassandra digested a god? \"Heh! I remember hearing that bitch Urd talk about how she was gonna use your friend's magical box of chocolates to help her overthrow Cassandra. Something about them being made of a Gluttony God or something... aw well. Blew up in her face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukimaru on the other hand didnt seem as interested in the robot girl's story. She was just staring at her hands for a short while, then looking over to the cracks, torn dry paint, and debris her former gigantic gain caused to her room. Curious of her newbound powers, she decided to test them. With a wave of her hand, each and every little bit and piece of debris magically zipped back to their original position in the room and every single crack, hole, and tear was instantly sealed up! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This....\" Yukimaru stared back down at her hands in anticipation. She even drooled a little! \"This is... wow!\" You were staring in awe, too. But not at the magically restored room. At Yukimaru herself! Sure you've felt something pretty deep about her before, but now youre not just interested in it, youre entranced by this little ninja demon! Maybe it's that angelic aura of hers luring you in, but man did it make you want! You never noticed how lovely her lightly-toned and peach skin was. Her serene face was also a wonderful addition. And the way her blue eyes twinkled as you gazed at them made it next-to-impossible for you to keep from reaching out and touching them! Lots and lots of thoughts raced through your mind, but about 90% of them translated to 'DAMN, Yuki's hot!' ...ANOTHER side-effect from digesting Urd?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, Yukimaru heard those thoughts, too! She quickly turned her head to hide her obviously bashful face as she twidled her fingers! You couldnt help but find it cute how quickly such a big strong and determined woman turned into a little bashful cutey-pie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear!\" just then, the robot looked at her watch, \"Look at the time! I gotta get going! Hope I see you too later!\" And she quickly darted out the door! Gee... you never even learned her name! Oh well. Speaking of, youre starting to feel a little tired. Might as well not let that room Urd paid for go to waste!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um! W-Wait!\" Yukimaru tugged on your shirt as she looked up at you at you nervously(probably not used to being smaller than you!). It was cute... except for the fact she was holding a knife to your throat! \"A-a-as your g-goddess... I... I order you to...\" she was blushing like crazy again as her knifing hand was very shakey, \"...to g-gaze at the s-s-stars with me....z-zam?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When you're ordered by a goddess to do something, you do it...no matter how trivial that task is.  When you hear her give that order, you feel like you should obey it....but also you feel like you could refuse the order, but you don't want to get on  her bad side!  Especially when Yukimaru turns into a goddess.  So, you just nod.  You and Yukimaru exit the hotel and look up at the night sky.  Countless stars dot the sky, but you can hardly see them due to the lights of the city.  Yukimaru and You make your way outside the city, so you could stargaze properly.  Once the two of you are far enough from the city, the two of you look up at the stars.<br>\r\n                  \"I know all of their names...zam\" said Yukimaru.   \"the name of every galaxy, every star, every planet...I know everything\" <br>\r\n                   \"Well, that's what being a goddess means\" you say.  <br>\r\n                    The night sky isn't exactly cloudy, but its not completely clear either.  The night is silent, save for the crickets and other nightly noises that are nothing but white noise.  You stare up at the sky and wonder if Earth is somewhere up there.  <br>\r\n                   \"It is\" said Yukimaru, reading your thoughts.  \"you're about 700 billion light-years away from it\"<br>\r\n                    \"What?\" you ask.  \"I thought...\"<br>\r\n                     \"You thought you were in another dimension\" finished Yukimaru.  \"you're still in your own universe....or, should I say...the Multiverse\"<br>\r\n                   \"Multiverse?\" <br>\r\n                      \"Every dimension is interconnected\" said Yukimaru.  \"if you go far enough and long enough, you'll end up on your own planet.  However, with the multiverse with the size that it is....it'll take you billions of years to reach Earth\"  <br>\r\n                       \"How big is the uni...er, multiverse?\" you ask. <br>\r\n                      \"Infinite\" said Yukimaru.  \"it goes on forever and ever....\"<br>\r\n                        Yukimaru's voice trails off and she looks up at the sky for a minute, then looks back at you.  Without warning, she kisses you on the lips!  When a goddess kisses you, you pretty much get an instant erection....if the goddess herself is horny.   You return the kiss.  <br>\r\n                             \"Let's go somewhere more private\" said Yukimaru in a husky voice, and snaps her fingers. <br>\r\n                             You find yourself out in space, yet you're able to breathe.  You look around and discover that you're adrift in interstellar space with Yukimaru.  There's a nebula nearby.   This is the way to stargaze!  You look all around, gazing at the endless sea of space all around you.  You guess that Yukimaru is keeping you alive somehow with her new-found powers. <br>\r\n                       \"Indeed I am, zam\" said Yukimaru,  \"right now, we're surrounded by a bubble of air that I made.  Now, we can talk in private....and do other fun stuff, zam\"<br>\r\n                         \"What kind of stuff?\" you ask eagerly.<br>\r\n                         \"Well, I don't know\" said Yukimaru.   \"maybe talk about building me a temple since I'm a goddess now...hehe...\"<br>\r\n                           \"I was thinking of overthrowing Cassandra\" you say.  \"isn't that what Urd was planning to do?\" <br>\r\n                        \"Ah, yes\" said Yukimaru.   \"Cassandra is also a goddess  since she ate one of the Q....overthrowing her won't be so easy, even for me.  Cassandra is more powerful than I am, zam\"<br>\r\n                          \"She...she is?\" you ask, shuddering. <br>\r\n                          \"Oh yes\" said Yukimaru.  \"remember, I'm just a newcomer to this goddess stuff.....I have yet to test my powers fully\"<br>\r\n                         \"So, you need time to....get better with your powers?\"<br>\r\n                          \"Practice makes prefect, zam\" said Yukimaru.   \"if I can't control my powers, I could wipe out the entire multiverse!\"<br>\r\n                          \"That would be bad\"<br>\r\n                           \"Yes, zam\" said Yukimaru.  <br>\r\n                            \"So...what's first on the agenda?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                            \"First, we need to spread the word  about the new goddess in town\" said Yukimaru.  <br>\r\n                            \"That's a fine start\"<br>\r\n                           Yukimaru glances toward the nebula nearby and smiles.  She then exited the bubble of air and went towards the nebula.  You don't know what she's up to.  Yukimaru entered the nebula.  Within moments, the nebula started to spin rapidly.  It spun faster and faster, all the while it started to look like a solar system.  Soon, the proto-solar system started to expand.  You could now see Yukimaru in the center of the new solar system....and she dwarfed you like the sun dwarfs the Earth. All you could do was stare in awe.   A few minutes later, planets began to form all around you, all orbiting the young sun that had formed in the center of the new solar system.   After that, Yukimaru moved closer to one of the planets and breathed on it...and gave it an atmosphere!  She breathed on all the 7 planets, giving each of them an atmosphere.   Yukimaru then grabs the bubble of air.  She looks down at you and smiles when she sees you bowing down to her.     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Only moments after witnessing this astronomical event of galactic proportions, with a simple blink of your eye, your short ninja goddess was standing before you (looking UP at you, mind you) within the bubble back to her normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it, zam?\" Yukimaru stared up at you with anticipation, \"was it incredible? Was it magnificent? One of the greatest things you have ever saw in your entire life if not THE greatest?!\" Despite her confident stature earlier, Yukimaru was obviously excited about her new powers. Guess becoming a God can do that to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That....that was-\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, zam! Dont tell me!\" she cut you off and decided to just read your mind, \"you were gonna say... 'That... that was AWESOME!' Right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" you nodded, \"that's exactly it! Youre amazing, Yukimaru!\" However, it wasnt exactly the monumental change of the universe that holds youre interest in this girl. Perhaps youre getting a little too high off the goddess pheromone, but just looking into Yukimaru's sparkling blue eyes was more than enough to find your goddess completely irresistible. And of course, judging by her face turning red again, she could sense your interest again! Damn, she's too cute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I am more that just cute, zam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you smiled down at her and wrapped your arms around her, \"a lot more.\" You held the kunoichi close to you... knowing DAMN well the possible consequences youre facing if she doesnt want to be hugged! Being both a ninja and a god multiply the unimaginately limitless possibilities of excruciating death! Even Yukimaru smiled a little smugly knowing that she had you by the balls and twisting them off was not outside her reach!<br>\r\nThankfully, she didnt mind your passionate embrace. In fact, she put her hand to your cheek and raised her head to kiss you on the lips. Throughout all this, you can hear the unison chants of 'ALL HAIL YUKIMARU! ALL HAIL YUKIMARU! ALL HAIL YUKIMARU!' coming from the planets below! Your own galactic audience? Heh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'ALL HAIL YUKIMARU! ALL HAIL YU-MELEANA! ABEL COMA DE SABALIBA NEBA DRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" Just then the chants started turning to gibberish and strange sounds! None of them went unheard by Yukimaru! \"W-What's going on?\" she pushed you off her and looked down at the planets below.... only to find them spinning out of control! Her blue eyes widened at the sight! \"WHAT?! NO! THIS ISNT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN, ZAM! STOP!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach planet spun around in their own little circular rotation around the universe! None of them spun in a particular pattern, so-<br>\r\n*THUD!!! SLAM!!! CRUSSHH!!!* some ended up crashing into eachother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!\" Yukimaru screamed, \"STOP! STOP!!\" But the planets wouldnt comply. To make matters worse, the stars themselves fell out of their position like they were poorly taped to a wall and fell deeper in the black abyss of space!<br>\r\n\"NO!! COME BACK, ZAM!!!\" Yukimaru screamed, trying to regain her power, \"YOUR GODDESS DEMANDS IT!!\"<br>\r\nAnd to add the final nail in the coffin, the two of you noticed a big bright streak of fire (a comet!) fly toward a particular planet that bared a striking resemblance to earth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... no no please, zam!\" he short ninja goddess shook her head and banged on her bubble, \"dont! Dont do it! DONT DO IT!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMM!!!!!!!!!* And with that, the new goddess had just screwed a portion of the multiverse over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOO-huh?\" When the explosion finally stopped, you found yourself back at the hotel. Yukimaru didnt destroy it! ...Then what universe was it that she DID destroy?!<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, you looked over to see the little kunoichi shivering and shaking in desperation... safe to say she couldnt believe what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...What happened, zam?!\" she shouted in confusion, \"I... I had everything! The absolute power of a goddess... the power of the universe in the palm of my hands! How do I... actually... screw that up?! W....wait! How come I dont know what's wrong with me?! I'm all-knowing, zam! I'm supposed to be all-knowing!!!\" Geez! She's taking it THIS badly! Well, it's probably understandable seeing as though she completely obliterated an entire galaxy by accident! Just like she warned...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I dont know how to fix it, zam!\" Yukimaru turned her head and snapped at you for some reason.<br>\r\n\"What? Fix what?\"<br>\r\n\"The universe, zam! Didnt you wonder if I could fix it a moment ago?\"<br>\r\n\"No, I didnt.\"<br>\r\nThat very answer made Yukimaru give you that same dumbfounded look she made when she saw the galaxy destroy itself in front of her eyes! Did she read your mind wrong or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... no, it's not very cold out, zam.\"<br>\r\n\"But I didnt ask if it was,\" you humbly replied. Extremely cautious of her lack of a mind-reading ability, she tested you. \"Quick! Think of a number between one and a million!\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n\"JUST DO IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" you thought of a number... would she guess it?<br>\r\n\"Is it 506,499?\"<br>\r\n\"No, it's 2.\" Nope! And she took the wrong answer really REALLY hard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auggghh....\" Yukimaru groaned as she fell to the floor. By the sad look on her face as she kept her eyes to the ground, she was pretty heartbroken. \"I... I have failed. I am no goddess... I am unfit to control such a tremendous power... How could I possibly dream of taking down Cassandra? I'm a failure... a lowly, lowly failure.\" She even started crying! She's really taking it so badly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukimaru, relax!\" you assure her, \"you just discovered your power like an hour ago. It's gonna take a while to get used to it.\" But your 'goddess' just shook her head, \"It's because I'm a failure... A failure as a goddess, a failure as a lover, a failure as a ninja... *SNIFF!* I'm just a worthless landlady of a some shoddy hotel nobody ever bothers to come to, zam. I... I'm a disgrace to my brothers and sisters.. I... I dont deserve to live.\" Aww... poor gi-'DONT DESERVE TO LIVE'?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know now what I must do,\" Yukimaru got up off the floor and pulled out her knife... and pointed it at her own throat! \"I can at least die with honor, zam!\" Was she being serious?! She's gonna kill herself just because of one little mistake (that destroyed an entire galaxy, but still!)<br>\r\n\"YUKIMARU, DONT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back!\" Yukimaru ordered, \"I dont deserve the luxury of being with someone as brave and charming as you, zam.\"<br>\r\n\"C'mon Yuki, knock it off!\" you try to calm her down, \"It's ok! We'll work this out together. You'll get used to your new powers! I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry about me, zam,\" she humbly sighed, \"youre just still entranced by goddess aroma. It'll go away soon... and then you'll just forget about me.\"<br>\r\n\"Please! Stop!\"<br>\r\n\"G....Goodbye, C-C-cruel w-world!\" she shouted as her hand with a knife in it started to shiver like crazy. Would she actually go through with it?! By the way she's shivering, shaking, and sweating, she didnt seem all that serious about this! She is clearly overexaggerating! The way she's looking back at you is almost like telling you 'Please stop me!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you buy it? Or do you even want to take the risk that your new friend might do something stupid?!</span></div></div>",

She didn't brought the knife any closer to her throat, and yet...it seemed to inch towards her throat.  Without thinking about it, you rush up to her and manage to wrestle the knife away from her throat.  Yukimaru doesn't give up a fight either; otherwise, you'll never get the knife away from her throat.  You slowly take the knife away from her and throw it to the ground....and then, hug her.   It's  hard to say who is more shocked by this, you or Yukimaru.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"What good will it do if you kill yourself?\" you ask.  \"you're not weak; you just started way too big with your new powers.

The purple-haired priest is wearing his trademark smile, as well as his clothes from the series.  In his hands, he held his wooden staff, which was slung over his shoulder.  As you watched, he ate from a large apple in his other hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         \"Who are you?\" asked Yukimaru.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n                     \"I am Xellos, a wandering priest\" said Xellos, bowing slightly.  \"and I just couldn't help but notice that you're a new goddess.  It's been quite a while since we had a new goddess around these parts\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n                      \"I'm no goddess\" said Yukimaru sadly.  \"I destroyed an entire galaxy, zam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     \"Yes...my superiors saw what you did\" said Xellos.  \"and they're willing to teach you how to use your powers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"But, I'm not worthy...\" started Yukimaru,<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n                        \"Listen\" said Xellos.  \"you just got your powers...it'll take time for you to learn how to control 'em.  You can go to see my superiors, and they'll teach you how to use your powers properly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"But...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                     \"Yukimaru, shut up!\" you shout.  It came out more sharply than you intended.  You instantly cringe, ready for whatever punishment that Yukimaru was going to dish you out.  But it never came.  \"Yukimaru, you gotta believe me when I say that I find you the most attractive woman I ever saw..\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"You haven't met any of my superiors\" interjected Xellos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"...and I would be sad if you kill yourself now.  You're worthy of being a goddess\"  you continue.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n          \"It won't be that easy\" said Xellos.  \"a deity gets their powers from prayers and worship...that's why your powers went out of control.  You haven't even established a temple to yourself, or even a religion.  You can't expect to become a goddess and instantly create a whole new solar system just like that--\" here, he snapped his fingers.  \"--it takes time.  My superiors can teach you how to use your powers....only when you've earned your powers through being worshiped\"  <br>\r\n       <br>\r\n                   \"You honesty think that, zam?\" asked Yukimaru to you, ignoring Xellos and his little speech.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Yes, I do\" you say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"What am I? Chopped liver?\" asked Xellos, sweatdropping.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"You say that your superiors will teach me how to use my powers, zam?\" asks Yukimaru.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n                    \"Why, yes\" said Xellos.  \"it'll be quite a long journey, though\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                      \"Can't you just send us there?\" you ask.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n                       \"Well...I could\" admitted Xellos.  \"but I'm awfully busy with something else\"  With that, Xellos vanishes into thin air, leaving behind a map.  <br>\r\n                      \"Hey, come back here!!\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I SAID GET BACK HERE, YOU GOD OF CROSS-DRESSING!\" you continued yelling. But you already knew that Xellos was long gone. To where? Who knows. Youre not a god... All you have left of Saint Tranny is that map. A map of what seems to be the world but with continents you never heard of... 'Knaron', 'North Pelasar', 'Ahum-Raj', 'Skulvadia'... there's even a red line that seems to lead from where you assume this location is to a certain whitish, sparkly continent circled in red. It said 'Celestia'. The Gods' homeland, perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoure picking up nothing but bad vibes at this point. You know it aint gonna be easy.. hell, it's probably gonna be one of the hardest things you've ever attempted in your entire life if not THE hardest! But youre a long way from home and you think very highly of your new friend... and youre bored. VERY bored. And as we all know, when some people are bored... they do very desperate things to entertain themselves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....S-Steve?\" just then you felt someone tugging on your shirt. It was Yukimaru... looking up at you with her cheeks reddened. Is it just you or is it REALLY easy to make that girl blush? \"...W..what you were saying to me in front of that lecher, zam... d...did you mean it?\"<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, zam!\" you tell her, not realizing you slipped the z-word out! \"a wonderful woman like you has far so much potential. It'd be an awful waste if you throw it all away and take your life.\" As you said it, you noticed Yukimaru's eyes beginning to twinkle again. She's still goddess enough to find her irresistable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukimaru then looked back at you with a determined look on her face and nodded, \"I... I was a foolish coward for doubting myself just for simply destroying one solar-system. I refuse to allow myself to be so weak again, zam! With this new light shining on my soul, I shall flourish from this mortal shell of a makeshift demon-ninja forever cursed to running a run-down hotel all alone in the world... and emerge as Yukimaru, the Goddess of Hope, Strong-Will, and Determination!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could almost see a flame light around her body as she continued her speech, \"I owe this all to you, zam! Your manly physique and romantic voice has shown me the light!\" you blushed a bit when she referred to your 'manly physique' and 'romantic voice'! \"When I become the Impervious Goddess, you shall be my greatest and most trustworthy servant. You will dedicate your life to me, zam... and I shall fight with my body and soul for you! No one will ever be able to stand against us... especially not Cassandra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounds like she is more than ready to begin the journey that weirdo Xellos is gonna put you through. Still, great to know her spirits are lifted... especially thanks to your 'manly physique' and 'romantic voice'! ...Heh... they sure dont make 'em like that back home! No surprise why!<br>\r\n\"I...I must prepare, zam!\" Yukimaru announced, \"This journey will be long and perilous. We'll need to get ready! I'll need to increase my training, extend my exercising sessions, meditate and clear my mind, change my diet, increase my chocolate intake to store blubber for the extremely cold weather we'll come across.... And....*yaaawwwnnn*...and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how determined she was, her lack of sleep was catching up with her! \"Yukimaru? Perhaps we should start going to bed. It's getting late.\"<br>\r\n\"No!\" she snapped despite her eyelids were getting heavier, \"I... I cant sleep now, zam! I need to.... need to.... *yawn*....get.....ready.... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....\" She literally fell asleep standing up!<br>\r\nYou couldnt help but shake your head and smile. The girl's got spunk. But she still has a heck of a way to go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently carried the small kunoichi in your arms and carefully set her down on her bed which was surprisingly restored just moments ago and pulled the covers over her. She looked so peaceful in her nice deep well-deserved sleep.<br>\r\nSpeaking of, it's about time YOU get some sleep too. Since Urd's no more, you got a room all to yourself....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Or you could hop into Yukimaru's bed and appease that inner Xellos of yours!</span></div></div>",

Despite  your desire to feel her up, you're too tired for it....besides, Yukimaru would probably punish you for touching her without permission!  So you get as far as you can get away from her on the bed and watch her sleep for a minute until you fell asleep too.  Within ten minutes, you find yourself standing in front of Horseshoe Falls in Niagra Falls.  You're standing on the platform that overlooks the falls and the  sight is breathtaking!  There's nobody around; just you.  The sound of rushing water is the only sound you hear.  As you approach the edge of the platform, you hear something behind you.  You whirl around and spot Yukimaru!<br>\r\n                   \"Beautiful place for a date, zam\" said Yukimaru.  <br>\r\n                    \"I guess\" you say.    \"hey, how did you get here?\"<br>\r\n                     \"I just stumbled into this dream\" said Yukimaru.  \"I guess this is one of  my powers, zam\"<br>\r\n                      \"You mean, you're the real Yukimaru?\" you ask.  <br>\r\n                     \"Yes, zam\" said Yukimaru.  \"I....err...\"  she then blushes!  Gosh, she blushes SO easily!  <br>\r\n                       She then notices the falls behind you and smiles.  <br>\r\n                      \"Hey...I just realized I'm awfully thirsty\" said Yukimaru.  \"and this place has plenty of water, zam.  Hehe, watch this!\"<br>\r\n                        Yukimaru then jumps off the platform and into the water fall below.  You then jump off the platform too and end up in the water, next to Yukimaru!<br>\r\n                        \"You better watch out\" said Yukimaru.  \"I might drink you up along with all this water, zam\"<br>\r\n                           \"I've been in your stomach before\" you say.<br>\r\n                          \"Good point...\" said Yukimaru and swims over to the bottom of the falls and opens her mouth wide.  As you watch, Yukimaru's belly quickly swells up with water.  Within moments, Yukimaru soon takes up the entire bottom of the falls' basin!  You end up on Yukimaru's stomach as it swells even bigger.  Soon, Yukimaru dwarfs the falls.  <br>\r\n                             \"That hit the spot, zam!\" said Yukimaru.  <br>\r\n                              You're about at the top of Mount Belly, and you make your way to her inflated breasts.  Before you could reach her  breasts, you find yourself floating towards her fattened face. You land right in front of her mouth.<br>\r\n                              \"So....have you ever been to Celestia?\" you ask. <br>\r\n                              \"Nope\" said Yukimaru.  \"but I did hear that it's awfully cold up there!\" <br>\r\n                             \"What do you know about it?\" <br>\r\n                              \"Its the Gods' Homeland\" said Yukimaru.   \"very few mortals live there...the continent has only one city of mortals, in fact...they call it North Haven....and all the people up there are fat to protect themsleves from the cold\"<br>\r\n                             \"It looks to be a long trip\" you say.<br>\r\n                               \"Yep\" said Yukimaru.  \"and you can't go there directly either!  You have to take several ships to get there...it should take about 3 months to get there, zam\"<br>\r\n                              \"Three months?!\" you ask.  \"isn't there a faster way?\"<br>\r\n                             \"I'm afraid not, zam\" said Yukimaru.   \"in the morning, we'll make our way to Quahog for the ship that goes to....Ahum-Raj.

That usually tells you she's thinking. \"...Actually, I heard there was an 11th city, but I think it was destroyed a long time ago after a big town revolt which led to the Mayor and his wife being executed by the townfolk.\"<br>\r\n\"Geez... that's terrible,\" you comment. Yukimaru nodded, \"I feel bad for their son, zam. Left all alone in the world at such a young age... I could relate, though.\" You noticed her eyes lowering to the ground as she spoke, \"I'm just thankful I still had my big brother to look out for me, zam...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm? Something unpleasant about her past? Now youre a little curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I never knew you had a brother...\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm?! OH!\" for some reason, her distant look of sadness was immediately replace with a carefree grin, \"N-nevermind that, zam! That's all in the past. We have the future to think about... my future as a full-fledged goddess!\" Hmm... she's obviously hiding something. But hey, this is supposed to be a GOOD dream, so you'd rather not butt in and make her feel uncomfortable. And the last thing you want is to give bring back suicidal tendencies! Besides... you dare not make those beautiful blue eyes of hers shed tears of sadness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Yukimaru sensed that bit of interest from you and starting blushing a bit. \"U-U-Um.... S-Steve? W...why are you looking at me like t-that... zam?\"<br>\r\n\"No reason,\" you just replied with a smile on your face. Oh man, you hope this dream could last forever, but you know youre gonna have to wake up sooner or later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Steve! STEVE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... did you hear something, Yukimaru?\"<br>\r\nYour colossally obese friend shook her head, \"I didnt hear anything, zam.\" She didnt? You coulda sworn you heard somebody else called to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY STEVE! We gotta talk!\" You DEFINITELY heard that!<br>\r\n\"Um... are you sure you didnt hear anything?\" you asked Yukimaru.<br>\r\n\"No, I dont think so, zam. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you were about to answer her, there was blinding flash around you and she was nowhere to be seen! Not only was Yukimaru gone, you werent even in Horseshoe Falls anymore!  You were in the middle of some forest next to a campfire and a tent. Where were you?! You were supposed to be with your ninja-goddess pal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to interrupt your little fun time with the newbie, but we gotta talk.\" You heard the same voice again. You turned your head, only to see that very lecher from earlier... Xellos! What the hell is HE doing here in your dream?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his hand to greet you \"Hello again, Steven! Long time no see... uh... well, technically it's only about 7 hours since we last met, but nice to see you again!\"<br>\r\n\"What the hell are YOU doing here in my dream?!\" you politely asked him. Unfortunately it wasnt enough to wipe that carefree smile off his face. <br>\r\n\"Now now, relax! Your friend doesnt know the difference... in fact, at this very moment, she's still chatting away with you.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\nXellos pulled out a little orb from his pocket and showed you, \"See?\" In it, you saw a vision of you and Yukimaru still talking with one another, although you couldnt hear what either of you were saying. ...WAIT A SEC! How could you be THERE when youre HERE?!<br>\r\n\"Wait! How could I be THERE when I'm HERE?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand-alone double spell. It's a clever little trick only a true full-fledged High Priest like myself could master!\" Xellos bragged about his incredible powers, \"Ha! Amazing, isnt it? She could be knocked by a different double every day and never realize it! Ha ha ha-hUGH!!\" You stopped his snooty laugh short after you grabbed him by the neck!<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" you questioned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey! Easy easy!\" In an instant, he disappeared out of your grasp and zipped right behind you, \"Anyways, I heard you and the goddess-in-training are heading for Quahog to take a boat to Ahum-Raj. Very dangerous place.... of course, it'll be difficult enough to even get to Quahog in the first place. Not even your powerful friend might not be enough to protect you from the horrors that await.\"<br>\r\n\"And what is it to YOU, Xellos?\" you asked the rather nosey priest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want your body!\" ...WHAT THE HELL?!<br>\r\nYou slowly stepped away from him \"Dude... you might wanna look elsewhere for that kind of thing!\"<br>\r\n\"What? No, you misunderstand!\" Xellos, keeping some sort of a dignified persona, cleared his throat, \"*Ahem!* I propose we have ourselves a little bargain. You see... I need a place to um... hide out for a while. And I thought of the perfect place... your body!\" Your body?!<br>\r\n\"Wait wait! Here me out!\" Xellos could sense you wanted to object, \"I err... just need to take possession of it for just one day. One day is all I ask.\"<br>\r\nHe's practically asking you to let him possess your body a day. You do not like where this is going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why exactly should I do that?\" you raised your eyebrow, \"care to tell me why you need to take MY body?\"<br>\r\nXellos blushed a little as he scratched the back of his head, \"Well... it's quite simple, really. I mean youre young and new, and I am quite highly experienced with this world. With my incredible knowledge of the route to Quahog, I can lead you and your friend to safety without causing any harm whatsoever to your dashing body!\" ...'Dashing'? \"That and um... I kinda need to lay low for a while for some big reason, but you dont need to know that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I dont!\" you snapped back at him, \"I aint letting you take control of my body! Lord knows what you'll do with it!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh come now!\" Xellos swayed his hand, \"You have my word I wouldnt do anything... unpleasant with your body...\" you then notice a slightly devious grin on his face appear on his face as he looked through his little orb, \"of course if your friend were to get rather.. frisky, I cant possibly be held accountable, can I?\"<br>\r\nCurious as to why he's grinning like that, you looked through the orb... and saw your double start making out with a smaller-sized Yukimaru! Of course, he had to pick her up to reach her mouth, but HIS was practically everywhere on her body! The nerve of that fuckin' priest! He's messing with YOUR girl with... your clone... and making her think that's you! But....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, this can work for the both of us!\" Xello continues to plead, \"I get adequate... hiding time playing as you, and in return, I help you and your girlfriend through the route of Quahog and maybe pick up some essential supplies for your trip to Ahum-Raj, and even teach your friend of certain survival tips and secrets to getting through the merciless desert quick and easy. And in just one day, you'll be back in your normal body and nobody'll ever know of the 'switch'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really dont want him to gain control of your body even if it's only for a day, but maybe Yukimaru could benefit from Xellos's help on the road to Quahog. But one question remains.<br>\r\n\"And where will I be during the whole time?\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be in MY body,\" Xellos answers, \"But dont worry. There's nothing to be scared about when being me. Just keep a low profile and dont make yourself too obvious and you'll be fine!\" then Xellos frowned a little and blushed even more, \"...however, you might wanna keep away from a certain someone I'm trying to get away from. It's not like she's gonna hurt you or anything... but yeah, you'll know to watch out for her when you see her! So do we have a deal?\" He extended his hand, waiting for you to shake it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obviously dont trust Xellos's true intentions for switching bodies with you and youre a little worried about who this certain person is he's trying to avoid, but it's only for 24 hours. Plus, Yukimaru could use Xellos's knowledge. Is it worth the 24-hour switch?</span></div></div>",

It could be fun switching bodies with Xellos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Deal\" you say, shaking Xellos's hand. As soon as you do, there's a bright flash, blinding you for several moments.  When you can see again, you find yourself in a one-room shack.  You blink and look around and find that you're indeed in the body of Xellos....but where the hell  are you?  The one-room shack you're in looks to be a storage shed of some kind....that hasn't been used in about 40 years!  You decide to open the door to the shack, only to find yourself on a low hill overlooking a canyon.  Okay....so...you were kicked out of the dream because you switched bodies with Xellos and were sent to whereever Xellos was hiding out.   You were going to ask him what was wrong about the trip to Quahog, but it looks like you don't get to find out.  You wanted to ask who was after him too.    It's still night out with the faintest hint of sunlight coming.   Looks like the start of the day.   You take a closer look at the shack and find a flashlight with working batteries in  it.  You decided to explore your surroundings.   In five minutes, you find a note from Xellos not far from the shack on a sizable boulder.  The note reads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        If you're reading this, I will answer some of your questions that you no doubt have.  <br>\r\n              There's nothing wrong about Quahog;  the road that leads to Quahog goes through Neko's turf.  Neko--that isn't her true name--is a fox that's a well-known robber and murderer.  Neko also happens to be a goddess, thanks to her devouring of the god known as Ako-Ako  (you wouldn't know him).  Anyway, Neko is a dangerous goddess that likes to torture people in brutal ways....and she's not after me if you're wondering.  Neko's turf is a dangerous place to be for anyone (especially a goddess-in-training).  I do know the one weakness that Neko has that I will not say here.  I'll try to get Yukimaru to avoid Neko and we'll be in Quahog before the day is done.  Hopefully, you'll be in Quahog tomorrow. <br>\r\n               The person who's  after me is Lina Inverse.  Lina isn't too dangerous per se, but she has an terrible temper and I have what she's looking for.  There's also someone after me by the name of....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             At that point, the  note is snatched out of your hands and you look up in time to see a gigantic foot rushing at you.  You manage to dodge out of the way at the last moment and scramble to your feet.  You gasp as you see that a full-grown dragon is standing right beside you!   The dragon merely glances at the note and snorts with laughter.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n          \"So, Xellos is hiding in your body, is he?\" asked the dragon in a female voice.  <br>\r\n           \"Who are you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n              \"Nithog\" said the dragon.  \"looks like I have a dilemma on my hands.  Do I stand and wait for Xellos to come back to his own body....or roast his body with you in it?  Decisions, decisions....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Nithog tosses the note into her mouth and swallows it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Nithog is about 50 feet tall, and is dark green.  Her underside is light green.  She also looks to be quite fat.  </span></div></div>",

I just cant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you to the count of three to cough it up before I gobble YOU up!\" she threatened, \"...1.....\"<br>\r\nMan, why couldnt Xellos have left you a note on how to use magic as well?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pondered the nearest escape route, you noticed something just below her bulging belly... a switch?<br>\r\n\"...2....\"<br>\r\nYou dont have time to question it, so you let your curiosity get the better of you!<br>\r\n\"THREE!!!\"<br>\r\n*Click!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POOOOOOOOOFFFF!!!* The moment you flip that tiny switch, Nithog bursts into a humongous cloud of smoke!! Yikes, what kind of big scary dragon has a self-destruct button?! But when the smoke cleared, you learned that Nithog wasnt a kamikaze dragon...<br>\r\nWhat was left when the smoke cleared was a little girl lying on the ground. A short young(looking) blonde girl with blue eyes, a cute blue bow in her hair, wearing what seems to be a white sleeveless choir-girl dress and little white wings sticking out her back! For some reason, this girl seemed to be sweating bullets as she stared up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd youre pretty sure you know why! Say hello to the big bad NITHOG!!<br>\r\n\"..<b>WHAT?!</b>\" you growled under your breath, almost causing your darkened aura to explode all over the place!<br>\r\n\"Uh...uh....um...\" the girl stuttered nervously, \"uh.... Roar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY YOU LITTLE-\"<br>\r\n\"EEEKKK!!!\" the brat let out a loud shriek as she got up off the ground and tried running away! Unfortunately for her, the twerp wasnt getting away! As if acting on ranging animal instinct, you leaped into the pounced on her! As your shadow overshadowed her, you noticed her blue eyes widened at the sight of you just before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOMMPPPPHH!!!!\" You pinned the sneaky little runt's arms to the ground, ensuring that she aint getting away! You didnt hurt her (not like you didnt want to after she scared the living hell out of you!), you just restrained her!<br>\r\n\"Grr! L-Let me go!\" she squealed and struggled, \"I-I-It is a crime against the Celestial laws to brutally torture an angel-in-training!!!\" 'Angel-in-training'? \"N...Not to mention it's also a crime to hide confidential information of a wanted criminal I, Flonne Caspius, Angel Trainee and Love Freak place you under arrest!\" Who is this little brat kidding? And what is this little brat talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, youre in no position to flaunt authority, little lady!\" you snap at Flonne, \"Secondly, what are you talking about? What do you mean by hiding information of 'wanted criminal'?\"<br>\r\nShe gave off an angry frown that seemed more cute than it did threatening, \"Hmmph! I'm talking about the Dark Priest Xellos! Wanted on many accounts of murder, thievery, lechery, co-inspiring against Heaven! It's my job to see that awful criminal brought to justice and pay for his crimes!\" And YOURE the one who gladly accepted to switch bodies with him?! You had a feeling the guy couldnt be trusted! You better hope he makes good on his deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Unless you wish to share his punishment,\" Flonne continued to squirm, \"you'll let me go and tell me where the real Xellos is!\" Once again, YOU had HER pinned to the ground. Threats were out of her league.<br>\r\n\"No way!\" you snapped at her, \"not after that little prank you pulled on me! I seem to recall you threatening to eat me!\"<br>\r\n\"Th....th....th...\" Flonne stuttered like crazy again, \"....then at least give back the thing that he stole from Celestia!\"<br>\r\n\"What did he steal?\"<br>\r\n\"...I dunno,\" Flonne shrugged, \"I only heard that he stole it... um... so give it back!\"<br>\r\nSafe to say you were getting tired of the little angelic flunkie, so you gave her a little proposition, \"How's about you give me a good reason why I shouldnt yank those little wings of yours off?!\"<br>\r\n\"I-I'M TELLING THE SERAPH YOU SAID THAT!!!!!!!!\" she squealed like a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"XELLOS?! WHAT IN THE...?! I KNOW YOURE A PERVERT, BUT... A CHILD?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAw snap! Somebody else spotted you. You turned your head to see a red-headed girl with a black bandana, red eyes, big yellow earrings, wearing what seemed to be light swordswoman armor and red pants... Lina Inverse, you take it? Judging by the disgruntled look on her face, she's not very happy to see you... or it could be due to the fact that she's looking at you on top of a little girl, pinning her arms to the floor! Not exactly a good sight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-wait! M-Ms. Inverse! I can explain, ya see-\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, save your worthless excuses!\" Lina snapped at pointed her sword at you, \"just step away from the kid and hand it over!\"<br>\r\n\"Hand what over?\"<br>\r\n\"You know what I'm talking about!\" she snapped again, \"I said give it back!\" So this was what Xellos when he said you had what she was looking for. Shame he didnt say WHAT... or at least he MIGHTVE if Flonne didnt eat the note!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Look! Ms. Inverse, this is all a big misunderstanding!\" you explain, \"I'm not really Xellos.\"<br>\r\nLina just tilted her head and looked at you funny, \"...What?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you continued, \"I swapped bodies with him as a favor so he'd help my friend! Isnt that right, Flonne?\" you looked down at Flonne, \"C'mon! Tell her it's all a big misunderstanding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlonne....</span></div></div>",

For a minute, you're afraid that Flonne would rat on you...in which case, you might be on one end of a Dragon Slave attack from Lina.  <br>\r\n              \"...He speaks the truth\" said Flonne.  \"said that Xellos switched bodies with him to protect a friend of his\"<br>\r\n               \"And why should I believe you?\" asked Lina.<br>\r\n                \"Cause I'm an Angel-in-Training from Celestia\" said Flonne.  \"we're forbidden to tell lies\"<br>\r\n              \"If you're not the real Xellos, then where is he?\" asks Lina.<br>\r\n              \"And would you kindly get off of me?!\" asked Flonne.  <br>\r\n              \"You threatened to eat me\" you snarl.  \"you think I would let you up after that?\"<br>\r\n               \"Oh, come on!\" said Flonne.  \"that was an act\"<br>\r\n                You let Flonne up after some thinking.   When she's up, she tells Lina that she's looking for something that Xellos stole from the Hall of the Gods...she doesn't know what was stolen however.  After that, you tell Flonne and Lina about yourself and how you came to be in this situation.  It's a little hard for Lina to believe your story, but she's convinced that you aren't the real Xellos.  You leave out the  fact that Xellos knows how to get pass Neko.  <br>\r\n               \"Are you and Flonne looking for the same thing?\" you ask.  <br>\r\n              \"I seriously doubt it\" said Lina.   \"unless the Gods want a breast expansion potion...\"<br>\r\n               \"A...what?\" asked you and Flonne.<br>\r\n                \"Breast expansion potion\" repeated Lina.  \"I've been looking for it for years, but Xellos stole it from me\"<br>\r\n               \"Uhh...\" you say.  <br>\r\n                Lina Inverse is a very talented magician, but she's not very....well, curvy in the breast department.  This is a running gag on the Slayers anime.  You think that she's one of the cutest anime girls out there; proof that not all anime women need to have big breasts to be cute.  <br>\r\n                    \"Couldn't you use magic to make them expand?\" asked Flonne.<br>\r\n                     \"If I was able to do that, I would do that\" said Lina.  \"but expansion magic isn't my forte...and they can go VERY wrong if you're not careful.  I discovered the potion that would expand my breasts.   As soon as I got it, Xellos came and stole it from me....that was about three weeks ago.  Ever since, I've been searching for Xellos. So, you don't have the potion with you?\"<br>\r\n                         You do a quick search of Xellos's pockets (which is deeper than normal pockets) and you pull out pretty much everything besides the potion.  Lina sighed.<br>\r\n                         \"Xellos must've hidden it somewhere\" you say.  \"he did left me a note explaining everything....and then, SOMEONE came along and ate it!\"   When you say \"someone\", you point at Flonne.  <br>\r\n                    \"Hey, I was....\" starts Flonne. <br>\r\n                      \"Speaking of eating, I'm awful hungry\" said Lina.  \"time to get some breakfast!\"<br>\r\n                      When Lina Inverse wants to eat, there's no stopping her.  So, you and Flonne follow her to a nearby city called Pfoensheare.....which is a sizable port city.  It turns out that you're on the other end of the contient.   You three find a resturant and start scarfing down major amount of food.  Lina's hunger is legendary, and she lives up to it; she even warns you to keep your hands and feet away from her mouth!  \"Unless you wanna end up in my stomach\" she quips as she gulps down a drink.  <br>\r\n                             \"I think I'll pass on that...\" you say. <br>\r\n                             Flonne also has a bottomless pit for a stomach it looks like.  <br>\r\n                              \"So...everyone has a bottomless pit for a stomach?\" you ask, hoping to sound causal.  <br>\r\n                              \"Pretty much\" said Lina. <br>\r\n                              \"Where's Gourry and the others?\" you ask, realizing that Lina is  traveling alone.  Lina thumbs her nose at you and doesn't answer you.  You look over at Flonne, but she shrugs and continues to eat nonstop.  For a moment, you think you hear muffled voices coming from Lina's stomach, but that's just crazy.  <br>\r\n                            </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just then, a shocking surge sparked in your mind! It wasnt painful... it was more like a premonition. Someone was coming! Someone with bad intentions! You dropped your fork as you waited with fear and anticipation for this someone to come! Unfortunately, neither Lina or Flonne were as astoundingly perceptive as you are!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*whew!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm... that shocking surge is gone. That was fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can relax, Lina put on a rather shocked expression. She seemed to be staring in the direction of the waitress coming over to your table to offer seconds. Unfortunately, the waitress had stopped suddenly in place and had an expression of frozen shock as if whatever happened just scared her stiff. But before you could ask her if she was alright...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*sssslllliiicccceee*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEEKKKKK!!!\" Flonne shrieked as you gazed in absolute horror as the poor waitress's body split in half! Her top half fell on the floor while her bottom half stood standing with pools of blood gushing out of it's gaping sliced wound! Poor woman probably died before she could experience how excruciatingly painful that was! It's a good thing Xello's body has a strong stomach, otherwise you'd be fighting back the urge to puke and piss yourself!<br>\r\nYou tried to sound out the other customers' screams and panicking as you pondered who could do such a horrible thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if things couldnt get worse for you, you felt the shocking surge come right back. At the very back end of the room you saw a very familiar-looking silhouette. Although her body was completely shaded, you recognized the midget's shape and figure: Yukimaru!!<br>\r\nAnd if you thought THAT was painful, she whipped out a particular knife that you recall she attempted to commit seppuku (or was it harakiri? I forget) with.... drenched in blood!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... no friggin way!\" you mouthed in disbelief. Your own little girlfriend... a cold-hearted murderer?! Sure she inadvertently destroyed a universe, but it was clearly an accident! Not that this... which was clearly on purpose!<br>\r\nNot only that, she whipped out something from her pocket... a little bottle full of green bubbling liquid! Seeing that made Lina tense up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHE'S GOT MY...\" Lina suddenly stopped mid-sentence for some reason, \"...Elixir of Healing!\"<br>\r\n\"But I thought you said it was a breast expa-OOMPH!\" Lina covered Flonne's mouth before announcing, \"LET'S GET HER!!\"<br>\r\nNot wanting to look the other way, you followed the angel and flat-chested heroine as they chased after your lover's shadow! Yukimaru dashed down the hallways as you followed after her! She was so quick and agile, she even leaped against the walls and dashed across them like the Prince of Persia! She was fast, but so were you. Xellos musta done a lot of running around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasnt long before Yukimaru led you and your allies out of the restaurant and into a dark back alley. Your newbound intelligence told you she was leading you into a trap, but it didnt matter to you. All that mattered was why she had done what she did. And on the plus side, she finally stopped running... right in front of a brick wall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nowhere left to run, murderer!\" Lina warned as Flonned whipped out a bow with a pink heart arrow and aimed it your lover's way, \"Hand over the.... bottle now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukimaru turned around.... she has no face!! No eyes, no nose, no mouth! Her exposed head was completely pale and white! A fake?!<br>\r\nThe fake Yukimaru quickly fell to the ground like a marionette that's been clipped of it's strings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the... YAAAAAHHH!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, electric surges sparked not only your mind, but also the bodies of Lina and Flonne! By the time the surging stopped, your two friends fell to the floor with a thud!<br>\r\nTHANKFULLY they were just knocked out. UNTHANKFULLY, you were all alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shocks that knocked your friends out came from the two identical demons in ninja garbs.... with tasers. Not exactly sure why ninjas would have tasers, but whatever. The ninja demons pointed their tasers toward your neck and crotch area, making absolutely sure you werent going nowhere!  Not wanting to piss off your kidnappers, you remained still and quiet as you awaited their mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, shadows appeared out of the brick wall, revealing more pointy-eared ninjas\u2026 and another figure, with a more dominating aura stepped out of the center shadow! This figure wore the exact same ninjaish uniform that Yukimaru wore, had the same pointed elven ears... even had long black hair similar to her as well. but by the time you caught a glimpse of the figure when it stepped into the light, you could tell this was not Yukimaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis figure was much taller than her, even taller than you! His eyes were completely white, void of eyelids or pupils, with black ring makeup around them. His aura felt similar to that of Yukimaru's but a lot colder and less welcoming. A relative of hers, perhaps?<br>\r\nHis pupiless eyes were locked on to yours as he stepped toward you. Split seconds seemed like split hours as you both stared daggers at each other. This gave you plenty of time to think about who this guy might be and what he might want. Since you believe he is related to Yukimaru, you had to think hard for clues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just thankful I still had my big brother to look out for me, zam.... zam... zam....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess...\" you finally broke the silence, \"you must be Yukimaru's big bro, right?\"<br>\r\nHe said nothing. And you didnt like the sound of that. He stared at you for a few more seconds before whispering something to one of his fellow ninjas in a language unfamiliar to you which lacked the word 'zam'. His ninja underling nodded and whispered to the ninja with the knife to your crotch who then nodded.... and stabbed you HARD in the shin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAAAAGGGHHH!!!\" you screamed off the top of Xellos's lungs. You fell over, gripping the side of your leg in pain! You couldnt nurse that wound for long, cuz Fubuki's underlings had tied your arms together and gagged your mouth! Geez, is this any way to treat your brother-in-law?!<br>\r\nShame you had no friggin clue on how to conjure magic... but even if you did, you sensed special little magic-blocker tags on each on the ninjas preventing you to cast anything! Wait a sec. How do you know about magic-blocker tags?<br>\r\n...Better question! How did you know his name's Fubuki?! Yukimaru never told you his name, did she?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, the guy who you think is named Fubuki leaned down at you and whispered...</span></div></div>",

All that you could do was stare up at the ninja with a shocked expression on your face!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"How do you....?\" you ask, speaking through the gag you had on your mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"My mistress apologies for not showing up much sooner\" said Fubuki.    \"but she was in the middle of something when you came to her house...or rather, when your car broke down\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Wha...?\" you ask.   \"what's this all about?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Fubuki turned to face one of his ninja underlings and gave an order in that same unfamiliar language....was it Latin?  It sounded vaguely like Latin, but you were never good at studying other languages besides English.  The underling in  question did a quick salute and then vanished from sight.....just like that.  He turned to another underling and barked out an order.  The underling hauled you to your feet.  Fubuki started to walk down the dark alley, and the ninja underling forced you to march after Yukimaru's big bro.  You look over at the still knocked-out Lina and Flonne on the ground and pleaded at them silently to get up and rescue you....but they never did!    As you are frog-marched out of the dark back alley, you notice that you're being led to a large red and black carriage.  The carriage looks like it could seat at least a dozen people!   As Fubuki, you and the underling approach the carriage, the footman opens the carriage for you.  The footman looks like a demon, complete with horns and cloven hoofs!   You're forced into the carriage, followed by Fubuki and hid underling ninja.<br>\r\n                \"The mistress will be with you shortly\" said the footman as he closes the door.<br>\r\n               The inside of the carriage looks just like the inside of a limo and could seat at least a dozen people.  The seats are made out of black leather and the walls are a light red.  <br>\r\n                 The underling and Fubuki start to have a conversation in that strange language of theirs.  You try to get their attention, but they ignore you.   Four minutes later, the carriage opens again and a demonic woman steps into the carriage and takes a seat near you.   The woman looks like Morrigan from the Darkstalkers games with blue hair and silvery eyes.  She looks directly at you.....and you find yourself kneeling in front of her!  You don't recall getting up from your seat at all.  <br>\r\n                       \"A sheep in sheep's clothing\" mused the woman.   \"allow me to introduce myself.  I'm Lady Cassandra.  I own that house you saw before you entered into this world.  I apologize for not greeting you sooner, but I was busy with something else.   Let me take this off of you....\"  Here, she removed the gag from your mouth.  Her voice was like honey to your ears, and it effected you like a siren's call.  You couldn't help but be enthralled by her voice and her looks.  She smiles at you and motions for you to return to your seat. <br>\r\n                        \"I imagine you have a lot of questions for me\" said Cassandra, and you feel the carriage start to move. <br>\r\n                       \"What's this all about?\" you ask.   \"why did you kidnap me?\"<br>\r\n                      \"I kidnapped Xellos' body\" corrected Cassandra.   \"I want Xellos....but you're my second-place prize.   I could return you to your own world if you want.  For a price of course.  Nothing is free you know\"<br>\r\n                         \"You can....?\" you start to ask when the carriage suddenly exploded!   <br>\r\n                         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                            You wake up to find yourself looking at Lina!  Flonne is there too.  All of you are in a wagon, speeding down the streets of the port city.  The wagon is being drawn by two horses and driver is Gourry.   <br>\r\n                            \"What happened?\" you ask groggily.  <br>\r\n                            \"Dragon slave\" said Lina, pointing behind the wagon.   You turn around to see that a small section of the city has been destroyed and nothing is left save for a huge crater.  <br>\r\n                              \"Thanks for saving me\"  you say.  <br>\r\n                               \"We're not out of the woods yet\" said Flonne.   \"a dragon slave won't kill Cassandra\"  <br>\r\n                               \"I know that\" said Lina.   \"but it'll slow her down\"<br>\r\n                                 You figure you must still be alive because you're in Xellos' body.

She's very powerful and she plans on ruling our world!   Other than that, I don't know that much about her\" <br>\r\n                               \"She's the seventh daughter of Lilith, queen of all succubi\"  said Flonne.   <br>\r\n                                 \"Lilith?\" you ask.  \"Adam's first wife?\"<br>\r\n                                 \"Who's Adam?\" asked Gourry.<br>\r\n                                \"Never mind that\" said Flonne.   \"we need to get to Quahog as speedily as we can\" <br>\r\n                                \"We'll never make it to Quahog in a day\" said Gourry.  <br>\r\n                                  Now, the wagon had made it out of the port city of Pfoensheare and was on a wide cobblestone road.

But you stood your ground. If she really wanted to kill herself, she wouldnt have bullshitted around for so long, she'd just DO IT! You stared her down as she sweated kunais, shaking the knife at her throat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I...I.....I....\" she finally lowered her head and put her knife away, \"I cant do it...\"<br>\r\nYou breathed a sigh of relief. She's finally calmed down. However, she wasnt the least bit happy about it.<br>\r\n\"...I am not even brave enough to die with honor!\" She was ashamed that she couldnt kill herself?!<br>\r\n\"Yuki, dont say that-\"<br>\r\n\"I am truly a disgrace to the rest of the Snow Clan! I have disappointed my own brothers and sisters!\"<br>\r\nYou were not liking the fact she hasnt uttered the 'z' word yet! \"N...Not even a 'zam'?\"<br>\r\n\"Only a true strong blooded Snow ninja can utter the word,\" Yukimaru started breaking into tears, \"I...I... I have lost the meaning of the word! E-excuse me!\" And with that, she stormed out of the room crying her eyes out! Oh dear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuki! Where are you going?!\" you called out to her, \"Wait! Yuki!\" She didnt wait. She darted off down the hallway, not even bothering to look back! You chased her down the hall and out of the hotel...<br>\r\n\"Yukimaru, come back! COME BACK!! YUKIMARU!!\" Too late. She was gone. You lost all sight of her. \"Aw... damnit!\" <br>\r\nPerhaps you shouldve stopped her from humiliating herself when you had the chance. She is pretty stubborn after all. Now she's wandering off somewhere, leaving you all alone stranded in the middle of nowhere in front of her hotel.<br>\r\nOn the plus side, you dont think you need to worry about her getting in danger. After all, she is practically a goddess now. Perhaps she just needs some time alone to clear her head. \"She'll come back,\" you say to yourself as you turn around and head back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" only to bump into someone who suddenly appeared out of nowhere! Just inches in front of you was a tall shady long brown-haired slightly bearded man man in a black leather trench coat with a bigass wooden cross strapped to his back glaring into your eyes with those red and blue dual-colored pupils of his and a cigarette in his unemotional frown. You didnt know whether he was trying to intimidate you or just try to look badass. After a short while of staring at you, he took a slight smoke of his cigarette and blew right in your face!<br>\r\nThe nerve of that Van Helsing reject!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...WHO will come back?\" before you could get a word in, he questioned you in a dark roughnecked badass tone of voice.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, what do you think-!!\" you stopped in midsentence the moment he whipped out a little switchblade from his coat and pointed it at your throat!<br>\r\n\"Dont move,\" he warned you, \"dont even take a single breath.\" Without Yukimaru's protection, you were at the stranger's mercy.<br>\r\nHe flipped his switchblade around, revealing a crucifix on the opposite side, holding in your face as he looked you over.<br>\r\nHe checks your eyes. \"Hmph. Pupils arent dilated.\" Checks both sides of your face and under your neck. \"No sign of any scratches or teethmarks. Your breath kinda smells a little off, but then again, it could be just bad dental hygiene.\" Smartass! Still, he continues looking you over, \"No weird markings or tattoos. Skin tone doesnt seem quite pale enough. No wings, no tail. Testicles still seem to be attached.\" ...THE HELL?! After a bit of looking you over he FINALLY puts his switchblade back in his coat, \"Heh. Guess youre not a demon... good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh... good?<br>\r\n\"Wh...who are you?\" you finally muster the courage to ask, to which he gladly answers.<br>\r\n\"Hunter. Hunter H Hunters. Demon Hunter, 1st Class, 25 years straight. See my badge? Course you dont. Know why? Hunters dont carry badges. An assassin for hire, but I'm a pure-blooded servant of the Good Lord,\" he says as he reaches into his coat and pulls out a bible... shaped box with a liquor flask marked 'Good Lord' inside! He twists open the top and takes a huge swig of the flask! \"AaaAAAAH! That's the Good Lord for ya!\"<br>\r\nHoly hell, a Van Helsing reject with a drinking problem?! Lovely.<br>\r\n\"S...so... um... that makes you, what? A vampire hunter or something?\"<br>\r\n\"Vampire, zombie, werewolf, ghoul, devil, you name it, I aim to slay it,\" Hunter responds cooly, \"I'm in charge of keeping the demon population in check. Heard the Succubus's lair is a good place to do a little... 'population control'!\" A Van Helsing reject with a drinking problem that decided to wander into Cassandra's place to kill monsters! Can this guy get any better?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which... have you seen this demon?\" he reached into his coat once again and pulled out a piece of paper. Your eyes widened when you saw the picture! It was Yukimaru! \"This one's got a hell of a record. Wanted on multiple charges of vandalism and homicide. Forty accounts on robbery. Twenty-one accounts of destruction of property. Twelve accounts of rebelling against the judicial system. One account on devouring a well-ranked goddess. 723 billion accounts of murder. 9 accounts of galactic imbalance which led to 723 billion accounts of murder.\" Oh right... the universe destruction incident! \"The client, a certain family member of said devoured goddess, demands the demon dead, it's head sticking on a pike, and it's tongue removed so that can never again utter the cursed 'Z word of Heracy'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamnit! This guy's set out to kill Yukimaru?! YOUR Yukimaru?! He cant possibly be serious! Has he got too much of the 'Good Lord' in his system?! He cant kill Yukimaru.... can he?<br>\r\n\"Uh... listen, Mr. Hunter-\"<br>\r\n\"Let's see...\" Hunter pulled out random objects from his trenchcoat, \"it's a ninja type... got a robe of camouflage and a few shurikens handy. It's of the Snow Clan... got my lighter and a can of aerosol. Has plenty of God blood flowing through it... packing plenty of Hines blood. Yep... bitch is good as dead. Alls I need now is leads. HEY YOU, KID!\"<br>\r\n\"I got a name! It's-\"<br>\r\n\"Dont care!\" Hunter cut you off again, \"I couldve sworn I heard you calling out the demon's name. Which way did it go?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now he's asking you where Yukimaru went! Seeing as though he's out to kill your special lover, the last thing you wanna do is tell him where she is! Not that you know anyway...<br>\r\nBut lying to him might be kinda bad for your health as well! Do you dare give Hunter false directions... or just flat out tell him you dont know?</span></div></div>",

I'll go and kill her, shall I?\"<br>\r\n            Hunter turned and was heading out of the lobby of the hotel when somebody entered the hotel;  it was a young man dressed much like Hunter was, but he had a mess of blond hair instead of brown.  The young man rushed past Hunter, not even noticing Hunter. By the time Hunter turned around to see where the young man had gone, the young man was chatting away with you, apologizing for being late and asking for forgiveness.  The young man was still babbling on when Hunter grabbed the kid from behind.  The young man yelped and faced his attacker.<br>\r\n              \"I believe I'm the one you're looking for, boy\" said Hunter.   \"I thought I told you to come as soon as possible!\"<br>\r\n               \"The map you gave me wasn't any help\" said the young man.   \"and this place is out of the way and...\" <br>\r\n               \"Shut it!\" snapped Hunter.   \"seems this one has been in contact with the demon we're looking for\"<br>\r\n              \"Hey!\" you yell.  \"I have a name!\"<br>\r\n               \"I thought I smelled the demon on him\" said the young man.<br>\r\n                Smell?  You sniff yourself, but can't make out any other scent.   <br>\r\n               \"You stay here and keep an eye on the place\" said Hunter.   \"I'm going to try to pick up the trail\"  With that, Hunter stalked off out of the hotel.  The young man re-entered the lobby of the hotel and looked you over.  The young man looked to be two years younger than you were.  His leather trenchcoat had old stains of blood all over it and a sizable claw-mark was on the right shoulder.  A rather shabby-looking coat.<br>\r\n                 \"Might as well get on with the introductions\" said the young man.   \"I'm Yorick, Hunter 4th class\"  <br>\r\n                \"I'm Steven\" you say.   <br>\r\n               \"What do you know of the demon?\" asked Yorick.<br>\r\n                 \"Only that she's a ninja and runs this hotel\" you say.  \"and she's NOT a demon!  She's a goddess!\"<br>\r\n                 \"Only because she ate that goddess earlier\" said Yorick, sitting down at a table.  He motions for you to join him at the table and you do.  Yorick whips out a flask from an inner pocket filled with an amber-colored liquid.  The flask isn't labeled...could that be more of that Good Lord stuff?!  Now you have two hunters with a drinking problem!  Yorick takes a small swig from the flask and makes a face.   \"Wish I didn't have to take this stuff....\"<br>\r\n                        \"Huh?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                          \"Every Demon Hunter has to drink this shit at least once a day\" said Yorick.   \"have no idea why....I'm just 4th class, they tell shit to Hunters of my class\" He takes another swig of the stuff and nearly gags.  You puzzle over that little statement....why would they have to drink once a day?  Sounded like some sort of medicine.   That's when you hear the doors of the hotel open once again.  This time, it's a woman who enters....and she's dressed like Hunter and Yorick was.  What's with the trenchcoats?!  And she's quite the looker too with curves and big breasts. She's wearing a low-cut shirt under the leather trenchcoat and she has dirty blond hair.   She looks much like Mai Valentine from Yu-Gi-Oh.  In fact, you wonder if it really is Mai.   Does Mai has a twin sister?  The Mai lookalike looks around the lobby until she spots Yorick. She comes over to the table and sits right next to you.<br>\r\n                     \"Good afternoon, I'm Janet.  Hunter, 3rd class\" said the woman, shaking your hands and Yorick's.   \"And you're the new guy I've heard so much about\"<br>\r\n                     \"I'm Yorick\" said Yorick.  \"I'm with Hunter\"<br>\r\n                     \"I'm with Dastena\" said Janet.  Yorick looks shocked.<br>\r\n                       \"They have TWO hunters going after the demon?\" you blurt out.<br>\r\n                       \"Dastena isn't after the demon\" said Janet. \"she's after Hunter\"<br>\r\n                          \"What?\" yelled Yorick.  \"why on earth she's after Hunter?!\" <br>\r\n                        \"She wouldn't say\" said Janet.   \"all she said was that a third party wanted to  stop the killing of Yukimaru\"  <br>\r\n                         \"Third party?\" you ask. <br>\r\n                           \"Even so, a Hunter can't hunt another Hunter\" said Yorick.  \"its against our ways\"<br>\r\n                        \"I don't get it either\" said Janet.   \"Dastena just came to me and asked for my help...and she looked scared\"<br>\r\n                       \"Scared?\" asked Yorick.   \"I thought nothing would scare her\" <br>\r\n                        \"Well, something did\" said Janet.   \"Dastena sent me here to look after the place\"<br>\r\n                        This is quite the development!  First, there's a Hunter who's after Yukimaru and then there's another Hunter going after Hunter!  And who...or what is this 'third party' that wants Yukimaru to live?  You find yourself staring at Janet's large chest and notice something.  She's wearing a golden pendant with the letter \"Z\" on it.   In a moment, the pendant vanishes into thin air as if it was never there!  What the hell?<br>\r\n                           \"What're you looking at?!\" asked Janet.  <br>\r\n                              \"Uh...nothing\" you say, quickly looking away.<br>\r\n                              \"So...Dastena is another Hunter?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                             \"She's our leader\" said Yorick.   \"she's a master of swordfighting and spying\"  <br>\r\n                              </span></div></div>",

Even though you've done nothing but feed Yukimaru all day long, you feel sleepy at the end of the day.  What worries you is how this new goddess will react to your refusal.   Will she kill you with her knife, or will she be merciful?   You wait several tense moments as Yukimaru considers on what to do with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"Eh, you're right\" said Yukimaru, taking her knife away from your throat.  \"I feel that you're too tired to stargaze with me, zam.  And I won't have a tired worshiper hanging around me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"Whoah!\" you say.  \"who said I was your worshiper?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"I did\" said Yukimaru.  \"if you have a problem with that, I'll digest you like I digested that crazy Urd, zam!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"Hey, I have no problem with that\" you say.  \"I was pretty much your worshiper anyway by feeding you all those chocolates\"  <br>\r\n           <br>\r\n            \"I guess you're right\" laughed Yukimaru,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            You then wonder why Yukimaru returned to her normal size and weight.  Was it because Urd was skinny too?  Or was it a status choice...I mean, who ever heard of a fat goddess?  Statues of goddesses were thin and lovely....in fact, the only goddess that was remotely fat was a goddess of fertility.  You're just too tired to think straight, and you automatically head for Urd's room,when Yukimaru tugged at your shirt once again and you turn to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"Since you're too tired to stargaze with me....\" said Yukimaru.  \"would you mind....sleeping with me, zam?\"  with that, Yukimaru blushes so deeply red that she looks like Mars!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"You really want me to?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"Do you think you're the first mortal to sleep with a goddess, zam?\" asked Yukimaru.  \"you humans have a history of being smitten by the divine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"I don't have the energy for that, either\" you say.  \"I just want to sleep\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"And so you shall\" said Yukimaru.  \"and I'll provide a nice and warm place for you to sleep in\" she then licks her lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"You want me to sleep in your stomach?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Well...in my body, anyway\" said Yukimaru.  \"it doesn't have to be my stomach.

Breasts already the size of wrecking balls soon grew to be twice that, then three times the size as they swelled with fat from the magical sweets. Enormous thighs soon became gigantic as they grew, their combined width enough to crush a large truck. Plump feet wiggled as the cankles around them swelled to immense proportions. Her hands soon became completely useless as her arms became weighed down with over two hundred pounds of smooth, creamy-skinned fat. Yukimaru's once nonexistent derriere was now squashed against the ceiling, connecting with her back rolls. Her belly was a giant, fleshy bed, continually filling with adiposity until it eventually filled the room, pressing you and Yukimaru against the ceiling. You almost feel claustrophobic as Yukimaru's immense bulk is squashing you into a space less than that of an average closet. The robot simply snoozes on her boulder-sized left breast, not even noticing as Yukimaru continues to swell. She's completely ecstatic as she begins to fill the remaining space, forcing you against the ceiling. You gasp for breath as you realize how soon she's going to outgrow it, excited at the very mention of the idea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More...\"Yukimaru asks of you. She's smiling devilishly now. \"One or two more and I'll break through the ceiling. I'm famished...feed me, outsider-san...zam...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's almost begging, her fat face set in a seductive and cute smile that's practically asking to be stuffed. \"One question before I do: how big do you think you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukimaru giggles before snuggling a little into her amorphous left shoulder. \"I know my butt's completely inflated now, about the size of my massive tummy. That's why it's so stuffy in here. And my belly's been flowing into the hallway when it can. It's probably close to about four tons by itself, zam. Plus my enormous cheeks, four tons. My breasts I believe are a two tons apiece, so that's about ten. Add my fattened legs and I'm probably close to about 14 tons altogether, zam. My cute lil' face and big, soft arms aren't worth a thing compared to my body. Now, feed me...make me huge, zam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou comply, and stuff two, three...five chocolates into her mouth! Grinning, she chews and swallows them, eager to feel their fattening effects. You and her wait patiently. It might've been a delayed reaction. YOu hear another rumbling...then...\"Oh my...this feels wonderful!\" Yukimaru exclaims. Her body rips through the upper floors, tearing away at the two story hotel. THe chocolates actually multiplied the effects of one by TWENTY-FIVE, making the gain equal to...(rough estimate) ten tons of pure fat. That's 20,000 lbs. You actually faint as she continues to rise, bleeding from the nose at her immense and expansive beauty. You hear her laugh as she breaks through the roof now, her enormous tummy bursting open the front of her hotel and engulfing a couple of hapless women. The massive set of rear cheeks she garnered rip through the back, flowing into the street and settling into two enormous, silky smooth globes. Her breasts are like enormous piles of dough; they're softer than anything you've felt, yet they're round and perky and for some reason still held in by strained bandages. Her fattened thighs and hips are spread out over the entire square footage of her hotel's foundation, crushing anything that was reminiscent of it. You hear her sigh, slightly muffled by her gigantic cheeks(which have the volume and surface area of basketballs by now). Deciding to sleep, you close your eyes fully and enjoy the new mattress that is officially your ninja girlfriend.</span></div></div>",

Your legs are hanging down into her cavernous cleavage while your upper self is resting on her left breast.  The robot is resting on the other breast.  The robot didn't really do anything yesterday; she thought the situation between you and the ninja was funny, so she had decided to hang around.  Yukimaru is snoring softly as you look around wildly for the box of chocolates.  You barely remember that the box slipped from your grip when you fell asleep.  You look into Yukimaru's cleavage and you spot the box of chocolates resting at the very bottom, where her two massive breasts meet.  You shrug and dived right into the cleavage, and ending right beside the box.  You're about to climb out of the cleavage when you spot a hand sticking out of the meeting of the two breasts.  You grab the hand, and the hand grips hard.   After some time, you manage to pull a young man out, and you're shocked to discover that you've just saved Ash from Pokemon.<br>\r\n                   \"Thanks a lot\" gasps Ash.  \"I was afraid I was a goner!\"<br>\r\n                   \"You were in there overnight?!\" you ask.  \"didn't you suffocate?\"<br>\r\n                  \"I was in my room when I was suddenly buried in a cleavage.

Pokeball, go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Misty tried to catch the robot. Unfortunately, her rage was that of over ten billion apocalyptic suns. \"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING, YOU FUCKING DITZ? I'M NOT NO GODDAMNED POKEFON OR WHATEVER THE FUCK IT WAS! SUCK PLASMA!\" You and Ash hear the plasma cannon charge up, only to hear it fire and see Misty fly over the canyon of cleavage. She, the robot, stomped over to the edge of the canyon, the back billowing steam as she vented her fury. \"BITCH!

Guys never want to get involved in a cat fight, especially ones with such short tempers. Yukimaru's long black locks are curled into a spiral on her back fat, still in the long ponytail. She's sleeping soundly, even with all the commotion. You can see Misty running up and down Yukimaru's breasts, trying to escape the raging miniature Cascade Range. Ash is looking exasperatedly at them, moreso Misty than the other girl. Eventually, Ash gets up, finally fed up with the ongoing fight and goes to stop it.

Yukimaru is losing weight by the hour.   She wakes up when she's around only 4,000 pounds.  You tell her that the effects aren't permanent.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n            \"I knew that\" said Yukimaru.  \"I didn't want to be big forever, zam\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n              \"You didn't?\" you ask.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n              \"Of course not\" said Yukimaru.  \"I can't be a ninja when I'm the size of a building\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              Yukimaru seems to be taking the news well.  Perhaps she truly didn't want to be that big.  You feel just a twinge of disappointment as you look over the box for anything you might've missed.  The company that made the box of chocolates--Expanding Dreams, Inc.--is located in  several cities according to the big logo:  West City, Quahog, Springfield, The Samna Canyon.    Samna Canyon?  What's that?  You ask Yukimaru.  The fight came to an end just then by Misty hitting the robot with one of her mallets. The robot goes flying off of Yukimaru's body and out of sight.   By that time, Yukimaru is back to her normal size--albeit 500 pounds.  All of you are just standing around in the ruins of the hotel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"The Samna Canyon is a canyon, containing many cities\" said Yukimaru.   \"That's where I got that box of chocolates.  That company makes some fun stuff....as you can imagine with a name like that, zam\" Yukimaru looks down to her tattered clothing.  \"I guess I need new clothes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                There were TV crews from various stations, all gathered to report on who had destroyed the hotel...but as soon as they found out that Yukiaru wasn't as big as she once was, they all left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                Yukimaru drags you to the nearest clothing store.  You hand the box of chocolates to Misty and say \"have fun with that\"  Misty smiled and eagerly started to gobble up chocolates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  You and Yukimaru go to the nearest mall--which is called The Milky Way.  The Milky Way Mall is an impossible building....or it would be in the real world.  The Mall was one of those cartoon buildings that's far more bigger on the inside than out.  It's called the Milky Way Mall becase it was said to be as big as the Milky Way Galaxy...which is just plain silly.  The Mall looks like any other mall you've been in with a multitude of stores of all kinds in it.  People from all over are here, too; both animated and non-animated people.  You stop to talk to a man that's with Mai from Yu-Gi-Oh.  The man's story is just like yours; he wandered into the woods surrounding Cassandra's house and ended up in this cartoon world.  Yukimaru and you go into a store that's called  \"Ninja Supplies Co.\"   You wait while Yukimaru tries on different clothing.  As you wander through the store, you spot Officer Jenny.  Jenny is clearly part of the mall's security.  <br>\r\n           <br>\r\n                 Just then, someone grabs you from behind!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              </span></div></div>",

What're you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs, her broad mechanical shoulders sighing. \"I decided to follow you. I've no idea where my true <i>'creator'</i> is right now, and probably never will. At least not for the time being. Anyways, I like being with you and Yukimaru. It's actually very relaxing. Better than wandering around, waiting for another crazed person to pick me up and turn me into a 'toy' or the ultimate weapon of mass destruction.\" You see her reasoning. \"So, can I stick around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, waiting for Yukimaru to come back from shopping. Ten minutes pass, then...<b>fwoosh.</b> You jump out of your skin, the loud noise coming from right behind you. Turning around, you see the head part of the robot retract like a helmet, revealing a young girl's face(ten or twelve) with grey eyes and cropped black hair. You gaze at her with wide eyes, mouth gaping as she takes out a bottle of water and guzzles it down. She catches you staring. \"What? Never seen a mecha musume-tan before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" You stutter, looking at her face. \"How old are you, exactly?\" She looks at you funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Age-? I have no age. I'm a sophisticated AI familial guardian. I've studied under several martial arts teachers and weapons masters(sword and gun). I've been around for longer than you've been able to walk, buddy. But if you need an age, I'm about thirty in human years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to faint when you feel another tug at your back. Turning around, you see Yukimaru wearing an exact replica of her old outfit, sized to fit and hug her plush form. She carrying a few spares, as well as a kimono and a bunch of replacement tools. You surmise they're for ninja expeditions. \"I'm all ready, zam...oh! Hello there. I was wondering when you'd catch up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot raises her hand in greeting. \"Hey. I'm following you around for a while. Is that acceptable?\" Her left eyebrow(synthetic hair, you guess) raises up, waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukimaru smiles serenely. \"That's perfectly fine with me. You can as long as you want, zam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. By the way, my name is Mesa. Mesa Chateau.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven,\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Yukimaru, zam. But of course, you already knew that.\" Mesa then does something surprising: she hugs Yukimaru's obese form! You think it's a form of thanking and you simply look away. She lets go after about ten seconds. \"Well...that was unexpected, zam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a tracking thing. Taking in your signature allows me to pinpoint where you are at any location. It helps with security issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat. \"Uh, girls? Where do we head from here?\"</span></div></div>",

You were curious about that \"Expanding Dreams, Inc\" where that box of chocolates came from.  If Yukimaru liked getting huge, then maybe they would have something else that could make her huge again.  Of course, you don't know where this Samna Canyon is.  You ask Yukimaru and Mesa about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"Samna Canyon is a beautiful place\" said Yukimaru.  \"it's located near the Tranquil Plains, zam\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Tranquil Plains was an expanse of open flat land that extended over 30 miles.  There were small towns and tourist traps along the way to Samna Canyon.  When you said that your were interested in finding more about this \"Expanding Dreams\", Yukimaru gave you a sly smile.  You three exit the mall and take a bus to a town called Daniel, which is inside Samna Canyon.  The bus was fairly empty; there were a dozen or so people on it including you three.  Some of the people were as fat or fatter than Yukimaru, while other people were skinny like you.  The driver of the bus is one of those background characters from the Looney Tunes that you don't know the name of (he looks like the boxer from that one Bugs Bunny cartoon).  The Tranquil Plains look very much like the Great Plains states;  flat as an ironing board.  The bus makes several stops for gas.  Eventually, the road the bus is traveling on begins to steadily dip downwards. On the way, you learn more about Expanding Dreams from Mesa.  <br>\r\n                     Expanding Dreams is a company ran by someone named Gerald T. Rodchester, a human who had entered into this world around 24 years ago.  Gerald partnered with somebody named Scaven to open Expanding Dreams.  It was Scaven who came up with candies and foods that were extra-fattening.  There's little info on Scaven, except that he isn't human and he lives somewhere in the Saava Mountains (which is the Rocky Mountains of the cartoon world).  Scaven and Gerald had some sort of falling out 4 years ago, which left Gerald in charge of the company.  <br>\r\n                       Samna Canyon is one of those impossibly deep places that dot the world you're in.  The bus goes down a series of roads that brings you deeper into the Canyon.  The Canyon is 5 miles wide and 50 miles long, and about 2 1/2 miles deep at its lowest point.  The floor of the canyon contains the Samna River and nearly three dozen small towns.  <br>\r\n                           The town of Daniel was a fairly large city, named after its founder and one of the larger cities in the canyon.  Expanding Dreams is headquartered in a place called Samna Rapids, which is 2 miles from Daniel.  The only attraction Daniel has is the Van Statten Caverns, a series of caves that honeycomb throughout the canyon.  You three get on another bus which heads for Samna Rapids.  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It sends shivers down your spine. She's got one heck of pear shape, along with a very nice belly. You move your eyes from her and instead look at Mesa, who's staring at her with a gaze of disbelief. The redhead doesn't notice her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Revya-chan?\" she stutters, not above a whisper. The redhead turns, obviously surprised. \"I-it's me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesa?\" she says incredulously, her red eyes looking at the miniaturized Cascade Range. Mesa nods and blushes profusely, which activates her radiator and blasts steam into your face. Those two knew each other from somewhere. But from where? You've never heard of the name Revya before in any video game you've played. \"Where've you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, fatty! Who the hell is this?\" you hear the voice say again. Revya leans over to Mesa and puts her gloved and gauntleted hand on her cheek. \"Hey! Soulmate, I'm askin' your fatass somethin'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,Gig. Remember? The one golem that had the powerful gun? The one that could shoot light? And the one who...*ahem* Never mind. It's good to see you again, Mesa,\" Revya says, looking at Mesa with very kind and loving eyes. Mesa's synthetic heart is almost ready to burst with shyness, and you can tell due to all the steam that she's emitting and how red her face is. Yukimaru's giggling silently at this. You're kinda amused, but kinda pissed off as well: you're getting a lot of scalding from Mesa's blushing emissions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's good to see you two, Revya-chan. I've missed you...\" she says, turning away from the redhead. You immediately snap to the most likely conclusion: Mesa's in love with her! Revya's next action confirms this. She strokes her hair lightly, ruffling the black locks, then kisses the top of Mesa's head, which causes her to faint. Before the fat redhead can do anything, the intercom blares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Uh, good afternoon passengers, I hope you all are having a good trip. I'm sorry, but due to reports of rockslides and traffic, we're taking things a little slower today. We'll arrive at Daniel in about...one hour. Thank you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukimaru leans over and looks at Revya, who's not startled and is busy picking Mesa up off the floor of the bus. \"You two make a really cute couple, zam. And now you'll have plenty of time to catch up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. And now that Gig has left me alone, I'll let Mesa sleep riiiight....here.\" She put Mesa on her massive soft tummy, then laughed softly as she snuggled deep into her fat body. She was snoozing gently, her breath almost like an ephemeral breeze. \"She's got plenty of time to rest. Do you two mind if I come along? I want to make sure Mesa's all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to hide it, zam! You love her, don't you?\" Yukimaru teases, watching Revya nod her head. Wow, an actual yuri couple. Who would've ever thought of it? \"That's so sweet, zam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukimaru then sidles up against you, and you get the hint, giving her a nice hug and a kiss on her plump cheek. You then feel like taking a nap, and you two both fall into the seat, your head resting on one of Yukimaru's large breasts.</span></div></div>",

Revya and Mesa wake up once the bus pulls into the bus depot near the heart of Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         \"Welcome to Daniel, everybody!\"  said the driver through the loudspeaker.  \"those of you that are going to Samna Rapids--the home of Expanding Dreams--stay on the bus.  Everybody else had better get off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"Can't we go to Samna Rapids now?\" you ask. The driver ignores you, as he opens the door and at least five people get off the bus, and ten more people get onto the bus.  Revya stays on the bus, as well as Mesa.  The two lovers are currently kissing, making you and Yukimaru giggle a bit.  After nearly ten minutes, the driver says into the loudspeaker:   \"Next Stops:  Samna Rapids, North Ateria, Salad Bowl, and Yiaran Falls\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           Suddenly, at that moment, the bus's engine died.  The driver cursed his luck and told everyone that there was another bus to Samna Rapids that was leaving within  two hours.  \"Sorry for the trouble\" said the driver, as the riders of the bus grumbled as they got off the bus.  The last to leave the bus was Reyva and Mesa.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"Two hours to kill, zam\" said Yukimaru.   \"what shall we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"Well...what's there to do in this town?\" you ask.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                  It was then when Yukimaru's stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"How can you still be hungry after eating all those chocolates...?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Bottomless stomach\" said Yukimaru, patting her obese self.  \"I told you I enjoy stuffing myself silly, zam\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     \"I'm hungry myself\" said the massively fat Revya.  \"how about you, Mesa?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                   \"I could eat...\" said Mesa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     \"It's decided then!\"   you happily say as you look for a resturant.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking at a directory, Mesa spies an all-you-can-eat buffet not far from the bus stop called Sweetwater Buffet. She says she knows the owner and that she'll negotiate any problems with Revya and Yukimaru eating them out of house. \" I swear, she's a very good cook, but she doesn't take that much of a liking to humans. She won't kill you, but just won't provide you with the excellent service that she gives people like Revya and Yukimaru who are demons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem? Demon?\" Revya said, bumping against Mesa. She chuckled a little. \"Oh, excuse me. Goddess of earthly destruction. Thanks to Gig, she's basically the most powerful person on the planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...okay...\" you say, knowing full well that Yukimaru was a demon, but not paying attention to how much power Revya emitted. You start garnering cold sweat, worried about what she could do to you. But, for the time being, it was time to fill up the two big beautiful young women. \"All right then! To Sweetwater Buffet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the blue, translucent doors, you watch as they part like water, sounding like a cascade as they slide away. \"Wow...\" you mutter, feeling a little overwhelmed. The first impression you get is of a very serene lagoon, with soft colors, almost realistic sand-colored carpet and a dappled ceiling. Spotting the clerk, you walk up, Revya and Yukimaru in tow. The woman manning the register, light blue-skinned with webbed fingers and wearing a swimsuit, looks up at you then back at the register. You clear your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Ahem* Excuse me, we would like a table of four...\" you say, and she opens the client book, calling over another woman, this one with dark hair in a bun, conversing with her in a different language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're table six. Sierra will take you to your table, and your water will be right out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks...\" you say, pulling out a fifty and handing it to her. You tell her to keep the change as your group follows Sierra to a table. Yukimaru's belly is practically roaring at her, and Revya's is doing the same. The two obese women are starving. Sierra looks at them with a kind eye, bringing them a large plate(each!) of big, fluffy yeast rolls, slathered in butter. They're bigger than your hand! Revya digs in, munching on two at the same time, their soft fluffy dough vanishing into the growing dough of the young woman. Yukimaru is shoving two into her mouth at once, munching on them and swallowing them forcefully before stuffing her face with more. Mesa is literally fawning over Revya as she eats, snuggling up very close to her obese girlfriend. You simply watch in amazement as Yukimaru inhales them, eventually lifting the plate up and swallowing them whole as they reach her mouth. Sierra comes back, this time with who appears to be the owner of the buffet. You smile meekly as Yukimaru sighs, patting her burgeoning belly. Revya sighs as well as Mesa rubs her filled belly, cuddling up to it like a very soft pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Revya, looks like you've grown,\" the owner says, a very pretty and tomboyish-looking young woman of perhaps 17. Her mussed hair is very fitting you decide, looking at the way she's dressed. She's wearing a very revealing bikini bottom but with no curves to speak of. \"And in more than one place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Gig's been making me eat all of those damned hotpods because he hasn't been able to 'fully experience' hotpod goodness, Juno.\" She smiles, chubby cheeks framing her face. Juno, the owner, is also smiling, patting Revya on the tummy. It seemed to swell with her touch, you notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, I love hotpods! I can't help if you mortals gain weight every time you take a bite outta somethin'!\" the voice dubbed Gig says, acting kinda pouty. You disguise a laugh as a cough, wondering what exactly he could do. Juno pats Revya on the tummy again, watching it swell with a very warm smile. She then feels Revya's breasts, which make her moan a little as they swell. One of the aquatic beauties goes over to Yukimaru and does the same thing, pressing her breasts, tummy, thighs and hips, which turns you on as you watch her begin swelling as well. Sierra speaks for the first time: a very soft, motherly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food here is top notch, that's true. But it's when special guests like Revya come over that we give the special treatment: the Massage of Vitality.\" You watch, fascinated, as Revya swells with what is newly formed fat, her combat top becoming severely strained as her once CC-cup breasts turn into EEs in the space of about ten minutes. You can hear the bench creaking as she grows, belly flowing out and onto the table as pounds packed on. Her face becomes chubbier by the second, her second chin melding into a larger one, giving her a cute, cherubic face. Her arms grow even softer, and you notice how strained the sleeves of her outfit are as well as her gloves, trying to contain so much new flesh. Juno is clearly enjoying this, grinning joyfully and happily at Revya's expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Revya...your body seems to grow more beautiful for every pound you gain...Mesa is a lucky girl...\" she whispers, applying more power to the Massage of Vitality. Revya's growth speeds up and increases, and she's being lifted up from the bench by a rapidly fattening derriere. You feel something touch your right hand, and jerk it up immediately, only to realize it's Yukimaru's growing thighs. They've become extremely fat and soft, and you sink your hand into one, watching as it's engulfed by her fattening thigh. It's got to be wider than a tree trunk now. Her arms are growing fat, being stuffed to the brim with it, and becoming giant pillows. Her outfit starts to rip again as her belly surges forward, growing thicker and larger, expanding at a constant pace. You place your hand on it, accidently touching the aquatic woman's hand. She smiles serenely and continues to fuel your ninja girlfriend's massive growth. It immediately swallows your tanned hand in a few seconds, a sign of how fast and fat she's growing. Her breasts are ballooning at an alarming pace, already becoming JJ cups as you watch. Her chins meld together like Revya's, except that her cheeks are a little larger and that Yukimaru has got to be around 200lbs bigger. Her enormous rear destroys the back of the seat, swelling into two beachball-sized globes. Then the benches crack. Both Revya and Yukimaru are about 900lbs. each, Yukimaru's fattening stopped earlier to even them up. Juno smiles happily as she rubs Revya's tummy, enjoying the soft feel of her expansive flesh. The other woman is too, stealing a kiss form Yukimaru's plump lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" you gasp, looking at Yukimaru's massive form. Her uniform somehow stayed on, although now it is completely formfitting to the point of ripping. You massage her tummy and she sighs in pleasure, her entire front heaving up and down from the small breath. \"She's...beautiful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at Mesa, who is deep in a kiss with Revya, her mechanical arms looking tiny compared to Revya's pillowy ones. Yukimaru grabs your arm with a chubby hand and smiles, bringing you in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we've given the best gift we can...have a good day. And thanks for that generous pay, Outsider-san.\" Juno and the women walk away, leaving the four of you in peace. You kiss Yukimaru passionately, wrapping your arms as much as you can around her obese and massive form. This was just like your feeding session, except it's more permament...maybe.</span></div></div>",

You can tell that Yukimaru is getting horny by the kissing, and you're getting horny yourself.  Finally, you and Yukimaru break your kiss when you see Juno coming over.  Juno looks at the pair of you and silently smiles.  You explain that your group has missed the bus ride (did you really spent two hours kissing Yukimaru?!) to Samna Rapids.   Juno laughs and says that she runs a hotel downtown and that your visit is free (actually, everyone who is as obese as Yukimaru and Revya get to stay for free....Juno has a thing for obese people it seemed).  The four of you eventually exit the buffet (after Yukimaru and Revya gains another 500-700 pounds) and head for Juno's hotel.  You and Mesa are practically riding on Yukimaru's and Reyva's massive tummies.  Yukimaru's outfit still fits her, despite her girth...and Revya's clothes are showing strain, but they're holding.  <br>\r\n                The hotel is called The Lard House and its 4 stories tall.  In the hotel's lobby, which is filled with obese people, the four of you check in and get rooms;  Yukimaru and you get a room on the 3rd floor, while Mesa and Revya get a room on the 4th.  The room is especially made for someone as obese as Yukimaru.  You massage her tummy as she sits on the floor.  <br>\r\n                   \"That feels good, zam...now come here\" said Yukimaru, and you two kiss passionately again.  You can't help but be turned on...and neither can Yukimaru.  Soon, the two of you are naked and you practically make love to Yukimaru's fat belly.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Early in the morning, you hear two knocks at the room's door. Getting up and putting on one of the hotel's robes for normal-sized guests, you open it to find two of the strange, aquatic women. You then remember their race's name: Nereids. \"What can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got a transportation schedule for the day, sir. You said before that you wanted to head to Daniel?\" she says in a very soft, musical voice. You nod, taking it out of her hands and thanking her. Yukimaru is just rising. Right now she's rubbing her blue eyes of sleep, her pudgy face yawning. \"Good morning, Yukimaru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up, albeit with a little difficulty, looking for her clothes. You pick up the stretched out pair that she was wearing yesterday and hand them to her. She smiles and points, telling you to dress her. You pull up a pair of snowflake-print panties, big enough to cover a hippo's rear end, slipping them over her enormous legs and large, round derriere, your face blushing as you did so. Her silky smooth skin was almost unbearable to touch, almost perfect. You slip her matabiki over her legs next, the tight blue fabric wrapping around Yukimaru's massive legs and cankles, formfitting to them exactly as the day before. You apply a new bandage bra to her, not too tight as to allow her to breath but enough so that her breasts. become big, full cushions of fat. Yukimaru puts her shirt on herself, it being very simple. You've already donned your underwear, pants and T-shirt by the time she's done, but only because you were hurrying. You didn't want her seeing how flushed you were getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-ready, Yukimaru?\" You ask. She nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, zam. But let's get Revya and Mesa. I hope we didn't keep them up last night...zam.\" She giggles, thinking about how much fun you two had last night. It might've kept those two up all night...<br>\r\n= = = = = = = = =<br>\r\nTaking the elevator up to the fourth floor, you arrive at room 101, a room engraved with angel wings. You hear someone's soft sighs in the room. Strangely, the door is unlocked. You two slip in, despite Yukimaru's impressive girth and large frame, quieter than mice. What you see almost makes you double over because of the cute factor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesa is sleeping right between Revya's massive breasts! Their faces are touching, with Mesa snuggling into Revya's cleavage and her large cheeks, cooing a little at Revya's soft form. Revya's immense body is serving as a very large, fleshy mattress, her fattened thighs, hips and butt cheeks perfect cushions for her enormous belly and KK-cup breasts. However, something is amiss...oh, right. The number of sleeping Nereids on her fat tummy. Including Juno. There are four or five, all snuggling deep into her soft belly, all enjoying the thousand and a half pounds of Revya. Yukimaru giggles, waking Revya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's up?\" she says, a little sleepy. Her big pillowy arms are wrapped around Mesa's torso, almost engulfing the 4'6\" android. She notices the number of *ahem* 'guests' on her tummy and laughs. \"I know. Juno's had a crush on me ever since I met her. And so do many of her followers, for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When can you guys get ready?\" you ask, trying to contain a major nosebleed. She's laughing quietly at your attempt to stem the flow,  her entire body shaking and jiggling with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be about half an hour. Mesa's always ready because she never needs to get clean, but I need to give these little hitchhikers some time to get up. They love cuddling up to a gigantic fatty like Yukimaru or myself.\" </span></div></div>",

Appearently, the bus driver took a wrong turn somewhere yesterday and ended up in a completely other town called Hidden Springs....which is 30 miles away from Daniel, which is two miles away from Samna Rapids, which is the home of Expanding Dreams, which is the company that made that box of chocolates that made Yukimaru so huge. In order to get to Daniel, you have to take a bullet train from BlackTail Station on the outskirts of Hidden Springs.  The group makes it to the station with 10 minutes to spare.  <br>\r\n                  Yukimaru and Revya are easily the biggest people within the station.  Revya had to wait nearly a hour for her \"guests\" to get off her tummy at the hotel.  After a quick breakfast, you and the three others walk to BlackTail Station.<br>\r\n                  When the train got to the station, Yukimaru and Revya was the first people to enter the bullet train.  The train was expandable to allow Yukimaru and Revya to enter it....the train even had specially made seats for someone as big as the two massive females.  The train was crowded with nearly 400 people on the train.  You had to sit on Yukimaru's belly because there weren't any room left for you on the train...likewise, Mesa sat on Revya's massive stomach because there wasn't enough seats on the train.  <br>\r\n                 The train started up and quickly reached speeds of nearly 400 miles an hour...which would make the trip to Daniel a short one.  <br>\r\n                   \"Couldn't we just so to Samna Rapids on this train?\" you ask Yukimaru.<br>\r\n                     \"Daniel is the last stop of the train, zam\" said Yukimaru.  \"the bullet train begins in an area called Rezard's Cliffs--which is about 1,000  miles back that way--all the way to Daniel and back.   Samna Rapids is just a short car ride from Daniel.  Oh...and Samna Rapids is close to Oilano lands...which is forbidden to humans\"<br>\r\n                       \"Oilano?\" you ask.  \"who are they?\"<br>\r\n                        \"A collection of marine animals that are angry at human-kind for the oil spills that occur often in your world\" said Yukimaru.  \"They journeyed to this world and became animated creatures--as some animals often do when they wander into this world--and claim some land on their own.  Samna Canyon empties into The Endless Ocean....and that's where the Oilano are\"  <br>\r\n                        \"Uhhh,,,\" you say, not sure what to say.  <br>\r\n                        About 15 minutes later, the train arrives at Stillwind Station, WHICH IS IN THE TOWN OF DANIEL. <br>\r\n                         Revya, Mesa, Yukimaru and you get off the train along with 200 or so people.  There's a big wooden sign that says:  \"WELCOME TO DANIEL\" as you exit the station.<br>\r\n                       \"Alright\" you say.  \"finally, we're in Daniel\"  <br>\r\n                      \"Yep\" said Mesa.  \"Daniel is a fine city\"<br>\r\n                      \"Enough talk, zam\" said Yukimaru.  \"let's get a taxi to Samna Rapids\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      <br>\r\n                        </span></div></div>",

And as for Mesa? Well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Johnson, I suggest we leave as fast as possible!\" she whispers, buying a long robe from a nearby cart. She pulls out the small, protruding barrel on her chest and attaches it to the blade on her left arm, as if trying to hide it. Donning the robe, which is a sandy brown in color, she hides her face, eyes shifting every which way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so nervous?\" You say airily. Yukimaru and Revya are walking back to you, looking kind of disappointed. Guess they couldn't find a bus or something else that would take them to Daniel. Your eyes shift after Yukimaru and Revya sit on a bench to a poster. You read it slowly, your eyes widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanted: Mesa Chateau, Cascade Range AC. Notorious for destroying the last tram rail to Samna Rapids, as well as terrorizing the roads to said city. Reward: $1,000,000, Dead or Alive. Preferably deactivated.\" You turn to her and she looks away, her body shaking. \"Mesa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" she hisses, \"I don't want my name to be heard!\" In fact, you can tell. Two or three rough-looking bounty hunters glance in your direction, hands at their rifles and pistols. Revya and Yukimaru appear to be on guard as they chat lightly, eyes unmoving from the bounty hunters. \"I went berserk! This is one of those crazy things Urd made me do one day. She unlocked my Seraph form and implanted a rogue AI, which promptly took control of me and devastated the rail system and roads to Samna Rapids. I think she saw the box of chocolates Yukimaru had at one point and knew it from somewhere. Maybe she didn't want competition, I don't know! But now, I'm utterly hated by the entire populous of Daniel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch her miserable tone of despair and feel sympathy for her predicament. But you had a nagging question. \"So, it was you that made the bus make a wrong turn and die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, yes! Maybe if I hadn't, it wouldn't have been a problem. But instead, I panicked! I knew exactly what they were going to do if we arrived in DAniel and they saw me...I fired an electromagnetic pulse at the engine, frying the wires and the plugs. It messed up the GPS. I knew it bought me time, but I hated it. I can't help it now. You probably hate me...and so does Revya, probably, due to the fact that she has really good hearing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed. Revya had picked her massive body off  the reinforced steel bench, waddling over to Mesa. She put her hand on the android's shoulder, who was silently crying, her broad, mechanical shoulders shaking uncontrollably. Now you felt really bad. She must've been expecting that you were going to shout at her, turn her in to the burly looking guys at the end of the street, and laugh at her as she was beaten into a synthetic-bloody mess. Part of that was along the lines you were thinking. You also place your hand on her shoulder, knowing that while what she had done was considered treachery, what you were thinking of doing to her was much worse. She hadn't hurt you or Yukimaru. In fact, with the worst circumstances imaginable, she might've died for you because you set her free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesa.\" Revya's voice was soft, motherly. She put a tender hand to Mesa's wet cheek, wiping away her tears. \"It's all right. I understand. There's no reason for you to worry that I'd hate you. We've been friends for the longest of times, and to think that I would hate you over something like that is just silly. You'd have to destroy an entire world before I hated you.\" She hugged Mesa's mechanical body, kissing her on the head. You then speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesa, I'm sorry too. I know I sounded...accusing and I'm sorry I did. If you wanted to hurt me and Yukimaru, you would've done it long ago. At least now I know why you hated Urd so much...\" you say apologetically. You're kind of awkward with apologies, never one to start something and never one to hurt somebody. However, Mesa takes it in kind and hugs your legs, the only part that she can reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" she says, before standing bolt upright. She sees Yukimaru giving her a 'Look out!' glance, and notices that the group of bounty hunters is coming closer, drawing their weapons.  Mesa motions for you to stand back, but oddly enough only you. Yukimaru takes a stance behind her and draws a couple kunai, hiding them from view. Revya's gripping that wicked blade you saw on her before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, lookie here!\" One of them says, putting a rifle up to Mesa's forehead. She doesn't even blink. \"Mesa Chateau, the unstoppable machine-woman. Basically, a demigod of artificial creation. You destroyed our lines about six months ago. Remember that? Well now, we're here to pay you back a hundredfold. You ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two snicker. He seems to have practiced that speech at least a thousand times before Mesa arrived. Mesa simply brushes the gun away from her face with her right hand, her left one sliding out. You notice it's got sharper finger tips, is dark grey with red wrists and arms, and has two barrels poking out of the bottom, underneath the hand. Come to think of it, she looks like she grew about six inches, too. \"I don't suggest you do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why not? I heard you earlier! It seems the oh-so-scary Mesa is just a whiny bitch!\" Little beams of light erupt from the barrels, producing two very long, very thin, and very deadly-looking blades of energy. \"You know what? I think killing you will be the easiest job I've ever-urk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesa had punched him in the gut. <b>ZASH.</b> And the blades came around. They sliced the rifle in half and took off his trigger finger, the gored through his left arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah! AH!\" he yells, pulling back. A hole as big around as a gun barrel is gaping in his arm, the inside seared and smelling of burnt flesh. The foul odor drenches your nostrils. \"What the hell? Nobody told us about hidden laser blades!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Mesa. Her hood has fallen off, revealing...a new, rounded head. It's oval in shape, with a pointed chin and a large flair rising from the top. The blue eyes are burning. Once broad shoulders are now narrow, sleeker looking. She has two enormous jetpack-like wings. Her body is now rounder, sleeker, more refined...like a jet fighter. And most of all, she's emitting a very, VERY disturbing aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now listen here, you little shits. The next time you fuck with me, I promise you, I will rend you from the inside out and stuff your entrails down your throat. I'm the second most hardcore asskicker in the entire world, and if you piss with me, I'll castrate you with rusty nails.\" They were very frightened, the leader now looking at Mesa with eyes as big as dinner plates and a gaping mouth. Then he snapped back, thinking of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...if you're the second most hardcore asskicker, who's the first?\" he asks insolently, standing up. Mesa points behind her to Revya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs. \"This fatass? What she going to do, sit on me? Make me into a barbecue sandwich? That's rich!\" He stopped immediately. Something was very wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL DID YOU SAY, NUMBNUTS?\" Gig roars, his silver-haired, red-eyed visage popping out. \"SHE MAY BE A GODDAMNED FATASS, BUT THAT BREAKS IT! NO FUCKING LITTLE PIECE OF RAT SHIT IS GOING TO TELL REVYA SHE'S A FATASS UNLESS IT'S ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy must've wet his pants. He runs away screaming like a little girl, two friends in tow. Gig settles down, fuming at Revya's side. She kisses him on the cheek, not lovingly, but in a thankful sort of way. \"Thanks, Gig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Those little peons were pissing me off. They deserve it. I think I made the leader shit his pants.\"<br>\r\nHe laughs, then you laugh, then Mesa...pretty soon the entire group is laughing at the mention of that. Gig eventually stops and vanishes, probably back into Revya's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now where to? They probably won't tell anybody. Let's see...there's a buffet, a tourist center...oh! There's a mall here...and the state fair!\" You say, running down a tour guide that you bought. The three girls put their heads together and think, eventually deciding on...</span></div></div>",

The tour guide gives it 4 stars and it says its equipped for larger people like Yukimaru and Revya.  The four of you started to walk down the street to JJ's.  Other bounty hunters give Mesa the evil eye, but none of them are getting close to your group...possibly, they witnessed what happened to the other bounty hunters that got too close.  You spot JJ's Bar and Grill and its a huge building, even big enough for Yukimaru and Revya to enter. <br>\r\n                      JJ's is a busy place and it has several obese people in it--one or two are more obese than Yukimaru and Revya put together!  You wait to be seated and look around the place.  You don't see anybody you know--but there's another Officer Jenny that's half as big as Yukimaru.  Just how many Officer Jennys were there?  You ask Yukimaru that.<br>\r\n                         \"I don't even think they know\" chuckled Yukimaru.  <br>\r\n                         \"There's about 10,000 of them....how do they tell each other apart, I don't know\" said Gig.  <br>\r\n                        The Officer Jenny looks like the one Jenny you saw back at Milky Way Mall....bigger, of course and was being served by none other than Brock.  You chuckle at that, as a greeter comes over to seat you.  The four of you are taken at a booth specially made for people as big as Yukimaru and Revya.  The greeter is a green-haired beauty with medium-sized breasts and an unusually fat ass.  You can't help but stare at the greeter's ass as she walks away.  You don't even hear her say that a waiter will be at your table in a few minutes.  Yukimaru bops you on the head as soon as she finds out what you're looking at.<br>\r\n                         \"If you like big butts, I'd be happy to sit on you\" said Yukimaru. <br>\r\n                          \"Um....yeah, sorry about that\" you say.  <br>\r\n                          Reyva snickers, along with Gig and Mesa.<br>\r\n                        In a few minutes, the waiter comes along.  The waiter is a male human with red hair and blue eyes.  The nametag on his uniform says \"Dennis\".   Dennis gives all of you a menu (jumbo-sized menus for Yukimaru and Revya) and asks if anyone wants drinks.  After the drinks had been ordered, Dennis left the table.  <br>\r\n                          JJ's Bar and Grill featured what they call an \"Endless Buffet\" where you can keep on eating as much as you want--or able to hold in your stomach.  Yukimaru and Revya both ordered the buffet, as well as anyone else at the table.  You're starving too, seeing as you hadn't eaten since the.....boy, you don't remember the last time you ate, actually.  You're looking forward to chowing down on some ribs and chicken.   <br>\r\n                  JJ's also featured live music and an \"open-mic\" night...which was later that very night  The band that was playing right now were finishing up a set, and said that they would be back in 15 minutes to take requests.<br>\r\n                    Yukimaru and Revya inhaled their food, while the rest of you ate slowly with your meals.  As time went on, you notice you were getting a little obese yourself...though nothing compared with Yukimaru and Revya.  <br>\r\n                         </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You've gained about 100lbs since you began eating, and you now feel like you're about to explode. You slam the fork down and stretch, unencumbered by your fattened body. Mesa is taking it at a little faster pace than you, not nearly enough to outeat Revya and Yukimaru, but enough to make a normal person gain about 300lbs. You look at her body questioningly, wondering why she wasn't gaining anything. Voicing the question, she smiles a little, blushing at Revya's gorging form, then replying to your query.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in my other forms an excess of energy is created, caused by calorific intake. In this 'Seraph' form, I use up far more energy than I can replenish, and therefore I have to eat a feast's worth of food before my generator has an excess of energy, which is stored in my generator's condenser cap. That's why I'm eating so much...although not nearly as much as Revya-chan...\" she explains, blushing as Revya and Yukimaru pile on the bounds, beginning to take up more room in the seat. \"Also, because I'm not human, I don't gain weight unless I'm in human form, and even that has its limit of about 250 before I revert back to the form you're most familiar with: Basic. The more energy I store by impacts or eating or even just shocks the higher tier I go to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Yukimaru reached over to Revya's plate and stole a handful of fries out of her hands, swallowing the greasy food without much effort at all. Revya was looking at her with a very pouty/mad expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You stole my fries!\" she said, leaning against Yukimaru with an intent to squash her. She snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. So what're you going to do about it, zam?\" Revya took a couple of ribs from Yukimaru's plate, stuck them in her mouth, then slowly dragged them out while sucking on the ribs. They were both stripped of all their meat. \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you going to do about it, fatty?\" she challenged, bumping her with her massive side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple: I challenge you to an eating contest! Whoever eats the most without fainting wins! Mesa can help you. I'll just call an ice maiden for me. Steven-san's kinda knocked out right about now, zam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on! Mesa, get on the table. I want you to stuff my face until I say stop. Got it?\" she asked Mesa. She eagerly agreed and hopped on the table, taking a handful of Revya's food in each hand. She was about to be the feeder of a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ton-chan!\" Yukimaru calls, and a very beautiful(and chubby) ice maiden appears out of nowhere, with long, lavender hair and skin paler than moonlight. She takes up a place next to Yukimaru, getting ready to stuff her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your mark...\" Yukimaru begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get set...\" Revya adds, leaning over to give Mesa a better chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO!\" They both yell, and Mesa And Ton-chan begin stuffing their respective leaders. <br>\r\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = <br>\r\nIt's about two hours into it, and people are actually stopping to watch the two girls gorge themselves. Revya is a little behind, but it appears that she's smarter. Yukimaru was worried about not eating enough, and as such had Ton-chan feed her massive amounts of food at one time, stuffing her at a very quick pace but also cutting her endurance short. At this point, Yukimaru weighs about a ton and Revya about 1800lbs. The redhead is taking it calmly, eating a ton but at the same time pacing herself. Yukimaru is an eating machine, but is wearing down, her belly getting filled much, much quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had enough yet?\" Revya teases, watching Yukimaru start to sweat, struggling to continue eating those massive amounts that she loves so much. You hear her belly gurgle and moan, the space in it getting completely filled to capacity. She's biting her lip, holding her sore tummy, chewing through another plate of ribs. Revya motions for Mesa to pick up the pace, who does it happily, beginning to just stuff her face full of the fattening, greasy treats. Yukimaru looks sick, staring at them. Her face is paler than normal, her belly is gurgling almost constantly now, and she reaches for a large slice of ham when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe falls face first onto the table, moaning in pain as her belly reaches its limit. Revya smiles in triumph. \"I win!\" she chants, patting Yukimaru on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, cheer up! Ton-chan could probably give you a good belly massage to ease the pain. Speaking of that, Mesa, could you do that for me? My stomach's starting to hurt something awful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Revya-chan!\" Mesa snuggled deep into her love's fat tummy, giving it a full body massage. She really had no shame. You simply gawk at the amount of food they had eaten. How much was this going to cost?</span></div></div>",

The other patrons had watched the two girls gorge themsleves, and a few had cheered when Revya won.  Dennis the waiter comes back and tells you that anybody who could eat the entire buffet doesn't owe a thing, so you're very happy that you don't have to spend hours cleaning up dishes to pay for your bill.  Ton-chan was still giving Yukimaru a belly massage.  You would like to give her a belly massage, but you weigh around 300 pounds now...and you feel sleepy yourself.  Yukimaru lifted her head off of the table, and rub her belly as much as she could.  <br>\r\n                \"I thought you said you had a bottomless stomach\" you say.  <br>\r\n                \"I thought so myself\" said Yukimaru.  <br>\r\n                  Revya and Yukimaru could hardly move by themsleves due to the extra weight  on their frames.  Luckily, JJ's had two massive cranes in case they had to move patrons that had become too fat to move.  The two cranes sent Yukimaru and Revya to a back room of JJ's where people of their size can sleep off a huge meal.  You snuggle up next to Yukimaru's fat and quickly fall to sleep...having a full belly always made you sleepy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n==============<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             You wake up to find yourself on Yukimaru's massive belly.  You wonder how you got up on that fleshy mattress when you see Ton-chan the ice maiden next to you.  She must've carried you.  \"Thanks\" you say and snuggle deeper into the belly of the fat ninja.  Yukimaru and Revya sleep through the rest of the day and most of the night.  Meanwhile, you and the other smaller people gave massages to your fat lovers, making them groan in their sleep.  As you massage Yukimaru, it feels like you're kneading a hunk of soft dough than a massive belly, which you enjoy.  You can't help yourself from slipping into Yukimaru's cavernous cleavage and play with her breasts at one point.  <br>\r\n                             After a long while, Yukimaru woke up when you were kissing her flabby cheek.  She smiled at you and you smile back.  Hours later, Revya wakes up and looks over at Yukimaru and you, who are making out.<br>\r\n                          \"Get a room you two\" laughs Revya, causing her great big belly to shake.  <br>\r\n                            After some time, Yukimaru and Revya leave JJ's.  <br>\r\n                             \"So....what now?\" asked Gig.<br>\r\n                            \"Well, we can't find a taxi to Samna Rapids, zam\" said Yukimaru.  \"I suggest we walk there.  It's only two miles...and we could lose a little weight\"  Yukimaru and Revya laugh at this.  Yukimaru and Revya had lost a good 100 pounds after a day without eating...but 100 less pounds wasn't that noticeable on their gigantic frames.<br>\r\n                            <br>\r\n                         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           </span></div></div>",

However as you're enjoying the calmness of the moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" You pause for a moment, hearing a feminine voice call over to you. Turning around you come to lay eyes on a blonde woman wearing a strange garb that was donned with old world japanese runes on it's center, her head was crowned with a frilly hat that was plastered with japanese talismens and also seemed to have pointed ears on both sides indicating that animal like ears were beneath them. Even stranger was that there were 9 fox like tails sprouting from behind her. Although, she wasn't nearly as 'full figured' as neither Yukimaru nor Revya, this fox girl was fairly generous in curves. \"I'm sorry to bother you but...\" The fox woman seems to be fidgeting a bit a look of unease on her delicate face. \"Can I ask for your help, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the woman's voice soon alerts the attention of Yukimaru and the others seated near you, as they too turn to see the fox tailed stranger standing nearby. Yukimaru is the first to speak up \"And who might you be, zam\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry I forgot to introduce myself,\" The woman apologizes as she bows politely and proceeds to state her name. \"My name is Ran Yakumo, I am the Shikigami to one, Yukari Yakumo, the Gap Youkai.\" A Shikigami? Those are something you don't hear of everyday...or at all for that matter. However, the word 'Shikigami' did sound to be japanese in origin. So perhaps Ran was some species of Fox demon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gap Youkai, the hell's that?\" Gig questioned \"Or a better question would be, what the hell are you, there aren't alot of people around here calling themselves Shikigami, hell I'd be surprised if there was a person who called themselves one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Shikigami is merely a servant, or a familiar if you will, of a magician in Japanese mythos\" Ran explained to Gig, as well as he rest of you who also didn't have a clue on what the word meant. \"As for what a Gap Youkai is, it is...difficult to explain, but all you really need to know is that Yukari is a very powerful being.\" Ran pauses as she looks away for a moment, possibly out of embarrasement due to her not having much information on her supposed master's vital stats. Ran then returns her gaze onto you as she speaks once more. \"So do you think you can help me, there's a reward for you if you manage to aid me\"</span></div></div>",

Well, it shouldn't hurt to help out someone who seems so polite at first glance, doubly so now that you realize that this woman is some manner of beast, more then she was human. \"Uhm, okay what do you need?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, thank you, my mistress Yukari sent me over her to retrieve you\" Ran explained \"You see there's a certain errand she needs to run and she believes that you would be most useful to said errand\" Strange, someone you didn't even know finds you interesting? Well, it's not completely unbelieveable, after all alot of people in your travels up to this point have thought about you as such. But still you weren't going to just pack up and go with this fox-girl, you had to make sure it was okay with the others; namely Yukimaru. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it okay if I go with her,\" You ask to your girlfriend \"If you don't think I should then I'll stay here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she does seem like she needs your help, zam\" \"But, what is all of this for certainly there's a motive for all of this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mistress needs his assitance to move a couple of things,\" Ran explained \"She told me she needed an able bodied male and soon caught sight of you after which she told me to come retrieve you and...here we are now.\" That seems like it's understandable, but it still didn't explain why this Yukari needed you in partiular to move something, if anything she could have chosen anyone in this entire area. \"And yes, I know you wondering why she would choose you, in fact I wondered that myself and asked her...she simply told me that she found you 'interesting'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up slightly and think on the matter, it does sound rather reasonable. Although the part where Yukari found you interesting doesn't really sit well with you that much, is that really any reason to turn down helping a someone in need? Thinking nothing of it, you shrug and face Ran \"Alright let's go, I'm sure it shouldn't be too much trouble to help\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Ran nods a small smile on her face as she turns to your group and bows to show her apologizes, perhaps more to Yukimaru then to the others. \"This won't be long, please excuse us.\" She then motions you to follow, which you comply to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten bucks says that he'll get screwed over the minute he leaves\" Gig interjected as you left the group behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music has started back up now, and the sun was beginning to set lower in the sky now, did Yukari really need you so badly that she chose to send for you at night? Well there is the valid assumption that she only say you just now and suddenly decided that you were the one who was to help her with her tasks. The walk is silent at best, being neither you nor Ran exchange words with one another that is before the kitsune decides to break the ice a little with a simple question. \"I didn't catch you name earlier,\" She spoke as she glances over her shoulder \"Do you mind telling me what it is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's Steven\" You answer casually to which Ran nods and goes back to navigating you to where she and Yukari had sat. Before long you come to a table that holds two plates that were cleaned of their contents, it would appear that this is where Ran and Yukari had their meal, however, the one thing missing is Ran's supposed mistress; Yukari who is noweher to be found. You look to Ran who seems to be just as puzzled (if not even more so) than you are at the mysterious disappearance of Yukari. \"Ran...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know where she could have gone\" Ran remarks as if knowing what you were going to ask of her. \"This is common for Yukari, but to just disappear like this...\" Ran seems especially nervous about her mistress' supposed disappearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could still find her right?\" You inquire \"Do you know where she could have gone off to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With Yukari there's no telling...she comes and goes as she pleases, even I, who has served her for hundreds of years on end, can't fully predict where she'll go unless I go with her...\" Ran answers in a mutter as she turns to aplogize before you notice a sudden change in her expression; one that reflects pure shock. Needless to say your a bit concearned about this and turn to see a purple rip that floats in the middle of the air the endings of said rip donned with red ribbions. Before you can even think on what to say, or do a gloved hand rockets from with the confines of the dimensional gap, grabs you by the colar and drags you inside with unworldly force. Immedieatly you start to panic and struggle to get free from whom ever grabbed you but you soon realize that the hand that had grappled you earlier is no longer around your shirt collor nor is there anyone around you to pull you in...What the hell's going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon realize that you seem to be floating in a never ending void composed of nothing but eyes glaring back at you. Everywhere you turn your gaze is only met with the unblinking stares of the eyes that now surround you. Each one watching your every move. It's so...creepy, and unnerving to be here, yet you still have no clue as to why, or even how, you got here. Wait...where's Ran, maybe she knows! You turn around but you see no one beside, behind or in front of you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...the hell's going on\" You mumble to yourself, now at a complete loss as to what you're going to do now. Hell any sane person would feel the same way at this point. As you sat by still trying to figure out how you ended up here, an ominous giggle echoes from the far reaches of this creepy void. Was someone here? Could it be Ran? No, for some reason you don't think that's Ran for one thing that doesn't sound like her voice. You pull yourself together getting yourself ready for whatever it is that's approaching you when the visage of a woman suddenly appears floating by your left side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, so you must be the human I saw earlier~\" She muses causing you to jump and whirl around to face her. As soon as you lay eyes on her, the first thing you realize is that she's absolutely gorgeous, having long blonde hair that reaches down to her back, several ends of it tied in small red ribbons, the top of her head is covered in a weird hat that is donned with frills along it's edges and a large red bow in it's center. The restof this woman's attire consists of a purple dress that hugs her every curve from the large and copious bosoms that were pressing the chest are to it's very limits, to her lushcious hips and thighs. Strangely she also seems to carry with her a parasol of some sort, now why she would need such a thing in a place like this is more than baffling...but then again you ARE in a void filled with eyes...so perhaps it is that strange. The mysterious woman opens a small fan that she holds and hides her face behind it as she begins eyeing you up and down, pacing around you as if sizing you up for something. \"Yes...you'll do nicely, I'll have to thank Ran once she finds us~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just mentioned Ran, so does that mean that she's the 'Yukari Yakumo' she told you about earlier? One way to find out. \"Are you, Yukari Yakumo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hm, that's me\" Yukari answered closing her fan shut and slipping it in a dimensional rip in the air. You take quick note of that gap in the air and notice it looks familiar to the one you were pulled into, albeit smaller than the one you remember. But as you are about to ask Yukari about this, you spot Ran trotting up from behind Yukari's position, and it seems she's been running for quite some time as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, I...*pant*...managed to catch up to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it seems,\" Yukari cooed as she turns to Ran \"Oh and good work on bringing this human to me, he definetly could have the potential\" Potential? Fore what? None of this is making any sense and it was starting to get to you none the less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could someone tell me what the hell's going on!\" You practically shout in frustration towards the large bosomed Yukari who turns to face your words. \"Were you the one who pulled me in, what do you need me for and what's this about me having the potential for something?\" The void falls silent as none of these uestions were answered, which only pisses you off even more. As you open you mouth to further expand on your frustration Ran suddenly cuts in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry,\" The kitsune spoke up even though you directed the barrage of questions to Yukari. \"I didn't realize Yukari would be this...assertive with her actions, please forgive-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Ran, allow me to explain my actions.\" Yukari then remarks abruptly \"After all, he deserves a right to know, especially if he's going to lose his humanity of it\" Okay that last part pretty much sent you for a loop, what did she mean 'lose your humanity'? All of a sudden none of the above questions you mentioned seemed to matter all you wanted now was to get back to Yukimaru and the others...at least then you wouldn't have to worry about losing your humanity...</span></div></div>",

You sigh in exasperation and decide to address her on a calmer note. \"Just...tell me what it is you want with me, or rather what you plan to do with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari looks to you and nods \"Well, you see, I need you for more than one reason; First, I've had this theory so far that a normal human can become a Shikigami if I can somehow manipulate the boundry between Human and Beast, you seemed to have remarkable potential being you've survived through alot of rather interesting ordeals up to this point.\" The youkai woman chuckles with a smile. That last part could only be justified by her having been watching you the entire time, which is impossible there's no way she could have had her eye on you that long...or could she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lastly, I need another Shikigami to accompany me on a certain journey we have to embark to a place called the <i><b>Monad Abyss</b></i>\" Yukari explained, pacing around you as she did so. \"While Ran also has her own Shikigami, Chen Yakumo, she does not wish for her to accompany us into the Abyss being it is quite dangerous\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know, the '<i>Go in and never return alive</i>' kind of dangerous.\" Yukari answered in a playfully nonchalant tone as she shrugged slightly. It's amazing how she can speak so lightly of this, but then again she made it sound like this <i>Monad Abyss</i> place was nothing more but a cliche. \"But, believe me, it's for a noble cause, if we don't go there soon Erebus will wreck havoc on this world, and pretty much destroy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Erebus...\" You pause a moment as you beign to peice together the clues Yukari dropped off in her explanation earlier. \"Wait...don't tell me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hm, he's you're typical <i>Sealed evil in a tin can</i>~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's just great, you can't go two feet without running into some impending cataclysm, but still there could be a way out of all this, Yukari did say that normal humans could become Shikigami so that meant you weren't the only candidate for this, you just happened to be the best possible option. \"...Does it really have to be me? I mean can't someone else do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could find someone else, but they must be spiritually aware to have the potential to become a Shikigami, and you can probably understand how hard it is to find someone like that.\" Yukari remarked \"Still, if you do not wish to do this, then that's fine, I won't force you into doing something you don't want, of course if the world ends because we couldn't find a new Shikigami to accompany us to <i>Monad Abyss</i> then you can be sure that it'll be all your fault~\" That's playing dirty Yukari, but then again she proved a painful point, they did come to you after all...so if anyone else is to do this then it had to be you. Still, Yukari did say you could decline if you wanted, there was an off chance they would fail and the world would inevitably end but you could still decline none the less.</span></div></div>",

If you declined you ran the risk of endangering the very existance of this world as you knew it and you really didn't like how it seemed like Yukari was putting you on the spot for this decision, what with her saying that last bit before shutting up, but that still didn't change the situation that much. You remain silent for another few minutes before giving Yukari eye contact \"What will happen when all this is over?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari frowns a bit as she puts her finger on her chin in a thoughtful pose. \"Hm, can't say, Erebus has never had a hissy fit before thus no one can say what will happen when we actually do beat him-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that. I meant will you return me to the way I was\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari gives you the same answer, only in a different light. \"Again, I'm still not sure, I've never manipulate a human before into becoming a youkai-like being, whether it's permanent or not we'll have to see when this is over\" She steps closer to you, apparently a little impatient with your questions. \"So, are you going to accept or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMight as well take this in stride. \"Fine, I'll accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spelndid~\" Yukari mused as she clapped her fan shut and walked towards you with a cheerful (yet slightly unsettling) smile on her face. \"Now, this may sting a little~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, was this going to hurt? By the time you even try to ponder on if it did, you feel your body being thrown into chaos as every aspect of your being is being twisted and manipulated to the wills of Yukari. You gasp out in pain as you glance at your hands feeling like someone was tearing them apart...yet upon seeing them, they looked completely normal. Along with this pain comes a strange sensation as all of your humanoid sense are amplified to a beastial level; your eyesight is sharpened, your hearing increases, your sense of smell is heightened and you can pratically feel your muscles growing large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it would appear that although everything about you has been enhanced your still losing conciousness, the last thing you hear is the concearned voice of Ran which you can barely make out before passing out completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh my head...\" You moan as your sense kick back into high gear, your vision slowly returning to you as well. You look around and notice you're no longer in that creepy void, although the intial location you're in is still just as weird; the sky is a bloody shade of crimson, and the landscape looks craggy and barren with various ruins scattered about. Was this Monad Abyss? You look down at your hands again and notice that your nails have slightly sharpened, and you can also feel that you now have fangs that replace your human teeth. It looks like Yukari really did turn you into a beast, albeit a humanoid one as your palms lack the fur of one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around but don't see Yukari nor Ran in the area, although you do lay eyes on a green haird woman clad in a long, form fitting dress of the same color, her bust line just as bountiful (if not even moreso) than Yukari's. She also has a set of horns on her head, with a red ribbion tied onto the right one, and a busy green tail. She doesn't seem to have noticed you as she appears to be looking around for something, perhaps she was looking for Yukari as well, it was unlikely, but it's worth asking her. </span></div></div>",

You pull yourself up from the barren ground walk towards the woman who glances over her shoulder the moment you get close enough to her. \"Uhm, hey do you know where Yukari went off too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari?\" The horned woman says before perking up as if realizing something important \"I'm not sure, the only thing I know of is that she came here dropped you off and then went back into the gap she popped out of...matter of fact she was the one who pulled me here in the first place.\" Hmm, no dice, although you're a bit disappointed you somehow were still expecting to be let down in someway. \"Oh, I'm Keine Kamishirasawa by the way, and who may I ask are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven.\" You answer casually to her question. Keine seemed rather nice, she didn't seem to have this strange aura around her like Yukari did, which is a good thing now that you're in a place that looks pretty unforgiving. \"So...are you in the same boat as me?\" You question, the vagueness of it causing Keine to tilt her head in confusion. \"I was turned into a Shikigami but Yukari, did she do the same thing to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Keine answers as she looks down \"I...I've always been like this...\" Why did she sound so ashamed of her answer, was there any reason for her to dislike who she was? \"Well, I don't <i>always</i> look like this, being I have a human form\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're half?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that...\" Keine answered flatly \"I'm a Were-Hakutaku, so I change into this form when it's a full moon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the sky and notice it's not a full moon, hell, there is NO moon to speak of, it's just a crimson void above you, no clouds, no stars no nothing. Needless to say this confuses you being according to Keine, there needs to be a full moon for her to be in this form. \"But...there's no full moon out...or a moon for that matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" \"I'm not sure why, or how, but this area can forcibly change anyone who sets foot here into a monster...\" Interesting, it looks like those who have a demon side to them has it forced out, but what about you, you felt fine. It is then you realize you were already a monster; Yukari just turned you into one. So was that transformation not only away to get you to help Yukari but also a subtle way to protect you from the Abyss' effects on humans? There's no telling...especially with Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around once more and still see no sign of Yukari or Ran. Where the hell were they anyways? They were the ones who hassled you here, why would they disappear like this. You sigh and feast your eyes on the road ahead; a long snaking path that leads to and ominous looking building that was perched atop a formidable crag. You could go on with Keine and save you the trouble of waiting for Yukari, but your rational side told you to simply sit tight and wait for them.</span></div></div>",

However, as she's looking onward, there comes an inhuman sound from behind you, followed by some rather heavy foot steps that only seem to get closer to you and Keine's location. You turn your head behind you and see something in the distance...something that's definetly not of this world...well maybe it was but you're damn sure it wouldn't belong in your own world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what <i>is</i> that thing?\" Keine asks in both concearn and worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know!\" Was all you can tell her, although you can tell it was some sort of reptile, being it looked closer to one than anything else. It was fairly large, bigger than a bus you estimate, and didn' have arms. It's legs were bulky and think, which would explain why they made such a loud sound with each step the monster took. One thing you also note is that the creature didn't have eyes either which only made it's appearance all the more creepy to you. The bi-pedal monstrosity halts and straightens up, before it's head turns directly toward you and Keine. Did it spot you? How could it, it didn't even have eyes to see with. The monster then proceeds to let loose the <i>most</i> gut wrenching, ear splitting roar you have ever heard as it charges forward it's mouth open wide letting you get a good glimpse at it's horrendously sharpened teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be your cue to run.

Turning on your heel you instinctively grapple Keine's arm and dash forward, taking the hakutaku with you in an incredible burst of speed. Was it just you, or were you alot fast than you were before? Well Yukari did turn you into a supernatrual being so it's possible. You glance back to Keine who's trying to keep up as best she could with out stumbling and further behind her is that reptilian beast that is hot on your trail, and actually gaining on you at that. Damn so much for being faster...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven-kun! Up ahead!\" Keine alerted to you bring your attention to the building you were rushing towards, the door wasn't open, but it didn't look like the monster was going to fit. If it's solid enough it may stop it in it's tracks...if not then you better hope it get's knocked out on impact.However, what you're more concearned about is if the door is even unlocked, well either way you had to get through it, and sense you're already running at a pretty high speed, you see no other choice but to ram your way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready Keine! We're gonna bust through the door!\" You yell toward Keine who nods and braces herself as best she could for the coming impact. You really had no idea if the door was actually gonna give if you ran at it full force, but with big ugly riding on your ass you had no real choice, lest you wanted to die a horrible bloody death in this empty red world. You take in a deep breath as the closed doors draw closer and closer by the second. There's no turning back now, it's do or die time! You bring your shoulder down and with everything you've got, you slam into the closed doors of the building a loud CRASH thundering into the air as you collided with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise (and relief) the doors actually gave in to your charge and you find yourself tumbling into the building with Keine in tow, both of your bodies intertwined in a chaotic dance as you free fall into, what appears to be, a sinkhole inside the main room building. With a low and dull THUD you hit your back on the not so soft floor the weight of Keine's body also landing on you full force. Thankfully, she isn't very heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze...that hurt more than i expected...\" You groan to yourself as your gaze moves up to see the monster couldn't fit through the door and was relenlessly lashing out against it to get to you, it's loud and bone chilling cries resonating throughout the vacant room of the building you and Keine were inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, we have to go.\" Keine points out as she pulls herself up from off you and helps you up. \"That monster is stayed for now, but I doubt the walls will hold him for long, this building is several centuries old and if anything a tireless assualt like this will surely bring it down.\" You don't argue with Keine's suggestion and look for away out; You come to spot an exit to this room just to your east, you had no idea where it led to or what was beyond it but you didn't want to stay here. Not for another minute. You motion for Keine to follow and make a run for the exit not even taking the time to look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the beast seems to have died down some, or at least you may have gotten so far off from it that it could no longer be heard. The latter is the best assumption seeing as to how you and Keine had been running down this hallway (it seemed) for a good long while now, and it seemed to take even longer for you to reach a small chamber that connected to the hallway you escaped through. Both of you, now exhausted from non-stop running, sat down for a moment to rest, Keine her self plopping down against the wall her bountiful chest heaving up and down with each breath she drew in. \"Did...we...lose it...\" She gasped out turning to see that you too we against the wall catching your breathe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...so...I don't...hear it...anymore...\" You look around and see that there are multiple exits to the chamber but no more than 2 at that; one veering north and another veering east. But for right now it's best to take a moment to rest a bit, and rid yourself of any fatiuges you may have. If there was something like that monster on the outside of this place then there was no telling what this area had in store for you and Keine. You sigh and sit down across from Keine and watch her as she attempts to relax her shaken nerves, her eyes closed and her breathing now slowing down to a balanced and calm pace.</span></div></div>",

Hm, she must be fairly strong to have become the latter. But one thing seems to strike your interest the most...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gensokyo?\" You echo that foreign word as a means to elict her to elaborate on it, you know it's her homeland, but what is it about Gensokyo that's so dangerous to humans?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gensokyo, is a land full of beings called, <i>Youkai</i>, which are also the ones who devour humans.\" Keine explained. \"Gensokyo was actually a barren land before, until various priests and priestesses gathered to seal the many spiritual beings of Japan into the land so they would not harm humans any longer, the resulting seal covered the entire land in a barrier called the Hakurei Border and it is this border that has managed to seal 'Gensokyo' from the world in which humans of the mordern world live.\" So, if you understand correctly, Gensokyo is a land that was sealed off by priests and such to get rid of countless Youkai that plauged ancient Japan. When the sealing was completed the land became isolated from the outside world, creating it's own seperate 'world' if you will. It's...rather hard to grasp, but I think you get the gist of what it means.\" At least now you know that the reason Keine protects the humans is because the Youkai most likely out number them in Gensoyko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah that's...interesting.\" You comment, before moving on to another topic one that should be a bit less, meta-worldly. \"So, Yukari chose you for this thing too, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, Yukari told me that she needed my ability of History manipulation to help 'seal' Erebus\" Keine replied. \"What about you, how did she come to choose you, Steven?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's rather odd...she told me that I had the potential to become another Shikigami for her to enter the Monad Abyss, she even went so far as to turn me into some kind of beast to make me her Shikigami.\" You recall how she just pulled you from the resturant...and Yukimaru. Was it really the right choice to make in accepting her offer? You still asked yourself this question but all the answers remained unknown to you. \"But, now that I stop and think about it, I'm not sure if she actually plans to use me as a Shikigami...I feel like that there's something else she wants to do with me, but I can't figure out what exactly.\" You concluded looking at your hands to see your sharpened nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari does work in mysterious ways, perhaps she wished to transform you so that she could see how a transformed human would fair in the Abyss?\" Keine explained which actually made sense, although the fact of you being used as someone's lab rat isn't really a comforting thought. \"She'll probably reveal everything when the time comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...I just want to get all of this over with.\" You answer looking around for a moment and noticing how quiet it has gotten since you arrived here. You begin to wonder how strong this Erebus really is. Hell, if he's strong enough to destroy this world, and the universe along with it, then you'll be facing something that has all the powers of a God. Can you really fight and defeat something like that? More over...can you <i>survive</i> a fight with something like that. \"Keine...do you think...we'll actually be able to beat Erebus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...not sure,\" The teacher shrugged. \"Yukari said my powers would be able to help in sealing him, but while I'm in my Hakutaku form, I can only <i>create</i> history, not erase it.\" Whether it can help beat Erebus or not, that's still a fairly powerful ability within itself, having the power to create history at will...you can't really imagine what it would be like to have such a power. \"If we can not defeat Erebus, then I'm sure Yukari could help defeat him, she wouldn't send us on an impossible mission that she knew we couldn't accomplish.\" Keine concluded, trying to end her sentence on a positive note of things. Things weren't really looking too good if one were to sit down and observe the situation in full, for one you had no way of knowing on how you can actually get to Erebus, and even then the both of you are lacking food and other supplies as well. If there were any wildlife here you could probably kill something and eat it but what if it were poisonous? Then you and Keine would really be screwed...you only hope that Yukari would return with supplies and food...that's really what matters on this excursion. Luckily you aren't that hungry, and Keine appears to be fine as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you have a point there, she did seem pretty anxious to stop Erebus when I met her and Ran...\" You nod weakly and continue to look around the area, noticing how odd it is for this cavern to look like the inside of a hotel, albeit a ruined and twisted one. In anycase, there doesn't seem to be any real reason to stick around, and you feel you and Keine have rested up enough to move on deeper into Monad, there's only one tunnel headed to the south so that should be the next path you take. \"Well...shall we move on now?\" You ask to Keine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we won't get anywhere closer to Erebus sitting around here.\" She replied with a nod as she got and the two of you began down the tunnel, or rather, hallway of this strange hotel esque cavern. You had no idea as to why it was shaped like this...it was actually somewhat creepy in away. Keine also seems to take note of the strange surroundings as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...odd that a cavern would have such a strange architecture to it...\" She remarked looking around the area as she walked. You glance over and open your mouth to answer when you notice her copious bosom bouncing softly within her form fitting green dress. You tear your gaze away from Keine's breasts and focus on responding to her, after all you already had a girlfriend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I noticed that too,\" You add \"I guess you could say these are some type of ruins.\" Which, now that you think about it, makes a bit of sense. Perhaps Monad Abyss used to be a paradise for some ancient race that was wiped out when Erebus came along? Who knows, maybe the answer to that was located somewhere within this abyss alongside Erebus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I never thought of it that way before.\" Keine says taking a look at the walls before she noticed a branching path up ahead and promptly alerts you about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...this is just great...\" You complain a bit knowing that you had no idea as to where you should go. One path seemed to keep straigh while another looked as though it headed west. </span></div></div>",

Turning around, you notice Revya drooling at the sight of the riders that had gotten off the bus, her massive stomach rumbling deeply for sustenance. Mesa appears to be not too worried, and actually seems to be waiting for her to jump at the potential prey. You, on the other hand, are now a little afraid, for what if the redhead decided to turn on you? Yukimaru appears to have the same exact thoughts as you, as she shuffles to your side and whispers into your ear. \"We need to find a restaurant and soon, zam. Miss Revya seems to have a bigger appetite than most people. Enough to EAT other people if they're not careful, zam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" You scan the streets for a single taqueria, a single sushi shop with haste, as the sound of Revya's belly growling gets louder and louder with every minute that passes. Eventually you manage to spot a small restaurant tucked into the corner of the end of the street and grab Yukimaru's hand, dashing over to it. The warrior and Mesa follow, the much larger girl almost following by scent alone. Reaching the restaurant and opening the door, you find that it is fairly small, meant for only a hundred or so people, and that there are a TON of waitresses, all scantily clad in two piece bathing suits, all from different games, and all fairly fat. You quickly run up to the service counter. \"Uh, excuse me miss, I would like a table for four, please...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs at you. \"Customers' total weight, combined total weight, must be over 600lbs. If not, we can't offer you service...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRevya suddenly pops in, the door bell chiming. The attendant raises an eyebrow and realizes that she might be the third member of the party, and the fourth one was not far behind. Standing on the scale in front of the counter, she sees that the total weight exceeds the limit, even without the fourth member. You sweat profusely, hoping that Revya doesn't go and start to eat the entire restaurant. \"I see. Well, let me see if a server is available...yes, Furi is, and Kuri is your waitress, and if you will wait about a minute they'll be up here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're chewing on your lip, tasting the fresh droplets of blood as you count down the seconds. Revya's looking hungrier and hungrier, and the girl behind the counter looked mighty tasty to her...</span></div></div>",

You see Cassandra's house on that high hill that you saw earlier with dark clouds over it in the sky.  Yukimaru is still with you--in fact, you're standing on her vast stomach overlooking the house of Cassandra and the surrounding countryside.  You then realize that Yukimaru is growing to epic size!  Soon, the house and all other things on the ground is covered by Yukimaru's fat as she gets ever bigger and fatter.  In a few minutes, Yukimaru even outgrows the entire Earth!  That's when a hand grabs you from under you and pulls you into Yukimaru's flab!  You yell for help, but your mouth is covered by a second hand and before you knew it, you were sinking in Yukimaru's flabby stomach!  You find yourself in a large chamber of some kind;  not exactly a stomach and not exactly a normal room either. You aren't alone in the room.   \"Hello there, I'm Cassandra\" <br>\r\n                  Cassandra was worthy of worship.  She was without a doubt the most beautiful woman you ever saw.  She had blue hair and silvery eyes that seem to pierce right through you!  Her demonic features (hoofs, tail, wings) didn't make her unattractive;  in fact, it made her the sexiest woman you ever saw!  You found yourself bowing to her without another thought. <br>\r\n                     \"You must be the mortal that wandered into my magical woods\" said Cassandra, her voice dripping honey.  It was all you could do not to get on your hands and knees and prostrate in front of her. She chuckles at your struggles.<br>\r\n                      \"I am Cassandra Von Fel Lyaniak\" said Cassandra.  \"I own the house you saw before entering this world.  I see you're making friends also.  Sorry for not coming to you sooner, but I was rather busy with other affairs\"<br>\r\n                                  \"What do you want?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                                  Cassandra gets closer to you and kisses you on the cheek. It was nothing but a quick peck, but you feel a stirring in your pants.  <br>\r\n                        \"I want your body in me\" she whispered directly into your ear.  \"I want to feel you struggle within my stomach and beg to be let out.  I want you to utterly worship me.  I want you to be my sex slave and have sex with me every night until your dying day.  But I can't do that\" here, she leans away from your ear and starts pacing up and down the room.  \"you see, normally I would offer you a way out of this world and return to your own world...for a price.   But now, it seems, that I need your help instead\"<br>\r\n                         \"With what?\" you ask.  <br>\r\n                         \"We'll get to that later\" said Cassandra, waving her arms dismissively.   \"Ordinary, I would have one of my servants to do this task.  But the Big Boss Lady wants you to help me....I have no idea why either.  She likes to keeps secrets from me..\"<br>\r\n                 \"Big Boss Lady?\" you ask faintly.  <br>\r\n                     \"The Boss of hell\" said Cassandra matter-of-factly.  <br>\r\n                      \"You mean Lucifer?!\" <br>\r\n                       \"Lucifer?

You just stop for a minute and see that men are being grabbed off the street and dragged to various houses, so you decide to move on and continue down the highway.   Every few miles down the highway, you see rest stops or another small town.   The desert keeps going on and on and so does the highway.  Other cars and trucks are traveling up and down the highway along with you;  you see a truck for \"Binford Tools\"  and one for \"Weight Gain 4000\", and another one for \"Acme\".   <br>\r\n         Around 40 minutes later, you noticed that you are the only person on the highway.

About 50 or so cars are at the Welcome Center and you get off your cycle and enter the  building.  The lobby of the Welcome Center is filled with fat people around 200 pounds.  You walk up to the desk with a very fat woman behind it.<br>\r\n        \"Welcome to Fat County\" said the woman behind the desk. \"you're new here, so read this\"  She hands you a booklet.   \"enjoy your stay\"<br>\r\n          You look over the booklet and make a startling discovery.  It seems that this county is called Fat County for a reason.  There's some magic in this entire county that makes people who live in it fat!    \"For every month you're in Fat County, you'll gain 200 pounds\" you read aloud as you take a seat on a bench.  <br>\r\n          200 pounds in a month?!   You'll weigh around 2,400 pounds  at the end of the year!   Can this really be possible?!  You read more of the booklet.  Fat County is 100 square miles in each direction and contains 30 small cities and one major city called \"Fatopia\".   The booklet also shows you some interesting facts about the county and tourists stops.     One of the tourist stops is a mountain range that's actually 10 mountain-sized women all in a row!   <br>\r\n         \"Geez!\" you say.  <br>\r\n         </span></div></div>",

Carpet suddenly veered around in a ninety degree turn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carpet, what's going on?\" Aladdin exclaimed, hopping off his mat of a companion. Taking a glance to the side, Aladdin noticed that the entire great room had been covered up with a vast chain of crimson curtains, \"That's odd... did Jasmine hire painters?\" Aladdin scratched his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe throne room was completely devoid of people- even the palace guards. Aladdin stiffened as he called out, \"Hello? Is anybody home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Aladdin could start to suspect an ill spell or villain behind the strange conditions, the curtains began to soar to the ceiling, revealing the great room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SURPRISE!\" thundered the entire room before breaking into a lively applause. It was full of both people and food from all over the land and from as many worlds imaginable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin could see handfuls of famous faces in every glance. Both the Simpsons and the Griffins were in the house, his eye caught Kagome wrapped around Inuyasha and Sango throwing a fist against Miroku in the distance. Not to mention Souta and TK running around. Sora had reunited with Kairi in the hubbub. The Weekenders were there hanging out with Trunks. Even an enormous 700 pound Officer Jenny had managed to make it to the celebration, squeezed into her police uniform. He noticed Sadira, the girl who claimed to be a sand witch that had a crush on him, in the crowd- she was smiling, which made him blush. Lady Cassandra was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, at the front of them all was Jasmine, <br>\r\nshooting her boyfriend a wink, \"All for you, birthday boy,\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee...

And then, Jasmine started to get fat and in a big hurry. Jasmine's belly got bigger and bigger and still bigger...and so did her butt, thighs, and face. All of the guests at the party quickly moved out of the way when Jasmine's fat rolls reached 'em. Jasmine still got fatter until she filled the entire room with nothing but her flab. Jenny is pinned agaist the wall, and you are sandwiched between Jenny and Jasmine's flab. Still, Jasmine still grew fatter and bigger until the wall behind Jenny gave way and fall away. Jasmine soon outgrew the entire palace...leaving you and Jenny trapped within a roll of her fat. You feel like you're going to die from suffocation as your stale air runs out. <br>\r\n\"Jenny, I'm gonna die..\" you say to the officer breathlessly.<br>\r\nSuddeny, the two of you are teleported out of Jasmine's flab and out of Argabah itself. <br>\r\n\"Thanks, Genie\" said Jenny. <br>\r\nYou look at the gigantic Jasmine, who took up at least half of Argabah and thankfully she had stopped getting bigger and fatter.<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" said the pikachu that was Ash. <br>\r\n\"I think that puts an end to the duel\" said Jenny. <br>\r\nJasmine's dress is just a tiny little thing that covered her massive breasts. Her butt is the size of a small city, although she didn't cover all of Argabah,<br>\r\nKairi farted again, and her butt grew a bit. <br>\r\n\"Will you stop farting?\" asked Sora. <br>\r\n\"Can't help it\" said Kairi. \"why? are you saying that you don't like my bigger butt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you and Jenny hug each other again which is very squishy, and you're in real danger of sinking into her flab. <br>\r\n\"Want to get out of here and go to a more private place?\" asked Jenny. \"you're a good kisser\"<br>\r\nWhen Jenny had kissed you earlier. your entire head went into her mouth and it was VERY wet. <br>\r\n\"Um...I'll like to stay here for a while, if you don't mind\" you say. \"I hardly had anything to eat when the duel broke out\"<br>\r\n\"No problem\" said Jenny. \"I'm still hungry myself.

Squirming out and glaring at Jasmine's immense frame, Sadira was now determined to win this magical duel and she knew how. \"Be glad you're so big Jasmine, because your time being it has ran out.\" she spoke with a hint of malice in her voice. Using her own magic on herself, Sadira felt herself changing and growing into something more monstrous. She grew claws on her fingers, spikes on her back and her legs began to merge together, forming a snake-like body. Wanting her counter-attack to be a surprise, Sadira dug into the sand and vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile on the outer part of the city, you, Officer Jenny and everyone wandered down to check on Jasmine who was so large, her head alone couldn't see beyond her mountainous breasts and belly which were planted on top of destroyed buildings. She tried to look for her friends, but she couldn't. \"Hey, guys, where are you?\" she called in a garbled voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer calls were unanswered, but not unheard. Genie used his magic to create a floating rock-like piece that allowed them to view Jasmine. It was made big to have enough Officer Jenny on top of and still had room for you and the others. \"Sorry everyone, if I ruined the party.\" she said embarrassingly. You and the others forgave her instead of Ash who was a Pikachu and Aladdin who's party was destroyed. \"Hello! Party-goers!\" said a distant voice who sounded very familiar. Looking down, you saw Ren and Stimpy down on the ground. \"Gee, Ren, are you sure the party was here?\" asked Stimpy. \"Shut up, I know where I'm going.\" snapped Ren. \"Hey, Ren! Stimpy!\" you called. \"Did you hear that? Someone's calling us.\" said Ren. \"Hey, Genie, could you?\" you asked. Using his magic, Genie transported Ren and Stimpy up your location. \"Cool, Ren, we're flying.\" said Stimpy. \"Hey, you're right. This is kind of cool.\" said Ren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they on the same rock as you and everyone, Stimpy asked, \"Are we late for the party?\" \"The party's been destroyed.\" Aladdin said as he pointed to Jasmine. Looking at her, Stimpy spoke, \"Whoa. She's amazing.\" Jasmine giggled and said, \"Thank you.\" \"She's also the reason my party's up in smoke.\" Aladdin said, \"I was enjoying the food buffet before she and Sadira had their duel.\" Ren smacked him in the face and said, \"Ah, quit your whining. At least you got to have your party. We just got here and no cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, let's not fight anymore.\" you said, \"We're all here and Genie can just wish the palace back to normal, right?\" \"I can, but it might take a while.\" Genie said. \"Besides, at least, the duel is over now, right?\" asked Officer Jenny. Unfortunately, she was wrong. VERY, VERY wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn even bigger, more threatening earthquake began to rumble. You and everyone couldn't feel as you were in the air, but Jasmine could. It was so powerful, that she was jiggling like jell-o. If Aladdin wasn't mad at her right now, he'd be enjoying himself right now. Then from right behind Jasmine, a giant cat-like head broke from the sand and as it rose from under the sand, its body was becoming bigger and bigger. When it completely rose from the ground, it bellowed in a deep feminine voice, \"TIME TO FINISH THIS!!!\" Jasmine tried to see what was happening, but she couldn't. If she would, she would feel fear like none she'd felt before. Behind her was a huge creature that dwarfed her in both weight and height. It was 400 feet tall and 1,000 feet around. Its snake-like body was 300 feet thick with spikes, while its human-like stomach was 100 feet wide and 90 feet in front of it. But was its upper body that made everyone realize who it was. The creature's upper body had breasts the size of blimps and cat-like head was 100 feet big. Add the destroyed ragged clothes that it wore which has tentacles made of cloth-like bandages, everyone yelled, \"SADIRA?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, everyone. I'm back to finish the duel.\" she spoke. Placing her head down on top of Jasmine's, her jaws grabbed hold of her immobile prey and she began to feast. Genie moved everyone to safety, but as he tried to stop Sadira from eating Jasmine, he found his magic had no effect. He, too, fled with his life. Everyone watched in both terror and awe as the once finished duel continued. \"Well, that's a way to finish a duel.\" Officer Jenny told you. You agreed, although you didn't want to be in Jasmine's flab right now. \"Now this is a party.\" cheered Ren. \"You said it, pal.\" Stimpy agreed. \"Maybe she can change me back into my human self.\" Ash thought. Sadira was engulfing every piece of Jasmine she could stomach. Her flab, her magic, it was delicious. As her jaws stretched like a python's to encircle Jasmine's immense waist, she wanted to chew a little bit just to get some revenge on her for crushing her. Her flabby arms tried to struggle, but they were too bloated to move. As her legs entered the mouth, Sadira delivered the final part. Getting her legs into the right spot, she began to chew softly so they could go down easier. As Jasmine's feet entered her throat, she closed her mouth and watched her stomach bloat out. With her as the victor, Sadira patted her stomach with honor and soon after...</span></div></div>",

Her stomach still remained its incredible size until Sadira reached her normal size....in which case, her belly returned to a bloated state (but still much smaller than it should've been).  You and the others slowly returned to the party site, which was completely destroyed.  All that was left in the rubble was the smiling Sadira with a 10 feet wide belly.  Muffled screams and curses were coming from Sadira's belly.   You feel sorry for Jasmine, but the others seem indifferent to Jasmine's plight.  You then asked if Officer Jenny if she could arrest Sadira for murder--for surely Jasmine would be digested in Sadira's stomach.<br>\r\n                 \"You must be new here\" laughed Jenny. <br>\r\n                    Genie was going around and restoring the ruined parts of the city, which would take some time even for him.  The damage was extreme indeed. You and Jenny go to a secluded area to talk.  Jenny explained that nobody ever dies in this world, even humans who find themselves in this world.  While humans were in this world, the physical laws of the world now applied to them as well.  You didn't believe it.....would anyone? <br>\r\n                     \"I can prove it to you if you want\" said Jenny.  <br>\r\n                      \"By eating me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                     \"Well....I could crush you\" said Jenny.  \"you'll be fine\"  she quickly says when she sees the look on your face.<br>\r\n                     Before you can fully answer, a shout arose from the party guests.  \"It's Cassandra!\"<br>\r\n                  You look around and see a carbon-copy of Morrigan from Darkstalkers. Cassandra had arrived in a chariot which was pulled by what looked like wolves the size of horses.  She got off the chariot and surveyed the area.  Genie had restored most of the damage, but there were a few buildings that were crushed to rubble.  Sadira was now talking to Meg Griffin...the Griffins had arrived just after Cassandra did.   Cassandra herself was wearing clothes that were so skintight that they looked to be painted on her slim and sexy body.  Cassandra was being accompanied by a human with red hair.   Your eyes are glued to Cassandra and instantly your head fills up with sexual thoughts and....<br>\r\n             \"Hey, are you even listening to me?!\" asked Jenny.  You turn around to see Jenny.  <br>\r\n             \"Sorry\" you say.  \"It's just that I can't look away from Cassandra\"       <br>\r\n               \"Cassandra has that effect on all males\" said Jenny.  \"she puts out an aura that lures every man in the area to her....makes it so that none of us women get.....hey!\" <br>\r\n             For you had turned your head and returned looking at Cassandra.   Cassandra was being greeted by everyone at the body, and she talked to nearly everyone that talked to her.  The red-headed man that came with Cassandra was talking to Aladdin.   You didn't notice when Jenny lifted you up  until she was dangling you over her open mouth.<br>\r\n             \"Jenny?!\" you nearly  shout.<br>\r\n             \"Ah, I thought that might get your attention\" laughed Jenny.  \"What do you say we ditch this party and go have some fun? I never did it with a human before\"<br>\r\n            \"I kinda wanted to go meet Cassandra\" you say nervously as Jenny sets you back down.<br>\r\n             \"You can do that later\" said Jenny.  \"we're not gonna leave.  We're just gonna find a nice quiet area.  With a palace this big, I'm sure we'll be able to find something\"<br>\r\n           \"Alright\" you say.  <br>\r\n          \"Good to hear\" said Jenny.<br>\r\n           \"Did what?\" you ask.  \"we're not gonna..\"<br>\r\n           \"If you're up for it\" said Jenny in a husky voice.<br>\r\n           You and Jenny manage to leave without anybody noticing.  Cassandra was far too busy talking to Peter Griffin.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"This looks like a cozy room\" said Jenny.<br>\r\n                You and Jenny wander through the palace for a good ten minutes before finding a private room.  The bed of the room was quite large.  The room had a balcony that looked over Argabah's southern end.  Jenny walks to the middle of the room and sits down, causing the whole floor to shake a little.  She motions for you to come over and you do.  <br>\r\n                </span></div></div>",

Right after that happens, there's a knock at the door and Souta waddles over to answer it. At the door are two ladies holding big suitcases. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are your new clothes\" said one of the ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweet!\" said Souta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new clothes that you and Souta get are like circus tents, but they fit reasonably well around your fat self. You and Souta walk out of the room after you two get dressed and head for the tour bus. You're still learning how to walk with your bigger girth, but you're able to walk. You wonder if the Fat Mountains can still walk if they're so big. You and Souta enter the tour bus, which is filled with anime and cartoon characters. The Powerpuff Girls are all in a row, and so are all the Ewoks from that old cartoon in the '80's. All of the people on the tour bus are fat as you are, so it looks like they've been in Fat County for a month too. <br>\r\nYou and Souta take a seat next to the last row of seats. You take the pamplet of the Fat Mountains away from Souta and read more about those 10 women.<br>\r\nWhat you find slightly startles you; There's only one road past the Fat Mountains and that's through one of the stomachs of the 10 women! There's actually a road in the stomach of each women and the road goes right through them...like a sick and twisted version of a mountain tunnel. You're not too sure about traveling in the stomach of someone, but you'll cross that bridge later. You read on and find out that 1,500 people a year climb at least one of the Fat Mountains. 24 people have died trying to climb, and 3 people sunk into the flab of Officer Jenny and was never seen again...although, there are stories that the 3 people are still living within Jenny's flab. <br>\r\nThe booklet also has pictures of someone on the \"summit\" and looking at the surrounding landscape. It's quite a view! <br>\r\n\"Okay, ladies and gentlemen\" said the driver, getting onto the bus. The driver was Genie from Aladdin, wearing what a bus driver would wear. The Genie had a strong Brooklyn accent. \"we're gonna go to the Fat Mountains, and we're coming back here. Any who wish to drive past the Fat Mountains, there's another tour bus that'll take you to Mt. Delia and points beyond. Enjoy the ride\" </span></div></div>",

A cartoon fish booed. You saw Tai from Digimon start a protest chant. It was getting pretty hectic in there. And then you felt a tugging on your shirt from the window seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and see Souta staring up at you, blushing, \"Uhhh... Steve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting the crowd, you sigh, \"...What's going on, Souta?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Steve, I've... gotta go!

I'm seriously got to spring a leak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eye the chaotic crowd nervously. Well, maybe if you two can break through to the front and stop the bus for a while, everyone will calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we're going in!\" you say as you grab Souta's wrist and try to plow your way through the crowd. It's tough because you can barely fit through the aisles as is. But luckily, when you push through, others either move or are forced out of your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now pass by the front few rows, \"Hehehe, look at the fat tourists,\" giggles a purple haired girl, \"Hey there, shoebie,\" Reggie Rocket smiled, giving Souta's large gut a poke. He was blushing now, but for a different reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I think we're up here for a different reason,\" you whisper as you walk up to the driver's seat, \"Hey, listen, can you pull over? ... We have a little emergency...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emergency?!?\" Genie cried, erupting into a large siren that flashed red lights through a dimmed bus, \"Where? Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab him by the collar even though he's driving and bellow in his ear, \"I mean to say Souta here needs to take a leak!\" ... wow, maybe the atmosphere is making you behave more cartoonish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie slams on the brakes and suddenly opens the door for you and Souta. You follow him out just so you can get a breath of fresh air... plus, you're so wide, Souta really can't make it out unless you get out first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he strayed off behind a wide array of trees, you hear Genie make a goofy remark, and the crowd starts yelling and shaking the bus. Suddenly, it speeds off behind you, without you. Great...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you hear Souta call, \"Hey!</span></div></div>",

You look closer and realize that Souta is holding a deck of cards! And not just ANY deck of cards; these look to be the cards from Yu-Gi-Oh! The first card is none other than the Dark Magician Girl! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would leave these behind?\" you ask aloud, as you and Souta look through the deck of nearly three dozen cards. One of the cards has an \"Exit\" sign on it and nothing else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" said Souta. \"hey, where did the bus go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It left without us\" you say. \"it was getting pretty ugly in there...I guess they couldn't wait any longer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phooey\" said Souta. \"well, what now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" you say. \"maybe look for the owner of these cards\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like an execellent idea\" saids a cool female voice from behind the pair of you.

You are caught up in Souta's fat, but not by much...you manage to wiggle out of the folds of fat. Souta still grows, bursting out of the shack and uprooting trees. He continues to grow bigger and fatter until he's about 200 feet tall! You're somewhere on Souta's massive belly. You're still holding the polka-dot mushroom that you picked up from before.<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" said Souta's booming voice. \"all that with just a nibble\" </span></div></div>",

Then, Souta becomes fatter, and he starts to get taller. In under a minute, he's towering over you! You are pushed to the wall by Souta's fat belly. Soon, Souta fills up the basement and he bursts out of the shack and continues to grow taller and fatter. You're trapped within Souta's blubbery fat...the air is breathable, but its growing stale. If you don't get out of Souta's fat now, you could suffocate! Having little choice, you start to \"swim\" in the blubber. The blubber is very yielding, allowing you to move quite easily. You have no idea just how big Souta will get...as big as a mountain, you guess. The great rumbling coming from within the blubber around you gets louder and louder as Souta grows even bigger and fatter. Ten minutes later, you finally emerge from Souta's flab, and gasp. At this point, Souta has grown into a virtual mountain...many thousands of feet up...perhaps even ten thousand feet up! You're near Souta's head. You know that because you see his hair somewhere above you. Souta's clothes had long ago been ripped apart, so he's now naked. The rumbling in Souta's stomach keeps going for five-six minutes, and then it stops. You have a great view....and you see the Fat Mountains. In fact, Jenny waves at the new mountain of fat...Souta waves back. <br>\r\n\"SOUTA!\" you yell as loud as you can, hoping he can hear you. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It took Mai's skin a full five minutes to melt away, to reveal what looked like Morrigan from those Darkstalkers games. The Morrigan look-alike had blue hair and silver eyes, which causes the illusion that she has no pupils. She still had the big belly, and she smiles at Souta. Souta seems to be smitten with the demonic woman. After a minute of looking at each other, Souta bows down to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who're you?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Cassandra\" answered Souta. \"she's a..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a succubus\" said Cassandra, turning her attention to you.

Try as you might, you can't turn your head away from her...you can't even blink your eyes. But you no longer care if you can't turn your head...or blink. All you care about is Cassandra herself. You seem to be drowning in her eyes, and you couldn't give a damn about it. Then, the spell over you and Souta seems to lift. You blink several times, and Souta got up from his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm usually good at disgusing myself\" said Cassandra. \"but not today, it seems.

And now, you're stuck here....that is, until you pay a price to me to let you out of this world.

You may be in another dimension, but you still find that a little odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you run into the big star himself.<br>\r\n\"Hey watch it\" Buster said. \"Oh my god, Buster Bunny ?\" you ask amazed. \"In the flesh\" he proclaims. Even in college Buster look mainly the same as before, just taller.<br>\r\n\"Wow, Buster I am a big fan\" you tell him. \"Always nice to meet one, wow, wicked gut man!\" Buster points out.<br>\r\n\"Heh thanks, you look pretty good to\" you compliment. \"Yeah, being big isn't for everyone....just for most\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, loud stomping shakes the ground. \"What is that ?\" you ask getting back up. \"My girlfriend\" Buster smiled.<br>\r\nFinally appearing on the scene, the one, the only \"Babs Bunny!\".<br>\r\n\"Hey Buster\" Babs said giving him a huge hug. Though you can see that everything about Babs is huge. She is big, even bigger than that time when she gorged on carrot cakes as Super Babs(Even though she can actually move this time). All that fat has even made her taller than Buster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she puts him down, the two look over at you. \"Wow, Buster and Babs Bunny\" you say. \"No relation\" they remind.<br>\r\n\"So who's your new friend Buster ?\" Babs asked. \"My name is Steven, and\" you are interrupted by the bell ringing. \"Whoops, we gotta get to class\" Buster said. \"I have no idea where I'm supposed to go\" you realize. \"You should come to our class\" Babs suggests. \"Okay\" you accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the class, you sit across from Buster and Babs. You also notice that Babs required three chairs to sit in.<br>\r\nNow the teacher showed up. You reognize her as a plump Lola Bunny. \"Hello class\" she said. \"Hello Ms. Bunny\" the students all respond. \"Today's lesson will be on........\".</span></div></div>",

Pressing you up against her enormous squishy belly. It actually felt kinda good.<br>\r\n\"After that, just do what comes natural\" she said. The class was probably thinking \"Duh, we already know this\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola then lifted you up on top of her belly. Still not letting go, she shoved your feet into her wide maw. Licking your feet with her tongue, you couldn't help but laugh. Taking her first swallow, your feet quickly moved to the back of her throat. As your legs continued to disappear, you could feel her throat muscles firmly grasp them.<br>\r\nAlso, even after seeing this before, the class never did get bored with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola opened her mouth a little wider to take in your hips.

You were too, a little, but you were still alert in the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after swallowing your chest, only your head and arms remained outside. You looked down at Lola, and she smiled at you. You smiled too, until she licked over your face. She then swallowed again and took in your head. Once inside her mouth, you could hear her making Mmm-ing noises outside. She then slurped up your arms like noodles, and gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly descened, and landed inside her belly with a plop. That made her belly jiggle outside.<br>\r\n\"Well, now that he's inside, we can keep going, Steven! Can you hear me ?\" she called out. \"I can hear you Lola, what's next ?\" you ask. \"Do you see a little red light ?\" she asked back. You look around. It's a little darker inside a belly, but you soon see something glowing on the stomach wall. \"What is that ?\" you ask aloud. \"It's a special gland that controls the secretion a digestive acids, if someone wishes for their meal to live, this gland will become visible, just press it\" Lola explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou steadily move closer, and lightly touch the gland. <br>\r\nNothing happens. \"That's it ?\" you ask. \"That's it\" Lola said. Smiling you just lie down on your back and relax. You are greatful of your safety, though a little disappointed that you'll miss the next show.</span></div></div>",

Each of your foot steps makes a squishy noise.<br>\r\nIt got darker, as you strayed further and further from the glowing gland. However, you seen spy many multicolored lights ahead. You quickened your pace, and soon found yourself in the prescence of legends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire Looney Toons crew !<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all dancing and partying their butts off. Also, you noticed that above them was a working multicolored disco ball. The fact that is was working, you didn't put much thought into it. A few hours ago, you were just trying to fix your busted car, and now you were face with famous cartoon characters, and in the belly of one of them.<br>\r\nUpon forgeting the laws of physics, was when a few of the toons noticed you. \"Hey guys, looks like Lola swallowed another one\" Bugs informed. Some of them came over to greet you. Bugs pulled out a carrot and spoke his classic line \"Eh *crunch* what's up doc ?\". \"Oh not much\" you couldn't think of anything else to say. \"So, what brings you to scenic Lola Bunny ?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"I didn't take a left turn in that creepy forest\" you answered. \"I thought that joke went, I didn't take that left turn at Albuquerque\" said a confused Sylvester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, my name is Steven, so how did you all end up here ?\" you asked. \"I accidentally called Lola doll\" Bugs admitted. That was kinda shocking. Next you turned to Daffy \"After the kids pulled a fast on me, I was drenched in barbaque sauce, and that was that\". You wiped off some saliva he sprayed on you \"I see\".<br>\r\nAfter him was Sylvester \"Hey don't look at me, I got here following him\". He pointed up to Tweety, who said \"I thought this was a good hiding spot\".<br>\r\nNext in the group was Porky \"I was j-j-j-j-just eating an apple, and Lola walked by once it got st-stu-st-stu-caught in my mouth\".<br>\r\n\"The point is, even though were all in here, were making the most of it\" Bugs said reffering to the party.<br>\r\nThey headed back, and Bugs said \"Come on Steven, we've got chips, dip, soda, pizza, stereo, satellite TV\". Still not questioning any of this, you decide to roll with it.</span></div></div>",

This is a sample of some of the questions they were to answer:  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n    1.  How do you eat a person?  <br>\r\n             A. Whole and Alive<br>\r\n            B.  Deep fried <br>\r\n           C.  Skinless<br>\r\n          <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     2.  How do you perfer you food?<br>\r\n            A. Willingly eaten<br>\r\n           B. Kicking and Screaming<br>\r\n         C.  Cooked over a roasting fire<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     And so on.   Lola looked over everyone, making sure that everyone was taking the test.  Lola just spotted someone who wasn't doing thier test!  It was that stuck-up boy billionaire, Montana Max.  Lola came waddling over to Max, who was preparing to shoot a spitwad over at Babs Bunny.   Lola grabbed him by the throat and picked him up. <br>\r\n           \"You better do the test in the next five minutes, or you're gonna take a field trip to my stomach\"  The test should be about half-over by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         In Lola's cavernous stomach, the party is going on swimmingly.  You're dancing with Taz (who was tricked to enter Lola's mouth by Bugs)  and he turns out to be great at breakdancing (no surprise there).   You're utterly amazed at the size of Lola's stomach.  This breaks all the laws in psyscics..but then, Lola never studied law.  You wonder if all toon characters have this in common...and its a safe bet that they do.   Lola's stomach is quite warm and comfortable  \"Like Pismo Beach, without all the calms I can eat\" says Bugs.   You don't care if you get out of Lola's stomach or not; you're having a great time in here!    <br>\r\n              </span></div></div>",

The best and only thing you should do when you are tired, watch television !<br>\r\nAs everyone gathered around the big screen, you noticed something. A large opening in Lola's belly, a valve to be precise. \"Hmm, it must lead to her intestines\" you figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just when you are about to take your first step, Bugs stops you \"Woah ! Where ya goin mack ?\". \"Uh, that way ?\" you pointed to the exit. \"Are you serious ?

Lola quickly graded them.<br>\r\n\"Alright class, I have the results\" she said. Everyone leaned in.

The mighty Babs picked up the struggling animal torturer and opened her mouth wide and lowered Elmrya into her mouth and swallow her whole!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Tasted like chicken\" said Babs, and everyone laughed along with Babs.   Lola grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n           In the depths of Lola's intestines, you are completely lost.  The Intestinal Labyrinth is filled with twists and turns..and who knows what else!   You hardly believe that Lola is THIS big on the inside!  However, cartoon characters tend to have much bigger insides.  You decide to go with the punches and not worry about it.  If you can't find your way out of Lola, you guess you'd go back to her stomach and watch that big-screen TV with the rest of the Looney Tunes.  The Intestinal Labyrinth has a bad habit of double-backing on itself, making you even more confused.  Each step you take makes a squishy sound.  It would be dark in the intestines, if it wasn't for the lights attached to the ceiling.  Lola seems to have electricty all through her digestive system...which makes you wonder who had installed the electricity.   You come to a T-Section, which makes you pause.  There's no T-Sections in normal intestines...of course,  this isn't a normal situation!  You're walking in the intestines of a cartoon character!  You take a right at the T-Section and come to several booths.  One booth is selling T-Shirts that says \"I was eaten alive by Lola Bunny, and All I got was this lousy T-Shirt\", another booth is selling maps to the toon stars' homes!  Still another booth is selling Looney Tune shirts!   You  just chuckle at this amazing sight.  You go on deeper into the intestinal labyrinth. <br>\r\n          You come to another T-Section when you hear two voices on your right.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n        \"Don't blame me, Todd!  I wasn't the one who owned the car that broke down!\"<br>\r\n      \"That car had no buiness breaking down!  I tuned it every other month!\"  said Todd.<br>\r\n       \"Yeah, yeah\"<br>\r\n      \"And who wanted to go to Acme Loon?!\" asked Todd.<br>\r\n      \"And who called Lola 'doll' ?!\"  <br>\r\n        \"Lola IS a doll\" said Todd.  \"she's freaking hot\"<br>\r\n         \"Man, you're talking about a doodle\"<br>\r\n         \"A doodle we're inside of!\" yelled Todd. <br>\r\n        \"Hey, I wanted to hang with Bugs and the others\"  <br>\r\n         \"Well, go ahead\" snapped Todd.  \"If you can find your way back there\" said Todd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          It seems that Lola had eaten people that had the exact same trouble as you did!  Should you go and meet Todd and his friend to the right, or go down the left side? </span></div></div>",

You don't have time to gasp as the Terror Toad's tongue pulls you closer and closer to its open mouth, and before you can blink, you're heading down the Terror Toad's throat!

You turn a corner, and see up ahead that reached an opening of some sort.  You run past the opening, and you notice that the walls of the intestines are bigger and further apart than ever before. You just realized that you've enteted Lola's large intestine...which means that you're heading for the \"exit\" and that can't be that far off....could it?

All you know is that you were getting fatter and fatter with each passing second. You couldn't have gotten bigger than the store could you? Or even the mall for that matter? <br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you find yourself in some sort of jail cell. The cell is probably 20\" x 20\" x 20\" x 20\"....big enough to house at least 6 other people besides you. You wake up on a cot that's a little bit bigger than you are. That's when you notice something odd: You're in your own body that you started with! You haven't got bionic legs or other bionic body parts at all. You look around as you hear some chuckling. The chuckling is coming from....your eyes go wide at this..Urd, from the anime Ah! My Goddess! Urd is wearing a police uniform that shows off her curvy body. You drool at the sight of her.<br>\r\n\"That was some curse you were under\" said Urd. <br>\r\n\"I was cursed?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Yep\" said Urd. \"Haven't you figured it out yet? Well, I leave you to figure out what the curse was by yourself. Now, I'm late for Thor's wild parties\" And with that, Urd vanishes!<br>\r\nYou get up from the cot and headed for the door of the cell..it looks to be unlocked.<br>\r\n\"Hold it, Sonny Jim!\" barks a voice. <br>\r\nYou look around, trying to find the source of the voice. It turns out that the voice is coming from the padlock on the cell door! As you look closer, you can plainly see that the padlock has a face on it! <br>\r\n\"Who're you?\" you ask. \"and where am I?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm Jason Locke\" saids the toon padlock, \"and you're in Springfield Jail\" <br>\r\n\"QUIET DOWN THERE!\" snaps a voice from the opposite side of the hallway. You look to see that it was Sideshow Bob who spoke. Bob returns to the book he was reading: The Joy of Cooking Bart Simpson. <br>\r\n\"How did I end up here?\" you ask Jason.<br>\r\n\"You were dragged here by Jenny\" said Jason. \"and then, the Goddess Urd came and cured you of that curse you had. Shel'ldeon was always a weird one..\"<br>\r\n\"Who's Shel'ldeon?\" you ask. \"and what curse was I under?\"<br>\r\n\"Shel'ldeon's curse\" said Jason. \"made you wake up in another person's body every time you went to sleep. You likely got the curse from sleeping in Shel'ldeon's stolen bed\"<br>\r\n\"Well...I did found a bed\" you say. \"It was in the intestine of Lola Bunny\"<br>\r\n\"Indeed?\" asked Jason, then he burst out laughing. \"Shel'ldeon will never find it then!\"<br>\r\n\"Uh....would you mind letting me go?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: To clear up any confusion, you're still a toon) <br>\r\n\"Can't do that\" said Jason. \"Jenny told me to keep you in here until she returns\"</span></div></div>",

Long cascades of indigo hair descend past his shoulders. His arms are adorned with sleek Arabic looking tattoos.

Average build, nothing to write home about. Not tough looking in the least. You're wearing the typical orange jumpsuit, whereas this guy somehow managed to get a gray tanktop and camaflouge pant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just un-frickin'-believable,\" he shouts, walking back up to his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww... poor Jeor'zel,\" Jazon Locke mocked in a pitful tone, \"Such a harsh, sharp fall from being Lady Cassandra's own lover-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said shut it, Locke!\" the indigo haired Jeor'zel roared, lunging to the padlock with clenched fists, \"Not one word- I swear, if Cassandra hadn't turned you into a hunk of metal and me into this... this animated waif... I would have torn your throat out thirty times over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason Locke whistled, \"Strong words, but I'm metal, you're flesh, and what bangs on me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT IT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-torn your knuckles out AT LEAST thirty times-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT IT!\" he explodes, eyes look ready to kill. He glares at the lock with pure hatred and expels a stream of lock-related expletives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now notice the scars around his fists... he must have been in there longer than you thought. Jeor'zel scowls and resignedly climbs the ladder to his bunk again and picks up the squeaky rubber Cassandra Chronicles, the only literature to find in this entire cell, aside from the newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was an interesting bit of dialogue... you certainly didn't know that about Cassandra. At least she spared at least ONE person she lost interest with to a somewhat menial fate. He starts muttering to himself in a tone that makes you fear for your life... if truth be told, you are the only 'fleshy' person in the cell... and there HAS to be a reason why there was vacancies in this cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bright side, maybe going to bed will make this all better... well, knowing your luck, at least temporarily better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn in your bed and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You fall asleep almost at once. You considered reading the other copies of the \"Cassandra Chronicles\" there were in the cell with you and Jeor'zel...but there were only two other Cassandra Chronicles in the cell; \"Cassandra Chronicles # 45: Dre'asianz, my first love\" and \"# 7: What REALLY happened in the Garden of Eden\". You figure if you would read those books, you would like to start with the first book. Jeor'zel was reading Number 10: \"Hitchhiker's Guide to Hell\". You glanced at the ratty old newspaper before going to sleep. The headline read: \"DRE'ASIANZ SPOTTED!\" But you were too tired to read more. That's when you fell into a deep sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself near a fountain. The fountain is perhaps 30 feet round, and has a stone statue at the center of it. The statue was that of a beautiful woman. The woman was clearly not human, judging by the huge bat-like wings on her back and her other demonic features. Water was flowing out of the statue's open mouth. You look around and see that you're in the center of what looks like a ruined town. The town looks to be deserted. Ivy and moss are growing from the buildings and from the cobblestone road. This place looks to be \"real\"...as in, not a cartoon. You look down at your own body and gasp to see that you're back to your normal self! You aren't a cartoon anymore! But...how did you get here? And where is this place?<br>\r\n\"The town's name is unpronouncable to humans\" said a male voice. You look around to see that an average-sized man is standing beside you. The man looks human, but there's a hint of evil in the depths of his sky-blue eyes. His hair is light purple, and he looks to be as stong as Jeor'zel. At the man's feet, there stood a black cat. <br>\r\n\"Who're you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Call me Drez\" said the man. \"I don't remember my true name. If I did, I wouldn't be stuck here. And he's forbidden to say my true name\" he points at the cat.<br>\r\n\"Where's here?\" you ask. \"I just fell asleep, and I found myself here\"<br>\r\n\"This city was once a city of demons\" said Drez. \"Sleepers tend to come here sometimes...nobody knows why\"<br>\r\n\"City of demons?\" <br>\r\n\"Yep\" said Drez, who smiles and reveals fangs in his mouth! \"The city's name was Tera Jeera....that's not it's true name, but its close enough for you humans to pronounce it\"<br>\r\n\"And why are you stuck here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"That doesn't concern you\" said the cat. It has a male voice, but its oddly high-pitched. <br>\r\n\"And why..?\"<br>\r\n\"You talk too much\" said Drez. \"I don't know why you're here. I didn't summon you here, that's for sure\"<br>\r\n\"I summoned him here\" said a female voice. You look around to see Urd standing there!<br>\r\n\"The Goddess Urd\" said Drez. \"what do we owe this honor?\" <br>\r\n\"The Nameless One\" said Urd, talking to Drez. \"the one demon who can't remember his own name. I summoned the mortal here because he holds the key to your freedom\"<br>\r\nDrez bursts out laughing. \"How could a lowly human set me free?\" <br>\r\n\"I don't know\" said Urd. \"the Big Boss Lady won't tell me...but she did told me that this mortal will set you free\"<br>\r\n\"Big Boss Lady...??\" asks the cat. \"why does she care about a demon like Drez?\" <br>\r\n\"Look, I don't know\" said Urd. \"She doesn't tell me everything....you two figure it out\" With that, Urd is gone. <br>\r\n\"Let's see where you're at\" said Drez, who grabs your hand. In a flash, you see images of the cell you fallen asleep in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeor'zel...?\" asked Drez, letting go of your hand. Then, he laughs. \"how the mighty have fallen. Cassandra must've been really pissed at him\" <br>\r\nBefore you ask what he means, you find yourself waking up. The scence slowly starts to disappear.<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll see you again\" said Drez. \"if you truly hold the key to my freedom, I'm sure we'll meet again\" </span></div></div>",

Ash and Gary were rivals...so what were they doing in each other's company? That's when you notice that the two of you were in a small cage in the middle of the forest. The cage had a large red letter R on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we doing in this cage?!\" shouted Gary angerily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no reponse. Nobody else was around the two of you, it seemed. You also notice that you have no pokeballs at all...and neither does Gary. It seems that Ash and Gary were each captured by Team Rocket and they had stolen thier pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theris add comsa\" muttered Gary...but nothing seemed to happen. \"dammit! My magic is useless in this body...\" Then, he tried to bend the bars of the cage...and it worked. Gary seemed to be much stronger than normal now. Was that because of Jeor'zel's soul was now in Gary's body? The two of you exit the cage and started to walk away from it. The forest you're in is very dense....could this be Viridian Forest? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, we're nowhere near Shel'ld Valley...\" muttered Gary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only way to break the curse is to return Shel'ldeon's bed to him\" said Gary, glaring at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bed is inside Lola\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means that we gotta find Lola..\" said Gary. \"or...do you want to wake up in a different body every day?...I mean, I don't care for this curse, but at least I'm out of that damn cell....\"</span></div></div>",

You sigh and enter the pokemon center.  The center is crammed with people; some are fat, others are skinny as a rail.  The fattest person in the center is none other than Nurse Joy...and her fat was mostly on her rear end.  You look around for Brock, but you don't see him anywhere.  Shrugging, you turn to leave the center.  That's when you bump into something big and soft.  You stumble back and realize you've just bumped into a stomach that's bigger than you are.

The people on Kairi's butt looked to be glued to Kairi's rear.  You were gonna ask her out to dinner, but you change your mind.  You wish her good luck on finding Sora, and you walk out of the pokemon center. Officer Jenny comes along almost at once.   You're amazed that her motorcycle can hold her 700 pounds.  Jenny stops at a red light and looks around to see you.  <br>\r\n               \"Here's your pokemon\" said Jenny, handing you a belt.  <br>\r\n               \"T-t-hanks\" you stammer.<br>\r\n                \"Say, I just went off duty\" said Jenny as you tie your belt around your waist.  \"would you like to join me for dinner?\"<br>\r\n              \"I--I---\" you stammer.  \"yes!\"<br>\r\n               Jenny smiles and pulls her bike off the road, letting traffic go that was behind her.  Jenny gets off her bike. <br>\r\n                  \"You can sit here\" said Jenny, pointing to the spot where she was just sitting.  \"I know of a place where we can go\"<br>\r\n                  \"But...where will you sit?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                  \"I like sitting on people\" said Jenny.  <br>\r\n                  You laugh nervously.  Then shrug and take your seat.  You're a cartoon character, right?  So you won't die if.....   <br>\r\n                          Jenny sits on you before you can finish the thought. You're flattened like a pancake, but you're still alive. Jenny's butt is like dough.  You smile as you feel the bike racing off to dinner. </span></div></div>",

Misty's huge body overshadows the counter as she piles her tray high with chips, seafood, and all kinds of donuts.

You go after him in his wake, trying to grab all the things he missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, Gary's stuffing himself silly so you follow suit, and all the while Misty's devouring things left and right. Your eyes grow wide when you look at her again, her belly is suddenly huge and pushing the table away- she looks like she must weigh 700 pounds at least. Her belly hangs down to the ground and her boobs are huge, pressing tightly against her now tiny yellow tank top.

Both of you keep eating and you soon hiccup, realizing you two are also growing. The chairs beneath you are buckling underneath you growing weight. Your black tee is riding up and your jeans are getting tight. Your massive belly jiggles out in front of you as you pass 400 pounds. Gary seems to be in the same weight range. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow waitresses bring you food as you chow down and keep growing... hopefully you won't outgrow the restaurant, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou outgrow the restaurant...</span></div></div>",

As you three keep eating, you three also get bigger and bigger around the belly and butt...and thighs. The patrons of the restaurant quickly exit before they've been engulfed by the growing girth of you three...but at least one waiter and waitress gets engulfed by soft mounds of fat.  Indeed, the three of you kept getting fatter until you outgrow the entire restaurant!  What once had been a restaurant, now there's three extremely fat people; You, Gary and Misty.  Misty is by far the biggest, easily weighing around 5,500 pounds!  You probably weigh 3,000 pounds and Gary weighs the same as you do.   After the restuarant is gone, the three of you let loose one loud belch.  <br>\r\n     Your black tee rides up on your very wide belly, revealing your deep belly button.  Misty now has a butt the size of a van, and each of her breasts are bigger than beach balls!  Her yellow tank top can barely contain her large breasts.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"I couldn't eat another thing\" you say, patting your huge belly.  <br>\r\n                      \"Me either...\" said Gary.  <br>\r\n                        \"What?\" asked Misty.  \"you mean you're both full?

Officer Jenny looks tiny to the three of you;  Jenny is only 700 pounds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                              \"I thought I had a huge appetite\" said Jenny looking over the three of you.  <br>\r\n                          \"You're not gonna arrest us, are you?\" asks Gary.<br>\r\n                            \"I'm afraid yes\" said Jenny.  \"you just can't go around destroying buildings\"  <br>\r\n                                 \"How are you going to arrest us?\" you ask.  \"we're a lot bigger than you\"<br>\r\n                                At this, Jenny smirked.   \"You know, my uniform has a...shall we say, a slimming effect on me\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                              \"Slimming effect?\" you all ask.   \"Slim\" isn't the word for Jenny!

While I'm wearing this uniform, I'm only 700 pounds...but if I take it off....\"  her voice trails off.  \"well, let me show you the true meaning of being huge\"  She then starts unbuttoning her uniform.  With each button she opens, her weight is easily tripled!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Eh...how much do you weigh?\" you ask.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     \"Find out for yoursleves!\"  saids Jenny, as she opens the very last button on her uniform.  <br>\r\n                       </span></div></div>",

Luckily, Snape isn't looking at you at the moment--looks like he's too busy bullying Neville Longbottom.  You also see--from across the room--a purple-haired Draco Malfoy.  Nobody here seems to be fat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"That's the third time you fell asleep in class\" whispered Harry. \"I thought you said you slept fairly good last night\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Well...\" you start to say.  You then notice that Hermonie isn't there in the room with you two.  \"Where's Hermonie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Before Harry can answer, Snape chose at that moment to stop bullying Neville and address the class at large in his oily voice:  \"Your weight gain potions should be half-way done by now.  This potion needs to stew for a good 10 minutes at this point;  that is, unless you're Longbottom\"  The slythiens in the room chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        You look in front of you and notice a bluish potion sitting in a small cauldron.  The potion is bubbling gently, even though the caldron isn't over a fire.  You look around and see that everybody has the same potion in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Hermonie made a mistake, believe it or not\" whispered Harry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"That's pretty incredible\" you say.  \"what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"She decided to taste test the potion before it was ready\" said Harry.  \"she started to gain weight at an incredible rate.

When he raises his wand, you see that it has become a large candy cane.  Draco looks at his candy-cane wand and curses under his breath.  You can't help but laugh, but then you notice that Draco's arms are becoming...gingerbread?

Cursing under your breath, you spin towards him, \"What was that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so you don't go eat me while I'm not looking.

To your horror, Draco's either asleep or fully a cookie and is unable to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sound crashes dangerously close to you, right by a torch. You see the giant wide shape illuminated in front of you; it's Hermione! She's at least 2,000 pounds but somehow mobile. Her butt almost spans the width of the giant hallway, her massive belly jiggles and bobs to the floor, a big round sphere ripping through her now tiny robes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gingerbread?

You wipe away the red hair that's blocking your view.  You got out of the bed and see that you're non other than Gene Starwind of Outlaw Star!   You're wearing nothing but underwear and you quickly get dressed before hearing a knock at the door.  Not waiting for an answer, the door opens and in steps a purple-haired Jim Hawking.  Exactly why does Jeor'zel keep his hair after going to another dimension?  Jim looks up at you and sighs heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"What?\" you ask.  \"it's not my fault you got cursed along with me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Yeah, yeah\" said Jim.  \"well, let's see what's happening here\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n         The two of you walk to the bridge of the Outlaw Star to find it empty and powered down.  The only light comes from the dashboard which is emitting a faint glow.  You head over to the pilot's seat and see that the glowing is coming from a screen that seems to be the ship's log.  Shrugging, you and Jim decide to listen to the last ship's log.   <br>\r\n                  The last log was filed just 24 hours earlier.  It seemed that the Outlaw Star had wandered into an unexplored region of outer space.  When the Outlaw Star had entered this unknown region of space, all of the women of the Outlaw Star vanished without a trace (Melfina, Aisha and Suzuka), leaving only Jim and Gene behind.  Gilliam was shut down by an unknown force and he has been offline for at least 32 hours.   The screen to the outside no longer works either, and neither does the airlock.  There's no telling what's outside of the ship.  <br>\r\n                     \"We picked one hell of a time to drop in, then\" said Jim.  <br>\r\n                      Suddenly, the whole ship rocked back and forth violently. <br>\r\n                       \"Now what?\" you ask.  \"did we hit something?\"<br>\r\n                        \"No way to tell\" said Jim, working at his station.  \"I can't get anything to work at all....give me a few moments here....\" <br>\r\n                        The ship rocked back and forth again....gentler it seemed this time.<br>\r\n                         \"We have partial sensors now\" said Jim.     <br>\r\n                          You read what the senors say and you blink.  <br>\r\n                         \"What is it?\" asks Jim.<br>\r\n                        \"Well...\" you say slowly.  \"it seems that we were just hit by a soccerball\" <br>\r\n                          \"A soccerball?\" asked Jim.   \"you must be joking!\" <br>\r\n                          \"Are the senors working right?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                         \"It doesn't seem so\" said Jim.  \"there's malfuctions everywhere.

Jenny has a smirk on her face, and the cashier looks to be mad. Your rolls of flab are shrinking down back to normal. In under 15 minutes, you're back down to your regular size and weight. The store is in ruins. All kinds of pills and pieces of wall are scattered on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you those pills were experimental\" said the cashier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did?\" you ask, not remembering if the cashier told you that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay..\" said Jenny. \"You just caused around $2,200 worth of damage...in all, you owe $4,000!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..I have no money!\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should've thought of that before you broke the law\" said Jenny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I'm going to jail?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\" said Jenny, rubbing her stomach. \"and guess what?

Jenny gulps you down. You go down her long and slimy throat until you're forced through a ring of muscle and you end up in a huge chamber that can only be her stomach. You land with a squishy sound and wait to be digested in a matter of seconds. After a minute, you realize you're not digesting. That's when you realize there's someone standing right behind you. You turn around to see Ash in a suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there\" said Ash. \"I'm Ash Ketchum, warden of the Stomach Jail...and how long will you stay in here with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach of Jenny is far more bigger than the outside.

The room does look like it belongs to a man, judging by the messy floor and the faint odor of feces. The bed is a four-poster bed and quite soft. You get out of the bed and turn to face the only mirror in the room. You see none other than Jon Arbuckle looking back at you. You just woke up in the house of Garfield and Odie. You look at the clock on the bedside table: 7:20 AM. You look around the room, but there's no sign of Garfield anywhere...or Odie. You decide to get out of the room and get a bite to eat since it's been a while since you've eaten. Of course, there's not a scrap of food in the entire house...no doubt, Garfield has gotten all of the food. You sigh and get the morning newspaper. The lack of Garfield and Odie is a bit odd, but perhaps the two are off on an adventure.

The cat in question is about the size of a football stadium, and seems to like lasanga and other Itilian food. As the food runs low, citizens flee in terror, fearing they might get eaten by this fat cat. Nobody knows who owns the cat, or how the cat got so big\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha....?!\" you ask.

They stood in front of the werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of my way\" he ordered. \"Now you have to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky ?' Do ya, punk ?\" one of them did a Clint Eastwood impression.<br>\r\nThe wolf was just confused, and a little insulted by this mockery. \"Do you know who I am ?!\" he yelled. \"No, do you know I am ?\" the smallest figure asked. \"No\" he answered. Finally that very individual came into the light, but only because she began to grow.<br>\r\n\"I am, Princess Angelina Contessa Louisa Franchesca Bananna Fanna Bobesca ! The Third !\" the twenty foot tall toon then ate the wolf with her big mouth.<br>\r\n\"It's a toon thing\" she said to the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrunk back to normal size, during which her stomach expanded greatly. She burped, and one of her siblings said \"Nice one\".<br>\r\nThey then turned towards you.<br>\r\nYou by now were suffering from a fandom overload, since you knew who these very famous toons were. \"Wow, you you and you, this is, I mean, I can't even, I I.....\" you faint.<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing he's a fan\" the oldest said.<br>\r\nThe middle child then went to your ear, and released one of his trademark belches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up ! I'm up !\" you awaken to the slight defening.<br>\r\n\"Wow this is just awesome, look, I already know who you are, but could you introduce yourselves\" you request.<br>\r\n\"What do you say sibs ?\" the oldest asks. They nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were the Warner Brothers\" said the first two. \"And the Warner Sister\" the cute fat one added.<br>\r\n\"I'm Yakko,\" he said. \"I'm Wakko,\" he said.<br>\r\nDot then jumps into your arms \"and I'm that really long name I just said, but you can call me Dot, oh and FYI, if you stay on my good side, you won't be on my fat side *burp*\". You then collapse under her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting back up, \"Wow, this is such an honor and....\". You stop and notice something rather strange about your hand.<br>\r\nIt has a penciled outline !<br>\r\n\"How 2-D\" Yakko said pointing with his thumb. \"What ? What's happening to me ?!\" you panic, yet again. \"Ain't it obvious, you've been in this dimension for so long, that now you're turning into a toon, duh\" Yakko explained. \"But I don't want to be a toon!\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Why not, now you can do this\" Yakko made his arms long and rubbery, and tickled you.<br>\r\n\"Or this\" Wakko started juggling his own head.<br>\r\nDot turned into a gaint again \"Or this\" before going back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck, being a toon can probably get you outta here\" Yakko pointed out. <br>\r\n\"Really ?\" you like the sound of that. \"Sure, just reach in your pockets\" Dot suggested.<br>\r\nTaking there advice, you start digging.<br>\r\nYou pull out, a Stop Sign, a rubber chicken, Elvis, Waldo, a tire, a mallet........<br>\r\n\"This is going to take a while\" they in unison to the audience.</span></div></div>",

Someone must've found thier way out of my intestine, Lola thought...or a great big log was ready to come out.  She entered the bathroom, pushed aside a student with her girth, and entered a stall that could support a fat person like Lola.  It took a few minutes for Lola to push you and the Warner Bros. and sister out of her rear.  You emerge from Lola's backside feet first and you're squeezed out...Dot needed some help getting out due to her large belly.  When all was said and done, the four of you grin at the shocked expression on Lola's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"You got out?\" asked Lola.  \"well, that's amazing.  Some people just stay in my stomach and enjoy the TV.

When you enter the cafeteria, you discover that it's common place for students to eat each other (or try to serve one another to a dinning teacher).   You find yourself hungry, and you're looking forward to stuffing your gut with several cartoon characters...or anything, really.   <br>\r\n                All kinds of cartoon characters are in the cafeteria now;  There's Jerry from the Tom and Jerry cartoons with a huge gut;  There's Templeton from Charlotte's Web feasting on who looked like Wilbur.   One table only had anime characters at it: Mai Valentine from Yu-Gi-Oh, Tea Gardner, Joey Wheeler, Kagome, Souta and others.   Lola went to a table marked \"Teacher's Table; Approach at your own risk\".  At the teacher's table sat ten cartoon characters.  These characters were;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     Jessica Rabbit (wearing her trademark super tight outfit that seemed to hug her body)<br>\r\n                    Faye Valentine (from \"Cowboy Bebop\")<br>\r\n                    Dr. Scratch 'n Sniff<br>\r\n                   Minerva Mink <br>\r\n                  One of the hippos from \"Fantasia\" minus the tutu<br>\r\n               Dr. Zoidberg (from \"Futurama\")<br>\r\n              Seymour \"Spanky\" Skinner (from \"The Simpsons\")<br>\r\n              Edna Krapable (also from \"The Simpsons\")<br>\r\n             Hello Nurse <br>\r\n             and <br>\r\n            Jon Arbuckle (from \"Garfield and Friends\")<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           You are geeking out, seeing all those icons of Saturday Morning Cartoons.  Before you can find a table to sit at (or decide what to eat), you're gabbed from behind by Plucky Duck.  Plucky isn't alone;  there's about ten other students with him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"So,  you're the new kid in school\" said Plucky.  <br>\r\n           \"Uh..yeah\" you say.  \"my name's Steven\"<br>\r\n          \"I heard you made it out of Lola\" said Plucky.  \"that isn't easy, you know.

The dragon is 15 feet tall, and pointing at a lonely bottle sitting at an empty table.  The bottle is marked \"Jumbo Gro;  The miracle growth formula for plants.  Also works on people.  Warning:  Don't drink the entire bottle in one gulp\".  <br>\r\n                  \"Otherwise, we'll cover you in Bar-B-Que sauce and leave you in a classroom\" said Plucky.  \"and see who enters the room first to eat you\"<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  </span></div></div>",

Ironic to hide from someone that wants to eat you inside a stomach..although, it would be a perfect hiding place for such people.  At First, Wile E. doesn't even notice you.  He seems to be talking to someone out in the hallway.  In a few cartoons, Wile E. does speak with a upper-class voice, suggesting that he's smart..he even calls himself a \"super genius\"..but that claim turns out to be false as he fails to catch the Road Runner (or Bugs Bunny).  Wile E. speaks in that upper-class voice to whoever he's talking to.  To be honest, you really didn't care who entered the room and ate you.  You survived in Lola's stomach, so that means that you can survive in anyone's stomach.  Maybe it won't  be so bad, you had thought earlier.  'I'm probably going to end up in a lot of stomachs' you muse to yourself. <br>\r\n          Wile E. Coyote turns into the room, and closes the door behind him.  He's not the rail-thin coyote you see in those old cartoons;  he's sporting quite a big belly that reaches pass his knees and almost to the ground.  He's holding a stack of papers in one arm.  When he sees you, he just stares at you and takes a sniff at the air.  The whole room is filling up with the smell of Bar-B-Que sauce, and Wile E. is looking at the source of that smell; you.  <br>\r\n           \"Someone done me the honor of bringing my lunch to me\" said Wile E. <br>\r\n           \"It was Plucky and..\" you start to say.<br>\r\n            \"I know who it was\" said Wile E.  \"Plucky and his band of friends do this all the time..trying to get on the good side of the teacher's\"<br>\r\n             \"They didn't leave me with much choice\" you say.<br>\r\n              \"They hardly do\" said Wile E, licking his lips.   \"well, any last words before I send you down to my waiting stomach?\"<br>\r\n                Before you can think of anything to say, Wile E jumps on you with mouth wide open.

Coyote, that super genius that he is, waited patiently for his next class to show up.  It was time for the afternoon classes to begin, and Wile had a very special thing to teach his next class.   There was no evidence that anybody was inside his stomach.  After waiting 4 minutes, the classroom soon filled up with anime and cartoon characters; Inu-Yasha, Izzy from Digimon, Tai from Digimon, Cow from Cow and Chicken, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Lisa Simpson, Bart Simpson, Miles Prowder from the Sonic games and cartoons and a lot more.   When everybody was in thier seats, Wile did the role call...and then, he went onto the lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Today, we'll be learning about Hammerspace\" said Wile.  \"now, who can tell me just what is 'Hammerspace'? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"It's the space that you put your hammer?\" suggested Bart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"Why, yes\" said Wile.  \"that's not the full defination, of course, but I'll let it slide.  Okay, now listen up....Hammerspace is a space where you can put any large item into a place that looks to be too small for it.  As an example, I want each of you to reach into your pockets and pull out something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             The class did just that.  Bart Simpson managed to pull out the Titanic from his pocket;  Izzy from digimon pulled out a WWII Tank, while Tai pulled out a modern tank from his pocket.  Tails had pulled out a large bowling ball from his pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"Very good\" said Wile.  \"Hammerspaces can be found anywhere;  even in your bodies!   Many stomachs of Toons have Hammerspaces in them.  A Hammerspace can be any size;  it can be as small as an insect, or it can be as big as the universe itself!  In fact, there is a serious theory that a Hammerspace is, in fact, a gateway to another dimension!   But this theory can't be proved or disproved.   If you reach into your pockets deep enough, you'll probably vanish into your own pocket...and simply pop out of existence..and into another dimension\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"COOL!\" said Bart.  \"see ya, guys!\"  And, Bart reached deeply into his pocket until his whole body ended up in his own pocket and popped right out of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"Well...\" said Wile.  \"I hope Bart is happier in whatever dimension he found himself in\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then the guy said \"That's all, and remember kids, at Acme, we ad rockets-\". \"To everything, we've heard it before\" Wile shoved him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now observe\" he said picking up an anvil.

The camera then zooms in on a certain green duck that's standing beside the Gym building of the Looniversity.  In Plucky's hand, there's the infamous bottle of Jumbo Gro.   Way back in the 1940's, Jumbo Gro came out.  It was meant for growing super big plants, but it was highly experimental. A cat owned one of the bottles of Jumbo Gro, and wanted to eat a king-size canary.  The cat fed the canary some Jumbo Gro to make it bigger...but the canary got too big for the cat to eat.  To make a long story short, a mouse and the cat had grown bigger than the planet itself due to Jumbo Gro.  The cat and mouse squished millions of people under thier titanic selves (luckily, they were all cartoon characters).  The cat and mouse remained that size for almost two weeks before the effects of Jumbo Gro had worn off and the cat and mouse returned to thier normal sizes.  Jumbo Gro was still made, but it had to have a disclaimer that warned not to drink from the bottle...and certainly not to drink the whole bottle in one go.  Who knows how big would someone get if they drank all of Jumbo Gro in a bottle?   That's what Plucky intended to find out.  <br>\r\n          Plucky had stolen the bottle from the factory two nights ago.  He was trying to coax everyone to drink all of the Jumbo Gro in one go...but nobody wanted to. Well, if nobody wanted to do that...Plucky would love to do that.  <br>\r\n           <br>\r\n        \"HOLD IT!\" yelled a female voice that belonged to the 800-pound Officer Jenny.

The direct approach would be useless;  Plucky would eat anybody that got in his way...or squish 'em with his titanic stomach.  Plucky had grown to be 100 feet tall, as he had drank the whole bottle of Jumbo Gro.  The thing was...why didn't Plucky grew bigger than the planet?  Nobody had the answer to that.

She was an officer of the law, that was true, but that didn't stop her from imagining things. Officer Jenny was 800-pounds due to all the doughnuts she ate on a daily basis...she hardly ever ate people (unless they broke the law).

Jenny could \"expand\" the jail by drinking Jumbo Gro.  She smiled and uncorked the bottle, and drank down all of the Jumbo Gro.

What feels like ten minutes later, you come to the edge of the bed and look down.  The floor of the room looks to be 40-50 feet below you.  That fall would normally kill you, but you see a number of trampolines lining the edge of the bed on the floor.  It seems like this bed was tailor-made for you to jump off of.    You shrug and leap from the bed to one of the trampolines on the floor.  You land on the trampoline and bounce back up even higher than the bed.  You fall once again to the trampoline on the floor, but you don't bounce as high this time.  It takes you 4 or 5 times bouncing on the trampoline for you to stop bouncing and climb off the trampoline in question.  Once off the trampoline, you look around the room.  The door to the room is about 300 feet (to your scale) away.  The carpet of the room hides you from sight from the three maids, and you begin to walk towards the door.  <br>\r\n                     \"...As I have told you before, your father is away on business\" comes a voice from behind the door!  As you watch, the door opens and two people walk in.  These two people are actually giants as well....and you can't help but stare at the pair.  One of the pair is a giant horse dressed like a butler...and its walking on two legs!  The other person who walked into the room is a giant fox.  The two giant animals are walking on two legs and wearing clothes.  The fox is wearing what a prince--or another Royal--would wear.  Due to the fact that the fox is wearing a white satin dress, you gather that the fox is a female.   Just where the hell are you anyway?!  <br>\r\n                      \"Forgot today just happens to be my 21st birthday, did he?\" asks the fox, glancing around the room.  <br>\r\n                      \"As I recall, your father did bring you a birthday present\" said the horse.  \"he found it just outside...in the flowerbed, no less\"  <br>\r\n                       \"Indeed?\" asked the fox.   <br>\r\n                       \"Yes\" said the horse.    The horse looked on the bed.   \"Hey...where did it go?\"<br>\r\n                        You have a BAD feeling about this!   <br>\r\n                        \"Hey, did any of you maids steal my birthday present?\" asked the fox to the room at large. The maids denied it. <br>\r\n                        The feet of the fox are only 10 feet away from you.  You decide  to make a run for it.  You manage to get passed the huge foot of the fox and approach the open door, which leads into a hallway.  </span></div></div>",

The cat-maid has something around her neck...most likely, a necklace.  The bunny-girl is wearing a necklace too...and it looks like the same necklace that the cat maid is wearing.  You look at the naga maid.  The naga is a very beautiful woman....you would call her a babe if not for that 100-foot long snake part of her!  The Naga is wearing a loose-fitting shirt that covers her DD-Cup breasts.  The naga also has long red hair and has a cute face.  The naga isn't wearing a necklace.  The necklaces that the bunny-girl and cat-girl are wearing is dark green and they seem to glow with an eriee light.  You look closer at the bed and see that the bedsheet has some sort of design on it.  As you're looking at the design on the bedsheets, you hear the naga hiss.  You look up to see the naga looking at you while the two other maids are still cleaning the room.  <br>\r\n      \"Good, you're awake\" said the naga.  <br>\r\n      \"Where am I?\" you ask.<br>\r\n      \"You shouldn't  have walked down that path\" said the naga.  \"you would've been safer then\"<br>\r\n        \"Where am I?\" you ask again.<br>\r\n        \"You're in the mansion of Lady Carmen, ruler of Upper Hell\"<br>\r\n           \"Upper Hell?\" you ask.  \"So....this is hell?\"<br>\r\n           \"Yep\" said the naga.  \"There's Upper Hell and Lower Hell.  Upper Hell has all the important people in it: Hitler, those idiots at FoxKids that edited Escaflowne, Saddam Hussein, and so on.  Lady Carmen is the ruler of Upper Hell\"<br>\r\n        \"I thought that Lucifer was the ruler of hell\" you say. <br>\r\n         \"Not anymore\"  said the naga.  \"the Lady Carmen took care of Lucifer and his supporters\"<br>\r\n          Someone even badder than Lucifer is running hell?!    You're royally screwed now.<br>\r\n          \"And who are you and these two?\" you ask.<br>\r\n         \"I'm Cessa\" said the naga.  \"these two are Janney and Torum, maids to the Lady Carmen\"   <br>\r\n        \"And what am I doing here?\" you ask, fearing the answer.<br>\r\n          \"You get to be Lady Carmen's plaything\" said Cessa, clearly enjoying the look of utter horror on your face.  <br>\r\n           \"Plaything?\" you say with a squeak.<br>\r\n            \"It's either that or suffer for eternity\" said Cessa. <br>\r\n           \"Umm......some choice\" you mutter.<br>\r\n          \"Lady Carmen is rather...playful\" said Cessa with just a hint of distain in her voice.  <br>\r\n          \"How do I  get out of here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n         \"Either pray for God to save you, or (and if) you meet the Grim Reaper\" said Cessa.  <br>\r\n             \"There's really a...\" you start to ask.<br>\r\n             \"You talk too much\" said Cessa.  \"Well...I was told when you were awake I should bring you too Lady Carmen\"  Cessa picks you up from the bed and exits the room.   Cessa slithers her way down a very long hallway that ends in huge double doors.  The doors are immense to you and Cessa, as it towers over the both of you.    Cessa opens a small door within the big door and enters the room.<br>\r\n           You are now in what looks like a throne room.  The ceiling of the room is so high you can't even see it.  The room is filled with guards--more naga even bigger than Cessa is!   The throne itself is pure gold and sitting on it is the LARGEST naga of them all.   The throne itself is large, but the naga sitting on it is truly immense.   Lady Carmen is easily a 1000 feet tall and 2000 feet long.  You stare in awe at Lady Carmen and she smiles down at you.<br>\r\n        \"Welcome to my domain\" said Lady Carmen.  </span></div></div>",

You beg for Carmen to send you back to the living world!<br>\r\n\"M..M..Mistress Carmen,\" you slowly stutter as she leans her head closer to your tiny body, \"I I I... I beg you to return me back to Earth! T T There is so much left for me to do.. and... and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome... to my... domain!\" Carmen says yet again. It was almost as if she had trouble contemplating what you were saying!<br>\r\n\"Uh... look, as much as I enjoy this place,\" you tell her, \"I would really appreciate being put back on Earth. Please, oh great Lady of Hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELCOME!\" she shouts, emphasizing each word, \"TO! MY DOMAIN!\" This might be kind of a stupid guess, but could it be that she doesnt really speak English?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity, you test her. \"Uh... Someone set up us the bomb! All your base are belong to us! Door is locked by magic of black! IM RICK JAMES, BITCH!\"<br>\r\nSure enough, Carmen just simply gave you a blank stare...<br>\r\nAlmost a minute passed before she finally replied, \"...Welcome to my.. domain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn... it looks like she cant understand you. How can you plead to someone who doesnt understand a word you say? It's probably not like it would help anyway, cuz she probably isnt very intent on giving you up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SSSiiSSSSSSS!!!!!* Just then, you hear a rattling sound behind you. There could be only one guess what it would be...<br>\r\nYep! You turn your head to see a huge snake-rattle almost the size of your house shaking in excitement at the end of Carmen's mega-long tail!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*WWWWHHHHEEEEOOOOOOOOWWWWW!!* In almost lightning speed, the end of the rattle darts you and scoops you off the ground before you could even have time to scream!<br>\r\nAs you hang on to dear life at the end of the rattle, the tail itself gets raised up to Carmen's eye-level!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen as her possibly 200-foot face is staring at you with an intrigued grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my..... DOMAIN!!\" Her tail-rattle swings you high up in the air!

You're gonna spend the rest of eternity in the recesses of Carmen's belly.   <br>\r\n      A minute later, you fall in a huge chamber that must be Carmen's stomach.  The stomach is so vast that you can't see the 'ceiling' of the stomach!   There's light in the stomach, coming from torches that are lying atop great big laterns.  You look around and see that there's a lake of stomach acid 4 feet in front of you.  You almost landed in the stomach acid!

But then again, you now have all the time in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, \"Yes Lady Carmen\". After taking one hard deep breath, you gently put your hands on her green and black spotted tail of hers.. It feels very scaley and wet, like the time you felt your best friend's boa constrictor. <br>\r\nNot being a genius when it comes to a naga's anatomy, the only idea you had was to slowly run your fingers down Carmen's tail in a rhythmic pattern...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by Carmen's *Hiissssssssss* underneath her devious grin, you might have gotten lucky!

As a mate?!<br>\r\nTo be quite honest, you really dont wanna nob either one of them! It's not that you find them unattractive or something like that. Far from it! It's just that youre in Hell. And you desperately want to get back home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, Cassandra and Carmen are practically cussing each other out by now. Usually this kind of thing results in a catfight, but they're worlds apart for that to happen!<br>\r\nWhile the succubus and naga are busy with eachother, you look around in hopes of a way to escape... there's a tiny little hole in which you can see light from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any other options, you run toward this whole while the other two are distracted. After looking back one last time, you jump up to that hole and climb out of the opening of the Robot Carmen's stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter escaping the inside of the robot, you gently slide down part of her extremely long tail before jumping to the ground and heading for the double doors!<br>\r\nThankfully, the ginormous robot doesnt even notice you possibly because it's operator is still distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, getting away from Carmen was the easy part. The HARD part would be getting away from the Naga soldiers! However, another miracle happens! Each and every one of the soldiers are fast asleep. Ha! Not even the troops of Hell are very trustworthy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. That means you run into no problems sliding under the huge double doors out of the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the throne room and into an endless hallway... this gives you plenty of time to think about your predicament. The only probable way out of Hell would be going back the way you came in. But how? You dont remember WHERE you came in... just waking up in a huge bed with three bizarre maids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n..Oh speak of the devil! A humongous foot blocks your path! You stop JUST before you could bump into it head-on. When you look up, you recognize the maid outfit!<br>\r\nWorse even, the maid definitely sees you! Judging by her bending down at looking at you in intrigue, you have her utmost attention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a sec... you recognize the maid! She was one of those maids that was with Cessa in the room you woke up in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's...</span></div></div>",

You try to run, but the maid grabs you and picks you up and raises you to her feline face!  The cat-maid smiles at you, revealing her very sharp teeth!  You gulp as you see the maid open her jaws wider and wider.  Oh  great!  Looks like you're gonna be cat chow!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Hey!\"  shouts a voice from down the hall.  The cat-maid looks in the direction of the yell and so do you.  The shout came from a naga that's coming towards  the  cat-maid.  This naga looks young, judging by the youthful appearance of the human half.  The human half of this naga is that of a thin man with reddish hair and green eyes...just like Carmen!  Could this naga be related to the new Queen of Hell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Where's my mother, and how did you get that human?\" asks the naga, eyeing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Your mother is in the throne room\" said the cat-maid.  \"I saw this human running out of the throne room.  Must've escaped somehow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"A mere human escaping from my mother?\" asked th naga, and then he burst out laughing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Um...\" you start to say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Just then, the double doors to the throne room burst open and there's Carmen along with two of the guards!  The guards each have a hand mark on thier faces...it's easy to  guess that Carmen slapped them awake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Ah, there you are\" said Carmen, snatching you from the cat-maid.   \"You really thought you could escape from me?\"   She wraps you in her coils while she looks over at her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Mozzari, what are you doing here?\" asked Carmen.  \"I thought I sent you to look after our other little problem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        At that moment, a bright flash of white light filled the hallway, blinding everyone.  You feel Carmen's coils being lifted around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"What the--?!\" shouts one of the guards, but you are too blinded to see what else is happening around you.   Taking this chance, you make a run for it.  A few moments later, your eyesight comes back and you find yourself running down the seemingly endless hallway.  You look back and see that Carmen and the others are busy fighting with what looks like a human with wings!  An angel?!   You don't stop running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          You keep running until you come to a T-section.  One hallway leads to the right, and the other leads to the left.  You look behind yourself and see that nobody is behind you...for now.   Now that you escaped Carmen, all you need to do is to escape Hell somehow...but how did you reach  Hell in the first place?  All you remember is waking up in that huge bed.   There's gotta be a way back to Earth....right?   Right now, you gotta decide which hallway to go down.  <br>\r\n            </span></div></div>",

In a way, right was always the 'right' way to go! Hahahaha! .....*urrghh*!<br>\r\nAnyway, long story short, you took the right side. You hope to God that this is the way out of Hell, because in Hell's thing's can ALWAYS get any worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway seems to go on and on and on and on. It feels as if you constantly passed that same damn portrait of Carmen, a young Mozarri, and a slightly taller gentleman with white angelic wings sticking out of his back. Carmen's husband and Mozarri's pa, you assume.<br>\r\nIf you didnt know any better, you'd think the hallway is repeating over and over just to keep you from escaping! Then again, the screams of that angel attacking are becoming fainter and fainter. Also, everything's getting brighter. Youre not dizzy or anything, so it's not like youre passing out... but as you run, everything just goes white!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened? This isnt that lovely white Mansion of Hell! It's dark, and hot.... very hot! Like the fires of Hell itself.<br>\r\nYou can hear sounds of loud rustling all around you. Followed by lots of heavy breathing. The breathing comes from that colossal mountain above you.. It's quite a huge mountain... looks about big enough for the fake Cassandra to lie on, give or take her tail!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange... this mountain has big white angelic wings, and long black hair all across it's face... wait, mountains dont have faces. ..But Hell demons do! The hair on it's head as well as it's beard cover it's face entirely... but you can actually see a big jade green eye glaring down at you. Quite a scary sight... but thankfully the angel's body is completely binded by lots of ginourmous golden shackles! Each one pinning a certain body part down. There's even one in his tongue, so eating you is out of the question!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.... do not belong here.\"<br>\r\nYou overheard a voice in your head calling out to you! The fallen angel, perhaps?<br>\r\n\"Yes... why are you here?!\"<br>\r\nHe speaks, but doesnt move his mouth (because he cant!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... who... are you?\" you shout to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ein. Ein Von Fel Lyaniak... the former ruler of Lower Hell.\"<br>\r\nEin Von Fel Lyaniak? The name doesnt ring a bell, but you coulda sworn you heard the surname 'Von Fel Lyaniak' before. Nah! Must be your imagination!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you do not belong in Hell. Yet you are here,\" you hear Ein calling out to you, \"Tell me... how is my wife and child doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Who?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Carmen. Ruler of Upper Hell. And her child, Mozarri. You have met them, have you not?\" Carmen?! That naga woman's his wife?! Last time you checked, you just escaped her oh-so-hospitable custody.. wait a minute! That reminds you... that little thing that happened before you got away. His wife made a pass at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...SHE DID WHAT??!!!\" Oops! He heard that thought! The jade eye widened with obvious anger pointed toward your tiny little body. But it wasnt your fault you were treated like a mistress!<br>\r\n\"Sir, I am deeply sorry!\" you plead to him, \"I swear, if I knew that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it wasnt enough that she locked me away and took everything that belonged to me. Now she plans to break an eternal-bond....\"<br>\r\nYou can sense a bit of sadistic rage in Ein's voice. Just hearing it gives you the creeps, but at least he doesnt feel like killing you. ...Not like he could anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... human. I need your help. Free of my chains and I will send you back to the living world.\" And now he bargains with you!<br>\r\n\"How do I do that?\" you ask, \"There's like a hundred of 'em. And Im way too small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that switch?\" His eye moves toward the direction of a tiny little switch just big enough for anyone your size to pull! \"Pull it. That will release these damned chains. Free me, human! Do it now!\"<br>\r\nHelp out a lord of the Underworld? Is that really a good idea? Then again, there's not much choice at this point. Ein could be your only way back home if you help him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...then again, what if he's lying?!</span></div></div>",

Why is Ein protecting him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first lady replied, \u201cShut up the both of you, If Ein chose this human to carry on with are powers and spirits then he must take pride in him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two just said, \u201cFine we\u2019ll do it.\u201d Then the 2nd women said \u201cBut if this human thinks are powers come free well, he can think again, he will have to live as we did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well\u201d the 1st lady said, you figured she was the leader of the 3. \u201cThen fussing us together I will make him a new body, his old human one is breaking down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 3 looked down at you, raised a hand, and a ball of energy from each of them shot at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEin looked down at your once was a human body and said, \u201cWhen he sees what they did to him, he going to shit himself.\u201d As he said that he once again looked at the curse on you and sigh there was nothing he could do, the curse was imposable to lift sense it changed you at the very core of your DNA. \u201cWell better start thinking of a new name for hi\u2026 or should I say HER.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you began to wake up you felt a heavy weight on your chest, putting your hand there to fell what it was, you began to fell a huge, round and very soft boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took your still groggy brain about 2 minutes to processes that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING!!!\u201d you screamed as you looked down at your new sexy female body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI se\u2026 HEAR that you are aware of what happened to your body.\u201d You hear Ein\u2019s voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere is a quick 3 minute summery, to give you the powers of hell I fussed you with 3 of the top demons, they like myself are part of the 7 deadly sins, the ones inside you, Lust, Wrath and Greed have given you all of there powers, but they decided to give you a new body based of there sins, in this case Lust whose body is tied into her sin was the base for your new body, meaning you are now a woman, a super sexy woman but a woman all the same. I was able to carry you out of the \u201cEver-Burning\u201d Castle and sent you to a world that is similar to your old one.

The first floor had 6 bedrooms, a living room that could have 50 people dancing and still have to much extra space, then there was a kitchen and next to it a dining room that could seat 30 people. There was also a privet library that had all kinds of books mostly spell books but you did see a small self of human books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver on a table, you saw a letter from Ein, in the middle of it. Going over to it you ripped it open and began to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Menyssan,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIf you are reading this, it must mean that you got over the shock of having a woman\u2019s body. Now as you know you\u2019re a combination of 3 of the greatest demons now, that means you have great power. You have one problem, you can use the spells, but don\u2019t have the knowledge to use them. To fix this I made a memory restorer. It is in a shape of a piece of candy, you will find it on the 3rd floor in the room that is next to the room that says \u201cMenyssan\u2019s play room\u201d I know you don\u2019t like a room named like that, and that\u2019s why I named it that. Anyway eat the candy and you will start to know how to cast Lust\u2019s, Wrath\u2019s and Greed\u2019s spells. It will take time to learn them, about 3 months and an addition 3 to master them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nP, S The mansion as you know is huge, so I sent for a maid. The maid will do anything for you, Think of her as a new toy if you wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting down the letter you say. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill Ein the next time I see him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing you decide to go and get that piece of candy. When you got to the 3rd floor you say the room that had the sign \u201cMenyssan\u2019s play room\u201d on it. You walk down the hall to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see the room next to it.\u201d You said as you saw an other door to the left. You wake up to it and begin to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT THE FUCK!!!!\u201d you screamed when you saw the inside of the room. The room was full of clothes, but not just clothes there were cosplay and other naught outfits every were. Your face turned red when you saw the outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you saw it. In the middle of the room was a table, and on it was a plate that held a heart shaped candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try your best to not look at the outfits but, the sin of Lust made you look, and the worst part was that you liked the outfits, you wanted to ware them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the candy, you rush out the door.

Surely you havent forgotten ol' Kura, your most loyalest maid!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head was pounding like Greed and Lust were having an orgy inside your skull! Just how long were you out, you wondered to yourself. Despite the pain, you slowly got up out of bed and rubbed your aching head. \"Uh... no! Of course! Sorry, I uh... just have a hangover! That's all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry, Lady Menny!\" 'Kura' smiled at you and she leaned against you, \"I'll fix that stubborn noggin in a jiffy!\" you didnt really like her hands/paws were twitching as she edged very close to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no no NO!' you backed away from her, \"That... that's ok! I'll be fine!\" Kura frowned a little as she lowered her guard, \"If that is your wish, my lady. ...OH!\" as if something went off in her head, she regained herself and pulled out an interesting costume from behind her back, \"I made you this! It's a special outfit I made myself that's sure to impress the prince!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince? \"P...Prince?\"<br>\r\nKura tilted her head and looked at you questionably, \"Uh.... yeah. Prince Dante? The crowned prince of Western Hell? The guy you invited over this evening?\"<br>\r\nYou have no idea who or what she's talking about but to avoid looking TOO suspicious (not that you arent already there), you smiled and nodded, \"OH! RIGHT! Him. Of course!  How could I forget?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good thing you didnt,\" Kura sighed disappointedly, \"you know, since youre gonna marry him and all-\"<br>\r\nAt that moment, you wanted to do a spit-take SO badly, but you werent drinking anything! You wanted to shout off the top of your lungs, but you didnt want to cast suspicions to your weird maid! ....Not only are you turned into a woman, but youre gonna marry a guy! A guy from HELL, even!! You know Ein kept this a secret from you on purpose just so he could laugh his ass off at this very moment! Word to the wise: next time you see some kinda evil ginormous angel chained to a rock in Hell, YOU LEAVE HIM THERE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frankly, I dont really know what you see in a guy like Dante....\" you overheard Kura mutter. Keeping your cool, you swallow hard and commence with the 'girl-talk', \"Oh? Something you dont like abut him?\"<br>\r\n\"Eh, he's ok I guess... if you like that type,\" Kura rolled her eyes, failing to cover obvious jealousy, \"he may seem cool and calming, but deep down you know he's hiding a crazy psychopathic side ready to pounce on anything with boobs!\" you gritted your teeth/fangs after hearing that part, \"Besides...\" Kura actually grinned a little, \"I'm more into the kind of person who's not afraid to take a walk on the wild side, if you know what I mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dont know and you dont wanna know! You just wanna get this mess over with...<br>\r\n\"I...I think I better get changed!\" you say as you grab Kura's costume. You hope to God this suit looks less trampy than your current one!<br>\r\nBut just before you could start changing, you saw your maid still standing behind staring your direction in the mirror! The smile of hers is still giving you the creeps, especially since she's smiling at YOU.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" you turn your head to her, \"you mind?\"<br>\r\nKura just shakes her head, \"Not at all! Go right ahead!\" <br>\r\nYour new maid is getting too close for comfort. Normally you dont mind her attention, but her attention toward her mistress Menyssan kinda weirds you out! <br>\r\nYou have two choices... you can either tell her to leave so you can change in private... or you can mess with her head and just change right in front of you.

(You are no longer on the Earth that you were raised on.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world you are in is one of many worlds of swords and magic, like your RPGs that you liked to play, and many of the modern conveniences in your new home is run by magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally worlds like this one are called [starter worlds] by those of Celestial or Infernal persuasion. These [Starter worlds] are meant for young devils or gods to learn how to use their powers without having to worry about messing up the plans of those much higher ranked then them.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the power you inherited from my former compatriots you already have the power of a high ranked Demon Lord, even if you are only [Level 1] right now. The Celestial of the world is also [Level 1], though her (Your opponent is indeed a goddess) power is equal to her level. (In other words your power is several magnitudes larger than hers. It\u2019s funny really\u2026 your fight is like that of a [Level 1] noob, the Celestial vs a noob, you, controlling their siblings [Maxed Level] character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really can\u2019t lose, the goddess\u2019s attacks will do scratch damage at best and you have a constantly active [Regeneration] spell placed on you. (You heal faster than she can hurt you.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to world info\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world you currently inhabit is similar to the earth that you used to live in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for the fact that there is a second race of humans that are only six centimeters (about 2.3 inches) tall and the world is inhabited by mythological monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the living room you\u2019ll find a box containing two of the [Buggers], what the natives call the smaller race of humans. Feel free to use them anyway you wish to relieve yourself of stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWishing you well,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S: Since this is a [Starter World] I will no longer be able to interact with you face to face.

Looking up, you see what appears to be a young woman with large black bat wings flying right toward you! You didn't know exactly what was happening, but your instincts were telling you to run. You immediately began to flee from the flying bombshell behind you, but you soon felt the smooth skin of her hands gripping your shoulders. Her speed was incredible to have caught up with you so quickly, but the girl firmly held you by your shoulders and began to lift you off of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you knew, you were being carried through the air back toward the mansion at an alarming speed. The bat-girl carried you into the building through an open window before releasing you and letting you land on the floor. It was here that you got your first good look at her. At first she looked like any ordinary woman, minus the bat wings, but soon her appearance began to change. While her figure earlier wasn't anything special, she was still fairly attractive. Now her appearance was becoming more voluptuous and sexy than anything you had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer modest B-cup chest expanded to a soft-yet-firm pair of perfectly round D-cups, and her figure molded into a seductive hourglass shape. However, that's when things started getting even weirder. Her fingernails extended into inch-long claws, and her feet morphed into a pair of hooves. The bat-wings on her back changed from black to red, and an identical (albeit smaller) pair appeared on the sides of her head. Her blond hair lengthened to reach down to her waist, and her clothing changed into an incredibly sexy black leather corset and a pair of long purple stockings that reached down to her ankles. The most noticeable change, however, was the simple fact that the formerly petite 5'6'' girl had grown a full foot taller and reached 6'6'', now standing a good 4 inches taller than you yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stared at this figure of beauty in utter awe of her body's sheer perfection, she began to speak to you in a voice so beautiful that it would be fitting of an angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Steven, I see that you like my true form...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name?!\" You ask in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman before you simply laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite simple really; I'm able to read people's minds. Normally it takes a bit of effort to find just the info I'm looking for, but you seem to be very attracted to me, so your mind is like an open book to me! And yes, my girls here are as real as any you'll ever find...\" She said, taking massive breasts in her hands and bouncing them up and down hypnotically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely entranced by this woman's goddess-like beauty, and you found yourself incapable of drawing your gaze away from her flawless breasts. The woman laughed once again before walking up to you and seductively tracing a circle on your chest with her index finger. She then put her head right up next to your ear, pressing her plush bosom against your chest as she leaned in toward you, and whispered into your ear in a soft and seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Steven, would you like to get to know this body of mine a little more... Intimately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now you were starting to get somewhat nervous. You had never met this woman before in your life, she had just scooped you off of the ground like a hawk catching a mouse, and now she was coming onto you like this?! You quickly backed away from her and decided to confront her about what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Miss, I want to know who you are and what you plan on doing with me! Right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but of course! I completely forgot to introduce myself! My name is Cassandra, and I am the owner of this mansion. As for what I want with you, that's a bit more complicated. You see, I am actually a succubus, and I want you to live here with me as my personal...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You then realize what she had just said.  She was a succubus?  Wasn't that a female demon that seduces men into sex and then drain their life energy?    You've heard of succubuses before.  Adam's first wife--Lilith--was said to be a succubus.  Of course,  the Bible failed to mention that little tidbit.  Before Eve was around, Lilith was there in the Garden of Eden and married Adam...or at least had a fling with her.  Adam had refused to be on the \"bottom\" of the relationship, and so he had rejected her.  Lilith was insanely jealous of Eve and was said to kill the babies of the world.  <br>\r\n                      \"Succubi is the correct plural form\" corrected Cassandra.   \"as for Lilith, she's the queen of the succubi.  She and Adam had seven children.  All succubi are related to Lilith if you look far back enough\"  <br>\r\n                          \"I bet she and Adam got along well\" you say.  <br>\r\n                          \"Lilith truly loved Adam\" said Cassandra, turning away from you.  That gives you the chance to look around.  Clearly the two of you are in the attic of the house.  The attic was fairly large and was about the size of a regular floor.  It was lighted by several bald light bulbs that hung from the ceiling.  At one corner of the attic was a large cedar chest with an ornate design on the lid.   The design on the lid seemed to be a scene in a forest glade of two nude humans with a third figure hiding behind a rather thick tree trunk.   The third figure was shockingly beautiful.    In another corner of the large attic stood what looked to be a doorway without a door frame around it.  The doorway was filled with a watery substance...very  much like the stargate in the movie and TV shows.   <br>\r\n                         \"That leads to other dimensions\" said Cassandra, looking over what you were looking at.   <br>\r\n                           \"Dimensions?\"<br>\r\n                           \"Never mind that now\" said Cassandra.  \"Here, let me take you on a tour of my lovely house.   This house belonged to my father who was a mortal.  He came from a fairly rich family\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course she wasn't human....she had hoofs for legs for goodness sake and she just shifted her appearance.   You seem more interested in the fact that you just met a demonic being then what she had just said.  She wanted to live with her as her servant?  What did that mean?  Does she want a simple butler like Alfred in Batman....or does she want someone more than a butler?       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"A combination of butler and servant\" said Cassandra.   \"I never had a servant before.....can you imagine?  Me, who has lived for hundreds of years and I never had a servant\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"Hundreds of years?\" you ask.  \"you don't look any older than I do\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             Cassandra smiled a smile that made you want to melt.   You then nod and agree to be her servant on the spot.  You'll do anything for this charming lady!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"I'm so glad that you want to be my servant\" said Cassandra.   Then, she cleared her throat.   \"Well then,  come along and I'll show you the rest of the house\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              The Victorian mansion that Cassandra owns has four floors counting the tower and the wine cellar.  Cassandra takes you on a tour of her house, with you eagerly following her. The room where she flew you to was at the top of the tower...it was a large room but it was crowded due to a table and four chairs around it.  Next, came the third floor which had bedrooms and Cassandra's personal study and rather large library.  The second floor had more bedrooms, the servants' quarters and Cassandra's bedroom  (the servants' quarters are directly opposite of Cassandra's bedroom).  The ground floor had a large kitchen, dinning room, drawing room, living room, and a small cloakroom.   The wine cellar had three rooms to it;  two of them held human-made wine while the third room had wine made from demons and not fit for humans to drink.  Cassandra warns you about drinking the demonic wine.    Lastly, Cassandra showed you one last room that was in the wine cellar, accessible only by a secret door.   In the secret room, there was a huge crystal ball sitting on a stand for it.  Inside the crystal ball were swirling colors at the moment.<br>\r\n                                 \"This is my pride and joy\" said Cassandra.   \"I have only recently made this\"  She rubbed the crystal ball.    <br>\r\n                                 \"What is it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                               \"A portal to other dimensions\"  said Cassandra.   \"it was very hard to come into this plane of existence you know.  This device lets me open portals to other planes of existence.  Makes it a lot easier for me to go to my real home\"<br>\r\n                                  \"This isn't your real home?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                                    \"Oh no\" said Cassandra.   \"my true home is in the Netherworld....or hell, as you mortals call it\"<br>\r\n                                     \"If I'm going to be your servant, why show me this?\" you ask. <br>\r\n                                     \"As my servant, you'll have to know the complete layout of the house\" said Cassandra.   <br>\r\n                                  \"I see\" you say.   \"and what are my.......wages?\" <br>\r\n                                        \"Isn't it enough to be a servant for a lovely woman like me?\" asked Cassandra.<br>\r\n                                     Before you can answer, the doorbell to the house rang.    \"Get that, will you?\"<br>\r\n                                         \"You expecting someone this late?\" you ask as you start to walk out of the secret room with Cassandra close behind.  <br>\r\n                                  \"No\" said Cassandra.  <br>\r\n                                       You and Cassandra head for the ground floor, and you go to answer the door.  Cassandra goes into the drawing room, which has a huge fireplace in it.  You approach the door and open it.     Who--or what--is at the door? </span></div></div>",

Her pet?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Your pet?\" you ask, your voice shaking slightly.  You don't like the sound of becoming anybody's pet, much less the pet of a demonic woman.  And yet, you can't help but think that perhaps being her pet wouldn't be as bad as it sounded.    \"you mean, you're going to change me into an animal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"Perhaps\" said Cassandra with a wicked glint in her eye.   \"perhaps not.  I can change you into any animal imaginable...even a mythological one.

I quite like the sight of human males on their knees\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Before you can say anything else, Cassandra waves a hand and a leather collar appears in her hand.    The collar is black with red letters spelling out your name,  The collar has a ten-foot leash  attached to it.  The collar also has four-inch spikes all around it save for the part of it that has your name.  The sight of the collar sends a shiver down your spine and you have a metal image of yourself as a dog wearing that collar.  You <i>very much</i> like to remain human.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"I take good care of my pets\" said Cassandra, seeing the uncertainly on your face.   \"you'll be safe and happy at my side\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             Without another word, you get on your knees in front of Cassandra and beg her to allow you to remain human.  You even kiss her right hoof,  which makes her chuckle.  You spend a good five minutes begging at Cassandra's feet......err....hooves.  Then she comes to her decision.  </span></div></div>",

Before she answers, Cassandra lifts up her hoof and slams it into your chest. You feel the wind get knocked out of you as you crumple in pain. Before you can recover, you feel the hoof once more as she firmly lowers it onto your covered neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for making me question my decision, pet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you told me to beg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I did, but the first rule of being my pet is to <i>never</i> question my rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut up, not wanting to risk her wrath once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, as I said, I treat my pets well, but only if they remained well trained.

It was bad enough to be under her control, but as an animal as well? You could hardly imagine what that would be like. Seeing no protest from you, Cassandra snaps her fingers.

The corkscrew tail, the pink skin, and a long snout are just a few of the features that clue you in. Worse still, you haven't become any old pig. Judging by you miniscule size, you've become a piglet. Though your mental faculties seem intact, you still shudder at the thought of being a child once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA piercing scream of delight tears through the room, pulling you from your analysis. Cassandra, delighted by your change, swipes you from the floor. She pulls you tightly against her chest, pressing your small snout against her meaty bosom. You can't help but imagine it must be a little awkward for her, but you aren't complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so much cuter than I imagined!\" she says. \"I haven't transformed someone into a piglet in forever. I can't wait to play with ya, babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really have to make me a baby?\" you try to ask only to let out a series of squeals. Luckily, Cassandra can somehow understand your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, silly. This way I can keep you around for longer, since you're younger and all. Plus, I'll get to fatten you up myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mere thought of being fattened up by her as some plaything sends your body into a shudder. Frankly, you fear spending the rest of your life like this, though it's not as if you can really act against her. All you can do is wait and hope something comes up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished snuggling with you, Cassandra lightly places you back on the ground. With a light tug of your leash, she orders you forward and the two of you make your way to the door.

The night air seems cooler now than it was the last time you were out here--which was about ten minutes ago give or take.  Or maybe it was longer than that.   Your little feet has no trouble in keeping up with Cassandra.  Now behind the house, Cassandra is leading you to what looks like a pig pen.  A rather large pig pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   The pig pen is a small house that's only one story tall.  It's about as wide as a regular house and about twice as long.   You see a huge mud patch near the pigpen but you see no pigs in the mud at the moment.  Cassandra opens the pigpen and walks inside with you.   The inside of the pigpen is <i>extremely</i> dirty and quite smelly but neither of those facts seem to bother you.  There are what looks like three pens in this pigpen.  Two of the pens each have gigantically fat pigs in them.  These two pigs are much fatter than any other pig that you ever seen....not that you've seen that many pigs in your life.   Each of the fat pigs must weigh at least 500 pounds!        You start to wonder if Cassandra likes to eat bacon which sends a shiver through your little body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"Here we are\" said Cassandra.   \"welcome to your new home, my new pet.  Sorry there isn't any food around here now.  You'll have to wait until morning to be fed\"   Cassandra leads you to the third pen which is the smallest.  The other two pens are a good forty feet square  while the third pen is only twenty feet square.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          \"Now, make me proud and be sure to eat <i>all</i> of the food you'll be given\" said Cassandra, smiling.  \"I want you to become the fattest pig  in the world!  Even bigger than those two useless ones\"  With that, Cassandra   leaves you in the pen and blows  a kiss goodnight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              For the next few minutes, the pigpen is silent.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"You hear that, Dom?\" asks a voice.   It's coming from one of the two fat pigs.  \"she plans to make the newcomer even fatter than us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"So what?\" asks the other pig.  \"she's just going to eat us sooner or later\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"She's going to eat us?!\" you ask in a trembling voice....but all that comes out are squeals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"Of course\" said Dominick .  \"what else  do you do with a pig?  I hear she likes her food alive\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"I'm Ralph and this is Dominick\" said the other pig.   \"we were once human like you until the mistress turned us into pigs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"Nice  to meet you two\" you say.  \"my name is Steven\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"And I'm Charlotte\" came a new  voice.     You look around until you spot a rat in your pen.  The rat--Charlotte--must've came from that hole in the corner of the pen.  Charlotte looks  bigger than any rat you ever saw.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"Were you a human too?\" you ask the rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"Goodness, no\" laughed the rat.  \"I've always been a rat.  I live under Cassandra's house in a series of tunnels made by my family for ten generations now.  Welcome to the family\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"Hold on\" you say.  \"how can I understand you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     \"Magic I guess\" said Charlotte. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        </span></div></div>",

But you said-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"I said that I \"might\" let you be human if you beged me to. I didn't say I would do it. Still, you should relax. I'll turn you into a mythical creature. And I think you'll like the results.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she began to chant a spell in a language that you didn't knew, her eyes glowed white and her hands had a white aura around them. Then you began to glow white as well and you noticed you were hovering a couple of feet above the ground. You expected the transformation to be painful, but it wasn't. In fact, it was a bit pleasurable. Each time one of you bones became longer or shorter, or when you muscles would flex and gain new form, you felt a tinge of pleasure. You guessed this was Cassandra's doing. You could feel the changes, but you couldn't see them. For the light of the spell was blinding you. Once the spell began to fade, you were brought gently to the ground, however, seeing as you were in a new form, when you tried to stand, you fell on you butt. Everything about you felt different. You looked down and saw hooves, instead on hands and legs and that your fur was a dark beige. Your neck was longer, your midsection was more toned and muscular, as was your backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Um, am I some kind of horse?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Close. But not quite.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra used her magic to summon a mirror for you look at your new self. You went to it and what you saw shocked you. Aside from the changes you had already noticed yourself, you found that you were quite tall. Taller than the normal horses. You also had a spiraled horn (it was the size of Celestia's horn from MLP:FiM) and two majestic wings. Your hair, or rather, your mane, and tail were pitch black. Your mane ended in three short spiked and inverted waves that pointed to your right and your tail was short and it resembled a bit trident. Except the two lateral \"spikes\" were the smaller ones instead of the middle one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"M-my goodness...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Quite impressive, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Y-yes, mistress. But, what am I? I read about Unicorns but, not about this creature.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"It's called an Alicorn. Among horses, there are Earth horses, the ones that the human know and use for wok or to ride on them, Unicorns, that control magic with quite a lot of skill and ability, and Pegasi, like the pegasus from the myth of Hercules. Alicorns are said to be gods/godesses and ancestors/creators of all three kinds. They posses greater magic than Unicorns could ever hope to achieve, are stronger than the normal Earth horses and are faster than any pegasy.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Wow. You were right, mistress. I do like the changes. But, it's too good to be truth. What's the catch?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"*chuckles*Sharp, aren't you? I fouldn't be foolish enough to give you all the powers right away. Right now, you have half the magic of a Unicorn and are as strong and fast as normal earth horses and pegasi. If you want to gain more power and freedom. You'll have to deserve and earn them by proving your self useful and loyal to me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I see. I may have no say in the matter but, I think that's pretty fair.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra smiled at this. For some reason, she felt happy that you aproved. Even if you couldn't resist her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"I told you I take good care of my pets. Now then, let's go inside, shall we? After all, I need to train you on how to use your magic. And then we can have some fun~.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStay tuned for the next part in: \"House of the Succubus\"!</span></div></div>",

She says this with a wicked grin that sends shivers down your spine.   She wants you as a sex slave?!  You start to protest, but you find that you can't say no to this woman.  You're entranced by Cassandra's beauty.  It's as if she put a spell on you the moment you saw her.  Being a sex slave to this goddess of a woman couldn't be all <i>that</i> bad, could it?  In the back of your head, you hear a distant voice insisting that you say no to this woman, that she's dangerous.  But that distant voice is slowly fading away as you continue to look at Cassandra.  You can't say no as to being her sex slave, but you can still ask some questions.<br>\r\n                             \"Sex slave?\" you ask.  \"and what does that exactly entail?\" <br>\r\n                            \"I have sex with you anytime I want\"  said Cassandra.   \"and I do mean <i>anytime</i> and any<i>where</i>.   You have no say in the matter.   I can see it in your eyes.  You have no intentions of saying no to me....not that you could if you wanted to.  I've been at this for longer than you've been alive.  I know how to seduce men....I know what you secretly desire.  I know how to please you in bed in ways you can't even imagine\"<br>\r\n                          It's at this time when that voice in the back of your head gets louder.  You take a step back from her and shake your head.  You were fondling her big breasts, but now you take a step back.   Cassandra's smile grew wider.    \"I see you have some willpower left in you, Steven.  Good.  I like a challenge\"<br>\r\n                          You look around to see that you're in a small room with a table that fills the area.  You must be at the top of a tower.   The table has four chairs around it and is set for a meal.  The stairs that lead downstairs are steep and rather narrow.  The room is lighted with a small  ornate chandelier.  You don't see the light switch for the chandelier in the small room...must be downstairs.  The small confining space makes it impossible not to look at Cassandra.  She studies you for a long moment.  <br>\r\n                                       \"Come, my slave\" said Cassandra, motioning you to follow her down the stairs.  Like a puppet on a string, you start to follow her down the steep and narrow stairs.  It's not like you haven't got a say in the matter....but you truly want to follow her.  She leads you down a long flight of winding staircase until you come to a long hallway.  She walks down the hallway, swinging her hips back and forth which makes you want to slap her on her sexy ass.  She comes to a door and unlocks it with a key that's on a necklace that's in her cleavage.   She opens the door and motions for you to enter the room first.  You enter the room and see that it's a bedroom with an ornate canopy bed made out of oak.  The bedroom also has a large dresser, a full-length mirror, a small daybed  and a small bathroom attached to the room.   The canopy bed is a large one, easily able to hold four people.  The red curtains that adorn the bed are thick enough to allow some privacy for whoever is on the bed.   Cassandra enters the room behind you and closes the door.<br>\r\n                        \"Nice room\" you say, looking around.  The bedroom has red wallpaper and a couple of framed paintings.  All of the framed paintings are still lives.  <br>\r\n                        \"This house has ten bedrooms upstairs and two downstairs\" said Cassandra, coming over to you and brushing her huge breasts against your chest.  She kisses you on your mouth and you start fondling her breasts.  She tears off your clothing one by one as she kisses you, putting her tongue in your mouth.   You two tongue-wrestle as she leads you to the bed.   She pulls away from the kiss and throws you none-too-gently onto the bed.  You look up at her as she climbs into the bed, closing the curtains around the bed.  While she's doing this, you get up from the bed and kiss her shoulder.  She elbows you hard in the  ribs, forcing you onto the bed flat on your back.<br>\r\n                        Finished with her task, Cassandra turns to face you.       She locks eyes with you and you can't turn away from her beautiful face.   You're completely under her spell now.  <br>\r\n                      \"You are to call me 'mistress'\" said Cassandra in a voice that drips with honey.   \"or by any other title you prefer\"  <br>\r\n                       \"Yes, mistress\" you say in a flat voice. <br>\r\n                       \"I'll teach you more rules later\" said Cassandra.    \"now, come here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        The night passes in a happy blur while you're making love with your new mistress.    You vaguely remember kissing her ass at one point while she was sitting on your face.  You do remember the smell that came from her ass; it wasn't foul at all, but smelled like a field of roses.  It was as if she had a perfume bottle  up her ass.   You do remember worshiping her near the end of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         When you do wake up in the morning, you find yourself snuggled up to Cassandra's breasts and using them as a pillow.  Her breasts seem even bigger than they did.  You sigh contently and continue to snuggle with your new mistress.      <br>\r\n                        </span></div></div>",

Her demonic parts didn't make her ugly...in fact, you find yourself sexually attracted to Isabelle!   She's about a foot shorter than you are, and she's still dragging you to the house.  You try to pry your hand away from her grip, but it's impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"We're going to the house\" said Isabelle.  \"and then, I'm going to have you before my sister can\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Excuse me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Isabelle sighed and turned around to look at you.

Determined, you decide to shrug off her baseless threats and ditch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't resist you? Listen, girl, you're pretty, but you ain't as hot as you think you are,\" you argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even so much as a simple acknowledgement of your insult, Isabelle spins around. Her beautiful green eyes lock onto yours once more. As you stare into her hypnotic orbs, you begin to feel your emotions change. The anger you were just feeling subsides, replaced by a warm calmness. Isabelle, as if sensing your mental switch, reaches forward and caresses your cheek with her soft hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, what did you say about resisting me?\" she say. \"Let me reiterate: I'm going to take you to Cassandra's mansion. We're going to go to my room and fuck like animals. I'll drain your youthfulness, growing more powerful and attractive while you became a frail old man, possibly even dying on the spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs horrible as her sentence is, you just can't find the motivation to react. Your mind hasn't been affected; you realize that what she says is dangerous for you. It's your emotions that have changed. Unable to truly react, all you can do is reply with a polite nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you don't die on the spot, an even worse fate awaits you. Succubi like myself can stretch our bodies, so I'll be giving you a one way ticket through my stomach. I'll be eating your body, not just your soul. All will be mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, as horrifying as her revelation maybe, you still do nothing. She notices immediately that you are unable to resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, not even a little wince? Anything? You know, most guys resist me at this point, even just a little. You must really be weak minded, huh? No matter, though, let's keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tugs your hand once more and the two of you continue your journey to the mansion.

Before you can take a look at your rescuer, the hands around your waist clasp together and drag you backwards.  Your hand lets go of Isabelle's hand.  It takes Isabelle perhaps thirty seconds to realize you're no longer holding her hand.  She whirls around but by then you're a good twenty feet away from her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        You're being dragged away faster and faster until you enter the forest that surrounds the mansion.  Then, the hands around your waist let go of you and you're forced to turn around.  Your rescuer has blue shiny hair and silvery eyes  that make her appear that she has no pupils.  She's the mirror image of Isabelle except she's taller and even sexier than Isabelle is.  Just looking at her makes your knees buckle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"Well, hello there\" said the demonic woman in front of you.   \"I'm Cassandra, the mistress of the mansion\"  Her voice is honey sweet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  Before you can say anything to Cassandra, Isabelle comes crashing through the forest.   \"No fair, Cassie!  I saw him first!  He's all mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  Cassandra snorted.   \"You'll use him all up in one go.

It sounded like a twig snapping or shuffling feet in the distance.  You glance around but all that you can see are  trees surrounding you as well as the two demonic ladies.  Isabelle also glances around nervously.  Cassandra seems not to be troubled with the mysterious noise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"Can we continue this back at the mansion?\" asked Isabelle.   \"this forest gives me the creeps\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"A demon like you has the creeps?\" you snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"This is no ordinary forest\" said Isabelle.   \"it's a Dimensional Conversion Point\"  <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n              \"Huh?\" you ask.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"It'll take far too long to explain here\" said Cassandra.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n                 \"</span></div></div>",

Taking initiative, she powers ahead, taking point. You, still in her grips, find yourself being dragged behind her against your will. Unlike Isabelle, who's beautiful stare managed to hypnotize you, Cassandra's even greater beauty is more intimidating than anything. Speaking of Isabelle, the younger succubi has taken your other hand, adorably pressing herself against you for comfort. As you make your way out of the forest flanked by two demons, you can't help but be amazed by it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later and your party makes its way back to the porch. The old Gothic-styled door swings open without any effort, detecting your presence somehow. The three of you enter and find yourselves inside a large foyer. The beautiful aged furniture and glorious chandelier above give the place a look of pure opulence. These succubi must be rich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we're back, finally,\" Isabelle notes. \"What are we going to do with Steven here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seems like a virile young lad.

Cassandra smiles at you as she leads you up a grand staircase at the far end of the foyer.  You're still worried about having your life sucked away as you make love to the succubus.   The grand staircase leads up to the second floor where Cassandra leads you down a long hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"Don't worry\" said Cassandra.   \"I won't kill you.

The kiss lasts for what feels like forever.  As the kiss continues, your mind goes blissfully blank.  All the worry goes out of your being as well as everything else besides Cassandra.  Cassandra becomes the center of the universe as far as you're concerned.  You're only dimly aware of your surroundings.   Finally the kiss ends.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"Whoa\" is all that you can say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   Cassandra smiles as she continues to lead you down the hallway until she comes to a door.  She opens the door and you enter a large bedroom with a  very large bed.  The bedroom is furnished with couches, chairs, a loveseat, dressers and a desk.  Just your typical bedroom.    The bed is a beautiful canopy bed with black curtains with gold trim and looks like it can hold perhaps five people.   The room has two windows that overlooks the forest.  As you  glance out of one of the windows you think you see where your car has broken down.   Cassandra leads you directly to the bed and throws you  gently onto the mattress.  The mattress is soft.    <i>Extremely </i> soft.  Clouds up in the sky could only  dream about being as soft as this bed.  You landed face-first onto the mattress.  By the time you turn yourself around on the bed, Cassandra has removed her skintight clothing she had been wearing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"Just like that?\" you ask.   \"what, no foreplay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             Cassandra smiles at you.   \"There's always time for that, my love\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"Lo--\" you start to say but then Cassandra tackles you and plants a big kiss on your lips.  Just as before, everything goes blissfully blank.  All that exists is Cassandra.  Cassandra sticks her tongue in your mouth and you two tongue-wrestle for several minutes.   When the kiss ends, you find yourself totally naked.   How did your clothes come off?  You find that you hardly cared about clothing....or anything else for that matter.   All that mattered was to please Cassandra.  You'd do anything for her.  You couldn't have said no to her.  In fact, you <i>didn't </i> want to say no to her.  Ever.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  The next few hours pass in a blur.  You would later remember how <i>good </i> it felt to make love with Cassandra.  Sure, she was draining your life force, but you would happily give your life to this goddess called Cassandra.  Later you would remember all the things you did with Cassandra and what Cassandra did to you.  She was <i>heavily</i> into S&amp;M and other kinky stuff.   But for the moment all that passes in a happy blur.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               </span></div></div>",

Remembering the events of the last night, you slowly pull yourself up, though your grogginess impedes progress. You shift your weight upwards and are hit with a stinging pain as your body repositions itself. Concerned, you reach behind yourself and feel your back. Though you cannot see it directly, the dull pain and series of bumps and bruises key you in to just what is wrong. Cassandra's S&amp;M play must have gone a little harder than you recall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you notice a full body mirror a few feet away from the bed. Wanting to see the injuries directly, you drag your aching body from the bed and trudge over to it. As you are about to turn around you briefly gaze at your own reflection, only to be utterly shocked. You look older! Whatever last night entailed, it seems that you've gained around ten years of age, putting you in your early thirties. You now have a fuller beard and much more mature features. Other than the shock of the change, you must admit that you kinda like the way you look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted by the mirror, you barely notice a pair of delicate hands wrap themselves around your exposed waist. You jump, prompting a laugh from a voice you recognize as Cassandra's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I startle you, darling?\" she says with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a sneaky one, Cassandra,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, succubi like myself are masters at stealth. But that is not important. How do you like your new look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look great,\" you admit, \"though did I really lose ten years of my life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, you did. But we do have potions to fix that. I have Isabelle working on one right now, actually. You can go find her in the basement if you want, or...\" she trails off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can spend some more time with me, cutie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Was that coming from being older or from what you did last night? Probably a little of both.  You're still standing in front of the mirror with Cassandra just behind you.  In the mirror's reflection you see that subtle changes happened to Cassandra; her cheeks are a bit higher than last night and her bust looks like it has gained a  full cup size.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"I was hoping you would say that\" said Cassandra, stroking your manhood idly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"You look a bit different this morning\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"Well, of course I do silly\" said Cassandra.  \"I sucked out your life force to make me more beautiful\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"How does that even work?\" you ask.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"Full of questions aren't you?\" asked Cassandra.  She then takes a couple steps to the right and pulls on a cord that's hanging from the ceiling.  The cord is about as thick as normal rope.  A minutes goes by without anything happening.   Then the door opens and a man in his 30's comes in.  He has brick red hair and wears a black suit.  He glances over to you before looking at Cassandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"You rang?\" asks the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"Get breakfast ready, Dennis\" said Cassandra.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"The usual?\" asked Dennis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"Yes\" said Cassandra.   \"with extra big helpings for me and my guest here.  We'll be eating it right here in the bedroom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              Dennis nodded and started to exit the room.  He paused and half-turned back to face Cassandra.   \"Somebody has broken into the pigpen last night and five of our pigs are now missing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              Cassandra sighed.   \"Bandits from the DCP I suspect. I'll take care of it later\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               Dennis nodded  and exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"DCP?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"Dimensional Convergence Point\" said Cassandra.   \"we started to talk about it last night in the forest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"Yeah, I remember something about that\" you say.   \"what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"Oh right\" said Cassandra.  \"I'll try to explain it simply.  Isabelle and I come from another dimension--another world if you will.   We opened up a portal between our home dimension and yours.  In doing that, we opened up other portals leading to other dimensions....we didn't mean to do that, it's just a side effect of opening up a portal. A DCP is when other dimensions converge and  start to mix together.  We're not really sure what other dimensions are in the DCP in the forest, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"Wait a minute, wait a minute\" you say.   \"you're saying that you and Isabelle aren't from here?  Well, where do you come from then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     \"You would call it hell\" said Cassandra.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      That would make sense since succubi are demons after all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"And why did you come here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"For fun mostly\" said Cassandra.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"And what other dimensions are you  talking about?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Like I said, we're not really sure\"  said Cassandra.  \"it all comes down to this:  there's at least four or five portals out there in the forest that lead to other dimensions. Which dimensions I can't really say\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"How many are there?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"An Infinite amount\" said Cassandra.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"...That's a lot\" is all that you can say about that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      Cassandra laughed.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"So what are these other dimensions like?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         \"I've only been to one since we came here\" said Cassandra.   \"it looks to be populated with cartoon characters\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          Now it's your turn to laugh.   \"Are you serious?  Come on, you're pulling my leg\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         \"I'm completely serious\" said Cassandra.    \"truth is stranger than fiction, love.   Just about anything is possible when you're talking about dimensions.  Some dimensions are just like your own dimension while others are radically different.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         \"So...what you're saying about a DCP....\" you start to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          \"Small pieces of other dimensions are bleeding over in this one\" said Cassandra.   \"it won't spread much beyond a given portal\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                           \"So you're given a preview of what a dimension might be like before you actually go through a portal?\"  you ask.   \"I guess you can say that\" said Cassandra thoughtfully.   \"however, denizens of other dimensions are free to enter this dimension\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"Aha!\" you say.  \"so that means that someone from another dimension must've stolen your pigs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"That would be my guess\" said Cassandra.  \"of course it just might be regular humans that stole my pigs\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        </span></div></div>",

Thankfully, the awkwardness of the situation passes when Dennis returns. He's carrying two plates, each filled with a delicious buffet of various breakfast foods. They look more delectable than anything you've ever seen. The experienced butler slides the trays onto the bed before you in one fluid motion and departs once more. The two of you take a seat and begin to dig into the delicious meal. After a while of silence, you decide to break the quiet that has enveloped the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you begin, \"if you devour people's souls, why are you eating normal food? Wasn't my youth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can answer, she pops a perfectly poached egg into her mouth.

You feel bloated as hell, but it was worth it.

You're wearing the clothes you wore last night but they seem to be clean now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               The pigpen lies behind the mansion. It's a large pigpen that's large enough to hold at least one hundred pigs!    As you and Cassandra look for clues around the pigpen, you spot a mark on the ground.  Looks to be a massive paw print of some kind along with tire markings.  Looks like whoever took the pigs took them in a cart.   The paw print is almost as big as your footprint.  Meaning that whoever took the pig must've been an anthromorphic animal since you only see the two paw prints over and over again.  The tire markings and paw prints lead into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    Cassandra found a note inside the pigpen itself.  This is what the note said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                              <i>Thanks for all the pigs.  I know someone that'll enjoy these. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                              -Simon </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                   \"Who's Simon?\" you wonder aloud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                 \"The pig-stealer without a doubt\" said Cassandra.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n                                     The two of you enter the forest following the tracks that the pig-napper left behind.  You two travel deeply into the forest which seems to go on for miles and miles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                            \"What did you meant when you said you couldn't guarantee my safety?\" you ask. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n                           \"Traveling to other dimensions could be dangerous\" said Cassandra.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                               The two of you eventually come to a clearing where a blue-white portal is standing there surrounded by what looks to be animated animals.  The animals are actually cartoons!    They all look very out of place here in this clearing  The tracks lead right to the portal.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n                               \"Stay close to me\" said Cassandra.  You nod as the two of you enter the portal.  In a few moments you emerge on a grassy plain.   Everything around you is a cartoon with bright vibrant colors.  You can see at least three towns on the horizon and what must be a mountain even further away.  It might've been your imagination but you could've sworn you saw the mountain move away from you as the two of you looked around to spot any more clues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                              \"Not much to go on\" you say.   \"I can't find any more tracks\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             \"Me neither\" said Cassandra.  \"which is puzzling to me.

There used to be thousands and thousands of dragons in the world of all shapes and sizes.  Most dragons lived in Europe in the \"olden days\" as it were because the population of humans were much lower then.  Then the modern age came along and the human population had exploded.  Dragons--the few that had survived--had to be very careful because if humans knew that there were still dragons around, they would hunt them down.  Humans fear what they cannot know or control.  <br>\r\n              You are Nithoggisapahyl but you much prefer the shorter name of \"Nithog\".  You are a female dragon that's 250 years old and you make your home in the Catskill Mountains in the state of New York.  250 years for a dragon is basically like an older human teenager of 18 or 19.   Dragons practically live forever.  In dragon form, you are a little over 200 feet long from head to tail and have a wingspan of nearly 300 feet.  You are dark green on top and lighter green on your underside.  While in dragon form, you are practically invincible due to your tough hide and scales.  You can produce near hurricane-like winds from your wings.  <br>\r\n                  Like all dragons, you can assume a human disguise.  You can alter your humanoid form in any way you wish; you can appear as a normal human or you can make yourself into a hybrid of dragon and human. <br>\r\n                     You have several human friends that know your real nature.  You prefer to eat cows and other large herbivores than humans because humans taste nasty to you....and yet you've eaten more than a few humans during your lifetime because you were mad at them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          You're soaring over a forest somewhere in the state of New York when you catch the scent of a human.  Looking below you see that a human male is working on a car that clearly has broken down.  You are virtually silent in the night sky so the human hasn't spotted you yet.  Not wanting to scare the human in your dragon form, you keep flying until  you're out of sight from the human.  Then you land in a small  clearing in the forest and turn into a human female complete with clothes.  In your human form, you stand at 5'6\" and have a thin frame.  Your hair is long and red.  You walk to the road and towards the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Need some help?\" you ask as you approach the human.  He has short brown hair and is probably 6'2\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"Not unless you have a tow truck\" said the human, glancing back at you as he works under the hood of the car.   \"I can't figure out why my car decided to break down\"  here, the human stands at his full height and turns at you.   \"I'm Steven by the way and you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"Call me Carla\" you say.  Carla is what you call yourself in your human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"Well, Carla\" said Steven.   \"we're not going anywhere in my car.  Do you live around here?  You just came right out of nowhere\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"I live nearby\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"Do you have a phone at your place?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"Take a look around\" you say.   \"you see any power lines?  This is the boondocks, bucko\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 Steven sighs.  \"Just my luck\"  </span></div></div>",

You're out in the middle of nowhere, but you see a Victorian House in the distance.  Do you go to the Victorian house, or go elsewhere for help?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       ----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       List of Characters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Steven (you) --  6'2\", brown eyes, brown hair, age 26 ....you're going home after a vacation to Niarga Falls.  You make a wrong turn somewhere and end up in a thick forest and your car breaks down at night.  You take a flashlight and search for a house to call a tow truck.  You spot an old Victorian house in a clearing.    Will you enter this house, which is home to a succubus? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Cassandra ---  6'6\", Blue hair, silver eyes   ---  The owner of the Victorian house is actually a succubus.  She looks just like Morrigan from the Darkstalkers video game, complete with dragon-like wings on her back and the sides of her head.  She has hoofs instead of feet and is VERY attractive to you. She has claws instead of hands.  As a succubus, Cassandra lives on the life energy of mortals by having sex with them to the point of exuastion or even death.  Cassandra can also change her form into anything (or anyone) at will.   Cassandra can also read your mind with ease.  Despite her demonic appearance, she's not evil...she's just a little too mischivous.   She rarely kills her 'victims'.  Looks to be 25 in her demonic form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Dennis -- 5'8\"  Red hair, blue eyes  --- Cassandra's housekeeper for the past 11 years.  Dennis came to Cassandra just like you did...with a broken-down car.  He's in love with Cassandra and is jealous with you for showing up.   Looks to be around 30. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Jenkins --  5'5\" -- Silver eyes, gray hair ---  One of the gargoyle statues that rest atop the roof of  Cassandra's house.  Works as an intruder alarm by telling Cassandra about any and all intruders near the house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You can add other characters if you wish  <br>\r\n  ----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The Rules  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    1)  Don't kill off anyone too quickly <br>\r\n    2) Vore, GTS, GT, Unbirth, Shrinking, Weight Gain are all allowed<br>\r\n    3)  I prefer soft vore here, but you can go hard vore if you wish<br>\r\n  4)  Digestion is allowed.
