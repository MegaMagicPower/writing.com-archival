After clearing the second labyrinth, the group decided to take a break and the girls, collectively, thought it might be fun to have a little female-only time. It was a bit difficult to separate Zen from Rei, but eventually they managed it. Leaving the guys at the food court they walked around the various phantom displays of the alternate reality culture festival, discussing some of the trials they'd been through so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The most recent labyrinth had been rather embarrassing. Finding the Yaso High leader's \"destined partner\" had been awkward for just about everyone, and there had definitely been one or two jealous mutterings as well. Still, the group was in high spirits. They had even been joined by the three women from the Velvet Room, who had heard \"girl bonding time\" and all but demanded to be included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The girls passed an unfamiliar looking classroom lined with pink streamers. The outside of the room had a sign reading \"Risk it All!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm...\" Rei said. \"I've been here a while, and I've never seen that one before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, this room looks new. Did we simply miss it before?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Doubtful,\" Naoto mused. \"Is it possible that this school is constantly changing and new attractions are being added?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I...I guess,\" Rei said, unsure. \"What do you think it is? Do you think there's anything to eat in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't know. Yamagishi, Kujikawa do you sense anything?\" Mitsuru questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nothing different than usual...\" Rise said, with Fuuka nodding behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What about you guys? Do you know what to make of this?\" Minako asked, looking at Elizabeth and Margret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This realm is as much of a mystery to us as it is to you,\" Margret said simply. \"We have no answers either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...I guess we could always just take a quick peak...\" Yukari said. The girls entered the room. Inside there seemed to be nothing more than an empty classroom, with pink streamers along the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh, weird. I guess there's noth-\" Chie's sentence was cut off by the lights in the room suddenly going out. Most of the girls screamed.After about ten seconds of black the lights cut back on. The girls gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The classroom was gone. In its place was a large room the size of a school gym. The room was entirely empty, but the walls were lined with doors. Lined up one after the other, the entire surface of the walls surrounding the room seemed to be covered in entrances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell just happened!?\" Marie asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's another labyrinth!\" Rise said, alarmed. \"I can sense it! It came out of nowhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A trap! Can you lead us to the exit?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No...I can't even find one...\" Fuuka said, worry filling her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn it...\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, well, well...new players...\" A perky and upbeat female voice filled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who's there?\" Naoto demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No one special. Just a...curious observer who runs this particular labyrinth. I'm rather pleased to see so many new people in my little gaming area. Who knew I could be so popular?\" The voice responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We never agreed to play any game. How do we get out of here?\" Marie said in her usual haughty tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...there are a lot of doors here. Maybe one of them will lead you out! It's hard to say, really. This labyrinth is so big and changes so often even I can't find my way around most of the time.\" The voice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So we're supposed to...what? Just keep trying doors at random?\" Yukari asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kind of! Once you go through a door you can't go back the way you came. Don't worry, though, I'm pretty sure you'll never be stuck in a room forever. There's almost always a way out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Almost?\" Yukiko asked, nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah! Though there's a couple of rules you should know about! First off, no more than two of you can go through a door at once. But it looks like there are a lot of doors. Maybe every one of you guys should take their own door. That's up to you, though. But if one of you makes it to the end then you can help all the rest of your friends leave! That's pretty much how it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So...you're saying everyone should split up and choose a door?\" Rise asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I dunno. That would certainly cast the net widest, huh? I can tell you that your little sensing powers aren't gonna be much use in here and you won't be able to talk to each other using your powers either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So...we should be moving through the labyrinth too...\" Fuuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What about enemies!? Are there shadows here? Rise and Fuuka can't fight!\" Minako suddenly piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ohh, don't worry about that! They can't <i>hurt</i> you. There are threats. Enemies and traps and such, but the only thing they actually hurt is your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Our...what?\" Naoto said, her eyes widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your clothes! The traps and enemies in this labyrinth are all designed to try and get you naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is this for real!?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yep. You can consider your clothing your 'health' in this dungeon. Run out and it's game over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W-what does that mean?\" Fuuka said, her voice shaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's a surprise! Let's just say: don't get naked. It's really embarrassing and all sorts of unpleasant things (for you) might happen. Then again maybe some of you are in to that kind of thing. I dunno. Don't worry, though, keep an eye out for special items in the labyrinth! You might find some spare clothes if you're lucky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This...is ridiculous! I refuse to debase myself by participating in this madness!\" Mitsuru yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Suit yourself. You can stay here if you want. But that would be pretty boring, don't you think? Anyway, that's pretty much everything. Good luck, girls! Maybe I'll see you at the end of this thing...if you can make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And with that, the voice stopped. And no further calls to her were met with response. The girls spoke uneasily amongst themselves, but it all came out to the same thing. They'd have to leave eventually and try their luck. They were stuck. Rise and Fuuka's attempts to contact the boys were unsuccessful and who's to say they could even do anything. There was nothing for it. They'd have to start going through doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich group do you wish to select your character from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SEES</b><br>\r\nThe girls from Gekkoukan High School.

I woudn't want to slow you down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm sure,\" Minako smiled warmly.  \"In times like this, two heads are better than one.  Come on, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes.  I'd be honored!\" said Fuuka, taking Minako's hand with visible relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you two are going together then,\" said Yukari, who was standing nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Yukari!\" Minako gasped.  \"I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't sweat it,\" Yukari grinned.  \"I'm worried about Fuuka too, with that thing locking out her powers.  I'm sure you'd either be doing this or going at it alone so that we wouldn't be forced to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Fuuka said, downcast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako shot Yukari a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  N-Not that I meant you're useless right now, Fuuka!\" Yukari stammered.  \"I just mean that, you've never set foot in a labyrinth, and you're always at the lobby for Tartarus, so-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I understand,\" Fuuka shook her head.  \"It's nothing any of us can help with, but what I can help with is getting us out of this labyrinth.  If the shadows really will only hurt our clothes, maybe there's some way to deal with them other than directly fighting them.  And there's always been puzzles so far that have nothing to do with fighting.  I'm sure I'll be useful somehow, so either way, I-I'll do my best!\" Fuuka said, pumping herself up as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Minako and Yukari nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not mean to interrupt, but we are currently the last ones in this room,\" Aigis spoke up, her monotonic voice bringing the girls back to the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, they noticed that they really were the only 4 remaining.  A good amount of the doors had vanished, presumably doing so after one or two of their companions entered them, but there remained more than enough doors to choose between them whether they went alone or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, guess we'd better get going then.  Come on, Fuuka!\" Minako said with high spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Fuuka said, matching her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wish to partner up as well?\" Aigis asked Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... I think I'll go solo,\" Yukari said warily.  \"There's quite a lot of doors left, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then I shall proceed on my own as well,\" Aigis replied, before going off to a far-away door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you on the other side,\" Yukari called out before passing through her own door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, shall we?\" Minako asked, opening the door before her and Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead the way,\" said Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair walked through the door into a dark hallway.  After closing the door behind Fuuka, it quickly vanished into the darkness.  Curious, Minako reached out to the door, only to feel nothing where it was.  \"Is something wrong?\" Fuuka asked, having already started along the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing,\" Minako said, quickly catching back up to her.  <i>It's not like we were going to head back anyway...</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe murky darkness continued for several feet, until the pair reached another door.  Taking a breath, Minako opened the door, and light suddenly flowed into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, the girls found themselves in a small chamber.  With torches lined all over the stone walls, and a floor and ceiling also made out of stone, it wouldn't look too out of place in a castle or fortress.  Minako was amused at this fact, as it had been the first labyrinth she'd been in that actually resembled a type of dungeon.  On the other side of the room lay a wooden door, but between them and the door lay a familiar looking box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A treasure chest?  Score!\" Minako cheered, running over to the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Ah!  Minako, wait!\" Fuuka called out, stopping her friend just as she set her hands on the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  What is it Fuuka?\" Minako asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't like the look of this.  Not at all,\" Fuuka firmly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?  It's a treasure chest, on the first room!  Talk about hitting the big time!\" said Minako, brimming with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, on the <i>very first room</i>,\" Fuuka said with emphasis.  \"It's just too convenient, especially with how the labyrinth master was talking back at they beginning.  I'm sure that it's a trap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... is this your Persona sense talking?  Or just your intuition?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... just my intuition, I'm pretty sure.  So I don't know that it's a trap, but... I just think that with all that's against us, it could be very risky.  We still have all our clothes, so we should probably just move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Minako said, pondering.  \"But on that same token, Fuuka, what if there's something ahead that we need the item from this chest to deal with, or suffer even more of a clothing loss if we don't?  How about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... hm... that is also a very likely possibility,\" Fuuka said, giving it some thought, then grimacing.  \"Oh... looking at it that way, even playing it safe is risky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks like what we're dealing with here,\" Minako said, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I still don't like the looks of this chest... but I'll let you decide what to do with it.  You are our leader, after all,\" Fuuka said, backing away towards the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako nodded, and turned back to the chest.  Taking one more deep breath, she made her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>1: -Yeah it's risky, but it could also be very helpful.  Plus, I'm dying to know what's inside!  Even if it is a trap, it is the very first room so how bad could it possibly be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: -Fuuka does have a point.  What if it was some sort of powerful bomb inside?  And how much damage can our clothes take anyways?  An actual beating, or just a slight tap?  One wrong move could strip us completely before we even begin!

But before she could reach in to the item inside, she heard an audible \"click\" below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*SHUNK* </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-MINAKO!\" Fuuka shrieked, clutching her arms inward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the noise sounded out, Minako's heart skipped a beat.  Slowly, she tilted her head down, and her jaw dropped open, as she was now standing knee deep in a bed of spikes, having pierced upwards through the ground in a ring around the chest after she had opened it.  but, impaled as she was, she realized that something was very strange.  Namely, she wasn't feeling any pain, or even the feeling of intrusion from being impaled, and there wasn't any blood on the spikes.  She also felt nothing when the spikes retracted into the solid stone floor , passing through her feet and legs again.  Utterly baffled, but remembering what she came for, Minako leaned in to obtain the treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Minako!?\"  Fuuka gasped.  \"But, how?  You're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's very strange,\" Minako said nonchalantly.  \"I didn't feel a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako's footwear then exploded into a small cloud of cloth and leather scraps, the pieces fading into nothingness as soon as they touched the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... now I feel something, heh, heh,\" Minako chuckled nervously, now all too aware of the feeling of cold stone beneath her bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... I knew it, I just knew it,\" Fuuka repeated miserably, unable to take her eyes off of Minako's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka, hey, hey...\" Minako said soothingly.  \"It was just my shoes and socks, nothing major.  I've got plenty of spares back home, so it's no big deal, all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but I had a feeling about this, and because I just let it go-\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Minako interrupted.  \"You had the right call on this one.  I was the one who ignored your advice.  It's not your fault for not talking me out of it, I just... I really wanted to know what was in there.  So don't feel bad at all.  You did nothing wrong here.  It was completely my bad on this one, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... yeah...\" Fuuka said, breathing more calmly.  \"You're right, Minako.  I was just worried at seeing you lose so much at once like that.  You're right, you've still got most of your outfit left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just look on the positive side,\" Minako said encouragingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, just curious... what was in the chest anyways?\" Fuuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing too special, just a Bead!\" Minako grinned.  \"It'll patch one of us up back to full health so long as we don't fall unconscious.  Really helpful if we take a beating, as I'm sure you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Minako,\" said Fuuka, who was noticeably less cheerful than Minako had expected she would be upon hearing of their find.  \"All our damage goes to our clothing doesn't it, like with those floor spikes?  If healing items only rejuvenate our bodies, then won't we have to run out of clothes first before we need to use them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako opened her mouth, finger pointed in the air about to explain, only to fully realize the implications of what they had discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AGHHH!  GOD DAMMIT!  SON OF A BITCH!\" Minako swore, smacking her forehead with her free hand.  \"I completely fell for it...\" she said sullenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, it's okay,\" said Fuuka.  \"I thought you were a goner for sure when that happened.  And who knows?  Maybe it will come in useful later.  Still, now we have a better idea of how things work around here and we can be better prepared for the future.  Let's just be more careful next time, all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure thing,\" said Minako, cheering up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's keep going,\" said Fuuka.  \"I think it was... this door?  Wait, where's the one we came in from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako looked around.  Sure enough, the only door in the room was the one leading onwards.  \"Oh, right!  It looks like the doors leading backwards disappear after we go through them.  Probably to keep us from turning back if the path splits or something,\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay... that makes sense,\" said Fuuka, slightly distressed at this revelation.  \"Let's just keep going for now, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" Minako said cheerfully, marching forward, opening the door and leading Fuuka inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corridor was similar to the room, lit by torchlight as well, providing some relief to the pair.  While Fuuka still a little nervous as before, truth be told, Minako was dealing with a new set of nerves, feeling a little strange walking around a dungeon without shoes.  Going barefoot was more for relaxing or swimming, not adventuring.  The stone felt too... real under her feet, though that could be due to having run around the labyrinths in proper footwear all this time.  Maybe she would get used to it soon enough, and at least the labyrinth floors were always smooth, flat surfaces of some kind; so far at least.  Either way, it wasn't good to dwell on this, especially now that the only clothes left were her actual outfit.  The jacket could go if necessary, but anything else and then things could get... awkward between her and Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Minako was soon take out of her thoughts as the pair reached a fork in the corridor.  With no signs or indications as to what lay down each path, it was up to Minako to decide which way they went.

Nodding toward her companion, Minako opened the door and went inside, Fuuka following closely behind.  Inside lay a walled, stone room similar to the previous room with the spike trap.  This one, however, lacked furniture or features of any kind.  There wasn't even an exit door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No exit?\" Fuuka gasped after seeing only walls surrounding them once the door vanished.  \"We're trapped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure looks that way,\" Minako replied, keeping her hand close to her sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in response to her observation, a trio of black pools seeped upwards from the floor below.  They manifested into a group of cupids, an agile and annoying enemy from the previous labyrinth.  The shadows drew forth, pointing their bows at the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3 shadows!\" Fuuka called out, attempting to concentrate with her persona.  \"Mmm... I can't get a reading, but they feel familiar.  It's likely the same ones from the other labyrinth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Then it's no problem,\" Minako said, feeling very confident.  \"Just stay back and I'll take 'em out quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this shouldn't be too hard for you, Minako.  Go get them!\" Fuuka said, smiling back at her leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako charged forward towards the center shadow, readying her Fire Slash skill.  But as soon as she swung her sword, the cupid dashed back, then flew forward over her head,  beelining with its cohorts as they all charged toward Fuuka.  \"Ah!\" Fuuka screamed in shock, trembling as the cupids readied their bows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka, MOVE!\" Minako cried out desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words just barely got through, releasing the timid girl from her fear just in time for her to dive to the right, barely avoiding the shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep running!  Get as much distance as you can!\" Minako called out as she ran towards the enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka did so, running along the outer wall, only for the shadows to follow suit, ignoring Minako entirely.

Catching up to the shadow nearest her, she swiped with her sword, dispatching the cupid effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One down!\" Minako cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako!  Help!\" Fuuka cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako turned and saw Fuuka backed into a corner of the room, the two shadows pointing their bows directly at her.  \"Shoot!\" Minako swore, dashing toward her cornered comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cupids did just that, leaving Minako cursing her choice of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka flinched, squeezing her eyes shut as the arrows flew toward her... then missed?  Having felt no pain from the attack, Fuuka opened her eyes fearfully, looking down at herself to check for any damage.  The sight of her bare, pale arms told her all she needed to know, but she turned to look at the wall behind her anyway.  The arrows had flown right through her and were now embedded in the walls, having taken her jacket and her sweater with them when they passed through.  Oddly enough, except for where the arrows pierced the garments, there weren't any other signs of damage, not even a giant rip that would have been necessary to pull the clothes off of her while she was still wearing them.  Mystified, Fuuka reached toward her jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka, focus!\" Minako shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka spun back around.  Minako was there, having just run through another cupid, but the third had drawn its bow again.  \"Ah!\" Fuuka squeaked, turning to move as the cupid released its arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" Minako swore, leaping towards the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*SHUNK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SWISH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SQUISH*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the shadow crumble into nothing, Fuuka turned back, then whimpered, noticing that another piece of clothing had been struck by an arrow: namely, a skirt.  She winced and clapped her hands down in front of her, only to find that her skirt was still there.  \"But, then-\" she gasped, and turned toward Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, that was a close one, eh, Fuuka?\" Minako asked, facing her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Minako!  You, um...\" Fuuka said, pointing at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Minako asked, looking down where Fuuka was pointing. \"Oh...\" she blushed as she looked towards the wall.  Sure enough, it was Minako's skirt that got pinned to the wall, leaving her with nothing below her waist except for her pink panties, slightly hidden by the bottoms of her blouse and jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Minako,\" Fuuka said sadly.  \"That must've happened when you protected me at the very end of the fight.  If only I didn't freeze up, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Fuuka, it's all right,\" Minako said, walking over to her friend and placing her hand on the cowering girl's shoulder.  \"This was your first time facing shadows up close, right?  Of course you'd freeze up.  Even Yukari and I did back at the start of the year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\" Fuuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  It's not easy doing what we do.  I just should've seen through them sooner.  I mean, I just lost my skirt, but you...\" Minako drew off, looking at Fuuka.  If it wasn't clear by her temperament alone, Fuuka was not a fighter.  While the rest of Sees was pretty fit physically from all of the shadow-fighting and Tartarus-climbing they all did, Fuuka always stayed behind as support.  Her slim, smooth arms lacked the roughness that the rest of the team had built up, and as for fighting... well, part of that sorry display had to be due to this whole sadistic stripping thing, but still, Minako knew that if it came down to fighting Fuuka's only practical use would be as a decoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the more she looked at the timid technician and her meek stature, the upper part of which was now only covered by a seafoam-green tanktop and a similarly-colored brassiere, as seen through the arm-holes of the sleeveless shirt, she knew she needed to protect her.  Not that she didn't protect her allies at all during their fighting, but they could look after themselves for the most part.  Fuuka, not so much.  Minako would not let this happen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako?\" Fuuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh?\" Minako replied, not realizing she had left the conversation sitting on an awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do better next time!\" Fuuka suddenly shouted.  \"I-It was my first time being so close to them, so I froze a little, but now I know what to expect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka?  Look, don't worry about it,\" said Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not, I mean...\" Fuuka fumbled, trying to find the words.  \"I... know that look.  Please... don't look at me like I'm a burden.  I can- I need to help too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka...\" Minako said, taken aback.  She shook her head.  \"You're right.  We'll get through this place together!  We'll just, um, be more careful the next time Shadows show up, all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Fuuka nodded, then blushed.  \"Um, so is there anything you can do about...\" she pointed down towards Minako, partly averting her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes,\" Minako said stiffening up and turning towards the wall where their clothes were pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the clothes were no longer there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Where did they go?\" Fuuka said, rushing over as soon as she noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako, however, had a feeling that they wouldn't have gotten them back anyway.  \"Okay then... Plan B!\" she said, unbuttoning her jacket.  Pulling it around her waist, she tied the sleeves in a knot and shifted it around, making an impromptu miniskirt.  It didn't quite cover everything in the back, but for the most part her panties were now concealed.  \"There we go, good as new!\" she stood proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's go,\" said Fuuka, pointing towards the door that just appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming to have gotten their energy back, the pair went through and found themselves in a hallway like the previous one, soon coming across another fork.  However, unlike the previous split, this branch had three gigantic signs along the wall.  In the center, above the other two, was written the words \"CHALLENGE TIME\", in big bold letters.

Let's go do the Luck challenge,\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" said Fuuka, nodding her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing through the Luck door, the two found themselves in a box-like room with bright, garishly painted walls.  Once again, the setting was empty save for doors on each of the three other walls.  Across from them was a door similar in size and shape to the one they entered from, not that they could check as their own door vanished after they entered, much like the prior rooms.  The remaining two walls each had a gargantuan gate, with one labeled \"VICTORY\"and was decorated in gaudy stars and halos, while the other was labeled \"DEFEAT\" and appropiately styled with morbid spikes and skulls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" said Minako, taking this all in.  \"Quite a setup they have here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see anything resembling a challenge though,\" said Fuuka, searching every end of the room.  \"What are we supposed to even do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...-\" as Minako began to reply, the far door opened with a loud creaking noise.  Walking through from the other side was a semi-familiar face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto!\" Minako and Fuuka both cried out as they ran toward their comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vice Leader!  And Fuuka as well!\" Naoto replied with shock, and then a small smile.  \"I'm glad to see you're all right, if slightly less dressed than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Um, yeah...\" Fuuka said with a little squeak, crossing her arms in front of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's been surprisingly tough.  But it looks like you've been crushing it, Naoto!  You've only lost your hat!\" said Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly,\" Naoto said, pointing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako looked, not exactly sure what Naoto meant, until she saw the detective's socked feet under her pant legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lack of proper footwear has made progress a little bit slower,\" Naoto continued when she saw Minako's look of understanding.  \"But I am relieved in that it shouldn't be an issue for this next challenge.  That being said, what is this next challenge, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So glad you asked!\" boomed a loud voice that none of them wanted to hear.  Though it was still just the three of them, the labyrinth guardian's presence had returned.  \"And now that you're all together, we can get started!  This luck challenge is the classic game of: 'Rock-Paper-Scissors'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rock-Paper-Scissors?  That's it?\" Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Strip</i> Rock-Paper-Scissors,\" the guardian spoke as if insinuating something while wiggling any eyebrows it may have had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That much was obvious,\" Naoto said with a sigh. \"And I imagine we cannot proceed unless we play.  Now where are our opponents?  Let's get this over with already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's you guys of course!\" said the guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What?\" Fuuka gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what the Challenge rooms are all about!  You split up into groups and everything so I figured, 'Hey, why not have them play against each other?' Pretty genius, wouldn't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whittling down our numbers by pitting us against each other... Is it too much to hope that we are nearing the end already?\" Naoto mused with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get your hopes up too much, this is only the beginning!\" the guardian spoke, with more of an edge to their voice.  \"Since we still have <i>so</i> much to do, this is only a Basic Challenge, which ends after one person loses 3 pieces of clothing, or if one team loses 4 pieces of clothing if the two of you decided to gang up on your smart-aleck friend.  Oh, and there's no switching of teams, so don't thing the two of you can gang up on your gung-ho friend to save yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemper flaring, Minako shouted in response: \"We wouldn't dream of either, you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine,\" Naoto spoke, cutting Minako off.  \"We've gotten some very useful information.  Now we know that we'll be able to advance from this room no matter what happens.  Isn't that right?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrmph!  You think you're so clever!\" the guardian growled.  \"Just choose who's going to fight and get started already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then,\" said Naoto.  \"Are the two of you prepared?\" she asked the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet I am, Naoto,\" Minako replied as she stepped forward. \"Let's do-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Fuuka shouted, grabbing Minako's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka?\" Minako said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako, you've only got half of your clothes left.  If you lose here, you'll only have one piece left!  Counting my shoes as one, I've got six pieces left on me, so let me do this instead!\" Fuuka said pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka... but if you lose, you'll be left half-dressed.  I don't mind if I'm showing off a little bit, or a lot a bit,\" Minako said, blushing a bit as she got a mental image of herself running around wearing only her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako,\" Fuuka spoke grimly.  \"Is this about before?  We talked about this, and I want to help!  I can't fight so something like this is perfect for me.  Let me do my part!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Fuuka...\" Minako winced.  \"Let's go together then, that way we can each only take off too pieces!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to agree with Fuuka, Vice-Leader,\" Naoto interrupted.  \"We still don't know what will happen if someone loses everything, so we should try and avoid that as much as possible.  If we spread out our clothing loss, then there's a greater chance of us making through this labyrinth in one piece.  And even if you each only lose 2 pieces, that leaves you with 2 and Fuuka with 4, which is less advantageous than Fuuka having 3 articles along with your 4, is that not correct?\" said Naoto, matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... ergh...\" Minako struggled.  She couldn't deny Naoto's logic, and she also knew it wasn't right to keep babying Fuuka.  But at the same time, the image of her friend, cowering in either her bra and tights, or shivering in her tanktop and panties, she knew Fuuka couldn't handle that as well as she could.  She used to be bullied before they met, after all.  What if this brought back some of that trauma?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So only one of us should fight...\" said Minako.  \"Then in that case-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>1- Sorry Fuuka, I made the choice to go to this challenge, so I'll take the heat for you.  It's my role as a leader not to let my friends get hurt when I can do something about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2- They're right.  Fuuka can't fight, and her powers don't work as well down here, so this is probably the only way she can really help.

Go Fuuka!\" Minako cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... Well done,\" Naoto nodded.  \"Now, what to- hm?\" she stopped mid-thought, noticing a queer expression on her opponent.  Following her gaze, Naoto jumped with a jolt- her pants had vanished, leaving only her boxers and socks below her waist.  \"What the-!?\" she gasped, blushing as she tried to pull the bottom of her jacket down to cover her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't keep me waiting!\"  the guardian chimed in.  \"If you don't choose what goes off quickly, I get to choose for you~.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrmph,\" Naoto grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... so she even dresses as a boy there too,\" Minako muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has nothing to do with our current situation!\" Naoto spoke loudly, completely flustered.  \"Let's just go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gulp, Minako watched as the other girls prepared themselves for round 2.  Naoto seemed to be getting angry.  Would Fuuka's luck hold?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paper covers rock!  Fuuka wins again!\" went the guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes!\" Fuuka sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erg- huh?\" Naoto grimaced, then gasped, as her jacket blinked away before she could react.  \"What!?  I didn't even have a chance to speak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm not really that patient, bleh!\" the guardian spoke as if it was sticking out a tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" Fuuka winced.  While she was glad that she was keeping her own clothes on, she felt sympathy for Naoto's situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!  Time to finish this!\" Naoto shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really seems pissed now...\" said Minako. \"Come on Fuuka...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more they squared off, once more they threw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And rock smashes scissors, Fuuka wins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Socks!\" Naoto shouted that instant, and was barefoot the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw... just as things were about to get good,\" said the guardian.  \"Whatever.  The challenge is over, so go scoot on through those winner and loser doors.  Perhaps I'll see you again soon~.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it!  Great job, Fuuka!\" Minako cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!  But I feel bad for Naoto, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right, Fuuka,\" said Naoto.  Oddly enough, the blue haired detective, though now only wearing a pair of boxers, a button-up shirt, and presumably at least an undershirt or something under that, she seemed to be carrying herself more comfortably than during the contest.  At the very least she wasn't trying to pull down her shirt for modesty anymore.  \"Now that it's over,\" she continued. \"I have ot say that I'm glad with how this turned out.  The two of you are probably our best shot at taking out the culprit responsible for all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Fuuka said.  \"I thought something was a bit odd.  Did you throw the match for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph,\" Naoto let out a chuckle.  \"If I did something as obvious as that, I doubt that I'd have anything left.  I was thinking extra-hard about my intended actions, but that was all, though the sudden stripping did catch me off guard.  Fuuka, if you did see a tell in movements during the game, perhaps your Persona's not as neutralized as we think it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh!\" said Fuuka, starting to ponder on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should get going now.  Don't want that thing to start getting suspicious.  Fuuka, Vice-Leader, good luck to you both,\"  said Naoto, with an encouraging smile.  She turned and left with more dignity than the other girls expected as she walked through the Loser door, which then shut behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Naoto... so full of surprises,\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Fuuka nodded as well, as the two of them went through the winner's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls found themselves in a hallway much like the other one, and much like that linear passage, this one soon came to a fork as well.  A helpful sign stood at the wall, and its contents were a bit surprising given what was seen so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Congratulations at winning the challenge!  As a little bonus for our winners, you get a choice!  To the left, you'll find a place where you can stock up on clothes, even score some new outfits!  Comes in pretty handy when traveling through this dungeon.  But, if you're feeling fine and dandy as you are, the path to the right will get you to the exit faster.  No tricks, because winners should be rewarded after all.  Have fun!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... oddly helpful,\" Fuuka said after reading the sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" Minako agreed.  \"Seems pretty cut and dry to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More clothes, or getting out of here faster,\" Fuuka said, looking at her bare arms in thought.  \"Both have their advantages, though these could lead to some traps as well.  Even if they're only later on.  Remember the chest from before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhm,\" Minako nodded.  Either way seemed to be positive, and thinking over how things had gone to this point, Minako decided to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>1- How often do we find clothes in dungeons?  Probably as much as a new piece of armor, but that's pretty rare if you think about it.  More clothes equals more survivability.  Better safe than sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2- We should be fine, we've still got over half our clothes left, and a bead if that works like it does normally.  The longer we're here, the more likely it is that we'll end up naked, or worse.

Your jacket!\" Fuuka cried out in surprise as Minako realised her blunder; arrows that would be no threat to her under normal circumstances were apparently more than her jacket could take, and it practically vaporized, leaving her blouse exposed as the shadows lined up more shots on Fuuka.  \"D-don't worry about me, just fight back before they... before they-\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako cursed, now realising just how much danger she was in.

Minako was far from fine, but she couldn't let Fuuka down at this point!  And now she knew the cupids' attack pattern.

After all, she couldn't fight shadows, so what would be the point of even trying?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako... I'm so sorry,\" she wept, as the cupids let loose their arrows, which thudded painlessly into the her body.  The vanishing of her skirt, jacket, and sweater barely registered for her.  She had already given up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SCHWING!  SWISH! SWISH!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Fuuka gasped, opening her eyes at the sudden sound of flashing steel.  She gasped twofold as she saw that Minako had gotten up and slain the shadows!  The last of them was impaled on her sword and bubbling into nothingness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave... Fuuka... ALONE!\" Minako roared, swinging the sword away, as if to shake off blood from a fresh kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Minako!  You're all right,\" Fuuka cried out, relieved.  Sure, she was only wearing her underclothes and a couple of light and translucent articles covering them, and Minako had not a single stitch herself, but who cares, they made it through!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Fuuka?\" Minako asked, turning to face Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-erp,\" Fuuka stopped, face brimming scarlet, unprepared as she was for a sudden full-frontal.  She had expected Minako to cover up with her arms at least a little, but nope, it was all there in front of her.  Her whole body, toned and fit, blade in hand, and not even mentioning her private areas covered until just recently... it reminded her of many a piece she saw at art club.  But she never thought she'd be seeing one of her friends in such... erm... graceful glory.  \"I-I'm fine...\" Fuuka said, tearing her eyes away from Minako's intimate regions.  \"Hey, look!  The exit's appeared!\" she pointed to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't go yet, you're completely feverish.  But I can help with that,\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I-Huh!?\" Fuuka spluttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make you all better...  You're gonna feel sooooo good,\" Minako spoke in a completely different tone of voice, her eyebrows wiggling suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-!  W-W-What are you doing?\" Fuuka squeaked, pressing herself deep into the corner as Minako walked towards her, hips and chest swaying back and forth in a sultry manner.  That walk was disturbing to Fuuka on its own, but what creeped her out more was Minako's expression.  Her mouth was sporting a twisted grin with her tongue sticking out the side, drooling slightly.  Her eyes also unnerving, staring at Fuuka with an intense gaze, far more intense than any bully she had encountered.  Strangest of all was that Fuuka could swear she saw tiny hearts in the middle of Minako's pupils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be shy, now, come to-whoop!\" Minako gasped, slipping on something and falling over backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-?\" Fuuka went, picking up the object Minako slipped on.  It was the bead she was holding onto earlier!  It must have fallen down when Minako's clothes, and therefore any places to hold her items, got destroyed earlier.  She quickly scooped the item up.  It could still have some use, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow... man that hurt.  What happened?\" Minako grunted, sounding more like herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako?\" Fuuka asked warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka?\"  Minako said as she rubbed her head, blinking.  \"My head hurts really bad,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right?\" Fuuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you kiss it better,\" Minako suddenly spoke, in that awful voice from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Fuuka gasped, realizing just what was happening to Minako.  \"You're being charmed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, wouldn't anyone be in front of such a cutie like you~?\" Minako asked lewdly, slowly turning over and crawling toward Fuuka on all fours.  \"Why not just cut loose and have a little fun together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  I mean, I don't see you in that- I mean, you're not even Minako right now are you!?  You're that creepy labyrinth guardian, or whatever it is that's imprisoned us down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, sorry!\" the labyrinth guardian suddenly spoke, her voice booming all around the room.  \"But I did just entice our naked loser friend with a little overpowering compulsion.  She won't be thinking straight anytime soon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I need to get out of here,\" Fuuka said edging away along the wall towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka...\" Minako whined.  \"Come on... please?  This feeling, it's, it's too much!  I can't... satisfy-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEK!  La LA La La LA!  I can't hear this!\" Fuuka said, plugging her ears and drowning out Minako's words.  But she kept her eyes open, which allowed her to see that Minako had dropped her sword and started squeezing her own breast.  And her other arm was starting to get to work downstairs as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP THIS!\" Fuuka shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the guardian had apparently left, the only other sound being Minako and her moaning.  Fuuka could only barely look at the writhing form of her friend, reduced to such a pitiful state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only there was something I can do... that doesn't involve THAT, of course,\" Fuuka groaned, burying her crimson face in her hands.  But then, she remembered!  When Minako had hit her head, she was sane for a moment.  Maybe some more physical blows could shake it off entirely?  She'd have to be careful though, Minako was still stronger than her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, if the guardian was going to ensure she remained that way, it's possible that Minako would remain enticed until the boss was defeated.  But could she really last that long with what she had left?  If it came down to a fight, she'd be as good as dead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka knew she had to do something though, so she quickly thought it over and made her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>1- I can't just leave Minako behind!  I have to try and bring her back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2- I'm sorry Minako, but I need to press on...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Minako: Naked<br>\r\nFuuka: Tights, tanktop, bra, panties<br>\r\nStatus: Charm/Normal<br>\r\nInventory: Bead</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tempted as she was to run away, Fuuka simply could not bring herself to abandon a friend in dire straights. Especially knowing that she was partly responsible for said dire straights. But how could she hope to take on a combat veteran like Minako? She was stronger, faster, and had far better instincts despite her current...distraction. What could Fuuka do to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh. Of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing profusely to herself, Fuuka tentatively lowered herself into a sitting position. On her knees she began to run her hands up and down the space between her legs, at first just rubbing against the fabric but soon enough sneaking her hand underneath her stockings and underwear and into her inner folds. To her surprise and embarrassment (and a tiny bit of guilt) Fuuka found it rather easy to arouse herself...the image of her prone leader writhing on the ground, so very naked and so overwhelmed with desire...no, it wasn't difficult at all. All the while, Fuuka kept her other hand behind her back, gripped tightly around a certain piece of equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako....\" Fuuka moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the red head's eyes shot open and she turned her head to stare at the other girl. Fuuka blushed but continued her display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...come...take me...\" Fuuka moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a leopard pouncing on its prey Minako wasted no time in flinging herself in Fuuka's direction. The movement was almost too fast to track. Fortunately, Fuuka was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Persona!\" Fuuka screamed, firing off the Invoker in her other hand. Instantly she found herself contained in the familiar blues walls of her Persona. A split second later saw Minako colliding full force with entity that now formed a solid barrier between her and the object of her desperate affections. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUseless for combat and its senses blind in this Labryrinth, Lucia was still not entirely useless. She made an effective way of turning Minako's strength back on itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDIsmissing her Persona, Fuuka rushed to the side of her nude friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako! Can you hear me?\" Fuuka whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Minako cried the lusty voice of her charmed self. Fuuka screamed in alarm as the horny girl wrapped her arms around her waste and twisted the pair around so that she was straddling Fuuka. \"That was MEAN, Fuuka-chan! Teasing me....tricking me....Your a bad girl! I LIKE it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Persona!\" Fuuka cried, the Invoker still in her left hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Persona appeared again, this time around her AND Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not following for it twice, Fuuka-chan. But this is a nice little intimate space! We can get to know each other real well like this! Now, I'm....gonna....\" Minako mumbled, her eyes suddenly fluttering as she collapsed on top of Fuuka, her face buried in the tank top's cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka could feel her heartbeat pounding in her chest. After a moment she attempted to move the prone girl and found the task quite impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooo.\" Fuuka said. \"This isn't fair! Wasn't she supposed to be dieting? How could she be this heavy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody's perfect.\" Minako said dryly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka squeeked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was clever.\" Minako said dreamily. \"Also, it hurt. A lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....that was mostly your fault.\" Fuuka said with a smile. \"Do you...remember what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit. I was fighting....I lost my clothes...and...I...tried to kiss you!\" Minako blushed a bright red and tried to sit up, only to moan in pain and flopped back on top of her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes...well...now that your back to normal....\" Fuuka said with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't think its that simple.\" Minako whispered. \"I'm feeling....really strange. Like that night at the love hotel...Junpei and the shower....I keep...thinking dirty thoughts. Its...getting hard not to act on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way Minako was looking at her made Fuuka blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but what else can I do?\" Fuuka asked in dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako gave her a hungry smile. \"You already know the answer to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Fuuka squeeked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's probably only one way to 'cure' me, Fuuka. This place is run by a creepy pervert! He's probably waiting with baited breath right now hoping I tear off what's left of your clothes and...ummm...sorry. Getting distracted! L-look!\" Minako gently grasped Fuuka's hand. \"This isn't an easy thing to ask, okay? But we have a bond already...I've already seen you at your best and worst! No matter how embarrassing it gets in here...no matter what we decide to do...that won't change. And...I...I could really use your help right now! But I don't want that unless you would enjoy it too. So...your choice! Run away now and I'll...uh...cope with things as best I can. No hard feelings, I promise. Or...stay and...have fun with me! Just...pick the option you won't regret!\"</span></div></div>",

In truth, she was more than a little apprehensive. Her shadow had been bad enough and when she had seen Rise's shadow she realized just how bad it <i>could</i> have been. She had no intention of having her clothes ripped off in this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I suppose now we have to choose how we're doing this,\" Mitsuru said, resigned. \"In pairs or alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, like the lady said, going alone would mean we'd cover the most area,\" Yukari offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's true, but some of us have no experience in dungeons like this,\" Rise piped up. \"I know I'd feel better going with someone else. Not to mention having two people might give us advantages at whatever challenges we'd face, or...well...if worse comes to worse we can share clothing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rise's last point brought everyone back to the reality they were facing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, we don't all have to do the same thing,\" Minako said. \"Some of us can go alone while others pair up. There's no rule against that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, but the small group size allotments are bothering me,\" Naoto chimed in. \"At best, it's an obvious attempt to avoid us finding strength in numbers, making us easier prey for whatever is in there. However, I'm worried there might be a far more insidious reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you mean?\" Fuuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well say a person or persons go through a door and there's only one other exit and then say another person or team comes in. Only two can leave through a door, so...\" Naoto offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You think the mysterious guardian here would want us to compete against one another in such an instance,\" Margret cut in, flipping her silver hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Precisely,\" Naoto responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm, yes. We didn't hear much from her, but that's something that would definitely not surprise me,\" Mitsuru said, looking troubled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well then we wouldn't play her game!\" Chie said, impassioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then we'd run into the same problem we have now. None of us want to go forward, but if we don't we simply languish here. Possibly forever. If we wanted any chance to make it through to save the group, we wouldn't have much choice...\" Naoto said. The girls all paused in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"All can say is that I hope you're wrong, Naoto,\" Minako said. \"But even still we have to press forward. Anyone who wants to pick a partner should right now. Otherwise...pick a door. We can do this, guys. It may seem bad now, but we've been through bad scrapes before. We can do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And with that the group began to disperse. Yukiko now had her own choice to make. Go with a partner or try to strike out on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>1. -If you know Chie, she's gonna run off without thinking trying to beat up whoever is responsible. She probably won't even look where she's going. If she's not going to watch out for herself, you'll have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. -Rise doesn't know how to fight in dungeons like this. Plus, her shadow already tried to show off Rise's body once. She could use some backup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. -You can take care of yourself, and the more people looking for the exit, the better.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yukiko: Loafers, pantyhose, red cardigan, blouse, skirt, bra, panties</b><br>\r\n<b>Status: Normal</b><br>\r\n<b>Inventory: (Empty)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(Game Tip: Having a partner means you have to worry about two girls' clothing count, but it also means you'll have help and can share clothes between one another to preserve as much modesty as possible.)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(Game Tip: In the labyrinth sometimes you'll come across challenge rooms where your girl or your team will have to go against a competing girl or team. There are two types of challenge rooms: \"basic\" and \"all out.\" In basic, the challenge ends when one girl has lost three pieces of clothing or one team has lost four collectively. In all out, the game only ends when the competing girl or team is totally naked. The losing girl or team is punished. The challenges very from room to room. It might be something as basic as rock, paper, scissors, or as physical as actively trying to remove a competitor's clothes by force.)</b></span></div></div>",

There they met two young teens their age, Rei and Zen, who had lost their memories. The teams joined forced and set to explore the labyrinths in the dimension to help their two new friends and eventually escape themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a girls-only party goes awry and the ladies end up in a mysterious and troubling new labyrinth, they must find a way to escape or they'll end up totally naked and at the mercy of the forces that control the maze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Take control of a girl and guide her through the maze, while trying to keep her modesty intact. Will you make it, or will she be exposed for all to see?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Basic Rules</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-</b>Write each choice from the perspective of the girl (3rd person is still okay). Don't say what the next challenge might be. Stick to keeping the choices based on things the character would understand, like: go left or go through the door. <i>Don't</i> write choices like: \"a clothes eating slime attacks her.\" It's fine if that's what happens, just don't spoil that in the choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-</b>At the end of each chapter, make sure to post the current status of the character or characters you are currently following. This includes their current clothing and any important items they may be carrying, like spare clothes or a key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-</b>A girl's clothing acts like her HP meter, so try not to deplete it all at once. \"Failing\" obstacles should strip it little by little. She might find new sets along the way. Maybe they're normal. Maybe they're cosplay. Maybe they're embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-</b>Do your best to be descriptive when a girl loses her clothes. Describe how they come off. Talk about her body, what's underneath what was lost, etc. That's a big part of the story, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-</b>Girls can venture forth alone or with a partner. When you work with a partner you have two clothing counts to worry about, but the girls can share clothes between themselves to try and stay modest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-</b>When you play as a guy you can either go alone, in which case they brave the stripping labyrinth same as the girls (hey, its only fair), or they go with a female partner in which case it's their job to keep their female companion dressed. Whether or not the men lose clothes in that instance is up to the writer. This is the way to go if you're in to NTR, or maybe just want a risque romantic comedy story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-</b>Once a girl (or lone guy) is stripped naked, it's game over. Write a game over scene about what happens to them then end the branch. If you're playing as a male with a female companion, it's game over once the girl is naked. Write a scene accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-</b>A game over scene can be any number of things, ranging from the fairly tame (such as simply being teleported to a place where the girl can be seen by her friends, tickle torture, being tied up, etc) to the more extreme (forced to masturbate in some way, forced interactions between the other girls and guys or even letting shadows have their way with her). It all depends on the current mood of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>I Accept All Content Except:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>-</b>Growth/Shrink<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>-</b>Scat, piss or farting<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>-</b>Vore or unbirth<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>-</b>Violent gore, torture or death (BDSM is totally fine and even encouraged)</td>",
