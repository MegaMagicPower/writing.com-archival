For the next 5 years, you stayed with Ignis in his home in the Fire Plains, learning how to control fire magic. But this wasn't just any fire magic -- this was the great Ignis' fire magic.

That's Erik,\" introduces the girl. \"He's as cold as the magic he uses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" yells the Ice mage, causing you both to laugh. You then think back to what Ally says about her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A spirit user huh?</i> You think to yourself. You've heard of them before. They're wizards that collect special keys that summon other beings such as golems to aid them. That's a pretty neat kind of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, back to the missing woman,\" speaks up Erik. \"From what some members in our guild told us, there's been a group of thieves hanging out in the forest and robbing those they come across. There's a chance they may have come across the person we're looking for and decided to capture her. I think our best bet is to find their camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next 2 hours, you three navigate through the forest. By now, the moon is shining bright in the sky.

It may be the thieves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, it is. Soon, you all find yourselves hiding behind a large shrub from a group of 6 men.

Perhaps the dragon wonders why you do not have a home, but it doesn't seem to be suspicious of you. It takes a step back and waves its tail which, in a flash, turns into a magnificent mid-air river flowing around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is <i>Stagna</i>,\" it says. \"If you don't have a place you belong to, you can come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou contemplate for a little while before...</span></div></div>",

This has been your dream for 3 years - besides reuniting with Ildirim of course - and you feel you're finally ready to take on the admission exam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder what it'll be</i>, you think as you walk down the streets of Magnolia, the town where Janus resides. <i>From what I've heard, less than 20 people are admitted every year. Is the test really that hard?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn the corner and immediately stop and gawk. At the end of the street was a tall, gigantic 2-story building made of stone. The entrance bears a sign that reads 'Janus' and past that is are wooden double doors. At the very top of the building is a large bell. This is it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is Janus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a renewal of spirit, you speed down the street with your backpack and suitcase in hand, excited to finally meet the guildmaster of Janus, Master Caerus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reach the wooden double doors, and with a creak, you open it. To your astonishment, the interior looks even spacier than the exterior. In the middle of the building is what resembles a cafeteria, fill with benches and wooden tables and the guild members who look like they're all having a great time. From the inside, the building is supported by massive wooden beams that are station at each corner of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take all this in by bits and pieces. Because you are too distracted by the sheer vastness and the liveliness of the place, you don't notice someone approaching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember you being a member of Janus,\" comes a smooth, deep voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your head to the source of the sound. To your surprise, you see a tall dark-haired teenager a few years older than you. He looks down at you with a stoic expression. \"State your purpose,\" he instructs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to join Janus,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy blinks twice before his face softens. \"Follow me,\" he says. \"I'll take you to our guild master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not like you have a choice, so you follow him as he heads upstairs. A few minutes later, you arrive at the front of Master Caerus' office. The guy knocks firmly and is answered with a 'Come in'. He opens the door, leans inside slightly, and speaks, \"Master, we have someone that wishes to join the guild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door flings open, barely missing the tall teenager, and reveals an elderly man with a white beard and a purple robe. He looks at you with bright eyes and motions you in. \"Come, come! Take a seat!\" he exclaims, quite cheerful for someone that could be your grandfather's age. He then looks at the dark-haired male. \"Thank you, Xavier. You may go now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Xavier' bows his head lightly before leaving the room. You look back at Master Caerus who gazes upon you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you wish to join!\" he bellows. \"I'm pleased. However, before you can become a member of our guild, you must answer some questions about yourself and pass our admission test. First question!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe goes on for 5 minutes, asking you basic questions such as 'What is your name\", \"How old are you\", and \"What type of mage are you\". Then it comes down to the last question: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you wish to accomplish in your life?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You also learned advanced necromancy, how to possess others, and immunity to soul drain. For all your magical prowess however, the only thing you had for yourself when it came to physical hand to hand combat was high dexterity, flexibility, and an uncanny ability to evade almost every single attack.

Actually you needed a lack of mana for your Void spells. See, though you were a medical genius, you weren\u2019t much of a fighter. No, instead you were more like a Pure support type only skilled at evasion and self taught in guerrilla warfare. To take care of yourself you formed a dark guild based solely on the principles of true companionship and the power of friendship with your 2 best friends, a female celestial wizard and a non mage alchemist. The Dark Guild was called Faery Tael.  Next you and your friends begin supporting whoever could pay you guys the most.<br>\r\n</span></span></span></div></div>",
