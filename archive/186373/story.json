What the hell happened?\u201d you think to yourself. \u201cThe last thing I remember\r<br>\nwas buying a pack of Mentos from the newsstand on my way to work this morning!\u201d\r<br>\nYou manage to get to your feet and look around. You are standing on a platform at an\r<br>\nunfamiliar subway station. There isn\u2019t a soul in sight. The station looks like a crumbling\r<br>\nrelic of a time gone by, like something out of a post-nuclear sci-fi movie. The only signs of\r<br>\ncivilization are a couple of rats gnawing at the contents of an overturned trash bin. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter the initial shock of unfamiliarity, you begin to calm down. You revel in the quiet and\r<br>\nsolitude, you always were a loner, even as a child. After your father walked out when you\r<br>\nwere only ten, your mother routinely left you home alone at night while she went out to\r<br>\nearn enough money to pay the rent on your roach infested apartment. Being too poor to\r<br>\nhave a television, you often fell asleep with the music of the local progressive jazz station\r<br>\nand monotone droning of their announcer for company... \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou decide to end your daydream and start walking. You have two options: at one end of the platform is a narrow dimly lit corridor, at the other a wide staircase leading downward. The faint sound of a saxophone drifts up from the stairwell. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Right or wrong, boy, make a decision!\" Your father's words echo in your head. He\u2019d always made his choices on the spur of the moment, probably including the day he'd\r<br>\nabandoned his family. \r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Rats are no strangers to you, having fed one that lived under your kitchen sink table scraps as a boy, being careful not to let your mother catch you at it. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Rats are filthy beasts!\" she had said, but she wouldn't allow you to have any other pets.\r<br>\nShe\u2019d  even refused to let you keep a poor starving mongrel pup you had once found.\r<br>\n\"Just what we need around here, another mouth to feed. Get rid of it right now, or you\r<br>\nwon't be having any supper!\" She had said.

You didn't feed that dog, so he left,\" your mother said. \"Dogs are the same as\r<br>\npeople, they all want something. You might think they're your friends, but if you don't give\r<br>\nthem what they want they'll leave you.\" \r<br>\n\"Is that what happened with daddy?\" you asked. You can still feel the sting of the back of\r<br>\nher hand across your face in reply.

And good luck, my man!\" Darrel says.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cThanks.\u201d you reply.\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",
