            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a rainy Tuesday afternoon. Joe sat in his room and cleaned the shoes of his older sister Sarah, a pair of very well worn high heels. While cleaning them he held the shoes as far away from him as possible, in order to prevent himself from smelling the stench coming out of them. It was unbelievable. He could still smell the strong thick aroma of stale sweat and worn out synthetic material as if the shoes were right under his nose. The stench was so strong that Joe imagined the waves of steam coming out of the heels and spreading in his room. The longer he stared at the shoes, the more he was certain to be really able to see flickering air around them. Joe wished he could just throw away these stinking things, run away and be free to do whatever he wanted to do, but he knew that this wasn't possible anymore. Like so often lately, Joe's thoughts carried him away to his memories about how his life had been before and how everything had come to this. Once again the events of the last months passed in his mind's eye...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome months ago, Joe had lived the normal life of a normal thirteen year old boy. He had visited a local school, where he always had received good grades and he had played in a successful hockey team. His family had been quite normal and unspectacular \u2013 Joe and his sister had lived together with their mother since their father had died in a plane crash. Joe and his seventeen years old sister had been fighting at times, but overall they had been living together dearly. Jessica, their thirty-five years old mother always had cared for both her children and worked hard to earn enough money for the family (she had been waitress, after the plane crash she started as teacher).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, everything changed. The family had been watching TV (some bad comedy), when suddenly the program was disrupted by breaking news. The reporter explained that the government had been changed dramatically, that the ultra feminist party was on top now and that everyone had to expect a lot of drastic social changes in the country. Joe and his family hadn't been taken this message too serious, his sister just mocked: \u201cHaha, Joe, seems life could become a lot more complicated for you now!\u201d Little had they known back then, how complicated it would become later. Two weeks after the news, the things had started to get serious. Joe had been in school, when a lot of police and SSS cars with activated sirens rushed the school yard. The officers had stormed the school and declared that the \u201cBill 48\u201d established by the \u201cFeminist Republic of Stenchlandia\u201d from now on prohibited any presence of male persons in the educational system, sports clubs or any other associations. Then every male person, students, teachers, just everyone, had been escorted home by police or SSS officers. Just before Joe had entered a police car, he had seen that even Harvey, the old caretaker was escorted by four SSS women. Surprisedly, he had started to shout and struggle but against four trained SSS officers he had had no chance. They had forced him in a van with darkened windows and just before the door was shut and the van had driven away, Joe had heard some muffled screams of Harvey and these screams had been so intense that Joe had turned away shocked and with a perseverative goose flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly two days later everything had become even worse. Joe hadn't left the house since the proclamation of \u201cBill 48\u201d and in the afternoon the family was visited by a woman from the local administration office. She had informed the family about a new law called \u201cBill 66\u201d, which gave human rights for male persons like Joe the state \u201cnot obligatory\u201d and which endowed women to use males as footslaves. At first, Joe and his family hadn't been able to believe that this was actually happening and true. For some weeks they had been living as if nothing had happened until the Smiths, their neighbours, had been deported by the SSS. In an early Thursday morning, some agents just had entered the Smith's house, arrested the parents and taken them and their children away in separated vans. This sight had caused Joe's mother Jessica to panic for the first time. She had called him and Sarah in the kitchen and told them that it was absolutely necessary to pretend to like the new government. Else the same thing that had happened to the Smith's could happen to Joe, Sarah and Jessica. She then had turned to Joe and said: \u201cI am very sorry honey but this means that whenever we have guests or are in public, we need to pretend to be good citizens. As much as I hate it, we will have to humiliate you and treat you like a footslave. I know it will be hard for you Joe, but always remember that it will be much better than getting caught by the SSS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since this day, Joe's life had been horrible. His mother always had been doing her \u201cjob\u201d treating him like a worthless little servant whenever guests or controlling officers from the new administration were there. She had humiliated him, made him smell her stinky feet or invited the guests to do so. But when the visitors had been out of the house, she always apologized and the first couple of times she even cried. In contrast his sister Sarah soon had learned to enjoy being able to dominate her brother with governmental legitimacy. She had invented the \u201cStinky-Saturday\u201d for Joe, which meant that she would invite friends over every Saturday to tie up and gag Joe and to make him sniff their rank feet. Of course Joe hadn't had accepted this cruelty just like that and complained about it. But when Jessica had asked Sarah to stop, she just had said: \u201cWhy should we stop? Look mom, I know you love your son and that's okay, but the more we look like strict feminists to our neighbours, the less is the chance that we get problems with the government!\u201d Jessica still hadn't liked this idea, but at least she had been convinced that it only would do good to the family's reputation and so she had apologized to Joe and said that he had to just tough it out until the social situation improved again. \u201cAnd that's it\u201d, Joe thought to himself, \u201cthat's how you turn a happy boy with a normal life into a worthless, serving piece of shit! If I ever get my normal life back, I will...\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>WHAM! All of a sudden, Joe's thoughts were interrupted by his sister Sarah who pushed the door to his room open and rushed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey little brother, or better, slave! How are my high heels doing? Are you finally done cleaning them?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cEerrrh yes sis..eerrh I mean yes mistress!\u201d, Joe answered, \u201cI think they are clean now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHo-hum, you think?!\u201d, Sarah chuckled, \u201clet's see..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her shoes out of Joe's hands and examined them intensively. \u201cHmmm, looks like you have done a great job, slave. They are shiny enough to wear them at the party tonight. But oh wait, I just saw you didn't clean the inside. Didn't I tell you to clean the inside?!\u201d Joe looked down to the ground and made a face. \u201cI am afraid you did so, Sar..erh mistress\u201d, he mumbled. Sarah smirked dangerously and whispered: \u201cI thought so.\u201d Then she grabbed Joe by his hair and pulled his face up. \u201cLook me in the eyes when I talk to you slave, okay?! And you will clean the inside now. Are we clear?\u201d Joe grimaced with pain and asserted that he would clean the inside of her high heels immediately. He wanted to pick up his cleaning utensils but Sarah chipped in with: \u201cAh-ah-ah..not like that. You didn't do your job properly before so I need to punish you a bit. You will clean the inside of my high heels with your tongue!\u201d Joe's face went pale and he begged: \u201cNo, please no Sarah, that's not necessary. I will not forget it the next time, I promise..\u201d but Sarah just barked: \u201cDo it now! Or I will make it even more uncomfortable for you! My friends have time on other days than Saturday as well!\u201d Joe gulped and looked inside the high heels, where the constant wearing and sweating had imprinted his sister's soles in the leather. Now, while he lowered his face, the smell of a cheesy sweat and synthetic material mixture assaulted his nostrils again and his stomach already started to revolve. Then he gave the inside of the high heels the first lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp aroma overwhelmed his sense of taste and Joe gasped in disgust. He tasted almost every possible flavour at once: sour, bitter, salty and even slightly sharp and sweet notes. As he started his second lick, he heard Sarah comment: \u201cYes, that's right slave..eeeewww, your tongue starts to get grey because of my dirty insoles. Keep going..\u201d By now Joe felt completely sick and he wanted to spit the horrible taste out of his mouth but his sister guessed Joe's intentions and ordered: \u201cNow swallow, slave. I want to see you eat what you forgot to clean!\u201d Joe was really panicking now. He knew that he would throw up for sure if he would really swallow the grimy mixture of cold sweat and dirt on his tongue. On the other hand he didn't know what his sister had in store for him if he kept being disobedient. Just when Joe was about to force himself to swallow, the door to his room was opened again ans his mother Jessica entered. \u201cThere you are! Finally I found you. But what are you doing there?!\u201d Before Joe could speak up, his sister Sarah answered. \u201cJoe is cleaning my shoes. He keeps forgetting to clean the inside as well, so I decided to teach him a little lesson. I forced him to clean it with his tongue.\u201d Jessica glared angrily at her daughter and said: \u201cSarah, I really appreciate that you take making us look like extreme feminists so seriously. But recently I have the feeling that you make your brother suffer more than he deserves it and more than it's necessary. I will not tolerate that, is that clear?!\u201d Sarah made a caught face and tried to defend herself but Jessica interrupted her. \u201cI asked you, if it was clear that you stop torturing your own brother more than necessary!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine!\u201d, Sarah barked offended, \u201cBut then it's your fault if the SSS will arrest us all!\u201d. With these words she swept out of the room. Joe finally was able to spit out and looked up to his mother. \u201cThank you mom.\u201d Jessica sat down and gave her son a fast and careful hug, almost as if she was doing something criminal. \u201cNo need to say thank you, honey. I am your mother and I will try to protect you as good as I can. Just don't be too hard with your sister. I know she is not treating you fairly, but I am sure she just takes her duty to pretend to like the new system a bit too serious. She is seventeen, an age where life is not easy anyways. But the reason why I came to you right now was not to talk with you about Sarah. Next week we will do something together as family but there will be other people as well. You know what that means for you. I'm telling you this now, so you can prepare yourself. We will... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You just go visit them alone, ma.\" Jessica sighed deeply and looked to the ground, shifting around uncomfortably. \"No, see we have to do this together... To be completely honest with you, Sweetie, we have a bit of a problem.\" \"What? Why?\" \"You see, despite your sisters... efforts... Some of the SSS members aren't convinced that we fit that well into their views of a perfect family. You have... heard what happened to our neighbours, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe gulped heavily. \"Y-Yes... Yeah, I have...\" Jessica sighed again. \"It's such a shame. They are such good people, they never did any harm, to anybody. God knows what those sick monsters- Ahhh, ahh, I mean the SSS agents-\" Joe rolled his eyes. \"You can speak openly to me, mom. Really.\" Jessica squint her eyes and bent forward, before whispering to her son. \"The walls have <i>ears</i>, Joe. The government is everywhere.\" Then she swiftly returned to speaking normally. \"As I was saying... The SSS members might be taking rather... drastic measures with our former neighbours, right now, so! We have to make sure to make a good impression ourselves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe shook his head quickly and scratched the back of his head. \"Yeah, yeah, I know, but what does that have to do with your friends?\" \"Well, one of them has ties to the SSS... Her sister is actually a highly ranked officer. Because of her, I know that the SSS is playing to inspect many households in this area...\" Joe's face went pale, and Jessica nodded. \"Yes, this includes ours. Of course, if we managed to please them, then we wouldn't have to go through the same misery as <i>them</i>. But we can't take any risks. More importantly, them coming here would mean bad news for you specifically, Joe... They would not only watch and judge over your service to Sarah's and my feet, but they would most likely make your smell and lick their own feet, as well. They typically send teams of three to four women, and some of the SSS members have worse feet than I do, so... I really want to spare you that, honey...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe could feel his breathing speeding up. Those were bad news, alright. When would the good part come? \"Well... Yeah, that does sound pretty bad. But how can visiting your friends prevent that?\" Jessica breathed in sharply. \"Remember my friend who'se sister is the SSS officer? Her name is Katherina, by the way. Well, she offered me to make sure her siser will know of our loyalty. But of course, she won't do that for free. This is why we will have to visit her, and bring you along, specifically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe made a dumb look. \"I am... not sure I follow.\" Jessica sighed heavily once more and started to rub her forehead with her left hand frantically. \"Joe... it pains me to say this, but... She's expecting you to take care of her feet. If you do a good job, she'll tell her sister that the inspection won't be necessary, due to her high rank, she will be able to make sure they don't come to our home.\" \"But... but... hold on a moment!\" Joe said with horror. \"You said... some friends and colleagues, right? There will be more than one?\" \"I am... afraid so...\" \"And let me guess... They all have incredibly disgusting, smelly feet?\" \"I... am not entirely sure about that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe suddenly got angry and jumped up. \"This is ridiculous! You expect me to endure the stinking feet of several women, just for their amusement, when it's not even guaranteed that it will spare us the SSS visit?\" \"Please, Joe! I know I am asking much, but it would spare Sarah and me for sure, if it works out...\" Joe made a disgusted sound. \"Bah! For you, maybe... But that bitch Sarah can go to hell for all that I care.\" \"Joe! She is my daughter as well! Don't you dare speaking about her that way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe could feel his anger growing. \"She is a monster, needlessly filled with cruelty and hate and also batshit insane, and you know it! I don't see why she, above all people should be protected! I say let her taste a bit of her own medicine... Maybe that would do that fucking bitch some good- Ahhh!\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I <i>told you</i> not to speak of Sarah that way! This isn't even about the SSS and their laws right now... I will <i>not</i> tolerate you speaking about your sister like that! I am warning you one last time...\" Jessica uttered angrily, and brought her large foot, still safely confined in a shiny, black leather shoe, right next to Joe's head. \"...If you insult Sarah one more time, I will make you smell my feet right now. You simply <i>must</i> learn to abide to our new rules, and I think that would be an appropriate method to teach you a lesson... Not to mention, a powerful one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe blinked quickly, in surprise. He was completely taken aback, and hardly registered what was going on. His mother was pretty much the last one left on <i>his</i> side! She couldn't suddenly take the other side, not like this. \"What... Mom! What are you thinking?\" \"Do you think I won't do it, Joe?\" Joe's face suddenly went pale. This had just sounded so terribly wrong. \"I've been thinking... Maybe I was too shy about that whole method. Perhaps Sarah had the right idea, all along.\" \"Mom! Stop it!\" \"After all... I AM doing it for the sake of our whole family... in the end, it will profit you as well, Joe... We just can't risk having you talk rubbish like that in front of other people. If I have to... I will make sure you learn your lesson. I will ask you now... Do you think your sister has smelly feet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe looked very much frightened at first, then his expression hardened into one of irritated anger. \"What's that supposed to mean? Stop... holding me down like that...\" Jessica had started to put one hand on her son's chest, her superior weight easily forced him to the ground. His struggle was futile. \"Ugh... Damnit. Yeah! Yes, of course! Her feet stink horribly, why do you even ask?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediatly after that, a broad smirk appeared on Jessica's face... Witnessing that sent shivers down Joe's spine; He never saw his mother look at anybody in such a way. \"It's because... if you think Sarah's feet are bad... Then you have no... And I mean <b><i>NO</i></b> idea what seriously smelly feet are like.\" Joe's gaze nervously shifted back from his mother's foot, which was steadily shifting around in its leathery confines, to the strange look on her face. \"You can't... You can't seriously mean...\" He stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I am of course, talking about my own feet.\" Joe panicked instantly. This was bad. He <i>KNEW</i> that Jessica had absolutely deadly feet. He would simply have to convince her not to go through with her crazy plan... Easy, right? Argh... If only he hadn't talked shitty about his sister like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... But I know your feet, mom! I... I mean... If you, when you are... Well, when you come home and you take your... shoes off...\" Joe had to gulp loudly. \"I mean, it is kind of bad, I have to admit. But nothing like Sarah's feet! Trust me, I have smelled those more than once!\" To Joe's horror, Jessica simply sighed and shook her head. \"But this is exactly the thing, darling. Sarah has made you smell her feet up-close, for hours. With my own, you were maybe close to them for seconds, at best... Or you smelled them across the room. And don't give me that look, I know you noticed the smell! But the thing is... You never really <i>sniffed</i> my feet. And since even making you smell Sarah's feet... Which I have to admit, are relatively strong smelling... If even that has no effect on you, maybe we just have to give you something worse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe was panicking again. It wasn't working. His mom... His own mother couldn't seriously be thinking about making him smell her tired, sweaty feet? They both knew how bad they would be! \"No! Stop this... This... This is insane!\" \"<i><b>DO YOU THINK I WANT TO DO THIS???</b></i>\" Jessica suddenly exploded, tears streaming down her face. Her sudden explosion made Joe go entirely silent. He looked at horror at his mother, who was now sobbing over him, still holding him down securely with one hand. \"You couldn't imagine how horrible this is... To harm your own child, to save both your children. If I had to sacrifice myself for your good... I would do it instantly! For you, or for Sarah... I would waste not a single thought! But there is no way... If you continue to be like that, they will take us... They will take us all... And I have to do everything in my might to prevent this. I am sorry, Joe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe's expression was absolutely horrified, every bit of anger was gone. His mother was outright crying right now. \"I'm so sorry. I just hope you can forgive me one day. But after smelling my feet now, you won't ever say things like these again, and both Sarah and you will be a whole lot safer...\" \"Mom... Mommy. Mother! Please... Don't do this!\" Joe gasped. Jessica ignored his pleadings entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just giving you a fair warning, right away. You are aware of the fact that I have always had incredibly sweaty feet. Even if it wasn't  hot, my feet would sweat incredibly much. And as such, their smell was strong, too. Now, today... I just got home from work, and even though the weather is rainy, I was working in warm, damp classrooms for many hours, sweating like a pig. And needless to say, my feet never had a chance to escape their shoes. It will be bad, Joe... Even for my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Let me go! I won't ever say these things again! Just don't... Don't make me smell your feet, mom!\" Jessica shook her head, sadly. \"I'm afraid I will have to make sure of that, honey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout losing another word, Jessica lifted her feet up, so that they were hovering right above Joe's terrified face... Before grabbing her shoes with both hands and pulling them off with one smooth move, making an audible, squishing noise. Her naked, bare feet were revealed to Joe, centimetres from his face... And even though Joe had already known how her feet looked like, they revealed themselves to him in all their terrifying glory! Their long, high arches were smooth and spotless as ever, but their surface was incredibly wet with fresh sweat, so much that it actually looked shiny. Her long, thick toes were completely covered in sweat as well, and as she moved them around a bit, a few drops fell all over the place, some brushing against the skin of Joe's cheeks, making him shiver in repulsion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the worst thing of the situation hit Joe. The smell. The hot, moist wall of air hit Joe's face like falling bricks and instantly, his entire head was trapped in a vile cloud of incredibly thick, strong foot stench. As he took even the slightest breath through his nose, he felt the vile fumes burning in his lungs and making his stomach twist. To make matters worse, Jessica was now pressing her huge, dripping soles down on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was struggling helplessly as Jessica's dominating feet covered it completely, blasting his sense of smell with endless waves of reeking footstench. It smelled with stale sweat, strong, spicy cheese and a hint of something sour, like vinegar... All around, the typical smell of unwashed, female feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica watched her son's power steadily fading beneath her smothering, hot feet, she couldn't help but shed a few tears. Her hot, slick soles were glueing themselves against her sons face now, even with their incredibly smooth and soft texture, it was hard to move them around. The stench was outerworldly, even Jessica had to notice that, and she wasn't the one with those horrible feet stuck to her face! Sooner of later, Joe would pass out for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting knocked out by his own mother's reeking, overworked feet was terrible enough for Joe... But the question is, what will happen after that?</span></div></div>",

And her trick had worked, she had seen and heard everything. \"That little shit... 'Talking about your sister in that way'... What did that filthy little parasite say about me? Damnit... Even though mom punished him already... I might have to help a bit with that, hehe. But not right now...\" She hissed quietly as she was walking away quickly from the door, which opened just a few seconds later, with her mother coming out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah? Are you around here somewhere? I need to talk to you, real quickly!\" Jessica's cries rang out, but Sarah was heading for her room, not wishing to speak with her mom right now. \"I can't, I'm busy.\" Was her only response. Jessica remained silent for a moment, then the sound of a palm hitting a forehead could be heard loudly. \"Oh! Oh right, you're preparing for your party, I almost forgot.\" Sarah froze for a moment and gasped. She had forgotten about that, herself. Just because of Joe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! You said you would get me there, didn't you? We'll be going to Cassandra's place... You remember where that is, right?\" \"Yes, yes... No problem. But remember, I won't be able to pick you up later on, I have to get up really early tomorrow.\" \"Don't worry, I can find back home myself.\" \"I'm serious, Sarah! I don't want you wandering around on your own in the middle of the night...\" \"Oh please, mom. Ever since the SSS started patrolling the streets 24/7, street crime has been virtually non-existant. Every good woman should know that, mom. It's another proof of how our system is the best!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Sarah was beaming again. Talking about the system usually put her in good spirits. \"But it's quite a distance. It's definitely too far for you to walk-\" \"What? Do you think I can't even walk that distance? Pah, I can make it in 20 minutes!\" Jessica groaned in frustration. \"I doubt that. You know I like to go for a run sometimes on weekends, and a place that far ago will take at least 30 minutes on foot... If you're running, remember that!\" \"Yes, you were running. And, no offense, but I'm much younger than you. I can beat that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shook her head. She was starting to feel tired of this. \"Alright, whatever, do as you please. But didn't you have your high heels cleaned especially for tonight?\" \"Uhhh... yeah??? That's because I'm planning to wear them tonight?\" Sarah barked while making an exceptionally irratated and clueless face. Jessica grit her teeth. More than anything, she didn't like it when people said sentences that weren't questions so that they sounded like them. She personally thought it made them sound rather stupid. Maybe that was because she was also a teacher, but she wouldn't tell that to Sarah outright...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So don't you see the problem, Sarah? You can't run for such a <i>long</i> distance, in the middle of the <i>night</i>, in this terrible <i>rain</i>, while wearing these blasted <i><b>HIGH HEELS</b></i> of yours!\" Jessica almost shouted. She was usually good at keeping her patience, but today had been stressful, especially the last minutes with Joe. Unfortunately, Sarah didn't react to that so well. \"Oh yeah, of course! I can't do that! I'm much too stupid for that, isn't that right, mom? Let me tell you what... I <i>will</i> walk, I will have <i>no</i> problems and I will prove that I'm <i>right</i>!\" Sarah screamed, running up and down the room hurriedly, picking up lots of small, sometimes useless things and stuffing them in one of her many handbags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica bit her teeth together and tried her best to stay calm. She knew she could still turn this around... She had managed even worse teenagers during her job. \"Sarah, look. I just don't want you to catch a cold. Just call a taxi, I will give you the money-\" \"No! No way, you don't want the best for me, you just always doubt the things I want to do, and the things I can do! I need to finally show you that you're wrong!\" Jessica was beginning to lose her cool at that point. \"Sarah... Stop being so difficult. If you continue like that, I won't drive you there at all and you can stay home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been the wrong thing to say. \"<i><b>OH YEAH</b></i>? Well guess what, mom, you're wrong! Then don't fucking bring me there, no problem. You think I need you for that? You are <i>wrong</i>! And I'll show you! I'll walk there myself <i>right now</i>, and there's nothing you can do to stop me!\" Sarah was furious, and squeezing her feet angrily back into her gleaming black high heels, she walked briskly to the front door, leaving her mother boiling with anger behind her. \"Fine! Go! But don't come calling me when you're somewhere in the middle of the way, your feet hurt and you'd like someone to pick you up!\" She shouted angrily at her daughter, who was already opening the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am going! And don't worry, that won't happen. I'll do this myself and tomorrow... Tomorrow you'll have to admit that you were wrong! And I was right! Yeah, haha... Bye!\" With that, Sarah slammed the door shut and stomped off, making even noiser clapping sounds with her shoes than usual. She had a tiny smirk on her face now... Yes, she would finally prove that she could do much more than her mother thought her capable of. She was always underestimating her, always. It was so unfair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shook her head quickly as the first raindrops fell coolly on her face. It was still relatively warm, but she was pulling up the hood of her jacket now, to prevent her head and especially her wonderful hair, from getting wet. \"Man, I must look so cool right now...\" She mumbled into the rainy evening air. \"People wearing hoods look pretty cool by default, and since I am also naturally cool... Just, wow.\" She said, running her fingers through her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the house, Jessica was slamming her fist on a table. She usually avoided cursing in front of the kids, but since she was alone now... \"God fucking damnit, fucking shit!\" She yelled, kicking over a nearby chair. She just knew Sarah would be calling for her later on... And she also knew she would feel bad for her then and want to go pick her up... But after teaching Joe such a cruel lesson today, she would also need to make sure that Sarah would learn hers. Her behavior today had been impossible, and she would need to see her mistake and face the consequences... And she had been right even, with one point... Due to the extremely high number of SSS police on the streets, at all time, crime levels were extremely low, especially in this area... Sarah should have no real problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sighed loudly and then tried to return her thoughts to something productive. Sarah would have to deal with this one herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah's grim thoughts soon ebbed away as she was briskly walking towards Cassandra's house. It wasn't cold at all while walking like that, Sarah had to smirk as she remembered her mother talking nonsense like her catching a cold, or something. \"This night is going to be PERFECT!\" Sarah said loudly into the evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, she realised one thing, though. Her feet did start to feel somewhat uncomfortable in her shoes... Obviously, these shoes were NOT made for walking! Not for longer distances at least... It didn't really hurt outright, so Sarah was sure she'd be fine, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more minutes of steady walking, Sarah reached the front door of her friends house. The rain had been getting a bit annoying on her on the last part, so she had decided to go extra fast. Not quite running, but almost... Because of this, her feet felt a bit worse already... But she was finally feeling really warm once more! \"Oh... it's you, Sarah! You're actually the first one here... The party is going to start in about...\" Cassandra, one of Sarah's longtime friends was checking her watch \"...50 minutes or so. You're really early!\" \"Yeah... I had to leave quickly, my mom was being a pain in the ass with all her... stupid ideas of what should I do and not do and... You know how it can be!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra rolled her eyes widely while grinning. \"Oh, tell me about it! My mother is exactly the same! Hehe... And that's why it's so great that she had to go to another city for one of her business deals or something! She said she would be home tomorrow, most likely in the afternoon... So we all should have more than enough time!\" \"That's <i>awesome</i>! Then we can do pretty much whatever we want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? We'll turn up the volume so high that the glass will be smashed out of the windows, we'll raid my mother's hidden booze storage, and the best thing... The girl from next door, I think her name was Lisa or something... Well, she's invited as well; Not only is her mom away, but she also has a younger brother... And you know what that means!\" \"Ohh! Oh! An early Stinky-Saturday? Just with a different victim?\" \"You know it!\" Both of the girls screamed shrill and then high-fived each other. \"This is going to be PERFECT!\" Sarah said, once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince there was still more than enough time, Sarah began to help Cassandra a little with the few preparations that still had to be done. But most of the time, Sarah was just chilling out somewhere, stuffing random bits of food into her mouth and sharing her experiences with her friend. \"Man I tell ya... it's so awesome to have a brother.\" \"Haha, shit, you're mean, Sarah...\" \"Haha yeah... You know, earlier today, I made mine clean the inside of these sweet shoes...\" Sarah pointed downwards \"...with his tongue.\" \"Ewwww... Haha, shit, no way!\" \"Hahaha, yeah! It was so damn disgusting, just to watch it was kind of hard... But he deserves it... Really, he's such a fuckass sometimes... But that's exactly why it feels so good to humiliate him every now and then!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra made a hissing sound and shook her head. \"Man, I wish I had one, as well... Oh man, Lisa's brother will so pay for that. Haha, really. You know how my feet usually are, right?\" \"Oh, only too well!\" \"Well, I've been wearing the same pair of socks for about a week now...\" \"Oh shit!\" \"And I also didn't take a shower for at least three days.\" \"Holy crap! Ohhh yeah, that dude is gonna paaaaaaaayyyyy. Hahaha...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah giggled as she wiggled her moist toes around in the tight confines of her high heels. In the house, it was much warmer than outside in the rain, obviously. But since Sarah had already been feeling warm from her quick walk, it was getting a bit hot for her taste right now... And she mostly became aware of that through her feet, because they started to sweat more and more already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me tell you something... My feet won't do him much better, either...\" Sarah said, holding her laughter a bit. \"Haha, of course... It's your feet, after all! Just being next to you when you unleash them is horrible!\" \"Yes, but it's even better today... You know, my feet are really sweating a lot in these shoes, right now. When I take them off in a few hours, or so... Damn!\" \"Haha, oh shit Sarah, you-\" Cassandra was interrupted by a loud *DING DONG* \"Ah... I'm coming, I'm coming!\" Cassandra said as she jumped up from her seat, and Sarah followed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra opened the door widely and revealed a whole bunch of girls who had arrived together, mostly former classmates and neighbours, already chattering and in a good mood. \"Hello!\" Sarah had also appeared behind the host and was looking for someone with a younger brother with her... And she found her! The girl herself, Lisa, was it? Anyway, she wasn't much to look at, not terribly ugly, not really beautiful either, but there was something she was holding in her hand... A leather leash, and it connected to the neck of her unfortunate brother, who was on his hands and feet like a dog, blindfolded and shivering in fear of what was about to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah jumped forward as she saw this and yelled \"Haha! So this is our victim for tonight? Ohhh, I feel almost sorry for him already...\" Lisa's brother made a worried sound and shuffled around on the floor, but Lisa gave him a sharp kick, which caused him to be perfectly still again. \"Yeah, that's him...\" Lisa said herself \"And don't feel sorry... After all, no man deserves to be felt sorry for.\" \"Yeah, I agree so much!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra was suddenly starting to wave her hands around. \"Alright, ladies and... gentleman?\" The whole group burst into laughter. \"Haha, yeah. As I was saying, let's get inside, grab a drink or something, have a nice time, make yourself at home. Oh ho ho, I am still impressed we got our own personal slave for the evening. You know what this calls for?\" Cassandra said, smirking at Sarah. Sarah got the hint, ran quickly to Cassandra's notebook, which was hooked up to a set of massive speakers and prepared to slam down her fist on the poor computer mouse lying beneath it. The cursor was already over the \"play\" button, she only had to hit. \"<i><b>A PAAAAAAAAAARTY!!!</b></i>\" Sarah screamed at the top of her lungs, smashing her fist down and almost crushing the mouse to dust in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire house was vibrating as the fat speakers started to pump out sick beats at MAXIMUM volume. Sarah couldn't resist and started to flail her limbs around aimlessly, while she was staggering through the entire room. She liked to call this act \"dancing\". Soon, the others joined her, a large table and some chairs in the way were simply thrown away and they had the perfect dancefloor! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt incredibly good as she felt the entire stress of the last few days falling off of her... Her body seemed to move on its own will, and it just wouldn't stop... And above all, letting that happen just felt so good. Eventually, some girl had come around with a bottle filled with some sort of alcohol. Nobody was really sure what it was, but they all had to try it, and before they all knew, it was empty. But everything just went better from that point on! ...Except for a single guy, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lone boy was kneeling in a corner, where his \"owner\" had left him. He had tried a few times to sneak away, but that proved impossible, due to him being completely blind right now, he had just bumped into some girl's dancing butt and was swiftly shoved into the corner again. Sarah was stumbling in his direction right now, leaning against the wall and barely being able to breathe. She had really given everything there on the \"dancefloor\", and now she could feel the sweat dripping down her forehead... And as she moved her feet around a little in her shoes, she could very much also feel it there, as well. It felt as if her feet were positively swimming in it, there. It was actually itching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Hey you there, boy... What's... What's your name?\" Sarah said, lightly prodding him with the tip of her shoe, which caused him to flinch. \"I-I-I'm A-Andy...\" he stuttered. Sarah laughed for no reason. \"Hahaha, ohhh... Andy. That's fun. I think I had a... something once. Named Andy. Oh nevermind, I think the main thing for the evening has to start now, and you will be the most important person for this, Andy.\" \"Me? So is that why Lisa brought me here?\" \"Oh... Oh! You don't know what's gonna happen to you?\" Sarah said with a broad grin. Andy shook his head nervously. \"Oh, haha, this is just too rich. Don't worry, you'll be the... one to watch, the star of the show!\" Sarah asured him. Andy didn't seem to be convinced, but Sarah simply grabbed him and shoved him closer to the other girls, some of them still dancing around, but most of them having already stopped and looking forward to making someone suffer the stench of their feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls completely surrounded Andy and he could already notice a strong scent in the air... The smell of female sweat, obviously caused by so many girls sweating around him like that. But, up to this point, he couldn't even see. At least for that, Lisa was going to free him. \"Here, so you'll be able to appreciate the beauty of the feet you are going to sniff.\" She said to him. Instantly, Andy's face went pale. He knew they had something like this planned... But actually hearing it sealed the deal for him. \"Your... your feet?\" \"That's right!\" Sarah loudly interjected and started to push him on the floor. \"You will be the only one to smell ALL our feet now! Tonight, you are the star. It's you!\" The whole group started to laugh loudly, but Andy wasn't so fond of the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he had no chance to escape now, but he still had to try somehow! He started to kick and punch desperately and as he was held, he started to scream loudly, as well. \"Ah, I thought you would do that. We came prepared.\" Cassandra simply said, getting some duct tape out of her bag.  Some of the other girls got out a long piece of rope...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was ready.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Let's get this party <i>started</i>!\" Sarah loudly exclaimed as she took some of the rope and helped some of the other girls in tying their unfortunate victim up good. He was struggling quite a bit at first, but Cassandra herself took care of that by swiftly kicking her left shoe off and pressing her cute, if somewhat small foot down squarely over Andy's face. He instantly tried to scream and buck again as the hot, sticky fabric of Cassandra's sock, soaked and moist with fresh sweat, came into contanct with the skin of his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded in approval as she caught a whiff of Cassandra's potent foot stink... Even from her position, it was more than noticeable. And of course, it was all the worse for Andy himself! As the stinky foot on his face started to rub itself around all over him, he gasped in pain as he took his first deep sniff... His senses were instantly stunned by the strong, sour smell of unwashed, worn socks and sweaty girl feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others wasted no time and tied his arms together by the wrists and ellbows, which they then tied to his torso. After tying both his legs together and his shins to his upper legs with his knees bent, he was completely immobile. All he could do now was wiggle around weakly, like a snail... There was no way to escape from the squaling, giggling horde of crazed party girls, about to assault him in the worst way possible... With drippingly wet, stinking feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cassandra was about to put the tape on his mouth, Sarah held her back suddenly. \"What are you doing, Sarah? We need to make sure he SNIFFS!\" Cassandra said in mild irritation. \"Of course. But your socks are way too good as not to use them for one more thing...\" With that, Sarah grabbed one of Cassandra's socks, still tightly stuck to her dangerous foot, and started to slowly pull it off. \"Careful! They are quite bad!\" Cassandra warned, but Sarah was too excited to slow down now. She was amazed with how good those socks were sticking to Cassandra's cute feet, it was as if they were glued there! Pulling more fiercely, Sarah managed to peel them off with a horrible, moist sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next instant, she slammed the nasty, soaked sock directly in Andy's horrified face, the discoloured, squishy toe section right over his nose. \"Now... give this sock a nice whiff before I shove them into your mouth!\" Sarah commanded. Andy tried to shake his head around, but the horrible sock remained securely on his face, stuck to it with all the sweat and guided by Sarah's hand. \"I said... SNIFF!\" Sarah yelled, suddenly jabbing him lightly in the stomach with her free hand. The hit had been far from powerful, but Andy had been caught off-guard and realised with horror how the air was flowing out of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah pressed her hand down on his lips, hard. Andy had no choice but to smell... But he still attempted another futile try to break free, only resulting in him shifting around by a few centimetres. \"Men... when will they ever learn?\" Sarah said, shaking her head with a broad grin. \"Smell now! Take a good whiff of this sock!\" Even though Andy tried his best to keep up his resistance, he could feel his lungs burning and a few dark spots were dancing before his eyes... He didn't want to breathe. But his body suddenly breathed on its own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking an incredibly deep, audible sniff; Andy attempted to fill his lungs with much needed oxygen. Instead, his system was filled to the brink with the foul, putrid odour of Cassandra's well-worn socks! It was sour, it was cheesy, it was rank and most importantly, it was so thick and strong that it seemed like someone was physically punching him in the head with every sniff! After he had smelled it about five times non-stop, his breathing thankfully slowed down on its own... But everything was going even further downhill from this point onwards!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good slave. Now, open your mouth wide, so I can stuff this sock into it.\" Andy squint his eyes together and shook his head again, which only causes Sarah to laugh. \"Fine... do you prefer smelling this sock?\" Andy attempted to say something, but they only heard a useless mumble, muffled by the reeking sock. \"Have it, then!\" Sarah said with a broad smile and held the sock over his nose, still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniff by sniff, he was inhaling its powerful aroma. Yet he somehow managed not to panic and open his mouth at any point. Sarah got impatient. She grabbed his nose and squeezed his nostrils shut. \"Fine, you little shit! Have it your way!\" Andy held his breath for some time, until he finally gave up and tried to open his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe panicked when he realised that Sarah was still pushing down hard on his mouth, blocking him from breathing completely. Sarah gave him a cruel smile as he started to produce muffled screams in terror. \"Oh, what's that? You say you'd rather die than open your mouth nicely?\" Andy shook his head frantically. Sarah giggled, turned around to Cassandra and said \"Prepare to hold your foot over his nose... We don't want to lose this opportunity!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra nodded and readied her foot, her slimy sole hanging like certain doom not far from Andy's face, whose eyes were now fixed on it in fear. Her foot wouldn't even look that bad, if it wasn't moist with sweat, he thought. After waiting a few more painful seconds, Sarah finally let go of his mouth... and instantly, it was open, sucking in the much-needed air... For maybe half a second, before his entire mouth got stuffed by the wet, disgusting fabric of Cassandra's sock. \"I really wonder how they taste... Thinking how much my feet usually sweat, and with how long I've been wearing them, it must be horrible!\" Cassandra teased, smiling at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the warm, wet stuff got pushed against his tongue, Andy had no other option that to taste it, really. And it did taste absolutely horrible! Much like it smelled also, if only a bit more bitter and musky, even. Finally, Sarah also let go of his nose... But as his mouth was being extra sealed by some layers of duct tape, Cassandra lost no time and immediatly slammed her foot down on his face, his poor nose right between her toes. He still hadn't got enough oxygen, so he was forced to take several deep, loud breaths... It was pure hell for Andy! He coughed and gagged behind his bindings as he was forced to inhale the toxic aroma of Cassandra's unwashed, sweaty toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench here was at least twice as bad then from behind her socks... And Andy felt as he was dying from the inside as his system had to take more and more of the ripe, sour aroma. Finally, as he was starting to feel weaker and weaker, the foot disappeared from his face. He took a few sniffs of relatively clean air (The stench of unwashed, sweaty girl feet was still painfully noticeable in the air around him) and his senses refocused a little bit... But as his vision cleared, he became deathly pale and he saw an image worse than his darkest nightmares:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral pairs of feet were hovering over his face, some clad with disgustingly wet socks, some bare and shining with sweat. As Sarah took her black high heels off it was especially bad, it seemed as if a pressured wave of hot, moist air was blasting through the entire room... And most directly, into Andy's face. He was positively stunned by them! Now, Andy had never been one to find feet beautiful... but these two feet were stunningly gorgeous! Their soles were slightly pale, their skin seemed spotlessly smooth and silky and their arches and toes were long and pronounced. The only downside was the incredibly thick layer of sweat on them, which made them reflect the light in the room like glass, as Sarah moved them around a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy let out a horrified, muffled scream as all those sweaty, stinking feet descended towards his face, Sarah's extraordinarily pretty and sweaty ones first. With loud, slapping noises they connected, and there was so much salty footsweat being pushed into his face that it was soon dripping to the floor. Andy squirmed in agony as a whole storm of stenches rushed up his nose. Most of these feet smelled a bit different from each other, but all of them had that typical, cheesy sweat-stench that he despised so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was unbareable. As the girls loudly cheered and hurled random insults against men at him, Andy was quickly finding himself pushed to the verge of unconsciousness! At the very last moment, Sarah's toes clutched his tortured nostrils tightly, and with his final breath, he was blasted to oblivion with the strongest gust of female foot funk yet! His eyes rolled up and were crying tiny rivers and with a final muffled moan, he was knocked out at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls cheered loudly again, proud with their excellent work. They didn't instantly remove their feet from Andy's face, either, and enjoyed the cool feeling of his sleeping breathes on their hot, tired soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been great fun for Sarah, but she knew that she had to leave soon anyway, she still had things to do tomorrow morning. Getting up and waving goodbye to some of her friends, she uneasily staggered towards the door, a bit dazed from alcohol and smelling the stench of her friends combined feet for many minutes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah grinned a bit as she slammed open the door and took in the clean, cold air of the night. She smiled as she realised the rain had finally stopped... While it was still pretty cool outside, she really couldn't stand also getting wet from above now... Especially since a slick layer of sweat was also coating her right now. She giggled as she moved her feet around a little in her shoes... They were practically swimming in her sweat. Just thinking about how fierce and sharp their stench would be right now made Sarah excited... And hungry for some suffering slave beneath her! And she had just the right person in mind... A good reason to hurry up home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she also realised that walking home with these shoes was pretty uncomfortable indeed... She could almost see her mother in front of her inner eye, shaking her index finger before her face and saying \"I told you, Sarah. I told you!\" \"No!\" Sarah yelled, angry. She still had to prove her wrong! Another good reason to hurry up! So Sarah began picking up her pace and running outright... Unfortunately, that didn't last too long. She came to a stop, her feet hurting terribly in various spots where her hard, unforgiving shoes had attacked her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch... Ahh, that really does hurt... If only I had someone to pick- Wait... Dammit, mom! How COULD she know???\" Sarah spat to the floor, in pure rage. \"Oh, I will make sure <i>someone</i> pays for this...\" With that, Sarah hurried home the rest of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she reached her home... Opening the door widely, she stomped in, sweat dripping from her forehead. She put on a fierce smile as she realised just how tired she was now... And how sweaty, too. She wasted no further time and walked upstairs, to her brother's room. She entered it as silently as possible, and walked towards his bed. He was still very much asleep, blissfully unaware of the horrors about to befall him! Sarah licked her lips as she slowly drew closer, ready to strike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as she reached his still sleeping form, she chose the most charming and appropriate way to wake Joe up... She first readied her foot right next to his head... And then, she slapped him across the cheek, hard and as soon as he began waking up, she pulled off her tight, black high heel and her wet, bare foot jumped straight into Joe's face. Instantly, a horrible wave of incredibly thick, cheesy stench was unleashed! The smell of her soaked, sweaty foot was so strong that even Sarah herself felt disgusted by its stale aroma. \"Oh god... Shit, it's worse than I thought even... Oh, hey Joe! Enjoying my foot, there?\" Sarah teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe didn't even know what hit him. Just a second ago, he was dreaming nicely... Flying around over an open, wide field, not a single cruel sister in sight... And the next moment, he had a dripping wet sole plastered over his face, drenching it in it's acrid, stinking sweat as it rubbed all over it and suffocating him with waves and waves of hot, moist stench. It smelled mostly like old, rich cheese, also very salty and with a slight, sour hint. But most importantly, the smell was so strong that it seemed to literally burn in his nostrils and lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I didn't hear what you said about me earlier today? Hmm? Do you really think you could get away with just smelling mom's feet for a little? Oh, you will pay now, you little, worthless shit. Think mommy's feet smelled bad today? Take another sniff of mine... You know very well that my feet usually get very sweaty and thus stinky, no matter what I wear... And that wearing these lovely black high heels of mine only makes it worse... Well, guess where my feet have been stuck in for the last several hours? That's right... Now SNIFF!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah barked, lifting her foot up shortly and slapping Joe across the cheeck again, this time with the powerful, round ball of her foot. It left a glistering, moist imprint of her deadly toes over him, but for Joe, the smell was much worse than the physical pain.- He groaned loudly in pain and protest... And this was when everything went even worse for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah didn't need an extra invitation when she saw his open mouth... She stuck her long, slimy toes right in, as far as they would fit. Joe retched in agony as his sense of taste was overwhelmed by the horrible aroma of Sarah's unwashed, smelly feet. Now Sarah kicked off her second shoe, unleashing even more foul foot air into the room's relatively small space... Before holding her second foot over Joe's face as well... Her deadly toes cupping directly over his tortured nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... suffer...\" She hissed. \"My feet really hurt... Just because of you! And... mom! Now you have to pay! Smell my feet and DESPAIR!\" She said, a bit too loudly. But Joe couldn't care less about that now. The only thing that mattered was the slimy feeling of Sarah's long, well-shaped soles; Smooth, soft and silky, but hot and wet; sliding across his face... Their incredible, repulsive stench and the sharp taste they were leaving in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Joe was out cold again... But Sarah couldn't just stop there! Driven by her ruthless anger, she kept holding her feet into his completely helpless face willingly... And soon enough, she fell asleep herself, due to exhaustion... With her moist, warm feet still stuck properly over and in Joe's poor face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the night, Joe was tormented by nightmares of incredibly stinky feet... Caused by the very much real feet, stinking up his air the entire night...</span></div></div>",

Jessica, clearly frustrated and stressed about the situation, responds, \"He is being difficult...\" Jessica then looks Joe straight faced in the eye and says slow and clearly, \"We can't afford to have the SSS arrive at our door to ensure we don't treat you with respect or worse, they could have the place bugged and just when we think we're in the clear they bust down the door and send us to the prison camp out in Reekville.\" Joe starts to well up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If you think our feet our bad the SSS hire women who are trained specifically in stinky feet torture and they all have that excessive sweating disorder, hyper hydrosis.\" A tear runs down the cheek of Joe. He says wobbly voiced, \"I can't do this... it's too much.\" Jessica and Sarah stare at Joe through the awkward silence as Joe rubs his eyes wiping away tears. Jessica holding back tears says, \"I'm sorry but if you won't willfully cooperate then we will have to force you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, see if you can pursuade him...\" as Jessica exits holding back tears. Sarah grins evilly looking a pale, petrified Joe in the eye, \"With pleasure...\" she says with mean intent. Joe says, \"Listen sis-I m-mean Mistress, this isn't necassary I can be bought for a tiny price and we could avoid this whole thing.\" Sarah stops and laughs hysterically and says, \"Why would I pass up an oppurtunity to torture you with my nasty feet?\" Joe begins to tremble with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't think I didn't hear you earlier, I heard every word you said about you getting me back! Much like my sweat soaked socks and footwear you'll eat those words.\" Sarah hastily and aggressively binds and gags Joe. \"Oh Joe, if you thought those heels were bad just wait to see what I'm keeping in these putrid sneakers I've worn all week without taking them off once. I delibrately wore them to bed and washed just my hair this week  so I could keep my feet disgusting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe screams into the tape which only amuses Sarah. \"Now we were going to surprise you this Saturday but these socks have been worn by each one of the girls a week each for the past 3 months. How they haven't dissintegrated I don't know but they now reek beyond anything you've ever smelled. The SSS torture specialists would be proud. Now enough of explaining and more with the torturing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah without the slightest hesitation removed her nasty sneakers and plopped her disgusting socked feet straight onto Joe's face. He screamed at the top of his lungs but to no avail. Sarah starts to slowly rub her feet against Joe's face as she says, \"You know, I've heard that the SSS torture specialists add breath control into their torture methods. They pinch the victims nose with their toes, like this.\" Sarah pinches Joe's nose with her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They then keep the victims air supply closed for a max of 20 seconds.\" She looks Joe in the eye as his face turns red and he starts to panic for about 15 seconds and releases his nose from between her socked toes. \"When this happens the victim has no choice but to inhale the nasty foot stench deeply. It's a truly cruel torture method.\". Sarah repeats this process for a half hour and Joe's eyes can't seem to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Joe, I'd say you've had enough. Of the socks that is.\" Joe moans depressed at this news as Sarah peels the sticky wet disgusting socks from her sweaty feet. She takes the now inside out dirty white socks and puts one inside the other, rolls them up and after peeling back Joe's mouth tape plops them in his open breathing mouth and quickly re-seels the tape over his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, slave. Let's continue with my bare toes.\" She tortures Joe for another half hour, this time with her nasty bare feet. Afterwards she says, \"You know what I could really use right now? A nice foot massage.\" Sarah then proceeds to grind her sweat soaked bare feet against Joe's face. \"Wow. Your face is a surprisingly good foot massager.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then does this for a solid hour then decides to one of two things.</span></div></div>",

You know that your sister has got vacation now and all of her friends are moving somewhere with their families. It just wouldn't be fair, if she had to stay at home as the only one. Even if this means that it could become a bit uncomfortable for you.\" Joe stared at him mother in disbelief. \"And how exactly is it fair, if I have to suffer humiliation in public, only to make Sarah happy? I thought, at least you would still consider your son valuable..\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jessica's mood changed, as if her protesting son reminded her of the authority she had. \"How dare you to speak up to me like that? You are thirteen years old, Joe, a child! You know nothing! If we as family don't go out anymore, it looks like we were hiding. People will start to talk about us and the SSS will be here faster than you can say 'humiliation'. We WILL go camping and you will HAVE TO endure what's necessary! Listen honey, I don't want you to suffer more than necessary, that's why I told your sister off. But I also have to take care of your sister and of myself, it's not only you. If anyone seeds the slightest rumor about us being rebels, we will be in deep trouble! It's not easy for me to torture my own son, but I play my part. Time to grow up and play yours, Joe! We'll be going next Monday.\" With these words Jessica left the room and Joe was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonday came fast. The week hadn't been special, in fact it had been quite calm. Only the \"Stinky-Saturday\" had been a bit more uncomfortable for Joe than usual, because Sarah and her friends wanted to celebrate the vacations duly. They had been on their feet shopping during the whole noon and afternoon. Additionally they had been dancing in the evening and therefore their feet in Joe's face had been a lot stinkier than normal. Now Joe sat on the couch in the living room and waited for his mother and sister to come. His only luggage was some clothes, pajamas and an old little tent. His mother hadn't allowed Joe to pack any luxury as in his old Game Boy, books or his iPod. At first she hadn't even wanted him to bring an own tent, because that could seem \"too individual\". Only Joe's argument that \"it was always good to have a tent in reserve, just in case of something unexpected\" had been able to change her mind. \"Ah Joe, I see you're ready to go!\" Jessica came downstairs with a huge and heavy bag in her hands, snuffled through the living room and put her baggage down in front of the couch. \"Oh boy, this is heavy. Our camping adventure hasn't even started yet and I'm already sweaty!\" She noticed the worried expression on her son's face and giggled: \"Don't worry, Joe. You don't need to do anything at the moment. I was actually just saying this without any hidden agenda. But could you please bring my and your stuff in the car already? Here are the keys. I will look if Sarah is ready as well.\" Saying this, Jessica threw the keys to Joe and walked upstairs again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your loyal servant hurries at your command..\", Joe bitterly thought to himself as he stood up and began to tuck the baggage away in the car. A little while later Joe's mother and sister came downstairs and the last pieces of luggage were packed in the car. Joe was about to get in the vehicle, when Jessica held him back. \"Joe, I'm sorry and I know that it is hard for you to get used to the new situation, but we can't just let you sit in the car normally. The society expects us to treat you like a footslave and footslaves don't have access to such luxury. We might get into a traffic control and just in case we need to look like a prime example for a Stenchlandian family. Our neighbors should think that from us, too. That is why we have to hurt you now, sorry honey..\" With this, Jessica stepped back, looked at Sarah and nodded. Before Joe could react, Sarah jumped forwards and slammed her knee hard into Joe's pit of the stomach. With a deep moan, Joe buckled and fell to the ground. The pain was so intense, that he wasn't able to notice anything around him. He just lay on the ground, wallowing around in agony with his hands pressed on his stomach. While Joe was helpless, Sarah took some skipping ropes and duct tape out of her bag. She began to tie him up with the skipping ropes, using two for his legs, two for his arms and one for his hands. Sarah wasn't completely done, when Joe had recovered a bit from the punch. He tried to fight the rope and wanted to sit up his upper part of the body a bit but he was stopped by his mother who pressed her hand over Joe's mouth and held him down. \"Thanks for the help, mom\", Sarah said in relief. \"I fear my kick didn't hit the solar plexus perfectly, he begins to struggle a lot.\" \"I see\", Jessica answered, \"that's why I'm helping you know. Are you done tying your brother up soon? As I told you when I talked you through this, I want to keep the pain for Joe as little as possible!\" Sarah glared at Jessica with a bugged facial expression and rolled her eyes. \"I am almost done. I just need to secure some knots. It would really work out faster, if you would calm his struggling down a bit and prepare the gag already! Here's the duct tape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded and took a look at the disturbed facial expression of her son. He was really panicking. For a moment Jessica felt like helping Joe up, comforting him, giving him a kiss and then just driving away with him and Sarah. But she knew that she had to be strong now, that she couldn't afford any pity now. While still pressing a hand over his mouth, she removed one of her boots and revealed a well worn black nylon sock glaring from sweat. She removed the sock as well and brought it up to Joe's face. \"Hey honey, as I said, I'm sorry that we have to do this to you but if you cooperate now, it will be over a lot faster. Will you open your mouth voluntarily and calm down a bit?\" Asking this, Jessica carefully removed her hand from Joe's mouth. Joe started to cough immediately and screamed with a panic voice: \"No, please stop! This is not fair, no, please mom, please noommmphhhaaarghmmppphhh!\" Jessica quickly stuffed her nylon sock in Joe's mouth, while he was screaming and completed the gag with a piece of duct tape. \"Then I have to do it this way\", she sighed, \"You have to calm down now, Joe, ..shhhh..shh-shhh..shhhhhh..\" While saying this, Jessica straightened up and readied. She concentrated on Joe's breathing and right after Joe exhaled, Jessica quickly brought her naked sole to Joe's face and pressed her humid toes hard on his nose, so that her air flow was cut off completely. Then she waited for some seconds before she spread her long toes and slid her slender sole up and down on Joe's nose, from the toe-area to the heel. Jessica repeated this procedure over and over again. Up and down. Up and down. To her own surprise, the cool air flow felt good on her hot, sweaty and stinky sole. It was so relaxing, that Jessica was literally carried away in her thoughts until she heard Sarah say: \"Mom. Mom? Eeerrr, just wanted to tell you that I'm done.\" It took a while until Jessica reacted. \"Mmmmh..what? What? Oh, yeah right. That's good.\" She looked down to Joe and noticed with shock that Joe's face already had a light green colour and that he was cross-eyed. Thereupon Jessica removed her foot quickly from Joe's face and said: \"Okay I think he will be calm now.\" \"Yeah, seems so.\", Sarah admitted, \"Let's get him into the cargo bay, so that we can finally drive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next minutes, Jessica and Sarah hauled up Joe's weak and tied up body and put him inside the cargo bay. Then, Jessica got in the car and checked the planned route for a last time, while Sarah couldn't help doing a last meanness to her little brother. She took one of her sneakers off, taped it over Joe's defenceless nose, chuckled a \"sweet dreams, bro..\" and closed the cargo bay. Now the camping trip could begin! Soon the engine rev-ed and the car began to move on its way to the national park. On the face of it, the atmosphere in the car seemed to be happy, casual and relaxed. But for Joe it was horrible. Instead of eating cookies and singing travelling songs like his mother and sister, he was tied up and gagged in the cargo bay, barely conscious and forced to inhale the pungent aroma of his sister's sneaker.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was late in the afternoon. Joe sat on a broad trunk in the national park feverishly brooding over a tiny map. His day had been horrible, the brutal trip trapped inside the cargo bay had surely been the worst experience in his life. At least after the arrival in the national park, his mother and sister had untied him and left him alone to build up the camp together. He had wandered around, cursed the whole situation thousands of times and even cried a bit in self-pity. \"My life really is at its worst.\", he had thought to himself, \"The government will never change and I will be forced to be my mother's and sister's footslave forever!\" Just when Joe had been at the verge of giving up and accepting his fate, he ad noticed a showcase for tourists with a map of the national park and its surrounding area in it. At first he had thought that it was nothing special: Like every national park he knew it included some lakes, rivers, emergency stations and a lot of forest. But suddenly he had noticed something unbelievable. He then excitedly had gripped on of the free and smaller copies of the map out of an INFO box next to the showcase and sat down on a nearby trunk to examine more precisely what he unexpectedly had discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, minutes later, Joe still sat there staring at the map in disbelief. Could it be true, what he was seeing? He felt how new hope was rising inside him. The map revealed that on a very broad sector, the national park bordered on a neighboring country of Stenchlandia. More importantly a neighboring country with a normal democratic government! This was his chance to escape this whole mess. This was his chance to live a normal life. Maybe the only chance he would ever get. Although it didn't take him long to decide that he would take this chance, the thoughts in Joe's head spun over and over. When would he leave? What would he take with him? How would he survive some nights in the wilderness, since the way was not too short? And once he was there, how would he cross the border? After thinking for a while, Joe at least found some answers to satisfy himself. He would leave as soon as possible, because he could never know, when he would be able to move around freely again. He would only take the most necessary stuff with him, so that his mother and sister wouldn't notice his absence too fast. Surviving and crossing the border was stuff he would deal with, once he successfully had escaped. Having made these important decisions, Joe began to plan his route. In the beginning he would run some miles into the forest in direction south west. \"I will leave some traces on this way\", Joe thought to himself, \"in order to lure chasers south west.\" He intended to trick chasers by suddenly moving south east instead of south west, without leaving obvious traces from then on. His new direction would lead him to a mountain called \"Old Rock\" which he planned to circle before turning completely east. The way further in the east would then lead him through a last forest until he would be able to cross the border and start a new and better life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving made this \"master-plan\", Joe stood up swollen with pride over his own brilliancy. His new hope was even whipping up a smile on his face. Now he only needed a good moment to come. Feeling himself like an undercover agent on a secret mission, Joe sneaked back to the camp checking the point of departure for his ingenious blow. The camp seemed to be ready. Two tents were built up around a crackling campfire. All seemed silent, the situation clear, when suddenly Jessica and Sarah came out of the bigger tent and sat down around the campfire. Soon they were starting to talk. \"It's really nice here, mom\", Sarah smiled, \"I really like the landscape and the nature. But even more I like that we are having a family trip once again after so much time. I think we didn't have had one since dad...since the accident...\". Sarah noticed her mistake immediately when she saw her mother's face and quickly added: \"Ohh, oh, I'm really sorry mom..I really shouldn't have brought this up. It's just..I miss dad so much..and this whole thing remembered me of him.\" Jessica's facial expression went more bland again and she caressed her daughter's head. \"Yeah, sweetheart, I understand. I miss him too, he was such a great family man. And how much he loved you! But let's talk about something more pleasant now, right?\" - \"Of course.\", Sarah said and hugged Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching this scene, Joe felt sad and uncomfortable in his hideout. After all, this was his family and Joe suddenly remembered all the good times he had with his dad, his mother and his sister before the coup. Was it really right if he would just run away and leave them alone? But before Joe could really think about this, all of his doubts were wiped away, when he heard the next part of his mother's and sister's conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, mom, after all this work building our camp up I'm really exhausted and sweaty. Especially my feet. I know that you don't like it, if I speak like that but I really could use Joe now..\", Sarah chuckled to her mother. To her surprise, Jessica didn't react with anger or grump. In fact, she giggled! \"Sarah, that was really mean of you and normally I probably would have grumped at you but I don't know. When I made Joe smell my feet this morning, it actually felt..good. Sure I was shocked a bit later, when I saw what my stinky feet where doing to him but aside of that the breathing on my hot sole felt relaxing.\" Sarah felt as if she was hit by a train. Was this still her mother speaking? She at first stared at her in disbelief and then started to laugh loudly. \"Haha, this is exactly why I like it so much, mom! Maybe you're finally getting the taste of it now!\" Hearing these words Jessica's face blushed read and she giggled with her daughter until she answered: \"Speaking of Joe..where is he actually? I haven't seen him since noon, when we started building up our camp..you know what? I will go search him and when we come back you are allowed to use him a bit, as long as you don't be too cruel with him. And maybe, maybe I will let him have a few sniffs of my feet as well. Deal?\" Sarah smiled from ear to ear and screamed: \"Deal! I love you, mom!\" After having hugged her daughter once again, Jessica went away from the campfire to search Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meanwhile Joe, who had seen and heard all of this in his hideout behind some trees, abandoned every thought of staying with his family again. This time once and for all. He was more than shocked, he was utterly disgusted by what he had seen. He wasn't surprised about Sarah's behaviour but the stuff his mother had said really gave him the creeps. He obviously had lost his last ally in a place where he was surrounded by enemies. Swallowing down some tears, Joe knew he had to be strong now. He would need to put his sister away, fast grab some supplies and then run for his life. After having looked around a bit, Joe found a solid branch, picked it up and quietly sneaked at the back of Sarah. Then he raised the branch high above his head, barked \"Sweet dreams, sis!\" and struck as hard as he could. Although she heard him, Sarah had no time to react. The branch hit her back of the head with full speed and she collapsed silently. Along the way, Joe quickly made sure that Sarah was completely knocked out. After that he entered the big tent, grabbed his backpack stuffed some bread, water and tinned fruit in it. He also threw in a compass, his cagoule and the little replacement tent he was able to bring with him. With a last cold look at the unconscious body of his sister, Joe started running..</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joe just kept running and didn't even allow himself to rest for a while. His chasers could catch up with him any minute and Joe didn't intend to let this happen. About half an hour after Joe had changed his direction as planned, he was finally completely exhausted. His movements slowed down and he leaned against a tree to catch his breath again after such a marathon. Knowing that his situation still wasn't safe, Joe carefully harkened into the forest if there was the slightest sound of nearby motor engines or commanding voices. To his pacification, nothing but the pure sounds of nature (some birds and even something that reminded Joe of wild boars) could be heard. The way more unpleasant thing was that it was already dawning and he had not found any shelter yet. Into the bargain, it started to rain cats and dogs now and Joe thought to himself: \"After a successful escape, luck leaves me again..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly pulled his cagoule out of the backpack, put it on and decided to at least reach the foot of the \"Old Rock\", before searching himself a shelter. The now regnant darkness and moistness made the already burdensome way through the forest even more burdensome for Joe. Although the mountain wasn't more far away than one or two miles, it took him almost three-quarters of an hour to reach the \"Old Rock\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving arrived there, Joe found that finding a shelter wouldn't be as easy as he imagined. The ground was exposed to the weather without any protection, since the trees in this area didn't carry too much leaves. In addition to that Joe wasn't sure about the wildlife in this national park. What if he would wake up being eyeball in eyeball with a hungry bear? No, that place wasn't safe. Instead, Joe started mounting the \"Old Rock\" hoping to find a cave or something, where he could spend the night. Unfortunately, the mountainside turned out to be extremely smooth and flat. No ledges, no gaps and no caves. Joe already wearily wanted to climb down again, in order to at least find a place where the trees stood a bit closer, when he noticed something interesting. Down in forest, about two hundred meters further east fluttered a little light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to find out what this is\", Joe thought to himself, \"if I plan to spend the night here..\". Driven by curiosity, he climbed down the mountain and sneaked towards the light. When Joe only was about fifty meters away from the light's source, the darkness and bad weather conditions finally allowed him to recognize what he was watching. It was another camp and the light came from a campfire! Joe knew he had to be careful now. This camp could belong to anyone. Other campers, some hermitic freaks or even his chasers! Should he just enter the camp and ask for help or was it better to stay hidden and check the owners intentions? Only one thing was sure. He had to figure out if this camp was a danger for him or not. After some seconds of thinking Joe decided to climb on a tree to observe the situation from there. But things turned out completely different. Before Joe could make a move, he was suddenly grabbed from behind. A strong hand pressed itself firmly over his mouth and pulled his head back. The darkness of the night made it impossible for Joe to see his attacker, as if he was grappling with a ghost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first shock had ended, Joe tried to struggle and to free himself but the grip of the unknown attacker was too strong. The only thing he did was making some desperate and angry, muffled noises through the attacker's hand. The next thing that happened was that Joe coughed in pain because the attacker slammed his knee hard into Joe's crotch while still holding him in place. At the same time the attacker used his other hand to press a humid cloth under Joe's nose. When Joe inhaled through his nose, the smell coming from the cloth hit him like a train. It was a hot and sharp aroma which reminded Joe of a mixture between stinky cheesy feet and something dead. Not only that. It felt like a warm, gluey gas taking hold in his lungs. He started to feel dizzy already but didn't want to give up already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Joe intensified his struggling with all his force in a last attempt to break free. He slammed his right elbow backwards and felt how he hit something, causing his attacker to grunt. Then he wiggled like crazy in order to escape the grip and for a moment it look as if Joe's efforts were successful. But then he got kicked in his crotch ones again, this time harder, causing him to blow out all the air in his lungs just to suck it in again very sharply. This was the overkill. Joe's brain got overwhelmed by the acrid stench steaming from the cloth under his nose. Colourful glistening lights danced in his vision and his legs turned to jelly. Joe felt as if his head was spinning around while his body kept falling. Falling to the ground and even through the ground. Everything kept falling, falling, falling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep-drawn sigh, Joe passed out, not knowing what was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite everything, Laurie decides to keep Joe as her footslave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie realizes that she needs the money and takes the reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joe woke up, the first thing he noticed was that he couldn't move. For a little moment, panic ran through his body. \"Am I paralyzed? Or even...dead?\" where some of the thoughts pulsating in his brain causing his heart to beat faster. Joe's breathing rhythm quickened and he almost hyperventilated. Just before his panic attack could get out of control, he forced himself to calm down and think. \"Joe, don't go nuts now\", he thought to himself, \"someone ambushed you and knocked you out. Now you're probably just tied up. You need to relax, open your eyes to check the situation and take the first opportunity to get the hell out of whatever mess you maneuvered yourself into again..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these appeasing words to himself, Joe's hectic breathing calmed itself and he carefully opened his eyes ajar. At first, he didn't dare to open his eyes completely or move his head, just in case someone was observing him. But due to the fact that he was secured on a camping mat with some pillows supporting his upper part of the body from behind, he was in kind of a half-seated position. This allowed Joe to examine his bonds without opening his eyes completely and without moving his head. One quick glance through the tiny gap between his eyelids was enough to see that his bonds were created by someone who knew what he was doing. The many complicated and squiggled knots almost equaled an artwork! Although Joe already knew that it probably wouldn't do anything, he gave the bonds three thugs with all his strength, just to make sure he really had tried everything possible to free himself. His assumptions however proved true, the ropes and knots stayed firmly in place. The only thing Joe did was cutting in his own flesh. He burked a desperate cry of rage and breathed deeply. Then he finally dared to open his eyes completely and check the situation. He found himself under a high and broad structure of grey green rug. \"A tent!\", flashed it through Joe's mind. The wan light shining through the tent roof revealed that it was daytime outside. His body was bound on a camping mat with another empty camping mat aside of him, although the used bed linen on it suggested that someone else was around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Joe could become clear about anything else, the tent suddenly was opened and he beheld his attacker for the first time. To his great surprise, it was a woman he was looking at. Joe remembered how strong and intransigent the grip from his attacker had been and now he found it hard to believe that it had been a woman all along. \"Look what we have here\", the woman started talking while moving closer to Joe, \"my catch is awake. Before you say anything, let me make some things clear. I'm here to talk with you. If you start to insult me or get bitchy for whatever reason, it will have uncomfortable consequences for you. If you start yelling for help, I will gag you immediately and trust me, you won't like my sort of gags! Also, while we talk you will stay tied up, that's a security measure. I don't want my catch to escape. If you respect and accept these conditions, you don't have to fear any danger or abuse for now. Did you get that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I g..g..g..guess s..s..so?\", Joe stuttered and gave the woman a worried look. She however remained unimpressed and sat down on the other camping mat. \"Good, then let's begin. My name is Laurie. I'm a hunter and this is my hunting ground. Now what is your name and what were you doing in my hunting ground at night and all alone, boy?\" Joe stared at Laurie for a while before answering. It was just now that he noticed how gorgeous she actually looked, with her long blonde hair and green eyes. He presumed that she wasn't older than 30, with a very sporty figure. \"Eeeerrr..I..errr..my name is Harvey and I was just wandering around a bit on my own. Then I saw the campfire and wanted to see to whom it belonged\", Joe finally said very fast. He knew that it wasn't a good lie and one look in Laurie's face could tell that she knew that as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith cocked eyebrows and a strict look she replied: \"Don't lie to me, boy. Do you really think I don't know what's going on in Stenchlandia? The current situation in this country makes it very suspect, that a young boy like you runs around in a national park alone, with a backpack including a survival kit. I'm not dumb. I know what you are, and I also know who you are. Coincidentally I was listening to local radio stations yesterday evening. The radio station of the national park reported that a thirteen-year old boy was missing and probably on the run. They even offered a reward for the one bringing the boy back. And what do you think I saw yesterday, right after the radio broadcast was over, when I observed the pheasants nestling on the 'Old Rock' with my nightscope? I saw a young boy climbing around! I only needed to put two and two together to realize that you were the missing boy. The much harder question is: What do I do with you? The easiest solution would certainly be to just extradite you and cash the reward. But then again you are my catch and true hunters don't sell their catches. I have always liked to dominate men with my feet and in general. Maybe I could just keep you for myself! Besides, the more I look at you, the more you remind me the son I lost..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing all this, Joe began to shiver. None of the alternatives for Joe's future seemed acceptable for him. Not at any price he wanted to be sent back to his family. He only could imagine how cruel Sarah's revenge would be and even his mother wouldn't spare him this time. On the other hand he wasn't really having an itch for remaining in the clutches of this hunter woman, who's stinky sock had been enough to knock him out. Therefore Joe commanded all the courage he had and began to speak. \"Please, don't do any of that to me, madam. I really beg you not to do. You were right, I was lying and that was wrong. My real name is Joe. I am thirteen years old and have lived a normal life until the ultra feminist party took over. Ever since then, my life has been horrible. I have lost all my friends, since 'worthless males' aren't allowed to have friends anymore. I am not allowed to be part of a sports team or to visit school. My mother and sister tried to assimilate to the new system, because they fear the SSS so much. You probably know what that meant for me. I was being humiliated and forced to sniff and lick sweaty stinky feet over and over again. Even though women in Stenchlandia might not understand anymore, I still have my pride. This national park was my last chance to escape and live a normal life since it borders on another country without such an inhumane system. I was so close to be able to start all over again. Now please don't send me back, please don't..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it wasn't possible to immediately see what it was, Joe's speech certainly did something to Laurie. In the beginning she just listened interestedly, later she began to lour and clench her fists. At some point Joe even believed to see her getting teary-eyed for a second. When Laurie answered, her voice was a bit brittle and she didn't look arrogantly and masterfully at Joe anymore. In fact, it seemed as if she was considering him an equal being. \"Wow. If there's one thing you are really got at, it is moralizing. I guess I have to grapple with it a lot more intensely, before I make a decision about your fate. And I can think the best, when I am hunting alone. So, I think it is for your best, when I leave now and mull over this whole mess for a while. I will be back in the evening to present you my decision. Until then, I fear I will have to make sure you are sleeping in order to prevent you from doing something dumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing these words, Joe felt how new hope was rising inside him until he heard Laurie's last sentence. He instinctively made a face and asked: \"I this really necessary? I won't do something dumb, I will just stay calm and wait!\" Laurie just laughed and replied with a smile: \"You're somehow cute, Joe. I don't know you at all and you have lied to me at least once. I am rather careful and if you start to scream while I am away or make noise while desperately trying to free yourself, god knows who or what will notice our camp. I also understood now, that you hate the foot thing, but even if I would want to spare you this, I've got nothing else narcotizing with me. I promise you it will be over fast and not as bad, if you cooperate by inhaling deeply and constantly. So, are you willing to cooperate on this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine..\", Joe finally answered with crunching teeth after a long inner conflict with himself. Laurie nodded and grabbed some duct tape out of a chest nearby. \"Don't worry Joe. I'll just put one piece over your mouth, so it's easier for your to breath through your nose in a controlled manner, if your body tries to breath through the mouth as a defence reaction.\" After the tape was successfully placed over Joe's mouth, Laurie sat down and took off one of her hunting boots and revealed a sweaty socked foot. She really wanted to do this fast, so she also removed the sock and placed the stinky foot on Joe's face with her toes over his nose. Joe's body shuddered as the incredibly well-shaped, sweaty, almost yellow shining sole was pressed on his face. When he took the first deep sniff of air filtered through Laurie's hot and moist toes, the stale aroma of cheesy sweat almost made him gag, but Joe forced himself to keep sniffing deeply and regularly. To his surprise Laurie had been right. After the fourth deep sniff, he already felt how his body seemed heavier and heavier while his vision began blur. The next few breaths brought Joe at the verge of unconsciousness and the last thing he heard, before he passed out completely, was how Laurie said: \"Well done, that was really brave, Joe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, everything went black.</span></div></div>",

At least, Laurie had removed the piece of duct tape from his mouth after the successful \"narcotization\", which made it a lot more comfortable for Joe to breath. The lack of light inside the tent made it plain to Joe, that it was late in the evening outside. Laurie would certainly return soon, Joe thought and so he kept waiting and waiting. As time went by, he began to worry a little. What Laurie had said earlier about having to think a bit more, had sounded promising to Joe but what if she was just a good actress? What if she would return with some guards to pick Joe up? But before Joe could abandon himself longer to disturbing thoughts like these, he finally heard approaching footsteps..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Laurie entered the tent, she didn't seem insecure anymore at all. Instead her facial expression seemed very confident and resolved. She immediately turned to Joe and asked: \"Hey, how are you feeling? Everything okay?\" His answer came a bit diffident but fast. \"Yeah, I guess so...I'm still feeling a bit dizzy but that's alright..\" When Laurie heard his answer, she grinned coquettishly and sat down next to Joe. \"Don't worry, that's normal. Aaaaand as I have promised you, I have made my decision. I could explain you all my intentions very detailedly, but that would cost too much time, so I will try to put the things short. Although you, as my catch, certainly were quite a big temptation for my dominant side, I decided to not keep you. I have been dominating men already years before the ultra feminist party took over, but the ones I was dominating back then really deserved it. Ever since each woman in this country is encouraged by the law to humiliate men, doing so lost much of its allure for me. Besides, you're not even a man. Your a thirteen year old boy, more child than man. It just wouldn't be fair to take your last chance to live a normal life. Well, and keeping these thoughts at the back of my mind, it would make absolutely no sense to send you back to your 'beloved' family. Also, as I said before, a true hunter doesn't sell his catches. This leaves us only one option to go..you are free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe could barely believe what he was hearing. All the hoping, fearing, crying, suffering..should it finally turn out for his best now? He could hardly believe his luck and the situation seemed somehow surreal to Joe, because he was called \"free\" while still being firmly tied up. \"Oh my god, thank you Laurie..if I may call you like that? This is really the happiest moment in my life, thanks to you..I don't know what to say..I could maffick now!\" With a friendly smile Laurie answered: \"You better don't. If the wrong persons are around, this could end your luck as fast as it appeared. And I don't intend to let you go just so you can let yourself be captured by someone else. You really need to give it all now, on the very last meters of your journey! And yes, you can call me Laurie..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these words, Laurie left the tent and came back with Joe's backpack. \"You will surely need this, to be successful. I took care of your stuff and now you shall have it back. I also put a map inside your backpack, where you can see the best place to cross the border undetectedly. It's not guarded equally efficient everywhere and I searched you a rather calm spot. But now it's time to really free you!\" Saying this, Laurie took out a hunting knife and cut through the ropes. Finally being able to move, Joe stood up and stretched his aching limbs. \"Thank you so much, Laurie, I really owe you something if there's anything I could do for you. But I just don't understand why you changed your mind so fast..was it really my 'speech' all alone?\" This question seemed to be a bit uncomfortable for Laurie. She shuffled her feet for some seconds before she started to talk facing the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really want to know that? Well, I guess I kind of owe you an answer there.. Remember when I said that you reminded me of my 'lost' son? With the word 'lost' I didn't mean 'dead' or 'missing'. In the very beginning of the ultra feminist revolution in this country, my son, a very smart guy, already smelled a rat. He quickly took all his most necessary stuff, said \"Bye, mom\" and left our house to get away to the exact same neighboring country you're about to escape into. He is seventeen now, a bit older than you, but still, it must be hard for him to be all alone. I have not the slightest clue where exactly he is and how he is doing. Also he can't contact me, because he knows that this would make me suspicious for the SSS, and I'm sure he wants to spare me that. That's how I 'lost' my son and as long as Stenchlandia stays as it is now, there's no chance that I will see my son ever again. Of course I could try to follow my son, but then again, Stenchlandia always has been my home and I know that I couldn't live without it. Well, and the fact that you reminded me so much of him made it impossible for me to harm you. But you should stop listening to my stupid stories, now. Your chance to cross the border unmolestedly is the highest, when it's still dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe had been really carried away by Laurie's touching story, so that her last words hit him in the face like cold water. \"Oh..yeah, you're right. Again, I can't thank you enough and I'm convinced your son is alright. Don't worry too much, Laurie..good luck with everything!\" Just when Joe was about to walk away, Laurie cat-called at him. \"Wait a second! You offered to do me any favor you could..I just thought of..maybe you meet my son over there. His name is Patrick and this is a picture of him. Just in case you meet him, please tell him that his mother loves him and hopes that he is alright, will you?\" Obviously touched, Joe returned and took the picture. \"Of course I will do that if I can find him, I promise!\" Having said this, Joe and Laurie just hugged each other for some sentimental seconds, before reality and seriousness came back. \"Best of luck, Joe, I know you'll make it. I knew you were a fighter since that night I grappled with you! Bye!\", Laurie said with teary eyes. Joe breathed deeply and answered with new gained self-confidence. \"I know, don't worry, I WILL make it!\" Then, he turned round on his heel and ran further east.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later, Joe reached the border. The forest became more and more light, before it abruptly ended. A small concreted slip of land slashed itself a way left and right, behind it was forest again. But that was the neighboring country's forest! Joe was so near to his aim, that he felt his heart beating faster. Laurie once again had been right. This sector seemed to be safe, no guards were around, the wall here was aslope and brashly and showed only unperilous, deplorable rests of barbed wire. Finally, with pounding heart, a relieved smile and swollen with pride, Joe crossed the border..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonths after the portrayed incidents, still only few things where cleared. Nobody knew if Joe really made it in the neighboring country or if he just died somewhere outside. He never got in touch with his remaining family again, so that after three months the authorities decided to declare Joe for dead. His mother Jessica really took a hammering by this and sank into depression, whereas his sister Sarah became even more radical and volunteered for the Stenchlandian Army and the SSS. Another consequence of the \"Runaway-Kid-Incident\", how the authorities later called it, was that the bad state of the border part near the national park was discovered. In a 500.000-Bucks-Project the damaged border parts were renewed and provided with traps, obstacles and even spring guns. Laurie returned to her home in Stenchlandia and continued to live her daily routine. Although she didn't share this with anyone, she never doubted that Joe had successfully made his way to a new life.</span></div></div>",

Until now everything had gone as planned, the journey had been a pleasure. She had sung and eaten cookies with Sarah, which had made it possible for her to forget about Joe for a while. But then the things had changed for the worse, as if life wanted to sneer at her. About half an hour ago, they suddenly had gotten into a traffic jam for no viewable reason until the bad luck revealed its whole extent..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she had seen the SSS-car, Jessica had understood the situation. \"Oh fuck it!\", she had hissed, \"An SSS traffic control..this is not good..\". But there had been no choice, she had been forced to stop the car and now the two police offers were approaching her car. Just before Jessica wound down the window, she turned to the obviously scared Sarah and calmed her a bit. \"No need to panic, sweetheart, I'm sure if we just answer their questions, there's nothing we have to fear from these officers.\" Then she put on an air of importance and turned back, awaiting the interrogation by the officers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello miss\", the first officer, a brown-haired and compact woman in her mid-twenties, started. \"I am officer Gina and this is officer Betty\", she said  next, pointing at the other officer; a black-haired woman who was a bit taller than Gina with better proportioned feminine curves. After this little introduction, Gina went on with the business. \"This is just a routine act and if you are no criminals hiding illegal stuff, there's nothing you have to fear. We request you now show us your driver license and car documents and then get out of the car please, so that we can take a short look if there's anything suspicious.\" To her own surprise, Jessica managed it to stay perfectly calm. She showed the officers her driver license and the car documents, then she and Sarah got out of the car and watched the officers doing their job. For the next minutes Gina and Betty checked the car. At first they controlled the outside if every important badge was up to date and attached correctly. Then they examined the driving mirrors, tested all headlamps and finally crawled inside the car to search for illegal stuff in the glove boxes and under the seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having searched through the entire inside of the car, Gina came to Jessica and said: \"Well, looks like you've got a very nice and clear car. You can go on with your journey very soon, we just need to check the luggage trunk!\" From one second to another, it was over with Jessica's composure but she was helpless. \"Oh..okay..\", was all she was able to say and her face suddenly was completely pale. To her luck, Gina didn't notice her reaction because she immediately had joined Betty on the way to the luggage trunk. When they opened it and saw the inside, a tied up and barely conscious thirteen year old boy, the time seemed to stand still for the blink of an eye. Then, Betty breathed in sharply and Gina said in a low voice, more to herself than to the others: \"Look what we have here..I think after all there ARE some things to clear..\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With strict and and colder facial expressions, Gina and Betty approached Jessica and Sarah. \"Who is that in your luggage trunk?\", Gina asked with a sharp voice. Jessica felt as if she was turned into a pupil again, facing a strict teacher who asks for the homework. Therefore she felt how her hands were shaking and she answered in a unusually high pitched voice. \"Ehm, that is Joe, my s...eeer I mean just our worthless little footslave. Is something wrong with that, officer?\" Gina folded her arms and wrinkled her nose before replying. \"Well technically there is of course no problem in you having a footslave. The issue is that you have brought him <i>here</i>. Last week, the government adopted a new Bill, I think it was number 120, prohibiting anyone to bring their male beings anywhere close to Stenchlandia's borders. Recently there has been an increased rate of successful escapes of some..<i>beings</i>..it seems and the Bill 120 is how the government intends to stop this grievance. With bringing your footslave here, you, knowingly or not, commited a crime. However, you both don't give me the impression of having done this willingly. Just answer all of our questions now and this incident will only have minor consequences for you.\"<br>\r\nJessica and Sarah both knew that they were standing on a fine line. If they would try to defend themselves they would risk to be arrested. If they would cooperate, it certainly would affect Joe, who apparently wasn't allowed to be here. But they had to make a decision now, as hard as this was, especially for Jessica. In a dramatic moment, mother and daughter looked each other in the eyes for a second, then Sarah's lips formed \"Please mom, just go for it..\". With a sharp pain in her heart Jessica slightly nodded and turned back to Gina. \"Yeah, of course. You're right, we had no idea about this new law. We will answer all necessary questions right away.\"<br>\r\nGina seemed to be content with this willingness to cooperate and her facial expression became more gentle again. \"Good. Then let's begin. Betty? Would you please take the minutes?\" After Betty had agreed and pulled out pen and pad, Gina started the interrogation:<br>\r\n<b>Gina:</b> \"What is your name and where do you live?\"<br>\r\n<b>Jessica:</b> \"My name is Jessica and this is my daughter Sarah. The male person in the luggage trunk, as I said, is called Joe. He is my son but now, since the glorious feminist revolution he functions as our footslave. We all are living in 12th Honsteinstreet in Newberg, an average size town about 200 kilometers from here.\"<br>\r\n<b>Gina:</b> \"Where are you bound for?\"<br>\r\n<b>Jessica: </b>\"My daughter currently has got holidays, so we decided to go camping in a national park only a few steps from here.\"<br>\r\n<b>Gina:</b> \"Oh yeah, I know that one. It's a nice place to be. When will you return home?\"<br>\r\n<b>Jessica:</b> \"Probably next week on Thursday.\"<br>\r\n<b>Gina:</b> \"Alright, that's already it. What will happen now is that you have to pay a fine of fifty bucks. Then you can continue with your journey, but your footslave will have to stay here. Don't worry we will take care of him and send him into a reception camp for the likes of him. From there he will be sent back to your house in Newberg on the same day you return. And once again, no reason to panic, the people running these reception camps know how to keep a footslave in good shape. Next week on Thursday he will be as good as new without having unlearned anything, I can promise you that!\"<br>\r\nJessica had no other but to accept and so she paid the fine and watched together with Sarah how the two officers untied Joe, removed the gag and carried his still limp body to the SSS-car. Then Betty closed the luggage trunk again and gave Jessica the green light to depart. While Sarah qualmishly fidget around on her seat rushing her mother to \"drive already\" in order to escape the uncomfortable situation, Jessica cast a last glance on the unconscious body of her son, before finally stepping on the gas...<br>\r\nIn the meanwhile Gina was busy securing Joe again. Although he still was unconscious, his head sometimes moved and Gina didn't know if he maybe was about to wake up. And in case he was, it should be better to have him immobile. Since classic rope wasn't included in the equipment of a standard SSS-vehicle, she used handcuffs to tie his ankles together. This should be enough to make his legs useless. For the upper part of the body Gina fished a straight jacket out of the equipment section in the car. When she was almost done jamming Joe's flabby body into the straight jacket, Betty came over and watched her. \"Uhm, what exactly are you doing there, Gina?\" she asked with a smirk on her face. With a slightly stressed voice Gina answered: \"Do you want this little piece of shit crying and wriggling about on the backseat, once it wakes up? Asking us where his mommy went and where we are bringing him he might even try to open the door while we drive! No, no, no. I prefer it if we just nip this little problem in the bud, tie him up, put this over his little mouth (saying this she took a piece of tape and put some strips over Joe's mouth) and be done with it!\" Betty was laughing by now. \"Haha, you're so smart Gina..and so cruel.\"<br>\r\nSpurred on even more by Betty's reaction, Gina's eyes began to dangerously shine. \"Cruel? This? Not just yet. I don't know how you see that, but I have been on my feet all day controlling thousands of cars and now it's quitting time. My feet are killing me in these uncomfortable shoes and I kind of need a refreshment. Even so, we still have to make a two hour car ride to our police station, where we need to deliver this prick so that they can send him to a reception camp. In my opinion he should make himself useful, for the chauffeur service we're carrying out for him. So how about we put him under the front passenger seat? One hour you drive, one hour I drive. The one who isn't driving can rest her feet on his face. Aaaaaah the cool air flow of his breathing will be such a pleasure and relish for my hot and sweaty toes! What do you think?\"<br>\r\nBetty grinned broadly and clapped Gina on the shoulder. \"That's typically Gina. Cruel but great ideas! Alright, let's do that, but you drive in the beginning. I want to be the first!\" Gina immediately agreed on that. Her feet had been heating up since hours, waiting another hour for the long-desired relief practically made no difference. Well maybe it would for this little kid, but not for her..<br>\r\nA sharp and cheesy stench assaulting his nostrils tore Joe out of his semi-consciousness. Where was he? Hadn't he been inside the luggage trunk of his family's car? Now he was still tied up and gagged and in a car but he was trapped under a seat, looking up to two women dressed in SSS uniforms. One was at his right, obviously driving the vehicle. The other, black-haired one, sat on the seat right above him and pressed a damp sock under his nose. Panic rushed through Joe's veins like fire through a dried out conifer forest. He wiggled as much as he could (which wasn't much at all) and screamed bloodcurdlingly into his gag, causing his two tormentors to laugh loudly. \"Ooooh\", teased the black-haired one, \"is it too stinky for my little boy? Here, I have something for you..the source!\" With these words she slammed her foot on Joe's face, her toes spread over his nose. \"Sniff, sniff, little boy. Sniff, sniff!\" Once again Joe burst out in muffled screams much to the amusement of Gina and Betty. \"You are right, Gina, his breathing does feel good and relieving! We should maybe visit the footslave stores downtown more often, haha! Gina smirkingly fell in with Betty on that one, then Betty fully concentrated on Joe again. Joe's eyes began to tear as he was tortured helplessly in such a way. Also he began to realize that the SSS had him and that he probably wouldn't see anyone of his beloved ones again. He even started to miss Sarah, being confronted with such cruelty. The next minutes trapped under Betty's slimy toes were pure torture but somehow Joe managed it to stay conscious. Finally, after an hour of footstink inhalation the car pulled over but much to Joe's terror, the two officers just switched places.<br>\r\nThe engine started again, and the agonizing drive continued. The brown-haired woman, now sitting on the seat on top of Joe's immobile body immediately began to unzip her boots and presented her black and completely sweat-soaked nylons. \"Aahh, finally my feet are going to breath! Hey boy down there, what you are about to smell now is really good and ripened stuff. I'll make sure that you take it in with deep drags!\" Saying this and accompanied by Betty's shrill laughter, she quickly plastered her feet on Joe's face trying to squeeze his nose between the big and second toe of her right foot. Due to the damp and slimy state of her soles, Joe's nose slipped out two times before Gina was finally successful with her third attempt. Joe, now unable to breath at all, opened his eyes widely in panic and began to beg for air through his gag. However, Gina cruelly let him struggle for more than thirty seconds, before she quickly released her grip and formed a foot-tent over Joe's nose with her hot and moist toe-area. The stench, Joe sucked in deeply in the following seconds was so intense and strong that his heart stopped beating for a second. Next, he felt how his vibrissaes were burnt just before the acrid footsmell rushed further up through his paranasal sinuses and hit his brain like a steel spearhead. Joe's body started to twitch wildly in his bounds, his eyes rolled around before closing completely and out of his throat, through the gag sounded a painful gurgling. Some seconds later, he was completely asleep but Gina just stayed in place with her feet, since his reliefing breathing was still there.<br>\r\n\"What a wimp\", she said in contempt. \"If my feet hit him like that, he is lucky that Maria isn't here anymore. You remember her? Her feet were easily twenty times worse than mine! But yeah, she's in the serious business now, working for the more dangerous tasks the SSS has to fulfill. I do miss her sometimes.\" Betty answered that she had never known Maria but that she sounded like an impressive woman. But before the two officers got into a longer conversation again, they arrived at the police station..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>About a decade ago, Stenchlandia had been compromised, not by outside forces invading our homeland but by the corrupt and unchecked authority of its predominantly male-dominated government.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn our greatest time of need, those who had sworn an oath to put the needs of the many above their own faltered on that promise and left us all to suffer the consequences of their actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaissez-faire economics, they said, always have a way of working itself out in the end. It didn\u2019t. Not this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThousands lost their jobs as the domino effect of the economic collapse threatened and very nearly destroyed our way of living. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more were forced out of their homes and had to sell coveted family heirlooms and other valuables just to feed their families and keep clothes on their backs. This was the price that we all paid for our government\u2019s political gambling and gluttony, and it was a high price indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany would (and did) compare it to the Great Depression that had plagued the United States of America back in the early 20th Century. But at least there was a clear leadership and a plan of recovery for the Americans to overcome their economic decline with the progressive legislation proposed by President Roosevelt\u2019s administration and the subsequent Second World War.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Stenchlandia however, the government had vetoed any such legislation that would lift all of its plighted denizens out of this slump. For years, we the people of this once prosperous land, suffered while the gluttonous gentlemen in office preferred to watch us struggle from their posh balconies atop multi story mansions and offices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo per the terms of the universal social contract forged between the government and the people, the long-suffering people of the Stenchlandian State decided unanimously to use the most important right: the right to rebel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe National Feminist Liberation League, comprised of many of the disgruntled and disillusioned female workers and politicians who had long endured the blundering and utter ineptness of the male patriarchy, staged a political coup in 2012 and successfully overthrew the pre-existing Stenchlandian government. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a hostile takeover in name only, as the federal army had long deserted their posts by that point to be with their families leaving only a skeleton crew behind to fight off this insurrection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who fought against this new political machine, however, were never heard from again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all of the talking heads who had filled our televisions with their condescending promises of a better tomorrow had been ousted from their thrones, the country was rebuilt from the ground up with a new leadership.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStenchlandia became the Feminist Republic of Stenchlandia, and a Council of all-female Representatives was established to change the social pecking order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith our mistrust of prominent male authority figures the impetus for this uprising in the first place, it was child\u2019s play for them to manipulate public favor towards changing the very societal structure of the nation. Within the same month, the NFLL signed into law something that would forever change our lives: Bill 66. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis bill rendered all male citizens of Stenchlandia perpetually subservient to females with direct and indirect defiance of said act punishable by cruel and unusual means carried out by the newly appointed Stenchlandian State Security. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the eyes of the Feminist Liberation League, men were the cause of our economic drought to begin with so naturally the logical step would be to remove them permanently from any kind of leadership role not just in politics but in the community as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce boys became of age, they were taught to serve at the feet of their female counterparts: friend, family, stranger, or otherwise. Those who complied and conformed without question were the lucky ones: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone who resisted would be made compliant either by the SSS or female citizens, and the methods that they use to break someone\u2019s spirit is the stuff of nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the reality that we all live in now, yet something tells me if you\u2019re still reading this you don\u2019t believe that this is how life should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou might be asking how did we as a once proud nation devolve to this tribalistic mentality of 'might makes right', with no room for grey areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may also be wondering to yourself how things like treating our sons like the family pet and never looking an SSS officer in the eye became so normalized in our lives that we do it without even thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth is that they don\u2019t want you to think, because that interferes with whatever propaganda they\u2019ve plastered over our television sets and computer screens to convince us of their \u2018altruistic\u2019 intentions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, let\u2019s look at a condensed version of what they want you to believe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan gets power. Power corrupts man. Man fails to serve the people. The people overthrows man. Man now serves the people.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThis, as I\u2019m sure you know, has been the same formula you\u2019ve been force fed since 2012 until it\u2019s sapped away enough at your brain\u2019s higher functions that you\u2019ve become just another docile denizen singing the praises of the NFLL like the thousands of Stenchlandians who do so on a daily basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the truth that they would, but as my late mother often said, \u201cTruth is a matter of perspective.\u201d So if you would, allow me to offer mine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth in my opinion, is that the National Feminist Liberation League do not have our best interests at heart, and are quite frankly, full of complete and utter bullshit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe promises that they made were the same that those before them made, with the only difference being that the Council has a militarized gestapo at the ready in case you start thinking too hard about what\u2019s being said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yes, the previous government was by no means perfect but they at least abided by the democratic principles that Stenchlandia was originally founded upon: freedom of speech, due process and natural rights for all citizens just to name a few. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe could criticize the government openly without the constant fear of being dragged from our homes at night and subjected to unspeakable tortures befitting that of a prisoner of war. Punishments for crimes weren\u2019t exclusive to only males, and the perpetrators were at least given a fair trial to prove their innocence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost importantly of all, all people, both male and female, were treated like beings of the same race instead of one subgroup being designated with servicing another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce upon a time, life wasn\u2019t just a daily routine of having your documents at hand to show SSS officers before going to work in a rare likelihood that they don\u2019t tie your face to the wrong end of their boot just on the basis of something so trivial as an alleged \u2018dirty look.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce upon a time, dear reader, we had a choice. There was no Council presiding over our every move, dictating which of us would be the bootlickers and which of us would be wearing the boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet somehow, that choice magically disappeared when the people voted the National Feminist Liberation League into power and it\u2019s been gone ever since. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you may ask why I do this, why I put myself in the public arena knowing that my days could very well be numbered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause I choose to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy fiancee, Paul, was one of the few brave soldiers who stood in the way of the NFLL\u2019s crusade to the capital of Stenchlandia all those years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew the government was corrupt to the core, but he didn\u2019t care. Flawed as they may be, those politicians had families and loved ones and he put his life before theirs to ensure that they could return to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his unit was overwhelmed by what would become the SSS, I lost contact with him and the love of my life became a faded memory in this new nightmare that I wake up to everyday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were to be married on August 1st, the same day that the crown of leadership over our beloved nation would be worn by hypocritical fascists who think that superiority over all men is the equivalent of feminism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will never see my husband again, and chances are slim that I will ever learn of the hellish fate that he\u2019s subjected to for simply doing the right thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was never given a choice, and I can no longer stand by the sidewalk another day and watch thousands of men like my beloved be dragged across the streets to places I would never subject my worst enemy to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I ask you, the people of Stenchlandia, to take action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoose to act of your own free will, not conform to the martial law that\u2019s pounded us into submission for far too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoose to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe overthrew this government once after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho\u2019s to say we can\u2019t do it again? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bead of anxious sweat trickled down the forehead of Anna Durand as her eyes frantically scanned the electronic pages she had just typed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer screen lit up her face in a bluish hue, illuminating her petite features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith shoulder-length brunette hair draped across her cardigan in strands, hazel brown eyes scrutinizing almost every word from behind her glasses, and her pale white skin caked in sweat, she looked every bit the archetype of the typical college graduate still trying to fit into the real world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer street clothes were simple and basic: a pair of khaki pants, buttoned up white shirt, brown cardigan, and a pair of used sneakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her index finger hovering nervously above the right-click of the mouse, she bit her lip nervously as she prepared to publish her manifesto for all to see, including those at the very forefront of her digital rebellion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is for you Paul,\u201d she finally said, before pressing the button.</span></div></div>",

BEE-<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nAnna Durand\u2019s head snapped backwards as the alarm clock mere inches away from her previously napping head exploded into its usual cacophonous belching of synchronized sounds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes, still glazed over from last night, groggily came back into focus as the alarm continued to whine in a seemingly nonstop loop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally adjusting her glasses to fit around her ears, she squinted her eyes a few times as the computer screen in front of her also jolted back to life from sleep mode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking her neck sorely before stretching her fingers, she brushed off a few stray strands of hair away from her eyes before her eyes fully came into focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning instinctively as her petite yet potent fingers caressed the keyboard, she quickly typed in the password into the login screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a breath, she pulled up the page she had fallen asleep proofreading as her eyes pinpointed where on the document the blinking cursor was located: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just yesterday, I was forced to watch as an SSS officer dragged a man out from the farmer\u2019s market and threw him on the pavement before kicking the perceived fight out of him. His only crime: daring to speak of his own volition to one of the vendors on behalf of his owner who had given him permission to do so mind you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo just for speaking, this man was beaten near half to death by an SSS officer young enough to be his daughter before the masses like some archaic form of public humiliation, then strapped to a wooden pillory where he would endure further humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it wouldn\u2019t be a typical SSS beatdown without her removing her boots and forcing him to inhale her toxic stench, if he was even conscious at that point of course. Remember when these two-legged doggies we have now used to have actual names? You know- brother, father, son, husband\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood times, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember those times fondly, as do many of you I\u2019m sure. A time where the mere thought of a male asserting his bodily autonomy wasn\u2019t subject to criminal prosecution complete with public humiliation. Granted, the male patriarchy of old Stenchlandia had a flawed leadership but at least there was some semblance of social order and equality amongst both sexes.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs opposed to now of course, where the current political party wielding an iron fist has condemned all males to a subservient quality of living based on the actions of a corrupt few. I can\u2019t help but find parallels in our current leadership to another infamous political machine that also prosecuted and demeaned an entire subgroup of people based on the perceived actions of a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Quiz: For those who\u2019ve read the history books that the Feminist Republic haven't yet tainted with their \u2018revisionist purity,\u2019 what other prominent political party in the history books rose to power following a country\u2019s fall from grace and proceeded to forever taint their country\u2019s name by lying on their initial promises of grandeur?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, Nazi Germany of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s right, and the actions of that particular party caused a world war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo ask yourselves, people of Stenchlandia: how much more of this feminazi regime are you willing to stomach before they too plunge us in a war that we\u2019ll never recover from? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her eyes circled around the last word, Anna took a breath before bringing the mouse down to the send button and pressing it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin nanoseconds, her work was submitted to the electronic annals of the World Wide Web where it would become either legend or blasphemy, depending on who was reading it of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlumping back on her chair, she sighed in the hopes that her message would reach the ears of disillusioned Stenchlandians who also longed for the seemingly anachronistic days of gender equality and democracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hope, though admirable, was fueled more by childish naivety than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, since she had begun making her viral entries into Stenchlandian cyberspace months ago only a few pockets of resistance against the Republic had arisen. Many were stamped out under the Republic\u2019s proverbial and literal boot immediately, with even fewer persisting long enough to vanish into the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew based on the website\u2019s online traffic that people were listening but thanks to the SSS\u2019s presence on the streets it was near impossible for them to answer her call to action in any meaningful way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, that was perhaps for the best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna had already lost the one person who meant more to her than anyone else: her beloved Paul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had little to lose, and much to gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else, with their families and freedom at stake everyday, had everything to lose and nothing to gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeditating on that lingering thought as she exited out of the web-page and powered down her computer, she yawned one last time before getting up out of her chair and stretching her limbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at herself in the mirror, she couldn\u2019t help but sigh at her unkempt face, with her unruly black hair still untamed and the faintest signs of age marks stitched across her face. It was a face that had went through more pain and heartbreak than some people will undergo in their lifetimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragging her bare feet against her room, her right hand brushed up against the wall and traced the frame of the pinned up college diploma she had been awarded on her university commencement ceremony, a day that seemed a lifetime ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swell of bittersweet nostalgia coursed through her as her eyes gazed at the academic credential that had symbolized her time at the University of Stenchlandia, her attention diverted to a happier time in her life if only for a fleeting moment before reality reared its ugly head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly tearing her gaze away, she looked around at her childhood room for a moment. Her bed was a mess with blankets and sheets everywhere, textbooks and magazines littered the floor, and the only area of her room even remotely organized was her computer desk for obvious reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the sounds of male screaming outside her bedroom walls shook her out of her momentary malaise and prompted her back into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, the now refreshed Anna Durand plopped down on her bed carrying a pair of worn black flats in one hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer previously unruly mane of hair was now pinned into a respectable tight bun, with her glasses polished and a thin layer of lipstick applied to her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeck down, she wore a grey uniform that stretched from her collarbone all the way to her ankles. Undertones of black and grey clashed in the color scheme of her shirt, while a pair of black leggings constricted around her legs. Her bare feet, the designated symbol of female superiority and dominance over the male population, were shapely and dainty with her unpainted toes and narrow arches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nose shriveled up as she nonchalantly wiggled her toes, letting the pungent aroma of her own foot odor waft upwards into her nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the pair of used and abused flats on the ground, she reluctantly wiggled her feet into them before reaching from behind and producing a small grey cap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pure look of disgust and hate crossed her face as she glowered at the hat before biting her lip and putting it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow standing up, she walked over to her dresser and stared contemptuously at the woman in the mirror staring back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce upon a time, she could look at herself without feeling an overwhelming sense of disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, the feeling of disgust was the only thing that came to mind as she looked at what she had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnna dear, please tell me you\u2019re still alive in there! Haven\u2019t heard a peep from you all morning, and I would\u2019ve assumed you\u2019d be downright jubilant. After all, today\u2019s the day!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing Mother! Just need a minute,\u201d she called back, sighing to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful that that minute doesn\u2019t turn into an hour, yeah?\u201d her mother reminded her, before continuing on to say, \"You know the Academy has no toleration for tardiness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce, she would call all SSS officers a plethora of names: pigs, gestapo, bullies, the list goes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow unfortunately, she called one of them Mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra Durand was a high-ranking officer of the SSS, who had enlisted voluntarily upon the police force\u2019s inception years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd throughout the years, it had become increasingly more difficult to see her mother for the kind and compassionate maternal figure she once was during her childhood as opposed to how she is now as an officer in the Stenchlandian State. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly didn\u2019t help that Anna was forced by her mother to enlist in the police force, undergoing intense training and conditioning to only now hold the novice title of \u2018Cadet.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead of doing something meaningful with her college education, she was now forced to become the very thing that she hates more than anything in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd almost to taunt her every waking moment of each day, her college diploma remains on the wall just to show the life that she could\u2019ve, would\u2019ve, and perhaps should\u2019ve enjoyed with Paul had circumstances been different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, if she is forced to wear the jacket of the devil the least she can do is sing with the voice of an angel from beyond her computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBitterly fingering the silver <i>C </i>for Cadet emblazoned on the right-side of her uniform, she looked at her computer one last time before exiting the bedroom and going down the hallway to meet with her mother. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria, an experienced officer of the Stenchlandian State Security, forcefully opened the large double-doors leading to the inside of the SSS headquarters. She quickly scanned the inside of the hall in front of her with her expert gaze, soon spotting a higher ranked member of the SSS, and walking towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's career at the SSS had started relatively early, several years ago. Even back when Maria was still too young to join it, it had always been her greatest wish to once rise up in their ranks. The Stenchlandian propaganda managed to have dramatic effects on Maria and for as long back as she could remember, she was a firm believer in female superiority and did everything in her might to prove her dedication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had been infamous for torturing others with her feet, preferably males but quite often females too, as soon as she found the slightest reason to do so. Many people also suspected that she sometimes punished people with her feet for pure satisfaction... Although they wouldn't say it to her face, as they knew they'd instantly be her next target, if they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis stubborn dedication, fierce will and a high natural intelligence allowed Maria to rise up in the ranks unusually quick. At the age of 21, she had joined the Stenchlandian Police, a position that seemed to be made for her. With the Stenchlandian's tight grip on its populace, only very few people dared to commit serious crimes, so Maria hardly found herself in moments of actual danger. She did, however, find opportunity to \"question\" suspects quite often. The victims of these interrogations often left the room unconscious, a terrible smell coming off their faces. Maria's incredibly efficient interrogation methods soon drew the attention of the SSS towards her, which recruited her soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe SSS was different to the regular police; It was the secret state police and as such, Maria was no longer a regular police officer and more of a secret agent. Once again, Maria had proved great skill in her line of work. Of course, her methods of getting suspects to speak \"the truth\" were as efficient as ever, but her employers soon realized that she also had an incredible talent when it came to secret missions. Maria was so good in sneaking around, hiding herself from the enemies view and moving completely noiselessly that she often used to infiltrate buildings and gather information without alerting her targets. Even though Maria rarely had to fight, she was always in perfect physical shape, able to dish out devastating moves, should the need arise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Maria had been called into the headquarters much earlier than usual. She didn't know yet what the exact reason was, information like that was always only delivered directly from person to person. One of her superiors, Captain Amber Stonefield gave her a brisk salute as she stepped closer, followed by a wide grin. Maria was relieved that it seemed to be Amber she would have to talk with, she was one of her old friends. After a salute of her own, she spoke \"Morning, Amber. I came as quickly as I could after I received your message. It seems quite urgent, do we have any sort of emergency?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber continued to shine Maria with her beaming grin for a few moments, remaining completely silent while she stared at her intensely with her bright, blue eyes, an unusual blank expression in them. Moments like this one used to fill Maria with... unease. From time to time, she did these things and many people didn't like her attitude, rumors even implied she was somehow not right in the head. But her ideas were right and she was an efficient agent, and that was all that mattered to Maria, and the SSS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" She finally said, her wide grin melting into a regular smile. \"It actually is quite important. I would like to discuss the matter with you in my private office, if you don't mind?\" Amber said, shooting off a few glances to her left and right. Maria nodded \"Yes, no problem at all. After you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber gave her another short grin before turning around and walking towards her office. Maria followed her shortly, and had to smirk herself when she saw several lower-ranked agents quickly moving out of Amber's way, sometimes almost jumping. Similarly to herself, Amber also had the reputation that she enjoyed to punish people with her feet a bit more than would be required by her work. Maria has had the pleasure to smell the scent of her feet herself a few times... And even she had to admit that Amber had two of the smelliest feet in probably the whole SSS. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short walk, they reached Amber's office and they stepped in. Amber immediately dropped into her chair and pointed to another, smaller one in front of her desk. As Maria sat down, she had to fight the urge to wrinkle her nose; Even right now, the typical smell of sweaty female feet was in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. So... We have somewhat of a delicate situation here, actually...\" Amber began, playing around with her long, blonde hair with her right hand while looking around aimlessly in the room. \"But it also might be a big chance for you, to rise even further. You see, Maria, the big bosses originally wanted some even more advanced agents to handle this mission, but due to some... unforeseen events, you are now our best bet.\" Maria cocked one eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why... What happened?\" \"Oh, Agent Copper injured her knee somehow, Agent Zinc was sent to another mission in the southern district and Agent Wolfram went... missing. Anyway, let me get straight to the point: We have acquired insider information that a potentially dangerous group has formed... We are not sure of their real name yet, but they seem to call themselves \"LTFK\". Possible an abbreviation of some sorts? Anyway... They are openly opposing our government and if what I have heard is true, they even actively try to gather more people for their group... The worst thing? They are accepting males and females alike, rumors are they even treat them... equally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria scrunched her face up \"Those vile criminals!\" she blurted. Amber nodded \"I'm with you here. As I said... they may have grown too big and dangerous to just raid their headquarters in a big operation. The civilians would know and wonder how we even let this have come this far. It may even inspire OTHER groups to do the same!\" At this point, Amber was gradually raising her voice, up to a point where she was outright screaming out loud, while gesturing with her hands widely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, and the COR DEMANDS that those outlaws brought to JUSTICE! But... yes...\" Amber was calming down a little \"First, you have to infiltrate their base, unnoticed and gather information. We are not entirely sure how big their organisation really is, or if their motives are actually as bad as we believe right now. You are to find out, Maria! Of course, it would be perfect if you could take in their leader right away... Maybe even SMASH THROUGH their entire organisation! But... if you find them too many to handle on your own, do not hesitate to call for backup! If we are really faced with no other option, we will send a bigger team to their base to take them out. But again, it would be favorable if we could avoid this kind of movement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you say, Maria? Are you up to the task?\" Amber asked, a sly smile spreading on her face again as she tilted her head to the side slightly.</span></div></div>",

I am ready to do this, I have successfully completed many missions like this one and it would bring me great honor... and satisfaction, to deliver our righteous judgement to those heretics!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had spoken with such vigor that she instantly feared she had come off as a bit too extreme... even for her own standards. But Amber seemed quite content with it- No, she was outright excited! \"Yes! This is EXACTLY what I want to hear!\" Amber said loudly. Then, she snipped her fingers and winked at Maria \"I knew you were the right one for this mission, Maria. I TOLD them! Ah-hem, anyway... Yes, I have utmost confidence in your abilities... Go, and FINISH THEM!\" Amber barked and stared at Maria silently, but with a quite fierce look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria shrugged nervously and tried to add \"Uhm, yes I will, but I need to know-\" \"Of course!\" Amber interrupted and gave her a quick sign to be quiet and fumbled around with something on her desk that Maria couldn't quite see from her position. Suddenly, a static noise was heard and a female voice spoke \"Yes?\" \"Agent Bismuth!\" Amber yelled at the top of her lungs, in seemingly no particular direction, making Maria jump a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard some quiet mumbling from Agent Bismuth, followed by a more clear \"Yes? What can I do for you?\" \"Bring the file of those, uh... The LTFK file. Bring it to me. To my office.\" Amber screamed. They heard a weak sigh. \"Alright, right away. I will be there in say... 10, 15 minutes?\" Agent Bismuth responded. \"WHAT? Can't you deliver this faster?\" Amber shouted with an incredible volume. Another short pause. \"I will see what I can do.\" \"YES! Good! Captian Stonefield OVER!\" Amber yelled into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria could swear she heard some sort of mumbled curse before the static noise ended again. \"Oh well... let me be honest with you, Maria, this new method of communication is still confusing me.\" Amber said, wiping her forehead with the back of her hand. \"Awww, come on, it's not that bad. Also, it's supposed to be 100% safe. Not possibe for anybody from the outside to listen into it, with any method, or so I've been told.\" Maria said, shrugging again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well... Alright. Hmmm... Hey, I have a good idea, Maria! If this should take 15 minutes or so anyway, I can show you something nice in the meantime!\" \"Oh? What is it?\" \"My new personal slave!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Doggy, come to your owner!\" Amber ordered with a confident, jocose, tone. Something, or rather, somebody, moved in the shadowy corner of the room. As Maria tried to scan through the darkness, a man no older than 25 crawled to her superior while dragging his tied feet. When he finally managed to reach Amber, the man reflexively licked the already shiny black boots, causing the SSS Captain to release a dominant giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrainwashed by propaganda that depicted men as inferior beings, and having been raised in a family whose household pet was a male, Maria could do nothing else but grin evilly:<br>\r\n\"Right where it should belong. At our feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, you are so correct, Maria.\" Amber affirmed, signalling her slave to take off the KGB-style combat boots. Acknowledging his new position, the Captain's human pet began to unlace the Master's shoes. \"He's Jacques, although you can call him Doggy. Ain't that right, Doggy? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Goddess.\" Jacques uttered through his thick accent, making both SSS agents laugh devilishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see Doggy is well trained. Where did you get him, ma'am?\" Maria questioned, finally locating the source of the smell to female feet that flooded the office - Jacques seemed to be wearing a sort of pet collar made of what appeared to be once white socks. Likely, Amber's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gift from a French feminist group. You see, Maria, a few weeks ago <i>La ligue des partisans du f\u00e9minisme</i>, a feminist ally party in France picked up a radio transmission from an enemy pro-Male cell regarding an operation to destroy the former. Thankfully, they foiled the operation completely, and took dozens of male scum into custody. But because the French couldn't make them speak, the men were sent to the State Security to interrogate. Once confronted with our <i>progressive</i> interrogation techniques, they sang like nightingales. Neither we, nor the Frenchwomen, had anything else to do with the traitors, and since they were already used to the smell of our feet, we enslaved them as relief prisoners for the agents.\" she answered, dangling her black-socked feet which had finally slipped off her moist footwear, dangerously near Doggy's face and making Maria's eyes water slightly due to the smell that Amber was spreading through the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so cool... I wished I had one so that when I came back to the HQ somebody would take care of my sore feet...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inhale hard!\" Amber cut, pushing her two bare feet into Doggy's face, who immediately began to smell loudly. \"Oh, sorry. Well, if you accomplish the mission, and quite certainly you will, then Director Madison is surely going to give you at least a man to pet. Maybe even more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, that would be fantas-\" Maria started. She was, however, interrupted by the opening of Amber's office's door. Agent Bismuth, a short girl with an abnormally pale face, and whose brown hair fell over her shoulders like water fell over a cascade, entered the room breathing heavily due to the hurried jog upstairs. Bismuth's eyes nearly jumped off their orbits when she saw her commander forcing the Frenchman to smell her feet. She seemed to also be able to smell them quite well, seeing how she tried to avoid breathing unnecessarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there you are, Bismuth.\" the Captain greeted, giving out a small salute. Bismuth returned the salute, and swiftly passed the case's files to her commander, before attempting to exit the room as quickly and as unsuspectingly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber stood up and with a short gesture, sent her personal pet back to his corner. She once more sat down, instinctively putting her feet over the table. Maria, who has in the other side of the desk, tried to ignore the intense vinegary stink that her Captain's exhaled, but for no avail. Their smell seemed to block Maria's ratiocination as it hit her nostrils, causing her to both cough and forcing her stomach to try and retain the day's meals inside. Thankfully, Amber did not take long to review the case, ultimately delivering the file to Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you have all the needed information - suspected hideouts, common radio bands, some code names we have been able to pick out and the outlines of the organization's activity. Now, good luck to you, Lieutenant. The Feminist Republic puts its bets on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria stood up and saluted her commander proudly. The latter smiled widely, and dismissed her with a salute.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria grinned widely as she pushed open the front door of the SSS headquarters again, leaving the building this time. The expression on her face was one of the utmost confidence and determination; Maria remembered all the details about her mission quite well. Nevertheless, as she was now quickly striding down the street, she reached into one of her uniform's many pockets, pulling out a few pages of text and a map that showed a part of the city. Maria didn't bother to read the text again, she knew it pretty much only gave vague information, nothing she could really use. The map, however, provided her with several areas at which the SSS suspected the rebel's hideout to be. She quickly scanned those areas once more and thought of the best spot to begin her investigations. In any case, walking there would take quite some time, as the district was relatively far away from the SSS headquarters. Maria willingly chose to walk there because for one thing, it warmed her up should combat follow when she reached her targets and maybe even more importantly, it would get her feet nice and sweaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was a pretty warm day, Maria felt somewhat sweaty already, but she could never be sure enough. Her extremely quick pace only helped in that matter. Maria tucked the papers into her uniform once more and took a closer look around as she was walking. The area around the SSS headquarters, sometimes called \"SSS zone\" was mostly composed of modern, tidy buildings of steel and glass. It was mostly pleasant to look at, everything was clean and orderly here and Maria enjoyed this view because she knew it would change way too soon, when she entered another district of the city. And still, despite the clean surroundings, the sky above looked very much dark and dreary; A thick layer of smog was mostly obstructing the sunlight, even though the factories and other facilities responsible for the pollution were located someplace else. Air simply doesn't obey to borders!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked to the other side of the street as she was marching, and saw a few high-class women in fine dresses striding around. Following them were their men, dressed far less fancy and with their hands together, like prisoners. One of them must have been a bad male recently, as he was attached to his mistress with a collar and leash and had an especially broken look on his face. Maria couldn't help but smile as after some talking, the women on the other side started to take turns in making their men smell their feet. This was a very popular pastime in Stenchlandia, sometimes the women would hold competitions to see whose feet smelled the strongest and sometimes they just enjoyed tormenting some unfortunate victims with their powerful foot odour. One of the males just broke out into an uncontrollable coughing fit after smelling a pair of particularly deadly feet and all the females broke out in giggles. Maria could only nod her head in silent approval. This was exactly what she loved to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more minutes of walking, Maria could tell the difference in the surroundings clearly. She was now coming very close to the areas the SSS suspected the enemy to be in, and the buildings here were pretty lowly most of the time. Some were downright smashed or burned apart, some seemed to be damaged in some places and some were just very dirty. The air around these parts also got worse and the layer of smog above was even thicker. Maria nodded gently in understanding; If any sort of resistance to their glorious system should arise, it only seemed natural to that happening in the dirtiest, lowest parts of town. And Maria hadn't been walking for a long time in this district when she saw two suspicious individuals talking to each other. Disturbingly enough, they both seemed to be females. \"Traitors...\" Maria mumbled darkly to herself, even though she didn't know anything for certain yet. But there was something in her gut that just <i>told</i> her these two were guilty of something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Maria was proven right, not only were those two girls communicating in hushed whispers before, but as soon as they spotted her, striding down the street in her shining black, intimidating SSS uniform, they began to flee instantly. \"I knew it...\" Maria hissed as she gave chase. Those girls were quick, but no match to her; Their only luck was that they started running while Maria was still on the other side of the street and that they knew the surroundings of this part of the city much better. Maria started to sprint with frightening speed, the two girls had run into a backalley, and when Maria followed them there, they were already climbing a high fence. \"Stop right there! SSS!\" Maria yelled loudly and one of the girls winced visibly as she heard the order. Maria grunted in annoyance when the two of them didn't actually stop at all and started to climb the fence with a high jump. As she landed on the other side, the two girls were still in her field of view, but after a few seconds, the vanished behind a corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria quietly cursed and sprinted ahead with all the speed she could muster. She wouldn't let those filthy traitors escape their punishment! As she reached the corner, Maria was yelling loudly as she looked all around, trying to locate her targets as quickly as possible again \"You cannot escape! Turn yourselves in now, and your punishment will be a <i>little</i> lighter! Aha!\" Maria had just seen them again, climbing up one of the buildings. As she gave chase once more, she heard one of her targets shouting \"I can't go on for much longer! Maybe we should just-\" only to be shot off by an angry \"NO! Are you crazy? Do you know what those SSS bitches will do to you?\" from her friend. Maria grinned widely as she saw the girl complaining falling back visibly behind her friend. Maria was already getting extremely close to her, victory was almost certain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter climbing for a little while, both of her targets had reached the roof, with Maria coming shortly behind. \"Come on now, we have to jump!\" The leading girl yelled, running to the edge of the building and jumping far, far away... And then landing on the roof of another building with an elegant roll, after which she continued her daring escape. Her friend ran to the edge as well... But she stopped abruptly upon reaching it! \"I... I can't do it!\" She yelled desperately. \"What? You have to do it! Hurry up!\" Came the distant response from the roof below... But it was already too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally catching up to her prey, Maria seized the second girl firmly by her neck. \"You! Finally got you now!\" She yelled, triumph and happiness creeping into Maria's face right now. \"Ohoho, let me tell you... You will be <i>so</i> sorry that you attempted to flee from me, girl. I will <b>make you pay</b>, see?\" The girl in her grasp looked positively frightened already, but Maria decided to take her interrogation to the next level!</span></div></div>",

But worst of all, we could make you smell our feet.\" Maria saw the girl raising one eyebrow, despite the state she was being in right now. \"Oh, you think that won't be so bad? Just you wait...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was completely silent for a moment, not moving a muscle. Then, suddenly, she stepped forward, pushing the girl in her grasp as well, her leaning dangerously over the edge of the roof now. \"Ahhhh! What are you doing! Let me go! Ahhhh, I'm gonna die!\" She screamed. Maria chuckled quitely, shaking her head. \"If it wasn't for my arm, you would drop to your certain death <i>right now</i>. Know this! I can let you fall to a very painful death at any moment now. So! Are you going to answer all of my questions?\" \"Y-Y-Y-Yes...\" \"<b>What was that?</b>\" \"YES!\" The girl yelled, upon which Maria dragged her into safer regions of the roof again. Maria softened her grip on the targer, nervous at first that she might fight back suddenly... But she just slumped down on her knees, breaking into tears. Maria could only shake her head. \"My, my... You seem to be terribly... weak. Almost as bad as a male.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that remark, the girl suddenly seemed to regain some strenght somehow, as she barked at Maria \"What is that supposed to mean? Men are not naturally inferior to women!\" Maria just giggled softly for almost a minute, trying to calm her rising anger. \"You see... I was going to ask you if you belonged to one of those groups and if you know anything about them. It seems to me you just confirmed that you at least know something about one of those... Those <i>equal rights</i> people...\" Maria said with obvious disgust. The girl in front of her was hesitating for a moment, but then she simply said \"Yes... That's right.\" Maria smirked \"Say... Do you know anything about a group that calls themself LTFK? Whatever that means?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Maria had spoken that name, the face of the girl in front of her went deathly pale and her eyes darted around nervously. \"So you know them?\" \"No! No, no, I don't! Never heard that name!\" Maria got angry very quickly \"Don't you lie to me! It's obvious you are one of them! I already warned you about having to smell our feet, but... If you don't tell me everything I want to hear <i>right now,</i> I will make you smell MY feet. And trust me, you will regret that.\" Maria said eagerly, wriggling her toes inside her high, black boots in anticipation. \"N-no! Really! I-I-I told y-you everything I know! I know n-nothing at all!\" The girl said. Maria nodded sagely \"You asked for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further words, Maria grabbed the girl by her hair and forced her head down even further. At the same time, she was moving her right foot, still clad in her black boot right now, directly under the girl's face. Her victim only struggled weakly as Maria made to take off her boot... It took a little bit, it almost seemed as it was glued to her foot right now. After making a painful grinding noise, the high boot finally came off with a wet plop, exposing a very hot, wet and incredibly smelly bare foot straight to the face of her unfortunate victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's eyes locked instantly on the intimidating foot beneath her... The first thing she realised was just how sweaty it was. It must have been swimming in its own sweat inside the boot, because some of the sweat was now literally dripping down off it, and the entire long, shapely sole was covered and shining with it. At first, the girl even thought the foot of her to be pretty. Incredibly beautiful, even. It wasn't overly large, but still very long, slim and well-formed with a high arch an a pronounced ball. The toes were rather long and slim as well, wiggling in anticipation. But the very next second, the girl's opinion of this foot changed entirely, as soon as she took only the smallest sniff. The stench coming from it was incredible, they smelled heavily of sweat; like well-seasoned cheese, salty and musky. This first sniff was enough to send the girl into a small fit of coughs and gags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, is it already too much for you? You haven't smelled <i>anything</i> yet!\" Maria said light-heartedly as she moved her moist, warm foot closer and closer to her victim's face, wiggling her toes all the time and flooding her face with waves of terribly strong, cheesy smell. The girl started to cough more violently as she was forced to inhale more and more of the thick, strong scent, making her eyes roll around aimlessly as she was beginning to feel more and more lightheaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, if only you didn't make me chase you two for so long...\" Maria taunted \"You know, my feet are already incredibly sweaty by nature... But because of that, they obviously had to sweat even more. I hope you enjoy it!\" \"No... ugh... Please, stop this... I... I tell you everything you want to know!\" The girl begged, but Maria didn't remove her deadly foot. \"Then explain!\" She simply ordered, finally pushing her foot into the girl's face. She winced as Maria's wet, hot foot came in contact with the sensitive skin of her face, smearing horrible foot-sweat and stench all over it. \"Ugh... Yes, you were right... I... I do belong to the LTFK. We are a group that fights for freedom and equality! Arrrrgh...\" She sputtered as Maria moved her slimy, stinking toes around her lips, punishing her instantly for words she didn't want to hear. \"Yes, I know. Where is that? Where do you have your headquarters?\" Maria asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shook her head weakly, barely able to remain conscious after getting poisoned by the toxic stench of Maria's foot with every breath she took. \"It's just... *cough* two streets to the west, there's the big, burned down building... ugh... Behind that, there is a huge gap in the ground... And then, there comes our hideout. It's completely invisible from the outside because of the ruins covering it... and... *cough gag* Unless you know the exact path, it's almost impossible to get it... Now... Please remove your- *Hmmmpfff!*\" The girl didn't get to finsh as Maria pushed her foot hard against her mouth now, sealing it off completely. With only her nose free now, the girl had no choice but to sniff the toxic, sweaty foot of Maria now, which she was now pushing squarely into her face, her long toes curled over her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just three sniffs of her incredibly stinky toes, the girl went limp and simply collapsed silently. Maria giggled and nodded slightly as she put her boot back on and fumbled around on her uniform, getting a communication device out. \"Yeah, this is Maria reporting in. I've got, uh... one of them rebels here, ready for pick-up. Yes, yes... Yeah, exactly, there. No, she's on top of the building, actually. Yes, on the roof. What do you mean... No! No, wait, she's lying there, on top of the roof. No, she's knocked out. Nah, don't worry, she <i>won't</i> wake up until you get here. I made her smell my feet, actually. I know, right! Yeah, haha... So yeah, hurry up, I'll move to their headquarters in the meantime. Yeah, yeah... No, I can handle it on my own... No really, trust me, I can do this. Yeah, alright... Hear ya later. Maria over and out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria turned the device off, and nodded confidently as she looked into the direction this so-called hideout was supposed to be. She was going to root this evil out, and soon!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria stepped close to the rooftop's edge, carefully watching her step as she looked down. Everything had been going quite rapidly when she climbed up here... But now, it did seem terribly high up. Maria moved her head back up, squinting her eyes slightly as she scanned the network of streets that laid ahead in front of her. Even though she wasn't really familiar with this part of the town, getting to her desired destination shouldn't prove to be too hard now, not for someone of her skill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, Maria slipped past the edge and climbed straight down for a short time, positioning herself precisely... before jumping back away from the building, turning by 180 degrees in mid-air and landing on another rooftop with a skilled, soft roll. Maria kept running and jumped from this building too, landing once more on the roof of another, lower building. From that point on, she spotted a fire escape staircase on one side of her current building, which she used to enter the ground level promptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was already panting softly and wiping the sweat from her forehead as she was sprinting on the streets once more, but after rounding just one more corner, she could already see the described place in front of her... It was actually just the ruins of some kind of place now, really. Maria whistled loudly as she eyed the dimensions of the building in front of her... Most of it was black and burned badly, great parts were collapsed or entirely gone... That group must really be mad to hide out in a place like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Maria headed for the front entrance, which was guarded by two regular policewomen. One of them happened to be looking away, so as she heard Maria's steps drawing closer, she loudly barked \"Halt! Nobody must enter this place, it is- Ohhh.... Oh! Are you... Are you an agent of the SSS?\" she hastily added as her gaze fell upon Maria's imposing, shiny black leather uniform. Maria couldn't help but smirk as she nonchalantly reached into a pocket and presented proof that she was in fact sent by the SSS. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that I am. And I'm afraid I will also have to enter this building. Surely, this will be no problem...?\" Maria added with a dark glare and a barely-hidden threat in her voice. The women in front of her visibly gulped. \"No! No, no, of course not! It's just, parts of these structures are collapsing all the time... We normally can't let people in simply because this place is a deathtrap!\" Maria simply chuckled and shrugged. \"I can take care of myself.\" She said as she gently pushed the guard aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria walked through a series of burned down rooms for a short while, when a wall was suddenly blocking her path. Grumbling mildly, she jumped and climbed it, where she continued her way on the upper floor. Just as she took the first step there, a loud creaking noise warned her of incoming danger and she instinctively hasted to the side... And not a second too soon! A huge chunk of debris suddenly came crashing down from above, smashing straight through the floor. \"Oh dear... This place really <i>is</i> a deathtrap. Are there really people hiding out somewhere in here? They would have to be incredibly skilled to bypass those dangers <i>and</i> the guarding police, every time...\" Maria mumbled quitely to herself as she got up and regained her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By god! Are you alright in there, Agent?\" The voice of the policewoman suddenly rang out again, coming closer a bit, but not very much. Maria rolled her eyes and screamed back \"Yes, naturally. I told you I could take care of myself. Go back to your post now, before you hurt yourself!\" \"O-Of c-course!\" The guard stuttered before quickly sprinting off once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria quickly walked towards her goal once more, and really, after passing a few more smashed apart and burned rooms, she came to a great gap that suddenly apeared in the middle of a room. Maria slowly edged to the cliff and looked down; it was going down for quite a long time there, climbing down and back up on the other side was no option. The abyss was also too wide to just jump over, even with her speed and agility, so Maria had to think of another option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sharp gaze traveled around in the room and she snapped her fingers as she spotted a thick rope, hanging semi-hidden behind a corner on top of a big pile of debris in the corner of the room. Climbing up swiftly, Maria soon came around a corner, where she could see the rope going over the entire abyss in her way, hidden behind a partial wall so it couldn't be seen properly from where she was standing before. \"My, my... They really thought this through when they put this system up! I just know I'm onto the real thing now... All these preparations, this is the work of professionals!\" Maria quietly spoke to herself as she was making her way over the rope with her arms and legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down into what would certainly be her death should she fall, from a swinging, creaking rope even put the experienced agent on the edge, so Maria hurried along it as quickly as she could! When she finally made her way across it, she found herself on a tall, wooden structure... And after walking around just one corner, straight into two other girls!</span></div></div>",

What are you doing here, who are y-\" \"Shit! She's from the SSS, don't you know their uniforms?\" Maria grinned widely as she saw the terror creeping on her opposition's faces and quickly regained her composure. \"That's correct. I wonder why you two are hanging around in an area that is sealed off by the police, let alone why you are so shocked to see one of us here... You are both arrested.\" Maria spoke with authority, stepping forward. One of her enemies flinched instantly, but the other one stood her ground, at least for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... How can this be?!? We hid this place so well... Ah, everything is over now.\" Maria shrugged lightly, her grin growing even wider and showing off her sparkling white teeth. \"Well, we are simply that good. <i>I am</i> that good. But truth be told, it would probably taken me a longer time to find this place, had one of your friends not been so cooperative.\" The woman in front of her growled in anger. \"Who! Who was it! Who betrayed us?\" Maria sneered and spat on the ground. \"How should I know who she was, exactly? She's now lying unconscious, because of me, most likely they have already picked her up and getting ready to question her further right now. And anyway...\" Maria's eyes suddenly seemed to bulge slightly as her face reddened in anger and she started to yell outright:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are <i>you</i> to speak of betrayal? You people have betrayed our very motherland, everything we fight for, everything we ARE!\" The other girl, who backed away, made a weak attempt to speak back in a hurried tone \"I-I... We have no idea what you're talking about! We-we did nothing! We didn't betray anyone!\" Maria calmed down a bit and shook her head. \"Your actions tell me everything I need to know. You are guilty.\" The woman right in front of Maria suddenly lost her temper at this. \"Argh! This is why that whole thing can't work! No matter how good I do, there are always some people messing up! Aaaaargh! If I find out who told you of our hideout...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria cracked her neck and got into a fighting stance. \"This is precisely what is wrong with these kind of organisations. You work together with <i>inferior</i> beings. So far, I have yet to actually see a...\" Maria spat again \"...male on your side, but nothing would surprise me at this point.\" \"Hey! All people are equal!\" The girl in front of Maria yelled, taking a fierce step forward. This was exactly what Maria had been hoping for! With that opening, Maria launched a full assault of quick punches and kick... To her honest surprise, her opponent managed to evade and block many of them and even fight back somehow... But in the end, it was pointless. Maria seized her by the collar of her shirt and pushed her against a wall. \"And now, I will prove how wrong you are!\" Maria hissed, before quickly forcing the girl on the ground, sitting on her chest while keeping her arms at bay with her own hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew what was about to hit her, the girl under Maria was unable to move at all, and Maria was moving her deadly, still boot-clad feet towards her head now slowly, getting ready to finish her off. Her gaze found her friend, who was still standing with her back against the wall, looking around in terror, helpessly. The very next second, her entire vision blurred as a terrible cloud of hot, moist air waved over her face, bringing with it the devastating stench of Maria's deadly, sweaty feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked back towards her tormentor, her eyes already tearing up from the acrid fumes of funky foot-smell, all she could see were two big, hot feet, dripping and shining with fresh sweat, coming closer at her towards her helpless face! Her screams of terror were soon muffled by two moist, soft soles pressing themselves firmly all over her face and she soon regret having opened her mouth at all, because some of the sweat from these terrible feet was now dripping right into it, torturing her with its repulsive, salty taste. The intensely cheesy, sour smell which flooded over her nose wasn't much better either! After just one whiff of the toxic aroma, her whole body was writhing and trying to break free in any way, but Maria's grip was iron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding her victim mercilessly, Maria continued to rub and hold her deadly, wet feet into her face for a few more minutes... It didn't take long for her victim to get knocked out completely by the extremely strong, thick smell! Maria chuckled proudly and got up uneasily, pointing at the second girl while holding one foot extended in mid-air, her long, moist sole plainly visible to her. \"You. Let's make this quick, then I won't have to hurt you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at Maria intensely for a few seconds, before acting...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girl in front of Maria looked at her defeated colleague, knocked out by a terrible stench and she quivered in fear as the very foot that had delivered the moist touch of death seconds before was now gently waving at her, sending waves of warm, humid in her direction. She did not dare to breathe in now, but the aggressive fumes were sharp enough to make her eyes water just from being this close to them. And as Maria pointed straight at her and back to her foot a few times, the woman's panic reached a critical point! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a fierce scream which made Maria cringe, she suddenly dashed straight at her with great speed, catching Maria off-guard. In the last moment, Maria shielded herself with her arms just as the girl slammed into her with a powerful bodycheck. Maria tumbled backwards and soon hit the wall behind her, but the other girl lost her balance as well and was now staggering away from Maria. Maria shook her head quickly and gave an enraged growl, before jumping at her prey with outstretched arms, like a pouncing cougar! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gave an annoying, shrill shriek again and nimbly jumped to the side, causing Maria to almost fall over as she had to slow down immediatly. \"Stop dancing around like that! What your little friend just went through will be <i>nothing</i> compared to what I will do to you when I finally catch you! And you're making it worse with every move! Come over... here now!\" Maria angrily exclaimed, extending her arm with lighting speed and managing to grab the girl by the arm before she could get away again. Maria grinned as she pulled her closer... But was not expecting her opponent to suddenly step closer to herself by her own will and using the momentum to punch Maria directly in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the added speed, the attack was by far not strong enough to actually knock the wind out of Maria, but it made her soften her grip on the girl's arm for just a second... And before Maria could look straight again, the girl had already broken free and was on the run again! Maria swiftly put the boot on her now naked foot once more before she gave chase herself, giving her target a slight advantage. But as soon as Maria did start running, it became clear that she would win this race, if only the distance was long enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in front of Maria was all-around slower than Maria because she wasn't as well-trained and also a bit smaller, but she was very nimble in rounding corners, which made her slip out of Maria's field of sight several times. As Maria sprinted with full speed, she hazily noticed that this part of the building was looking very much like the other side at first, but the further she moved in, the more intact and clean everything became. From time to time, the girl in front of her was actually entering doors (Which she slammed shut to buy herself some more time, just so that Maria could kick them open while still running every time) instead of just disappering through large holes in the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Maria finally got close enough to the girl that she could almost catch her, the surroundings finally started to look like some sort of secret headquarters; long hallways with several doors at both sides. At last, the girl ran into a big, wide room where they could see two very high, heavy-looking doors blocking the path. The girl yelled at the top of her lungs. \"Help! We got an intruder! Help me, she's almost caught up with me! Heeeeeeeeeeelp- Oof!\" The girl was instantly silenced as the muscular, lean body of Maria slammed into her in mid-air, throwing them both to the ground, with Maria on top. Between heavy gasps and pants, Maria uttered \"Now... I finally have you! I will make you PAY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl under Maria was absolutely terrified, and this time there was no way for her to break free. Maria was pushing her down with the full weight of her body and her arms were being held tight. The girl tried to kick her legs or wiggle out from under this terrifying woman on top of her, but it wasn't possible either. Unless help would arrive <i>very</i> quickly, she would be at the mercy of one seriously pissed off SSS agent and her deadly feet.</span></div></div>",

You may have called for help like the pathetic weakling you are, but it looks like nobody will be there to help you!\" Maria spoke sinisterly after looking to both sides a few times. But then, just as she was about to remove her boots once more and thus releasing her devastating stench, the set of high doors opened with a loud slam, distracting Maria for a moment. The other girl used this second to throw her off and craw away swiftly... As soon as Maria properly got up again, she found herself facing multiple enemies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the doors, at least two dozen people had come! They were men and women alike, and the very idea that these would fight together on one side sent waves of anger through Maria! She also noticed how most of them were clad in low-quality, ragged clothing. They looked very much like thieves or beggars, and not at all like an organised force! Still... their sheer number was imposing. Maria knew that underestimating this fact could lead to her defeat. She would have to deal with them swiftly, and with great precision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwaying lightly from side to side, Maria got into a fighting stance and started to taunt her opponents: \"Look how the rats come crawling out of their hole! Good, this spares me the trouble of seeking every one of you criminals out!\" Some of her enemies seemed frightened, but one stepped forward and retorted \"Your kind is the true evil, SSS bitch! You people are what has brought misery and chaos over our country! But not anymore! We, the LTFK fight for freedom and equality! Together, we will free this land and make the world a better place once more!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire group began to cheer loudly, waving their fists through the air in a strange, rhythmic motion. Maria's nerves, already dangerously strained, finally snapped. \"Dirty rebels! You are filth!\" She screamed, charging at her enemies. She didn't care much for a strategic position this time; jumping at the speaker from before and landing right in the middle of the angry mob afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she was completely surrounded by a large group of motivated, pissed-off people. Most fighters would have been hopelessly underpowered at this point... But not Maria! Just as her enemies started their first attack did her instincts truly kick in! Maria evaded a clumsy punch, landing three punches of her own to the chest of the attacking man and finishing him off with a round-house kick to the jaw! Someone from behind was grabbing her, but Maria swung her elbow into the unseen attacker's face, making them stumble away. Two more attackers came charging, a man and a woman, from both sides. Maria swiftly rolled to the side, causing them to crash into each other... Before sweeping both of their legs, making them fall hard on their backs! Suddenly, an attacking girl managed to land a hit with her fist into Maria's side, causing her to stagger back for just a second... Which left her open for a combined attack of three people at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria regained her breath in the last second, dodging two punched with speed and grace, she grabbed the fist of her last attacker, another man, and drew him closer to her... Where she knocked him out with a powerful headbutt! Now Maria was really getting into it; Grabbing one girl and picking her up like a bag of flour, she threw her straight into a group of three others, knocking them all to the ground. Furiously, she was jumping around, evading and blocking attacks and dishing out counters with extreme agility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of intense fighting, every single one of Maria's enemies was laying on the ground, either mumbling in pain or completely knocked out... Except for one certain girl. After scanning the area swiftly with her sharp eyes, Maria found the girl who had alarmed the others standing against a wall on the other side of the room, completely terrified. Maria sprinted over to her and seized her shivering victim by the collar of her shirt. \"You can't escape my wrath...\" Maria uttered through heavy gasps \"The only thing you managed to do... Was to make my feet even sweatier than they were before!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying another word, or giving her victim a chance to respong, Maria pushed her down to the ground, moving her feet beneath the girl's fearful face... before kicking off her tight, high leather boot and exposing her hot, wet foot directly to the girl's face! Maria's long, slender toes were literally dripping with hot, acrid sweat and just by wiggling them around, Maria sprayed some of her toxic footsweat straight into her unfortunate victim's face! The stench that was streaming from her moist, smelly foot was otherworldly! A nauseating mix of stale cheese, salty sweat and a slight sour undertone, that was strong enough to bring tears even into Maria's own eyes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was even worse to the poor girl being held in Maria's merciless grip! Even now, she was being pushed to the verge of unconsciousness just by inhaling a fraction of these powerful feet's stench... But when Maria then pushed her foot directly into her face, her long, wet sole plastering itself firmly on the lips with her slimy, noxious toes covering her nose... Just one whiff was enough to knock her out. Maria didn't notice right away, though, and kept rubbing her sweat-drenched foot into the girl's limp face, smearing it with more and more of her sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a few more minutes, Maria took a few steps back, put her boot back on and shook her head to clear it. \"Whoa... I got a little caried away here. As much as I love to put those unworthy dogs to their places... I need to hurry up! The true leader of this place might be warned already!\" She quietly spoke to herself as she ran forward through the now opened doors, leaving her defeated enemies lying on the ground under a thick layer of cheesy aroma behind her.</span></div></div>",

That last battle sure had been... exciting, but she still generally preferred to do things more subtly and not to alert the entire building. Should the ringleader of this organisation get away, they would surely regather somewhere else... with increased security. Maria was sure that the SSS could handle that as well if they really had to, but it would obviously be much better if she rooted out those rebels for good <i>now</i>! Also, Maria knew she would never forgive herself should she fail a mission like that... And more importantly, she knew that Amber wouldn't forgive her very quickly. Maria cringed at the ideas of how she would be punished should something like that happen, Amber had many ways and most of them involved the feet of SSS agents... Usually Amber's own, but that only made matters worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria shook her head and made a growling noise. \"No! There's no way I could mess this up! I already beat so many of them, while I was outnumbered... They have no chance!\" She hastily whispered to herself, starting to run at an even faster pace once more. Still, Maria was careful not to make too much noise and her foresight was soon rewarded, when she heard a large group of people running somewhere in the corridor in front of her. Luckily for Maria, it was rather dark in there, so she managed to vanish into she shadows of a nearby doorway almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria wasn't completely invisible, but soon enough, about twenty people; once again men and women alike, where running past her, in an almost panicked state. Maria was frowning as she watched them pass by... She would have loved to teach <i>all</i> of them a lesson... But she simply had no time for that! As they were gone, Maria swiftly ran onwards again, and after rounding a corner, she came across another big set of doors. \"This whole place is a damn maze. Everything looks the same, how can they find anything in here?\" Maria angrily grumbled as she walked quickly to the door, and pushed one side open very slowly and carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as a small gap was formed, she could hear hurried voices from the inside \"-the entire sector! And we had 27 of us stationed there! I tell you, they have sent an entire army into this place!\" \"No, don't listen to that fool. I saw her from the floor above... It's an agent from the SSS. Just one.\" \"Are you crazy? How could one woman defeat an entire sector!?!\" Maria had to chuckle as she heard this, and whispered very quietly \"I'm simply <b><i>that</i></b> good...\" \"I saw her with my own eyes! That woman, she... She's a damn fighting machine! You need to get out of here, and quickly!\" Now Maria tensed up, preparing to charge in with full speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I won't leave our headquarters to the SSS just like that. Too much of our vital information and equipment is stored here. Should they claim this place... Then our entire goal will be forever impossible to achieve.\" Maria squint her eyes and grit her teeth as she listened to the voice speaking. It was a girl's voice and what she said indicated that she was the one to give orders around there... Yet still, it did not at all sound like a leader's voice. Maria found it to be too gentle, too soft. It sounded <i>weak</i>. She shook her head slightly, not at surprised that she boss of such an organisation would be somewhat unfitting. Edging further forward very slowly and without making any sound, Maria pressed herself against the wall next to her and slowly inched her way to a corner, behind which the speakers could be heard. \"But... what if she defeats you?\" \"You all can still try to escape should that happen...\" \"No, you are too important! To us all, to our entire idea! If you are caught... Most of us will run away and hide again, I'm afraid.\" \"Don't worry. If it really is just one woman, I can take her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the voice sounded suddenly confident, making Maria very angry again. How dare she suggest anyone to be a better combatant than herself! ...outside the SSS, at least. One of the other voices rang out again. \"No, not you. <i>We</i> can take her! We'll fight with you to the bitter end!\" Maria rolled her eyes and scrunched her lips up, trying her hardest not to groan loudly. Typical hero-talk, downright clich\u00e9. But she would show them! Moving a bit quicker and finally reaching the corner, Maria carefully peeked around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she was, the leader of this whole infamous group. At least she was female, but that was about the only thing Maria liked about her. She was quite tall, taller than some of the men, but very slim and slender, not very tough-looking. She had somewhat long, pale blonde hair that moved down from her head to a bit beneath her shoulders in messy curls. Like many others in this room, the clothes she was wearing did not look very much like... anything. Various types of cloth and leather had been worked together in some way, at certain places it looked thick and strong, like some kind of lamellar armor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria couldn't tell much more from her spot right now, as she was facing the girl's back. But as she moved further just a bit, the girl in the middle of the room suddenly twitched slightly... And not a second later, she turned around and looked directly into Maria's surprised face. Maria jumped up from her hiding spot, not at all expecting something like that to happen. But at least, she could now see the girl better! Her face was looking very young, Maria guessed her to be somewhere between 20 and 25 years old and it was all-around a rather pretty face. Maria found herself in the gaze of two relatively big, greenish-blue eyes that stared at her with such an intensity that it made even Maria nervous. The girl just kept looking at Maria in silence for a few seconds, at that point all of her allies had turned around and spotted Maria as well. \"Looks like we've found our intruder.\" The girl simply stated, a small eerie grin forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was not amused and took a step forward, which caused all of the other people to take a step in front of their leader protectively, entering a combat stance. \"Who do you think you are, speaking to me like that?\" Maria demanded to know, even though she already pretty much knew. \"Well, I'm just the leader of the whole LTFK movement. Actually, we aren't really <i>that</i> big yet... But our numbers are increasing steadily!\" \"Well, not anymore! I will-\" \"Oh yeah, and you can call me Vanessa.\" Maria frowned for a moment, but then her face shifted into a slight smirk. \"Fine, Vanessa. What was it you were talking about earlier? I think you said you could defeat me in a fight!\" \"Yeah, I probably could.\" \"Such... <b>arrogance</b>!\" Maria barked, but calmed back down almost instantly. \"Alright, fine. Let's put it to the test then, shall we? You are all under arrest, anyway. And since you don't look like you'll behave nicely, I think I have to fight you anyway... Hehe, not that I mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanessa! Run now, we hold her back and buy you some time!\" One man to Vanessa's left uttered. \"Oh no, it's not like me to turn down a challenge... And I believe this one would defeat you all so quickly that I wouldn't have much of an advantage by that. No offense, but you know what she did before. So yes, SSS agent!\" Vanessa raised her voice \"We shall!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's smirk widened into a fat grin. \"You got it!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria charged forward instantly, with all the strength and speed she could muster, reaching the spot of her target within a second! Predictably, all of Vanessa's allies were completely overwhelmed by this and just stood around with a shocked expression on their faces, Vanessa herself managed to jump to the side in the last moment though, making Maria miss her slightly. Maria slammed into a small group of Vanessa's guards, sending them all flying to the ground and making herself bounce backwards from the force of the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa used the moment to jump forward with frightening speed and managed to land a few well-placed hits with her hands and feet as Maria's guard was down. Maria shrugged the attack off effortlessly, but she was still surprised. Vanessa's attacks weren't as strong as her own, by far, but her speed was amazing. Maria regained her balance and swung her fist widely, with Vanessa once again jumping away, quick and agile like a jaguar! She attempted her counter-attack once more, but this time, Maria easily blocked it and moved in to grab Vanessa with both of her hands, pushing her towards a wall in the progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was just about to achieve her goal when finally, Vanessa's allies snapped out of their stupor and launched an united attack to save their beloved leader! Three of them grabbed Maria from behind by her arms and pulled her back, buying Vanessa more than enough time to escape to the side. Maria gave a loud, enraged growl and spun around with such ferocity that one man, who was still holding on her uniform was thrown to the ground by the sudden movement. Maria then gave another man a strong bodycheck and picked a nearby girl up to throw her into the next best target, but there was Vanessa again, striking from Maria's blind spot! Coming from behind her, she swept Maria's leg and gave her a fierce push in one fluid motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria couldn't avoid falling down, but she managed to grab Vanessa in the last second, which led to both of them tangling together and crashing to the floor, with the girl who Maria had picked up before landing on top of them. Some of Vanessa's guys came rushing to them immediatly, and jumped on top of them to keep Maria down. More and more ran to the downed women and threw themselves on them, like a bunch of football players. The human pile didn't stop from getting taller! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut together with the human pile, Maria's anger was also steadily growing! Unleashing a feral scream, Maria rose from the ground to a standing position with the strength of ten tigers, sending her enemies flying all over the place like leaves in the autum wind! Most weren't in a fighting mood anymore after this display of awesome power, but Vanessa herself caught her fall gracefully and ran towards Maria once more. Maria's breathing was labored at this point and she felt the sweat dripping down her forehead. Even with her strength and endurance, she was finally tiring from fighting! Vanessa had no more allies to help her out should Maria catch her, but if she doesn't and Vanessa is allowed to continue her assault, then defeat is almost certain for Maria!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria caught her breath, just as she finished blocking off one especially furious cascade of punches from Vanessa. She had to focus if she wanted to walk out of this place victorious! She simply couldn't allow herself to lose against these rebel swines! Vanessa kept jumping up and down in front of Maria, throwing everything she had at her; fists, elbows, knees. Maria was honestly surprised that she could keep up this storm of attacks without tiring at all! Even worse for Maria, she was slowly being pushed back by the onslaught and slowly but steadily sliding against a wall that appeared behind her back. Soon, she would be cornered!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she saw it... Just as she brushed aside one not-so precise strike of Vanessa's left elbow, Maria could see the perfect opening... Leaning back and dodging another punch, Maria gained momentum for a devastating attack! Vanessa saw it coming, but it was too late for an evasive maneuver! All she could do was raising her hands in a desperate attempt to block... But Maria's powerful attack smashed it like a sledgehammer would smash glass! Vanessa's arms were blown to her side, and she staggered backwards... Before she could regain her balance, Maria followed up with a powerful punch to Vanessa's stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's eyes bulged as she felt the air being knocked out of her body! She knew the battle was lost now and looked at her enemy in desperation... Finally, Maria allowed herself to laugh and taunt. \"Hah! Finally caught you, you slippery weasel! Not so easy to run away from me now, is it?\" Vanessa did try to move away as Maria closed in further, but her breathing was short and ragged and she couldn't get enough oxygen to move quickly enough. She could only watch in terror as Maria casually walked up to her and pushed her against the closest wall, grinning broadly all the time. \"Oh, is it hard to breathe now? Hold up, I'll give you something nice to smell...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria raised one of her feet and started to take her tight, black leather boot off. She saw Vanessa's eyes darting down fearfully, her knowing full well what was about to happen. \"Oh, let me tell you, they'll smell so good, you won't even want to stop sniffing them!\" Maria chuckled, loosing the boot slowly as she used the other hand to hold Vanessa by the collar of her clothes. Vanessa made one last futile attempt to escape, but kicking Maria's legs weakly, but it didn't bother her in the slightest. \"No way out for you now, I'm afraid. You should have just gave up right away. I guess I would have punished you either way, but now my feet are <i>extremely</i> sweaty, even for my standards. Brace yourself!\" With that, the boot finally came off and a powerful wave of hot, humid and malodorous stench was released! The pungent aroma of moist, unwashed feet, sweaty and cheesy, soon reached the noses of both girls. Even Maria herself squint her eyes and scrunched her face up in disgust as the repulsive fumes of her wet foot and the inside of her boot hit her face... But it was nothing compared to what Vanessa had to go through! The instant she breathed in the foul smell, she instantly began to cough and gag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smiled as she raised her boot to Vanessa's face, making her look inside. \"It's only going to get worse for you from this point on...\" She said lightly as she slowly brought her terrible footwear closer to her victim's face, who could only look in terror at the dreaded thing! Then, before she knew it, it was firmly plastered over her face, with her nose trapped in the opening. Of course, her first instinct was to open her mouth, but Maria's hand sealed it off already. Vanessa didn't even get the chance to save her breath before, and thus almost instantly had to breathe in again... Which meant to inhale a noseful of pure stench! Vanessa's entire body shook and her eyes rolled up, slowly starting to tear as she gave her first deep, audible sniff. \"Yes! That's right! Sniff my boot, you damn rebel!\" Maria said, resting her now naked foot against Vanessa's stomach. Maria giggled a bit as she felt the fabric there soaking itself with the excess sweat of her foot, when she removed it again, a perfect imprint of it remained there. Meanwhile, Vanessa had no choice but the keep sniffing the dreaded combat boot. She had managed to rise her hands to it somehow, but she could only muster so much power as to move it away slightly... Only to have Maria re-adjust it the very next second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa took another sniff, and suddenly felt all her strength fading as yet another wave of toxic, cheesy smell rolled through her entire system. Her hands fell down on her sides and her knees buckled, she slumped down with her back against the wall into an awkward sitting position. Maria's boot remained firmly in her grasp, and for the shortest moment, Vanessa thought she could inhale a relatively clean air once more... But this proved to be wrong, as the very next second, the foot which Maria had put on her stomach now slid over her face, covering it entirely. As Vanessa smelled it for the first time, a bright light flashed in front of her eyes and everything seemed to spin for a moment... She couldn't believe that even after sniffing those deadly boots, Maria's feet could be even <i>worse</i>. But so it was, and with every breath, Vanessa brought herself closer to the edge of unconsciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. This is the smell of my feet. You better get used to it; I intend to keep you. Make no mistake, I prefer my slaves obedient and not those pesky little rats that think they can fight back, like you are... But I also love a good challenge every now and then. Breaking you will be <b><i>fun</i></b>.\" Vanessa groaned in agony behind a warm, sweaty wall of foot, she could barely understand the spoken words anymore and everything began to spin once more. It wouldn't be long now, but Maria noticed her movements slowly coming to a stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to go to sleep already? Awww, it's just a shame you only got to smell my foot when some of its sweat has already evaporated. Oh wait! I do have another one, wahahahaha!\" Maria retreated her foot and put it back into its sweaty confines; Vanessa's head weakly hung down, her face shiny and moist with Maria's potent sweat already. But Maria intended to finish this properly, as she had said, she moved her second foot directly under her victim's head... And instantly after releasing it, she held it straight into her face! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa made one last, muffled attempt to scream as the dripping wet, hot sole pushed itself over her lips, her helpless nose vanishing under the sweaty embrace of five warm, slimy toes. The very first whiff was enough to knock her out cold. A stench of unimaginable intensity drove over her senses like a tank, she felt as if she became blind and deaf, the only things she could still feel were the warm, soft skin rubbing her face and the unrelenting stench and taste it brought to her nose and lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa slumped down completely, all her movements stopping completely, with only some of her muscles in the arms twitching slightly from time to time. Maria nodded proudly and sealed off her foot once more. She looked around herself and smiled as she saw all the other people still unable to fight, some of them holding their hands over their faces to shield it from the violent stench present in the air, and some others knocked out as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria took out her communication device and contacted the SSS again. \"Hello, this is Maria speaking. Connect me to Amber immediatly. I- what, no, I don't care what she's doing and to whom, you get her right now. Yeah, you're damn right it is important. Yes, yes. Exactly, yeah, that one. Now get me Amber, if you please. Thank you.\" A short silence followed. \"What???\" barked the indignant voice of Amber on the other line. \"Maria here. Guess what, you were right about that group. Those LT-something rebels. They had an abandoned building in the eastern district as their headquarters and about 100 to 200 people there. They were planning something, alright.\" Maria could hear Amber giggle on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're speaking in the past tense. I take it this means what I think it does...?\" \"You're right. I got into some fights, but their leader lies beaten to my feet right now. Together with about a dozen others, or so. Mission complete.\" \"Well done! I knew you could do this! Hang on, I'll send a team to pick you and the prisoners up right away, just give me the exact location...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter telling her where she was located, Maria didn't have to wait for long. Soon, she could hear the typical noise of a helicopter, and then a few minutes after that, a team of about 10 SSS members came running into the room, lead by Amber herself. Maria immediatly saluted, but she couldn't help but grin cockily at the same time. It didn't matter though, as Amber had to smile herself. \"Wow, if I knew they had so many people already, I wouldn't have sent you alone...\" Amber mused as she looked around across the room, noticing the many people on the ground. \"But you managed to take them all out. And, more importantly, you got their leader, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did! There she is!\" Maria grinned, pointing at Vanessa's still sleeping body. Amber raised one eyebrow. \"This is their leader? Huh, figures... Well, at least she's a girl. Anyway, as I was saying... Even if some of them manage to escape now, they lost both their home and their leader. They are completely defeated. I say it again, Maria; Well done.\" Maria bowed and soon followed another SSS agent, who was leading her out of the room and towards the helicopter which had landed on top of the building. As the other agents were busy carrying the prisoners (Vanessa was taken by Amber personally), Maria could hear some of them complaining about the ungodly stench in the air. For the last time of the day, she allowed herself to giggle loudly.</span></div></div>",

She rapidly blinked her eyes and looked upwards, where she could see an intimidating image! A tall, furious woman in a fancy black dress uniform. It wasn't the one she fought before, though... \"Ah, so you're up again! Hurry up, my little prisoner! Man, Maria really put you to sleep well, eh? Well, you can look forward to what will happen once we got you back to our headquarters. I managed to make even the most stubborn rebels obedient in no time, and you will be no exception! But seriously now, hurry up, you don't want to be late... <i>Trust me!</i>\" Amber said with a dark undertone, retracting her hand. Vanessa became aware of the fierce burning feeling on her cheeks and instantly understood how Amber had woken her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa made to get up from her position down against the wall, but nearly fell on her face when she realised she couldn't move her arms! They had been bound together by her wrists, behind her back. Amber chuckled as she watched Vanessa getting up by awkwardly sliding back up the wall using her knees and feet, prodding her lightly with her boot. \"Good, see who needs arms anyway? We all expect you to try something dirty, so I made sure you won't be using your hands anytime soon. Now walk ahead in front of me... And if you try to kick at me, I will rip your damn legs out, understood?\" She threatened with a grin. Vanessa grit her teeth and looked to the ground. \"Yes...\" She had to think fast now, should they manage to imprison her at their headquarters, all would be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa walked in front of Amber, who immediatly held her by her shoulder and her bound hands, and pushed onwards. \"Go ahead and don't stop.\" They started to walk for a little while, Vanessa knew this corridor well; it was leading outside to an open space... They must have arrived with a helicopter! Vanessa frantically looked from side to side, looking for a way out of this misery. But there simply was no way. Panicking as she saw the door leading outside, Vanessa started to struggle and twist around, trying to get out of Amber's grip in any way. But she only dug her fingers more deeply into her flesh, making Vanessa yelp in sudden pain. \"Stop this! Or else I'll make you smell my feet right here!\" Amber said, holding Vanessa in place roughly. Vanessa seemed to calm down, and they walked on, leaving the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's heart almost stopped when she saw not one, but several helicopters stationed here. Here and there, some SSS agents could be seen carrying and dragging her allies into them, most of them knocked out, but all of them with their hands cuffed. She felt her pulse quickening as she was pushed towards an especially large and robust looking one, with two agents standing in front, saluting as they spotted Amber right behind her. \"Hehehe, look who I've got here, gals! The ringleader of these rebelling vermin! Let's bring her in, shall we?\" \"Haha, that's amazing! Did you capture her, Captian?\" One of the agents asked. Amber made a strange sound, almost a grunt. \"No, sadly, I only got to haul her from in there to over her. Her initial capture was the courtesy of Maria... She really did an amazing job, I have to admit. Hehe, coming to think of it... She always wanted her own slave. I mean, she got to pretty much enslave many men and sometimes women during her interrogations, but a real personal slave, to cater to her feet whenever she feels the need...\" Amber gave a dry laugh and moved her mouth close to Vanessa's ear, where she whispered \"And I know exactly who this slave is going to be. You already got to experience her feet, didn't you? Well, I hope you liked it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more, panic took over Vanessa as she heard these words. Being forced to smell that terrible girl's feet was amongst the worst experiences of her life. She'd rather die than having to endure that again! Anything but that! Letting out a shrill scream, Vanessa started to thrash around once more. Her wildly moving head hit Amber squarely in the jaw, breaking her concentration shortly. \"<i>Elende Schei\u00dfe!</i>\" Amber cursed loudly as Vanessa broke her grip and swiftly wiggled away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's eyes brightened and her heartbeat picked up the pace as she felt herself running freely once more. Was this her chance? If only she could flee now, then maybe, everything could start over again... But Vanessa's dreams had a short lifespan. The two agents in front of the helicopter immediatly rushed at her, and without being able to move her hands, Vanessa was unable to defend herself! She tried to jump to the side, but another agent had ran over from this side, who she ran into and bounced backwards, straight into the hands of the other two ones. They lost no time and each grabbed one side of her with both arms. Vanessa started to scream and flail her legs about in anger and fear. \"NO! Let me go, goddamnit! I'm not smelling that damn girl's feet again! No! No no no no NO! Aaaaaargh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was Amber again, smacking her across the face twice. \"You filthy little ant! You excrement, you <i>nothing</i>! I warned you, you will regret this little outburst very soon. My feet are one of the few that are even worse than Maria's, and you're about to find this out for yourself!\" Amber breathed in and out deeply, twice. \"But then again, this is a good sign. Your panic attack tells me you're starting to crack already. This will be easy. Well, hold her still for a moment, girls, I'm gonna tie her pesky, wild legs up, too!\" Amber said, promptly getting handed some sort of rope from a nearby agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got down on the ground and started to tie Vanessa up for good. \"You better hold her well. If she kicks me in the face, you will smell my feet as well.\" \"Yes, ma'am!\" As Amber finished tying her victim up, she took a step backwards and smiled. Vanessa was wriggling around in her binds furiously, but there was no way she could espace. Only her constant screaming got on her nerve. \"You know, I really do prefer her voice when she's not being so damn loud. We need to fix this, Ladies. Well, I'm not wearing socks today!\" Amber said, grinning widely at the two agents. One of them shrugged with a light smile, and instantly went to take her boot off. \"I do! Just a second...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boot came off, a long and slender foot, dressed in a sock that was obviously in a bad state appeared. \"Hmm... lookie here, I think they once were a lighter shade of gray!\" The other agent mused. \"Actually... they were white, once.\" Amber gave an impressed whistle as she fondly regarded the soiled sock. \"Not bad, not bad at all! Lemme see...\" She said, grabbing the sock with her fingers herself and pulling it off, which caused the other agent to gasp lightly. \"Please, be careful, Captain! They are quite bad...\" the agent said with a blush, but Amber only laughed again. \"Oh please, I've had to deal with much worse ones, usually my own. Well now...\" She mused, moving the sock closely to her face and giving it slight squishes with her fingers. \"Hmm, very good. Quite thick, which allows for a lot of sweat to be absorbed. Positively soaked in sweat, very warm, hot, almost... And a very nice color, too! The scent...\" Amber sniffed the sweaty, stinking sock deeply, which caused the other agent's face to blush even deeper. \"...is not bad at all, either. Very thick, strong. Mostly cheese with a slight hint of vinegar, and popcorn. Yes, this sock is perfect. How long have you been wearing them?\" \"Uhm... about two weeks...\" \"Good! Great! Well, you know what to do now, rebel...\" Amber said, facing Vanessa again and presenting her the disgusting, dripping gray sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say aaaaahhhhhhhhh!\" Amber demanded, slowly moving the smelly sock closer and closer to Vanessa's poor face! Vanessa's eyes widened in horror as she saw the dreadful thing coming closer, and soon her tears were flowing again. She could smell this sock already. It smelled just like Amber had described it... Only that it certainly wasn't very good. Vanessa shut her mouth tightly, shaking her head, but Amber only laughed, and pushed the disgustingly sweaty sock squarely into Vanessa's horrified face, the toe section right over her nose. It made a repulsive, squishing sound as the wet fabric was pressed against Vanessa's skin. Vanessa had no choice but to sniff it, and the stench was breathtaking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she could no longer keep her mouth shut, it opened instinctively to release a pained groan... And instantly, the sopping wet sock was pushed in! Vanessa gagged and retched behind her toxic bound, now having to taste the exact foul taste that she smelled before. At this point, she stopped struggling for good, and the two agents threw her into the helicopter. Amber took one gas mask from the inside and gave it to the pilot. \"Here, we can't risk a crash now. I'll be taking off my boots, you know.\" \"But, uh... what about me?\" The other agent nervously asked. \"Hmm? Well, you'll just be sitting next to me. If you pass out, no serious harm will be done. And hey, consider yourself lucky that you aren't the one with my feet in her face! Hahaha!\" Amber laughed, looking at a frightened Vanessa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all got in, the pilot in her little cockpit in front, with the gasmask over her face, Amber and the second agent in the space behind it, where they sat down. Amber lost no time in adjusting her and Vanessa's, who was still lying on her back on the ground, position, placing both of her still boot-clad feet next to her head. \"Do... do you really need to do this now, Captian?\" The other agent asked nervously, causing Amber to giggle again. \"Haha, no, not really. But I <i><b>want</b></i> to do this right now. Any problems with that?\" \"N-no, of-of course not, ma'am!\" \"Good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber took both of her boots off and the wave of hot, humid air blasted them all in the face, filling the small space instantly. The other agent was already pale, covering her face with both hands and coughing behind it. Vanessa couldn't even do that.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa was fighting with the sweat-stained, foul sock in her mouth as she saw two huge, deadly soles coming into view and slowly descending down to her, towards her helpless face. She tried her best to free some space so she could at least sneak some air through her mouth in... But she was only awarded with an extra amount of the sock's disgusting taste as a result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa had to breathe in for the first time since Amber's deadly feet had been released and she was hit with the full force of the strong, pungent stench! The searing, acrid aroma of sweat, stale cheese, vinegar and just plain unwashed feet hit her with such an intensity that Vanessa felt as if she was going blind! The thick, unrelenting smell continued to burn in her nose even after she was holding her breath again, and only with great concentration did she manage to focus her other senses again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she could hear the thundering laughter of Amber, then she felt a few warm drops of some liquid landing on her face which sent shivers up her spine and finally, her vision cleared and she could see those feet which were tormenting her so clearly again! Vanessa whimpered quietly, muffled by the damp sock in her mouth as she realised just what the liquid, which was steadily falling on her face was! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's feet were not simply sweaty, they were completely covered by so much sweat that gravity steadily pulled a few drops of it down from her warm feet... straight into Vanessa's face. Aside from the fact that they were so incredibly wet, Vanessa would have considered these feet which now loomed over herself like the sword of Damocles relatively pretty, yes beautiful, even. They were very large overally, but the soles looked like they would be smooth and soft as silk, with flexible, strong toes and very pronounced arches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Vanessa had any more time to admire the shape of Amber's feet, the worst possible thing for her right now happened: The feet came towards her much faster, soon filling her entire field of vision with an image of shining wet foot flesh before they finally dropped on her face with a horrible, wet sound. They were easily big enough to cover her entire head and they immediatly started to rub all over Vanessa's face with every part of them. Vanessa shivered in repulsion as she felt the hot sweat being wiped all over and into her sensitive skin, but the thing she was the most afraid of now was what would happen if she took a sniff of those feet up close. Vanessa held her breath for as long as possible, but Amber did not remove her feet. Eventually, her oxygen ran out for good and she breathed in automatically. Which meant in her case, she gave the most likely smelliest feet in the whole land a good, deep sniff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa released muffled screams and started to twitch for a few seconds... Before she passed out again from the overwhelming experience. The stench had hit her like a speeding train, like an explosion inside her head did the foul aroma blow her lights out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber released a quiet giggle and nodded. \"Well, I did warn her. Hope you don't mind if I keep my feet out on her face for the rest of the trip...\" Amber said, looking at the agent next to her, who was still covering her face, but was looking like she was about to pass out herself nevertheless. Amber laughed loudly as she noticed this expression and she pat the other agent on the shoulder. \"Ah, I know you mind. But keep in mind... it could always be worse...\" She said, grinning and pointing at Vanessa's defeated form, while she gave a lighthearted shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Maria was travelling towards the SSS headquarters as well, but in a seperate helicopter. This one did not carry any prisoners, she was alone in there with only the pilot also present, but the pilot obviously had to concentrate on the flight and could not listen well to Maria's hushed ramblings. \"-so amazing! I tell you, twenty, no thirty, no wait, <b><i>fifty</i></b> of them came rushing straight at me, all at once! And guess what I did? Yeah, I beat them all, one after one. What do you think about that? Yeah, it was pretty awesome. Man, I think I even heard some of them mentioning how sweet my performance was, even while I smashed them into dust. I was simply <i>that</i> impressive. Hoo wee... The whole organisation defeated. I better receive another promotion for this. Not to mention my own slave. I always wanted my own slave. How about you, do you have any- Oh shit, I forgot, you aren't allowed to speak right now. Oh well, let me continue...\" Maria kept talking in a fast, unrelenting pace for the entire flight, also gesticulating wildly the entire time, even though the pilot couldn't look at her flailing hands. Maria was quite excited indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time after that, Maria was meeting Amber in the SSS headquarters once more, just behind the front door. Maria couldn't help but grin as she noticed the line of prisoners walking in after her, tightly flanked by numerous guards, especially since she knew she was the one who brought them all to this place, in a sense. Amber had a fat smirk on her face as well, she was watching the steady stream of soon-to-be slaves as well and had just spotted the ringleader of them, Vanessa. Vanessa was being carried by two agents, she was still knocked out. \"Well... I already said it, but I'll gladly repeat myself... Job well done! Heh, I send you away to gather some information about an organisation and you go ahead and completely defeat it; Taking their headquarters and their leaders with one shot! Now <i>this</i> is what I want to see, and this is what the SSS values so much about you. Well, as you may have noticed, your success here not only defeated one enemy of ours, but it also got us quite a few... let's say potential slaves. The females, we may be able to rehabilitate, at least some of them. Their males will be, of course, excellent slaves. I'll make sure of that. Oh, and another thing about this... their leader, this Vanessa... She experienced your feet personally, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had to giggle loudly. \"Ahehehe, yeah you could say that. She didn't like it a lot.\" \"Well, for that one all hope is lost anyway. Not only is she way too fanatic in her wrong, primitive ideas... But she's also a traitor. She will have to be a Footslave, for live. Now I thought, how about she's handed to you, after her training is complete, as your own personal slave?\" Maria's eyes sparkled with joy as she heard these words. \"Yes! Oh yes, this sounds wonderful!\" \"Great!\" Amber clapped her hands loudly once. \"It's settled then! Maybe you can also get some of their other members as slaves... But Vanessa is hereby guaranteed to you. You have my word.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's fists vibrated with pure joy for a few seconds, she was holding back so she didn't release a loud cry of happiness right there. Finally, she saluted briskly. \"Thank you, Captian! Believe me... I am very, <i>very</i> happy about this!\" Amber leaned forward and patted her on the shoulder lightly, with a serious expression on her face. \"You earned this yourself, Maria. I'll make sure Vanessa's training will be finished as quickly as possible, so she can be sent to you soon. Having your own, personal slave sure is great... I can't wait to talk with you about that, sometimes!\" Now a wide grin was appearing on Amber's face again and Maria had to laugh shortly as well. \"Heh, me too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after that, Maria was heading home for the day. She had a bounce in her steps and was loudly whistling a random tune. Everything was well. <br>\r\nSoon after getting thrown in a small cell, Vanessa was waking up again. She looked around in panic for a moment, before she realised where she was... Being held prisoner at the headquarters of her worst enemies. Everything was terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's so called \"training\" began the very next day. In her case, this meant breaking her fierce resistance for good. Fortunately for the SSS and Maria, Vanessa had developed a great hate against feet after getting knocked out twice by two especially bad pairs on one day... She was literally fearing their very sight, which made it easy for Amber and her colleagues to break her speedily. In the following few days, Vanessa had sweaty, reeking feet in her face almost all day long, sometimes even during the night. If possible, Amber made sure to make her smell her own feet. Vanessa's initial panic and resistance soon broke away, and after just a few days, she was showing almost no reaction whatsoever even when one particularly stinky foot was being held into her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber then trained her a few more things that every good slave needed to know... Like the proper way to kiss and lick the feet of their masters. Amber let Vanessa practice on her own feet most of the time, and she was making rapid progress. In the beginning, Vanessa often spat out and started to cough and gag as the taste of Ambers feet became too much. Not like a good slave! But after Amber had punished her for this by tying her face to the soles of her feet for one entire night, Vanessa was doing a much better job at this. Very soon, she would be ready to be handed over to her master, Maria and to fullfil her now chosen role in life... To be a footslave forever.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today is the big day!, Maria thought as she was striding speedily towards the SSS headquarters in her usual, speedy pace. From time to time, some citizens and other officers who saw her waved and cheered as she walked by; The news of her having defeated an entire organisation by herself had spread like a wildfire and everybody who didn't agree with or like her at least pretended to do so... out of sheer fear of her wrath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smiled brightly and nonchalantly returned the waving gesture. She couldn't fight back a cheeky grin at that point, this all just felt too good! Finally, as she was noticing the main building of the SSS coming into view, Maria licked her lips and slowed her pace somewhat, just to burn this image into her inner eye. It was still relatively early, so the sun was just beginning to rise and in today's case, this painted the few surrounding clouds in magnificent tones of yellow. Just by looking at that, Maria knew this day would be perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finally reached the front door and entered the building, she could already hear Amber, who had been awaiting her already, greeting her loudly. \"Ahhh, there you are! Punctual as always!\" Maria smirked and started to look around the corridor. \"Morning to ya. So... You mentioned something about my reward? That 'she would be ready this morning, if I know what you mean'? Because, heh, I'm pretty sure I know exactly what you mean!\" Amber laughed loudly and pointed backwards. \"You're right, Maria! You know that I hold my promises. Vanessa! Come out here, slave, and meet your true master!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Vanessa did come out from somewhere behind Amber... But she wasn't at all the girl Maria knew from some days ago! She was still very much a relatively young, tall and slim girl, with the same blonde hair and pretty face... But she wasn't in the best condition. Even though she had already seemed to be somewhat... unclean back when Maria saw her the first time, now she looked downright <i>dirty</i>. Her armor-like clothes were gone as well, and replaced by a few plain rags and her hair was a lot messier than before, sticking to her head unpleasantly in many places. But the biggest surprise came to Maria when she looked at Vanessa's face. Her bright, big eyes now looked empty and hollow, her fierce, energetic power was simply... gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was so impressed by this that she walked forward and took a closer look at Vanessa's face, appraising her like a thing. \"Wow... Just look at her eyes! You removed the entire resistance from her! That's just amazing! But- ugh...\" Maria scrunched her nose and took a few steps backwards. \"That smell... I don't suppose she has had a bath recently?\" \"Hah! Oh, we did bathe her, alright. Only in the sweat of our feet, though.\" Amber laughed. Maria nodded sagely, and added \"Oh well, that explains it.\" \"Mainly in the sweat of <i><b>my</b></i> feet, if I may add.\" \"Ah... yes, yes, that explains it very well. Anyway... Is she... You know... Mine now?\" Maria said, getting somewhat anxious suddenly, much unlike her usual self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber nodded furiously. \"Yes, yes, yes! I promised you I would make her a good slave... A <i>very good</i> one. Vanessa!\" Her voice suddenly changed into a violent bark \"Take off my shoe!\" Vanessa nodded weakly, and Maria noticed that the blank expression on her face didn't change at all as she said \"Yes... master.\" and got down on her knees. Maria watched in awe as Vanessa wordlessly grabbed Amber's shoe and started to pull it off with some difficulties. \"Yeah, she's still kind of a weakling... Couldn't change that about her, sorry.\" Amber said with a shrug as she watched Vanessa struggle with her footwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds though, Amber's big, impressive foot came into view though, springing out of its binds with an audible, moist \"plopp!\" sound. Maria whistled quietly as she looked at Amber's foot, it was intimidating as usual, glistering with sweat. Maria took a deep sniff and cringed as she realised the smell of Amber's feet having already made its way all across the room. And Vanessa was right down there on her knees, with that sweaty, reeking foot right next to her head. Maria noticed her shivering just slightly... but she was still doing an amazing job there, considering whose feet she was about to smell! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now kiss it... and don't forget to smell!\" Amber commanded, prodding Vanessa lightly with her big toe. Wordlessly, Vanessa grabbed the huge, slippery wet foot in front of her with both hands and brought it directly into her own face. Maria whistled shortly again, quite impressed that anyone could do such a thing without dropping to the floor within seconds. Vanessa was placing soft, gentle kisses all over Amber's broad, long sole, licking away and swallowing the excess footsweat that gathered on her lips a few times inbetween. After every kiss, Vanessa slowly brought her nose extremely close to the hot, moist skin and inhaled loudly and deeply, filling her lungs to the brink with the foulest stench of feet! The aromas of sweat, spicy cheese and something distinctively sour assaulted Vanessa's nose, and she had to fight visibly not to jump up and flee from this torturous foot... But nevertheless, Vanessa managed to hold her ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Amber nodded, looking quite pleased. \"Good... good, good. Now, lick them.\" Vanessa flinched and seemed to hesitate for just a second. Instantly, Amber yelled \"What are you waiting for? You are a <i>dog</i>, and I am your <i>master</i>!\" Vanessa closed her eyes and leaned forward, pushing her face completely into the warm, soft embrace of Amber's smooth sole. Ignoring the acrid sweat getting all over her face, Vanessa stuck her tongue out and gave Amber's sole a long, hard lick, gathering a lot of warm sweat and filling her mouth with a terrible, salty taste in the process. \"Hmmmm... Oh, she does a very good job at that one. Still hesitating just a little here and there, but... Oh... Does it feel great once she really starts...\" Amber drawled as Vanessa was busily lapping away at her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber let this go on for a while, before she ordered Vanessa back. \"Good, this is enough, Vanessa! Get up again!\" Vanessa did so instantly, standing up straight again. \"So...\" Amber said, thankfully putting her shoe back on in the process \"...what do you think?\" Maria was honestly speechless for a moment. \"That's... amazing! I honestly didn't believe it was possible for anyone to that to <i>your</i> feet without fainting! ...No offense.\" Amber giggled \"Hehe, I take that as a compliment. Anyway, good to hear that you like her performance! She's now officially yours! Go on, you can take her home right away... You did enough overtime already, I'd say, hehe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria laughed giddily and jumped towards her new possession, her hands shaking with excitement. \"Hahaha, this is so awesome! Finally, I have my own slave! Hah! Isn't this awesome?\" Maria grabbed Vanessa by the shoulders and shook her a bit in pure joy. \"Man, you sure are... different now, though. It's like I'm holding a sandbag\" Maria mused, poking Vanessa's skin with her index finger a few times. \"Well, she did not eat a lot the last few days... Also, she didn't sleep very well, due to a few things... But hey, now she's really obedient! It really was worth it!\" Amber threw in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right. I think I'm going to treat you a <i>little</i> better from now on. After all, you're not really a rebel anymore. And most importantly, not a man.\" For the shortest moment, a spark of anger seemed to appear in Vanessa's eyes... But it vanished just as quickly. \"Hmmm? What do you think about that?\" Maria asked, having noticed the strange shift. \"Yours is the only truth, master.\" Vanessa responded, bowing her head. \"You know...\" Maria said, starting to grin broadly and put her arm around Vanessa's shoulder \"...I think your new life will work out quite nicely for the both of us. Thanks again, Amber. I'll be dropping her off, now. Come on, Vanessa!\" Maria said, starting to walk towards the door with Vanessa in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You earned it well! Just remember, there is still so much more for you to achieve... For a woman with your skill and dedication, you could make it to the <i>top</i>! I'll see you again tomorrow... Keep up the great work!\" Amber said with a brisk salute. Maria returned the gesture as she turned around and responded \"Of course. I always do my best. Until tomorrow!\" before she left for good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa followed Maria silently, as she lead her all the way towards her home. Maria did hold her word, she made sure that Vanessa was kept clean and well-fed, like any good pet should be. She did also, however, made it clear very frequently that Vanessa was her footslave, and nothing more. Every day, when Maria came home, Vanessa would take care of her tired feet like a good servant. Maria found Vanessa to be surprisingly skilled at giving her feet nice rubs and massages and because of that, she had her do it as good as every night. Maria also remembered to make her new slave taste the aroma of her potent feet often enough, both through her nose and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vanessa was facing her master's long, sweaty feet again one evening, she hazily remembered the dreams and goals she once had. It was hard to remember right now, really, as her face was getting assaulted by an incredibly thick, strong smell of sweat, cheese and stale popcorn. Vanessa embraced these hot, wet soles with the skin of her face and took nosefull after nosefull of their powerful odor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, that was right... Once, she had the dream of changing how this entire state worked. *Sniff* Yeah, once, she thought she had what it takes to overthrow the entire SSS force and bring new ideas... her ideas, into the country. *Sniff* But then there had been that woman... Maria. She showed her who was the boss. *Sniff* And there she was, at her very feet, smelling and whorshipping them. Her whole, glorious rebellion had ended, before it even began. *Sniff!\"*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The miracle never happen.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria growled and charged forward again, but Vanessa's swift dodge made her hit thin air. Every time Maria tried to focus and place a few more precise attacks on her target, Vanessa re-appeared and landed a few shots herself, throwing her off-balance again. Vanessa's attacks weren't too strong, but eventually, they were building up! Maria could feel her movements slowing and even though she was trying her hardest, her strength was finally coming to an end! Amazingly, even though she was also tiring herself, Vanessa managed to keep her ruthless onslaught of moves going, yes to Maria it even seemed to be quickening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's fist connected with the tip of Maria's jaw, which sent her tumbling back to the nearest wall! Maria countered and swung her arm widely, but Vanessa jumped into the air with a spin and evaded the attack, flying closer to her target who she then hit across the face with the palm of her hand! Maria winced as Vanessa's hand connected sharply with her cheek, she was finally starting to really feel those hits! Maria knew that this was a very bad sign and that she needed to change the flow of battle quickly, or else all would be over! Growing frustrated and desperate, Maria pushed herself away from the wall and straight into a furious Vanessa, managing to push herself and Vanessa's lighter body a bit away from the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, now Vanessa was really kicking up her engine. Jumping back from Maria for the shortest second, she used all her power to throw herself into her target now. Vanessa's shoulder was plowing directly into Maria's stomach, knocking the wind out of her and driving her back into the wall, which she hit with her back, making a loud noise. With her target stunned, Vanessa unleashed a flurry of violent slaps to both sides of Maria's face, occasionally spinning while doing so to use the most momentum! Soon the palms of both of her hands were smacking against Maria's cheeks with loud, terrible slapping sounds and the chances for Maria to turn things around were slowly but surely dwindeling away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a last resort to stop Vanessa's attack, Maria threw herself forward again, throwing her arms around Vanessa as if hugging her awkwardly and holding her arms down her torso. Maria was smirking as she felt Vanessa struggling in her grip; All she had to do now was to either throw her into the wall or floor, or to simply squeeze the life out of her victim!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But she couldn't do it. Maria's face was getting pale, she felt her arms tremble and shake as Vanessa managed to break free of her grip after just a second. Maria panicked; Vanessa had freed one of her arms and was surely going to strike again, Maria intended to shove her away as far as possible, but then something unexpected happened! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her now free hand, Vanessa did not simply strike at Maria again! Lifting off one foot and pushing the knee against Maria, Vanessa used her hand to pull off her shoe, a positively worn-out kind of sneaker. The next second, Vanessa was holding her rank, repulsive shoe into Maria's face, giving her a good view of the inside. Maria gasped as she saw the sweat glistening inside... And this gasp alone, even though done mostly through her mouth, filled her senses with a very thick, cheesy smell of sweaty, unwashed feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria gagged instinctively and tried to turn her head away; Vanessa giggled lightly at that reaction and used the moment to push her horrible, old shoe into Maria's face for good, shoving Maria's nose into the moist, warm opening of her shoe. Maria's eyes widened as Vanessa's other hand was suddenly there as well, squeezing her lips shut. Maria shook her head feverishly, she still needed to regain a lot of lost oxygen from the hit to her stomach and she had to breathe soon! She tried her best to free her face from Vanessa's horrible, oppressive shoe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't manage to do it. Without any other chance, she took a deep breath through her nose and thus, she gave Vanessa's rattled, sweat-filled sneaker a good whiff. Her eyes bulged as her lungs were flushed to the brink with a hot, foul air, carrying the potent stench of Vanessa's sweaty, smelly feet. It was an incredibly thick, powerful aroma, smelling strongly of cheese and musk. Unlike her own or Amber's feet, Vanessa's had no sour note at all. But their brute force alone was terrifying! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria coughed and spat against Vanessa's hand, which was still covering her mouth tightly, as she was forced to sniff the reeking shoe again and again, now getting pushed against the wall once more. \"It stinks, doesn't it? I've been wearing these shoes ever since I started our whole operation... It should be pretty bad. Keep sniffing.\" Vanessa teased, a horrifyingly wide smile appearing on her face as her eyes began to stare at Maria intensely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was feeling worse and worse. She absolutely had to break free right now. This was her last chance.</span></div></div>",

Maria knew she had to break free of this cursed situation right now, but she was simply out of strenght. In a last ditch effort, Maria flailed her arms about wildly, really managing to knock the disgusting shoe away from her face! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was about to take a deep breath of much-needed fresh air, but before she got the chance, everything was spinning again! Vanessa had grabbed her with lightning speed and pulled her forwards, while simultaniously sweeping her legs. Maria yelped as she tumbled to the ground and with the greatest effort, she managed to land on her knees and not face-down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa gave a loud, triumphant laugh as she saw this and did not waste a second... The very next moment, a long, slender and incredibly smelly foot was pushed squarely over Maria's face. \"<i>Schnupper mal... da vergeht dir h\u00f6ren und sehen...</i>\" Vanessa teased as she started to grind her socked foot over Maria's face slowly. Maria cringed and groaned as she felt the wet, sticky fabric rub itself tightly against her face, leaving a horrible trail of sweat and stench behind. Soon enough, she had to breathe in again and once more, she had no chance but to do so through her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, though, she was smelling Vanessa's terrible foot up close. It was much worse than before, the smell was very much the same, just with a higher intensity. Maria struggled and tried to break free, but Vanessa simply pushed her foot more and more forward, until Maria was pushed backwards and fell from her kneeling positon to on her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maria opened her eyes again, she first felt the impact of something hitting her stomach... Vanessa had swiftly sat down on her. Then, she was presented a sight like out of a nightmare, both of Vanessa's big, reeking feet were now looming over her face, ready to drop down. Her socks stuck to the skin like glue due to all the sweat, and as she moved them around, they were literally shiny because of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa then did drop one of her feet down on Maria's face to let her smell it, she used the meantime to pull the sock of her other foot. Repeating the procedure, she presented two soaked, dripping socks which seemed to be literally steaming with sweat over Maria's unfortunate face. \"I've been wearing those for weeks now. Soaking with my sweat day by day... can you tell?\" She whispered before letting go of her wet, dirty socks, sending them straight towards Maria's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wet impact, they fell all over it and Maria retched as she got a good whiff of their rancid aroma. And then another one. And another one. Maria was unable to free herself, Vanessa was now holding her arms down with her hands and pushed her bare, sweaty soles on her face on top of her socks, squeezing out more and more of their stored sweat. Finally, Vanessa kicked both socks away with one of her feet, but this did not give Maria much room to breathe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith herself being in such a weakened, dizzy state already, Maria realized in horror that Vanessa's long, slimy toes were forcing their way into her mouth... She tried to bite her teeth together hard, but it was already too late; Vanessa's long, huge foot shoved itself further into her mouth, forcing her jaw open and preventing her from biting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what was even worse, it flooded her sense of taste with the most terrible, putrid taste, the flavor of unwashed, cheesy footsweat. And what was at least as bad was Vanessa's second foot, which was now slowly rubbing over Maria's face, keeping the slick, moist skin as close as possible to Maria's tortured nostrils all the time; Assaulting her sense of smell with endless waves of hot, moist air, with an aroma of thick cheese, sweat, and musk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply put, Maria was in hell. Vanessa continued to insult her from time to time, but soon, Maria couldn't even make out the sounds anymore, everything was mixing into a senseless, static blur. The only thing she saw was one long, slender sole, shining with sweat and occasionally pressing down on her face... The only thing she felt was the wet, warm touch of incredibly smooth and silky skin brushing against her face, and the toes moving around in her mouth, wrestling with her trapped tongue and rubbing their stale sweat off on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the smell, of course. Nothing Maria had ever smelled could compare to this, not even Amber's deadly feet. They both stunk terrible, of course, but the strenght of this smell was so intense that she felt her strenght getting drained in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of non-stop sniffing, Maria was feeling herself edging closer to the brink of unconsciousness. Now she didn't feel anything anymore, and her vision became obscured by dark, blurry spots. The only thing that remained clearly was the inhuman smell of Vanessa's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in many, many years, Maria allowed herself to cry. Not her eyes tearing up simply because of the sharp fumes burning in them, but honest tears of fear and desperation. She knew that now, everything was lost. Worst of all, she had failed. Allowed herself not only to be beaten, but by her worst enemy, a traitor of the state! Right now, there was one person Maria started to hate even more than Vanessa... She hated herself. Never had she experienced such humiliation as this; Getting completely and finally beaten with her own weapons smashed her years-long sense of superiority apart, for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa cackled loudly as she heard Maria's pitiful sobs, muffled by her own long, soft feet in and on her mouth. \"Now, everybody will understand that you SSS lunatics aren't the perfect elite. One of your best agents defeated by a bunch of lowly rebels. Oh, what will your glorious leader think? Either way... You will never see them again, at least unless they are all stripped from their power and in prison, where you damn crazies belong. Go on, smell my feet. We really are lucky that one of the good ones happens to have this 'blessing' as well... These incredibly sweaty, stinky feet. Smell them... And suffer complete and absolute defeat. The cruelty which you have dished out to so many innocents is now finally coming back to you... I'm not sure what we will do with you, but be sure of one thing... You won't escape these feet, and their smell. It will become a part of your life... it will become a part of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Maria could barely hear Vanessa's hate-driven little speech, she could almost feel the anger behind those words... Or at least, behind those large, still wet feet, still rubbing on her face. Those really were incredible, they just never stopped sweating. Maria took another deep lungfull of pure, toxic footstench... And finally, with a long, pained groan, she passed out and went completely limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa slowly rose as she watched this happen... Then she started to laugh loudly, almost like a mad woman, while moving her hands around wildly. Some of her allies were rising anew, too, and all their eyes were on her, as she finally removed her feet from Maria's face and placed them back into her badly worn shoes... The stench in the air was still incredibly thick and foul, but at least it didn't knock her allies out againl, or not all of them, at the very least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a look here, my friends...\" Vanessa said as she picked the limp Maria up. \"The agent, who single-handedly... Or should I say... single-footedly?\" A few of her friends gave a pained groan, at which Vanessa just smiled and shrugged. \"Anyway, the agent who defeated many of our men and women alone... Is now utterly defeated herself. Obviously, we don't have to evacuate right now, because of this... But we should make preparations anyway... I suspect the SSS will know where they sent this agent to, and they will come for her, once she stays absent for long enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the LTFK members gave worries looks to each other, but Vanessa shook her head, grinned broadly and took a heroic stance, before she spoke with an unusually loud and powerful tone \"Today is a good day! We have not only proved to ourselves, but also to the government, that we can handle an attack of the SSS... We can take them, friends!\" Now, some of her allies started to cheer, and wave their fists in the air. \"We will move to another place, in the middle of the next night... We will have better security... The SSS will come for us... And we will <i>defeat</i> them! We will take over their organisation, and then... We will liberate this whole land and free it of its inhuman system!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa rose her fist into the air, and every single person in the room started to cheer and shout loudly, waving their fists in an unified movement. \"LTFK! LTFK! LTFK!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it remained unsure whether or not the LTFK would really conquer and claim the throne of Stenchlandia... It was certain that they survived that fateful day. The SSS was not defeated yet... But they lost one of their most skilled and dedicated women that day, a heavy loss indeed, and a strong blow to the other agent's morale. They were still a force to be reckoned with... But the scales were more balanced now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for Maria herself, everything was over. Her will was broken and she was reminded of her horrible fate every day, by those incredibly dangerous feet. She, the women who had turned so many men, and some women, into worthless footslaves, had finally become a lowly footslave herself. Karma was a bitch, indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n Maria's story has ended.</i></span></div></div>",

Anger etched her features, forming a contrast to the soft faced beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some may call you the same thing, LTFK swine!\" Maria spat at the girl. \"Now give up, or I'll give you what I gave your weak punk of a friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiggled her sweat encased toes in anticipation of the girls response, hoping she'd get another chance to teach this terrorist swine some manners, courtesy of the stinkiest feet on the force (Amber be damned, she thought!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beautiful girl stood up, and put her hair in a bun. She then took up a fighting stance with one fist outstretched, ready for what was to come. Maria's eyes scanned down towards her foot wear, seeing her feet were encased in a beat up, and ratty pair of ballerina flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria laughed heartily, doubling over at the sight of the girl and her cheap shoes. \"You really think you can DEFEET me? A trained agent of Stenchlandia's finest! I have the stinkiest feet in all the land you terrorist! My toe jam has choked many lying terrorists like yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time she spat her diatribe, Maria continued to work her toes up to a frenzy, creating rivulets of cheesy sweat which was itching to be released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl simply looked at Maria with a cold glare, and still held her stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your funeral little girl!\" Maria bellowed, running at the girl in a full sprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen things took a differen turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM! The girls foot connected with Mari's chin, sending the agent stumbling back. Shocked and appalled that she'd been struck, Maria was at a loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is this girl to kick me!? the agent thought, cradling her hurt jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Felicia, the Funky Foot Freedom Fighter, in case you're wondering!! Felicia responded smirking at the hurt agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo, you can't mean....\" Maria began terror settling into her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right you stink footed stormtrooper! The \"terrorists\" are fighting fire, with fire!\" Felicia responded. \"And you're about to find out first hand how prepared we are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flourish Felicia kicked off both shoes, engulfing the roof in a heady aroma of cheesy, popcorn, sour foot funk. Maria began to cough, swearing that she could see green tendrils of smoke coming from Felicia's size ten, black toenail polished toes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so entranced by the lovely stinkers that she barely saw the sweaty foot coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-WHAM! Felicia's slimy foot connected to Maria's cheek.<br>\r\n-BAM! The tortourous toes smacked Maria lips, wiggling themselves along her lips for added insult, leaving a trail of sweat on them!<br>\r\n-BOOM! Felica kicked Maria square in the chest, leaving a size ten sweaty footprint on her uniform.<br>\r\n-WHAP, WHAP, WHAP, WHAP, WHAP!!!! Felicia leaves Maria's face potmarked with slimy footprints, as she uses her wrinkly sweat encrustred soles to wreak havoc with the agents face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria hits the ground like a sack of potatoes, her feet falling out of her shoes. Her toes wiggled on the ground, seeking the damp confines of her stinky toes.<br>\r\nFrom her vantage point on the ground Maria watched as the maldrous pair of feet which had done their damage to her face stalked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe victorious Felicia attempted to force her foot inside of Maria's mouth, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick it!\" Felicia bellowed. \"Suck it, lick it....... rememeber these toes which DEFEETED YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEVER!\" Maria yelled through you sweat covered lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Felicia shouted with a evil grin. \"I guess I'm going to have to get rough..........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria retched behind her clenched teeth, as Felicia's long, sweaty toes steadily tried to burrow their way into her tightly sealed lips. It was a hopeless situation, while she managed to keep those toxic toes from terribly terrorizing the tender inside of her mouth, her sense of smell was steadily getting smashed with every breath. The foul, sharp fumes of Felicia's feet felt like the frantic stabbing of some fanatics dagger straight through Maria's nose, and even her eyes burned terribly by the salty sensation of the sour stench from Felicia's spectacular feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taste them, taste them! Stick them right into your mouth, haha, GO!\" Felicia said, as she retraced one foot slowly... Only to bring it down with frightening speed! Maria's eyes widened in shock and she managed to squirm to the side a bit. Felicia's moist sole connected to the ground instead, with a sickening, wet slap, spraying waves of tiny sweat droplets across the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Let me get rough on your pretty little face now! Stompity, slappity... Take my feet now, hahahaha!\" Felicia cheered as she started to do some sort of wicked dance, mainly kicking and jumping around and on Maria's battered body. She wasn't doing it with a whole lot of force, but as much as Maria tried to get up or roll away, one foot of Felicia was always there to kick her back into place. Maria kept trying to avoid those moist, acrid soles of doom, to keep them away from her vulnerable face, but it was getting harder and harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that Felicia was keeping up her ruthless aggression against Maria, it seemed that only Maria was tireing. \"Damn... her endurance is insane...\" Maria thought as Felicia started to jump up a bit too high. Maria smirked and quickly got up. \"Hah! Let your guard down at last, I knew that- Hmmmpfff... Hnnnghgh!\" Maria had spoken too soon! Thinking herself in a save position, she did not see Felicia's next move coming! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia had turned and twisted around in mid-air like no human should be able to... It looked like she was breaking the laws of physics! And suddenly, her foot was there, right at Maria's mouth! She had no time to avoid it; With a smooth, quick movement, Felicia's long, well-shaped toes traveled straight into Maria's widely open mouth, taking with them a load of salty footsweat. Maria gagged as an incredibly thick, salty and cheesy aroma was filling her mouth! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes yes yes, now you are tasting my foot for good! Now... for the perfect experience, I need to use my second foot for something as well, see?\" Felicia sung out, and plastered the toe area of her freed foot directly over Maria's nose. Maria had been in the process of getting up back before... But now she was collapsing anew, and Felicia, with both her feet fixed somewhere, descended elegantly onto Maria's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was knocked out of Maria's lungs and she had to re-fill it with the gaseous toxic of Felicia's smelly foot-air! To make matters worse, the slick, smooth toes inside her mouth were now busily hugging and wrestling her tormented tongue, making for an even stronger taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia kept making Maria smell and lick her feet for some time... Although she sort of did the licking for her, by slowly stroking her tongue inside her mouth where it couldn't flee with her flexible toes... but Maria didn't seem to weaken any further! \"Awww, not cool! You need to go to sleep, Missy! You must SLEEP! So I can drag you away somewhere, or something! Yes... *Sniff* I got an idea...\" Felicia mused while hurriedly drumming away at her chin with one finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's own feet were still reeking up the place as well, still freed of their own shoes, Felicia's nose had tracked their rancid aroma even over the strong scent of her own feet. \"Look what we got here... A pair of perfectly fine, if a bit smelly, feet.\" Even through all her suffering, Maria felt deeply offended that Felicia had just called her feet a \"bit\" smelly. \"Let's see what... this does?\" Felicia said with a broad smile, running the tip of her index finger sideways across Maria's sole. Maria's reaction was immediate, her entire body twitched shortly as a sharp, tingling sensation ran across her foot. \"Hmm... Aaaaaaaaand... How about this?\" Felicia said with an even fatter grin, running her finger down from the top of Maria's second toe to the end of her heel with minimal pressure, painfully slow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intense, tickling sensation unbareable for Maria! It ran through her nerves like electricity and against her will, she felt her heartbeat quickening... As well as her breathing. She started to sniff Felicia's dripping wet toes quicker and quicker... And more deeply, too. \"Ooooohh! Ahhhhhh! Fun fun fun! So... How about... THIS THEN?\" Felicia suddenly shouted as Maria started to frantically kick her feet around, trying to escape from Felicia's long, dexterous fingers. But Felicia caught them, held them together by her long toes with one hand... And then used her free hand to unleash a flurry of five flying fingers, finally reaching all of Maria's soles like a fantastic forest fire and putting her through pure hell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had no control over her breathing anymore. Instantly, the air was forced out and she had to sniff Felicia's horrible sole and toes, over and over again. The depth of the smell even seemed to intensify over time and soon, Maria could feel all of her strenght fading. If that kept going on... She would be knocked out.</span></div></div>",

She always gets her stuff done incredibly quickly...\" An agent of the SSS spoke, pointing at the downed Maria several meters ahead. Next to her were two other agents, who were now rushing forward to Maria's aid. \"Agh... Oh god, that stench... This can't be from one woman alone... Not even Maria can do that...\" One of them hissed, covering her nose and inhaling sharply through clenched teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia turned her head around quickly and looked at the three agents charging at her with full speed in surprise. She jumped back, stood still for a moment... And then attempted to simply defeat this new threat as well! She jumped into the air and swung her fists wildly, driving her enemies away from each other! Felicia smirked as she thought to have one of them cornered, but as soon as she locked on that one for good, one of the other two had suddenly re-appeared way too fast for her and slammed into her back with her shoulder! Felicia tumbled forward and received a violent round-house kick from the woman she initially tried to corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia stumbled back and dodged a flurry of attacks; she was suddenly completely surrounded by the three SSS agents! \"Damn, they're good...\" Felicia thought, seeking a way out of that misery. Suddenly, a few loud screams could be heard from behind; More LTFK members were arriving from the headquarters... They must have heard the fight nearby! As she heard this, Felicia smiled and let her guard down for just a second... And immediatly, a fist hit her directly in the stomach! Felicia coughed as she rung for her breath now and the woman who had punched her was now shoving her away with ease! As Felicia tripped and fell on the floor, rolling sideways and trying to get up instantly again, one of the SSS agents hurried to Maria, who was trying to get up herself now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get out of here... Right now!\" \"What are you saying... We can take them!\" \"No, we may be able to wrestle that crazy chick down if we concentrate solely on her... But it sounds like at least 30 people are coming this way! And look at Maria... She's in no fighting condition. You know Amber's orders... We leave now!\" \"Yes, ma'am!\" Maria was quickly helped up and dragged to the exit against her will. She shoved the agents away, but continued the hasty retreat. \"Get off me...  I can still run by myself.\" She gasped, her breathing still not fully functional after having smelled the toxic stench of Felicia's feet for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let them get away! They know our location now!\" Felicia barked behind them, leading the chase herself. Maria and her three allies continued the escape the same way they got up on the rooftops, until they got to the point where they all jumped down from the other roof before... But that one was much higher up than the one they were on right now. \"I-Impossible... What... What do we do?\" One of the agents stuttered, but Maria stepped forward and looked down... She could see a balcony on the building in front of her, quite a bit below. \"There. See this platform? We jump over there.\" Maria said, taking a deep breath and running at the edge of the building's roof with full speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still felt a bit groggy and dizzy, which worried her, but she managed to reach the balcony without problems. However, as she landed, catching her fall was too exhausting for her again and she almost collapsed on the floor. Her three colleagues landed next to her with little problem, two of them picking her up again. \"Please don't do this kind of thing now, Maria... If you mess up and fall down from this height, you might be- ouch!\" Maria had slapped her in the face and was getting up on her own again. \"Don't you... tell me... what to do...\" She gasped, her face distorted with rage, but pale and sweating heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She isn't wrong, though. Well, at least we'll be relatively safe, now... Oh shit.\" One of the other two agents said, as she watched Felicia show up on the roof they just jumped from... together with a large group of followers. \"No! We must get down! This madwoman will surely attempt... to... jump...\" The agent stuttered in awe as Felicia actually jumped off immediatly, descending towards them with outstretched arms!  Maria and her allies hurried into the abandoned building, Felicia following shortly. Every few seconds, they heard the impact of another LTFK member landing on the balcony... \"Damn! How come those filthy rebels have so many acrobats???\" Maria spat as she hurried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short run, they reached a staircase and after running down there, they were on the ground level once more. It did not take long for them to reach the streets again, and finally, as some nearby police officers noted them and came closer, Maria knew that they were safe for the moment. Maria cursed herself silently for having failed like that...  But at the very least, they knew where those rebels were hiding out now. If they were quick enough... They could still capture them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need backup... Lots of it. The subtle way may have failed, but I say still crush those bloody vermin one way or another. They have a few great fighters, I must admit... But so do we, and we have many more. Let's call for reinforcements right away!\" Maria yelled. And so they did, a much bigger assault team of the SSS was soon gathered and sent to the requested address... </span></div></div>",

Even though the troops were actually sent pretty fast, it seemed to last forever to Maria. \"Dammit... Hurry up, girls! They know we're after them... if we're too slow, they'll be gone and hiding <i>somewhere</i> else... I can't fail like that! Aaarrgh!\" Maria cursed and bickered loudly to herself, running up and down furiously. After several minutes of breathing clean air, she had finally managed to recover completely from the terrible assault of funky foot stench Felicia had laid upon her... And now she was thirsting for another battle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, several teams of about 20 agents, each lead by a high-ranked officer showed up, carried by heavy transporters and rushing towards Maria and her three allies immediatly. \"Listen up, women... Time's running short, we need to infiltrate the enemy headquarters as quickly as possible and catch any and every rebel that tries to escape. I know you are all the best of the best... We can still do this!\" Maria yelled and started the chase herself... Even though deep inside, she already suspected this battle to be lost. She would never admit that in front of troops beneath her, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, they reached the headquarters relatively quick... But Maria knew that everything was very, very wrong when they didn't meet a single guard. As she was rushing through the building, Maria's panick was steadily raising. \"Listen, everybody... Spread out. Catch some of them... Anyone! We need to know where they're heading next, or this all will be a complete waste of time...\" She screamed frantically, and her troops spread, heading into every single room and corridor, looking for anyone left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was hopeless. Soon, Maria found the room which had to have been the main central, the heart of this organisation... But it didn't look good. A few useless papers were scattered all over the floor, some chairs were lying around randomly, it was evident that someone had taken everything that could have been of use to the SSS away, before Maria got here. \"Damn! Damn, damn... How can this be... I have never failed a single mission...\" Maria hissed through her teeth, clenching the sides of her head with both hands desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on a nearby table, covering her face with one hand and thinking hard. Yet, no idea came to her. \"Maria? Oh, there you are... Listen, ma'am... We have bad news...\" One of the higher ranked agents said after running up to her and saluting briefly. \"...they got away, didn't they?\"  Maria spat. The other agent gulped loudly and nodded. \"I'm afraid so. My girls have searched every single room, and have even taking position on the roof directly above... There's no sign of them, anywhere.\" \"Aaaaaaaagh... <i>Verdammte Schei\u00dfe!</i>\" Maria cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakily took her device back out of her pockets and almost immediatly, Amber's indignant voice rang out. \"Maria? What's going on? Report, now!\" Maria remained silent for a moment, before closing her eyes in shame and uttering the most unpleasant words which had ever left her mouth: \"Mission... failed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, Maria was walking in a corridor in the SSS headquarters, towards a very pissed Amber with her head hung. Maria looked at Amber's face at last and almost gasped in shock as she saw just how upset she really was now... It was frightening! \"Well, Maria... So you have failed, yes?\" \"Yes...\" Maria said bitterly. \"Alright... Explain what has happend to me, now.\" \"Certainly. The main-\" \"Oh, and before you start, I want you to go down on your knees, in front of me.\" Amber interrupted coolly. Maria swallowed and did as she had been told. She walked up to Amber and got down, and before she could start talking again, Amber had pushed her further down, until her head was on the ground, right next to Amber's polished, shining black leather boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember my orders, don't you, Maria?\" \"Yes... I was told to... call for reinforcements if things became too dangerous for myself to handle...\" \"Exactly. So that our enemies wouldn't be warned. So they wouldn't get away. Tell me, Maria. Why did you ignore my orders?\" Amber's voice got more threatening by the second and she was moving her toes around in her boots, making loud, squishy noises. Maria knew she was in deep shit now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I just thought I could do it on my own. I was sure of it!\" \"You were wrong.\" Amber said coldly and even though Maria already knew that herself, Amber's words still stung. What was even worse though, was the fact that Amber was now busy kicking off her boot... With Maria's face right next to it! Maria wimpered as Amber's huge, sweat-dripping foot finally slid out of her boot, a moist wave of hot, pudrid air rolling over Maria's vulnerable face. Maria retched as she caught the first whiff of this strong aroma of sweat and stale cheese... Amber's feet were as bad as ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, you have to pay the price. Kiss my feet.\" Amber said, planting the large, shining sole of her shapely, incredibly long foot directly on Maria's face with a wet, painful slap. \"Yes... I deserve this...\" Maria thought to herself quietly as she began to tenderly kiss this incredibly smelly feet of her boss. The skin of her soles was incredibly soft and smooth, but the taste of salty sweat was more than enough to make Maria's stomach turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on, you will obey <i>all</i> of my orders. Understood?\" Amber said, spreading her slimy, hot toes over Maria's nose. Maria took a deep sniff and was almost knocked out by the brutal stench that hit her nose like a punch, making her stutter nonsense for a few seconds. \"What was that?\" \"I said... yes, of course. I will follow your every order. Something as this will never happen again...\" \"Good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a wave of cool air rolled over Maria's face as Amber's foot was lifted once more. \"You are incredibly skilled and determinated, Maria. I'm not overstating when I say you're one of our finest women. And that's why we can <i>not</i> afford to lose you, especially during a small scouting mission like this.\" Maria got up quickly and saluted. \"Thank you, Amber... As I said, I will not disappoint the SSS, ever again!\" \"Good, good. Well, I'll give you the chance to prove it, right away! Those LTFK members must be somewhere... Find them. Take every girl you need, use all your knowledge for this. This mission is important. Who knows what those maniacs will do if we don't catch them first...\" Amber said worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria saluted and was about to turn around, as Amber suddenly spoke out again. \"Just one more thing, Maria. I seldomly grant people a second chance. I do <i>not</i> give out third chances, not even for someone as skilled as you. If you fail this, it will have... dire consequences.\" Maria swallowed hard and gave a worried look. Suddenly, Amber grinned and smacked her hard on the shoulder, almost knocking her over. \"Ahh, don't give me that look! Listen, I know you're incredibly good. You can do this, no doubt. Just don't do something stupid and fuck everything up again, alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria grimaced for a moment, then took a serious expression. \"Yes... Yes, thank you for your trust. I won't fail you this time!\" And with that, she stormed off. As she walked furiously through the corridors to gather some agents to help her, she started to curse audibly once more: \"This is all that damn madwoman's fault... That damn... Felicia, was it? Grrrrr, if only it weren't for her, victory was already in my grasp! If anything... I will make sure she will <i><b>PAY</b></i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Four weeks later to a day, Maria made her way through the SSS headquarter's corridors heading for Amber's office once again. She didn't know what Amber had in store for her this time but one thing was clear: Although not Maria's fault, Amber just couldn't be happy with how the things had turned out. The SSS had searched for LTFK members without respite and with all finesse. They had even arrested people who were suspicious of being in touch with people who in turn were aspersed to be in contact with LTFK members! However, the most complex manhunt-campaign in the whole Stenchlandian history hadn't been successful so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, they had captured several individuals; partly because they were suspicious and partly just because they had to damn show some success. But the big fish hadn't been in the catches yet. Even when the arrested persons finally broke, after hours and hours of stinky foot torture, only few could convincingly prove their contact to the LTFK. And none of them had any important and useful information to share. Mostly, they had spat out some names of account executives who had already been arrested. Sometimes they had admitted to know that the LTFK was planning some actions in the coming days but no one could tell what exactly they planned and where it would happen. On the whole, they were terrible informants..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least, we're successfully defeating the footslave-deficit in this country if the things go on like this\", Maria thought to herself rushing through corridor after corridor. She even chuckled a bit about her own joke. \"If the LTFK doesn't fear us yet, at least their sympathizers will. I saw to that!\" As fast as it had come, her little mood of complacency disappeared when Maria saw the door to Amber's office show up in front of her. She gulped, tightened and energetically knocked three times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in\", Amber's voice rang out and so Maria entered the office. \"Agent Maria at your service! You called for me?\" Amber looked up from some sheets of paper and looked her over for a second. \"Indeed, I did. Are there any news from your side, I might like to hear?\" This was exactly what Maria had expected, but still, it didn't make the situation for her any better. Her body involuntarily stiffened and she readied for the moment of truth: \"I fear, I will have to disappoint you Amber. We captured several suspects and have our best interrogators pumping them for information, but it seems we were unlucky so far. Many of them talked, but nobody seems to have really important information. The LTFK must be a lot more careful since...since..I failed.\" Her own words pierced Maria to the heart and the inner pain even increased when Amber nodded in agreement. \"You're right Maria. If you wouldn't have been so egoistic and selfish, the LTFK could have been crushed already. But nevertheless, your comprehension and self-criticism shows me once again what an excellent agent you are. Let's forget this and concentrate on here and now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying this Amber stared at the mess of sheets on her desk and waved Maria nearer. \"Now I am really sure you and your team is doing just as good as possible but considering <i>this</i> (she made an angry gesture towards the sheets) it would have been a lot better if you actually had found out <i>anything</i> useful! You know what these sheets are? They are faxes from other SSS quarters from all over Stenchlandia. Most of them are informing us about civil commotions in their areas of competence, kindly asking for backup forces. It seems they don't even know that we have huge problems as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria overflew some of the fax headlines and senders. It seemed that Amber, who was talking herself more and more into a rage, had been saying the truth. \"How bad is the situation? Is it really a threat for our unchallenged control in Stenchlandia? And how will we react?\", Maria asked with an unusually worried voice. Amber leaned back on her chair, breathed deeply and massaged her forehead with her fingers before answering. \"Oh man, or should I say woman?! I feel how I get a terrible headache over all this disorder. I think I will call my footslave after we're done here. Well, Maria, after our first attempt to crush the LTFK failed, it seems some scum in the midst of the citizens drew new hope from our failure. The LTFK constantly grew and spread all over Stenchlandia. This blain literally spread circular from here. At first I received faxes from the south, then the east and west and today..even from the north! So, yes, unfortunately the LTFK bugs have become more than a little annoyance. But you know what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's hands were shaking by now and Maria could see the wrath rising up in her body. As she looked up from the sheets on her desk, there was a blazing fire in her eyes and a thick wrath core pulsated on her right temple. \"Now these rebel scumbags went too far..I will personally mobilize all the SSS forces we command, to show them what real power is! In the next days we will start huge tracing actions, detain everyone who is suspicious in any way and if necessary, we will even fight out street battles with the LTFK..This will happen all over Stenchlandia! You better prepare yourself Maria. Tell your team and every important commander you meet about these plans. We're done for now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to Amber's eruption, Maria just smirked. Her revenge finally came into reach..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the SSS's greatest efforts to hunt down and capture the remaining LTFK members (especially their leader who was still unknown to them at this point, and that self-proclaimed freedom fighter, Felicia) they did not make any real progress. Soon enough, the rebels got better and better in evading their feminist overlords and sometimes dared even to venture out into the open streets for short amounts of time, where they would speak with the oppressed populace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa, was personally talking with a small group of people who had lost their homes and everything else just a few days ago. Suddenly, one of her allies warned her and the very next moment, they were gone, vanished into the shadows. A few police women walked around a corner and took a look around because they had heard their voices, but walked back away after they didn't see anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa nodded as she was walking through another alley, away from the police. \"Well, we always knew that our country's regime was inhuman and wrong... But it's steadily getting worse! It pains me to say this, but... We'll have to use this situation to our advantage.\" Vanessa said quietly to herself. \"Do you mean... using those people to fight alongside us? We can't do that, Vanessa! They're just civilians, and most of them don't even have any fighting skills.\" One man to her right responded. But Vanessa simply shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we have to do something right now. I've seen it happening way too many times, now... Some of those poor, innocent people attacking the government on their own, and thus getting transported to their... sick camps or laboratories as a result. This may be the only chance to save all of them, including ourselves. While I hate to involve them all... We are too weak as we are right now. Besides, unlike our SSS friends, I would never force anyone to do something I want. Always remember, brothers and sisters... You are always free to go, should things become too dangerous.\" Vanessa had drifted into a mini-speech but that had only good effects on her allies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! You are right after all!\" \"That's why you're our beloved leader, Vanessa!\" \"Let's fight right now! For glory! For justice!\" \"For LTFK!\" After that, the entire group started to chant \"LTFK! LTFK! LTFK!\" loudly, making Vanessa somewhat worried. \"Ah, great. So much for subtlety... Listen to me, good people! We march into the streets right now! And now... we will make a change! Let's goooooo!\" Vanessa cried, starting to run in front of her people personally, all of them following her with blind devotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a single minute had passed, and already the police officers from before were running towards the cheering crowd. \"Hey, what do you think you're doing there? You're all under arrest!\" One officer said, getting out a pair of handcuffs. Unfortunately for her, she was far too used to locking up people without any resistance. She never saw it coming when Vanessa suddenly rushed over to her and slammed into her torso with her shoulder, completely knocking her over! She was attempting to stand up again, but immediatly, she was swallowed by the mass of about twenty angry LTFK members gathering around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember; avoid physically hurting them as much as possible! I know they would deserve it, but everybody needs to know that we're the saviours, not the tyrants. Seriously injuring anyone is strictly forbidden!\" Vanessa yelled as loudly as she could over the commotion of the starting fight. One of the police women was already trying to make some distance between herself and the angry mob, while also calling for help \"We require backup immediatly; Corner Schnitzelhausen Street/Gr\u00fcnewald Avenue. Send any nearby patrols here; we've got about- Arrrgh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer's radio was smacked out of her hand by a spinning roundkick delivered by Vanessa herself. She then struck the officer on her head with the palm of her hand, knocking her out instantly and clean! Vanessa turned around and saw some of her friends tying up the other policewoman with some of the rope they had taken from their original headquarters... One guy was carrying a backpack full of that stuff, Vanessa was sure it would come in handy often. \"Listen up, we'll need to get out of here quickly! I'm not sure how many people the police force will send just on information like that... But we better don't take any chances!\" Vanessa yelled and was the first to start running once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer flock soon followed and Vanessa gave them a nervous glance as she was rushing onto an open street. This wasn't the perfect spot to be right now, but if they reached the other side quickly enough, they'd have a really good place to hide once more. \"Ah... damnit!\" Vanessa cursed as she heard the sound of several police cars rushing down the street, with blaring sirens. \"How could they be that quick... And shit, where's Felicia now...\" Vanessa hissed through clenched teeth, scanning her allies but unable to find the freaky funk-feet freedom fighter, or how she called herself, anywhere. \"Aside from her and me... None of us here can really fight well... This will be a disaster!\" Vanessa mumbled as she watched three police cars coming to a halt screechingly, police officers jumping out and giving chase immediatly. Vanessa turned around and cursed again; From the other direction, there were also two police cars coming, completely sealing off their means of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright... Stay calm, my friends... We'll get out of this situation, just don't do anything rash before I say so...\" Vanessa said calmly, even though her hands were trembling with nervousness. The LTFK members stood together closely, soon to be completely surrounded by at least thirty officers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we just engage them right away, chief? They have no chance now, haha!\" One policegirl said, cracking her knuckles. \"No, we would win for sure, but that leader of theirs can put a serious fight... I don't want to risk getting any of my women injured, alright? We'll ask them to surrender now... And then, you'll have more than enough time to have some fun with them.\" Just as she said that, another car arrived, this time a larger, black SSS transporter; 8 uniformed and armored agents jumping out of the vehicle's back as soon as it slowed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police chief smirked as she saw she much-need help arriving and gave the SSS commander a thankful nod. She began to speak without further ado \"Listen up, rebels. If you don't want to get crushed to dust right here, I suggest you drop to your knees with your hands behind your head, all of you! And should anyone try to resist then I will make sure that they get to smell our entire force's feet. Not that any of you will be spared having to sniff smelly feet, haha! But some of us have worse feet than others...\" The commander's thoughts seemed to drift away for a second as she looked down on her own feet, her toes wiggling squishily inside the damp, hot confines of her tight leather boots. She quickly snapped back to her senses, though. \"What did I say? Get down!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's thoughts were racing. She couldn't just give up like this, without a fight! But driving all her allies into a hopeless battle and making them suffer terrible consequences later on? Time was running short, and she had to make a decision!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright... I'm afraid we have no choice, my friends... We'll simply have to-\" Vanessa started to whisper, but was suddenly interrupted by a loud,  thundering laughter coming from somewhere above. \"Aaaaaaahahahahaha! Haha! Seems like I'm just in time, \u00e9h? What do you say, Vanessa? Is this good timing, or what?\" There Felicia was at last, standing on the roof of a nearby building all of the sudden, giddily jumping up and down while pointing to herself. \"Felicia! ...At last. Now we have a real chance of turning this situation around, everybody!\" Vanessa said, the fiery gleam of hope reappearing in her shining eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe SSS commander looked up to the newly-appeared enemy and absent-mindly scratched the back of her head. \"So... another rebel appeared, yes? Hah... I don't see how this turns anything around. No matter how good of a fighter she is, we'll be done with this group of rebels before she's even down from this stupid building. Oi, you there, girl!\" She yelled, pointing to Felicia. \"Perhaps climbing up to that building wasn't the brightest idea, don't you think? Unless you wanted a good place to watch us utterly dominate the rest of your pathetic organisation. Well, enjoy the view!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fool!\" Felicia shrieked with a grin, leaping up high into the air... And right off the building! \"<i>Bei allen Heiligen...</i> This girl is completely insane!\" The SSS commander muttered, watching Felicia's speedily descend with her eyes widely open. Felicia seemed to be falling quite gracefully, but still, down to earth. \"My name is Felicia, dummy! You'd better write it down, or something!\" Felicia yelled in mid-air as she was suddenly extending her left arm, seemingly aiming at something while still falling towards the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike most of the other people present, Vanessa was smirking at that sight. She knew exactly what Felicia was about to do, and it would give her party a huge advantage, if she played her cards right now. \"Sssssssss!\" She hissed \"Get ready to attack...\" Vanessa had whispered these worlds incredibly quietly, some of her allies heard them, but not all. It would have to do, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the moment Vanessa was waiting for had come; With a loud mechanical sound, a metal hook attached to a chain sprung from Felicia's wrist and flew all the way across the street. \"What the...\" The SSS commander mumbled, her brain somewhat slowed-down. The next second, the hook had hit something on a building... And suddenly, Felicia's flight was shifting into a fierce vertical movement, rushing directly at the SSS team. \"Shit! Everybody down!\" The SSS commander screamed, throwing herself down just in time... However, most of her subordinates were acting way too slowly and thus Felicia drove straight into them, throwing them all down to the ground in one powerful impact! Thankfully for Felicia, this softened her fall dramatically and allowed herself not to break all of her bones with her crazy action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW!!!\" Vanessa screamed and attacked some of the regular police officers; They had foolishly turned their backs on the LTFK members, their eyes drawn to the courageous, mad action of Felicia. Even though they were still outnumbering their enemies, the police was literally blown off the battlefield as Vanessa and Felicia joined forces, the other LTFK members also feverishly helping whereever they could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, it didn't look so good for Vanessa's party; The regular police women were being dealt with as several of the knocked down SSS agents suddenly sprung back up and swiftly attacked her team in the worst possible way from behind! \"Regular methods won't bring us victory here... Use your feet!\" Their commander screamed and almost instantly, the heavy sound of several thick leather boots dropping to the ground could be heard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis action had been a two-edged sword though; The combined freeing of this many hot, sweat-soaked feet released a toxic cloud of horrible, burning footstench over the entire area almost instantly, and both the remaining policewomen and untrained LTFK members alike were soon groaning in agony, holding their hands over their faces in an desperate attempt to keep the thick, cheesy stench out. Vanessa and Felicia remained fighting, but even for the two of them, this was a nasty attack. Felicia gasped and took a few steps back before shaking her head and charging forwards again, while Vanessa was simply biting through the smell, but this situation was too much even for her to handle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe SSS agents immediatly exploited the inexperience of most of the LTFK members, some were collapsing from the smell on their own, some were pushed to the ground, their hands pulled away from their faces, leaving it exposed and vulnerable... And then, one or several deadly feet were held directly into them, drenching it with stinging, salty sweat and blasting their senses with an incredibly thick stench. Most of them stopped moving after just the first sniff, letting the agents target a new person within seconds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa and Felicia continued to land precise and devastating hits, but their small army was dwindling away at an alarming speed! \"Damnit! As good as all of our forces are down! I didn't want to do this, because it would affect our own side as well, but now... Let's use our feet, Felicia!\" Vanessa said, glancing around nervously. \"Alright!\" Felicia yelled with a grin, finally hearing something pleasant in a while. \"So, you SSS dogs want to fight us with your feet, hmmm? Well, two can play that game! Get a whiff of <i>these</i>...\" With that, she jumped up high again, kicking her feet together and her dirty ballerina flats away... The following wave of funky foot aroma hit everybody almost directly in the face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Vanessa had to cough as she was exposed to the shiningly wet soles of her friend's inhumanely smelly feet, but she grinned darkly as she followed Felicia's action and leapt up high herself, sending her sweat-filled shoes flying far, far away! The last standing SSS members were downright crippled by the thick, rank aroma of stale cheese and unwashed socks in the air, and it only got worse for them! Vanessa landed on one of their women, knocking her to the ground and smothering her helpless face with the repulsive, dirty underside of her sweatsoaked sock while she swiftly peeled the warm, wet sock off her other foot... And then skillfully flung it straight into the face of another agent, sending that one down immediatly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Felicia had landed on the shoulders of yet another SSS agent, sat on them and held both of her long, drippingly wet bare feet over her face from behind... And then jumped back off as her victim collapsed after just one sniff from between her lethal, slimy toes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Vanessa was taking a step back, nodding proudly as she looked at the heap of knocked out enemies on the floor. The last one that was still conscious, the SSS commander no less, was about to suffer the same fate as her allies! Felicia was standing over her, ready to knock her out, but still holding back for the moment. \"So... Just to make sure you remember well who I am, bitch! The name's Felicia. Funky feet freedom fighter! <i>Even in the depths of the night... Just when no other bird dares to take flight; One alone soars, to shine the light of righteousness over the worlds blight!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shook her head sceptically. \"What are you rambling about, over there? What bird? Hurry up, Felicia, we still need to get our people away from here...\" \"Shut up, I always wanted to say that in my enemy's face before I knock them out! ...But alright, I guess I'm finished anyways. Sweet dreams, you!\" Felicia shot, before bringing her foot down on her victim's face with a sickening squishy sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she joined Vanessa, who was already busy helping some of the LTFK members up again. \"Damn... The ones who just got hit by the stink shockwave are recovering already, however the unfortunate few who met toes to nose with our SSS friends will probably keep sleeping for a while... We need to carry them somehow!\" \"Yeah, but... where to?\" \"I don't know yet, but one thing's for sure... We need to hide!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, Vanessa... no.\" \"W-What? We can't take another fight like this!\" \"I think it's too late to find a place to hide right now. And look! Look at all those witnesses!\" \"Huh?\" Vanessa took a look around and indeed, many people have come out from various hideouts, backalleys and abandoned buildings and were watching them in awe... Them, who had defeated an entire team of SSS agents, plus some police officers! \"Let me handle this one, Vanessa...\" Felicia said with a smirk, as she put on a heroic stance. \"Yo, guys! See how we kicked the butts of those SSS idiots? I dunno about you, but I say we should finally take over around here! And kick those stupid psychopaths off their high throne! Who's with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia raised her fist and all of the surrounding people came running over to her, cheering loudly. \"Hehe, this is really easy!\" Felicia grinned, turning to a frowning Vanessa. \"...it gets the job done, I suppose. Alright... I have to admit, your idea sounds better. Let's gather as many people as possible, before the government strikes back for real!\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two months had passed since Vanessa and Felicia had won the first and most important street battle against the SSS forces. Ever since this fateful day, the LTFK had continuously registered new members in their ranks. To her great excitement, Vanessa's ambitions approached more and more. For every honorable freethinker and for all humane democrats, male or female, the LTFK was the place to go. The members among themselves often considered each other as part of something bigger: A movement for freedom, a dream of equality and individual fulfilment, or even a refuge of security like a safeguarding family! These men would not only fight for the LTFK, Vanessa knew that. They would go on until either the dictatorship was beaten or the LTFK was completely smashed. After all they had no other alternative. Even if they wanted, returning to their old lifes wasn't possible anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The slave who winded the sweet scent of freedom and tasted the ample feast of equality, will never ever give his achievements up again.\"</i>, Vanessa thought to herself while relaxing in her new office, a broad room located in the center of the LTFK's new base. \"Less than ever will former slaves forget about these achievements, when they were used to smell the sour stench of hot sweaty feet and to taste bitter toejam..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Vanessa's thoughts span around the speech she had prepared for the day. After her and Felicia's first public victory, the triumphal procession had almost turned into an exuberant flush of victory and it had been hard to keep her troops careful and down-to-earth. Luckily, one of the first men who had went along with the LTFK had been locksmith in a huge belowground textile factory, before the feminist movement had taken over Stenchlandia. This factory was old and rather gainless in the end, so the local government had decided to shut it down. However, due to the total chaos in the first months of the feminist revolution, everyone just forgot about the factory and now the male owners were either someone's slave or had left the country. In addition to that, Gus the locksmith felt confident that the new local authorities had seen the old order to shut the factory down and that they misleadingly reasoned that the necessary actions had already been taken by the former government. All in all very good conditions to build up a new base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe had made themselves at home pretty fast and at first everyone (except Gus maybe) had been impressed by the sheer size of this old factory. After some days of hard work, the LTFK had established forty dormitories (each dormitory accommodated fifty persons on a roll mat), three big canteens (each one with an own kitchen), one council chamber for 100 persons, five common rooms, one sparsely equipped infirmary, one exercise room, a little library where everyone who wanted donated some of his own books for the common welfare and several working rooms (for paperwork). Additionally, by command of Vanessa, some LTFK members had converted some storage rooms into arrest cells for captured SSS agents or LTFK members who turned out to be a danger for others. Once the work was done, Vanessa finally had a secret and operative base for the LTFK, with space for about 2000 persons! This truly was a beginning and now it would be a lot easier to coordinate strikes against the SSS establishments, although they still had to do a lot of organization and intern coordination before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the reason why Vanessa had decided to call every one of the LTFK she had gathered so far (after all more than 1600 energetic men and women) together for an important meeting. If this rebellion should end successfully, it wouldn't be enough to command an LTFK base with 2000 persons located in the center of Stenchlandia. Indeed, Vanessa had some contact persons in the north, south, east and west of Stenchlandia but the rebellions there would need to be coordinated by one headquarter in order to achieve the maximum power. Therefore, she had also invited all the rebels from all over Stenchlandia who were willing to combine under her command. Now they were here as well and the base really burst at the seams. To make sure that this overcrowding didn't last too long, Felicia, by now Vanessa's fuglewoman, had organized an election to determine the first 100 council members. This had been two days ago and today Vanessa had to address the council for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry\", she said to herself over and over again, \"these people look up to you. You give them hope. Whatever you say, just make sure you stay confident and remind them what they're fighting for!\" Vanessa had been at this point already thirty times today and was about to repeat this to herself for the thirty-first time, when suddenly someone opened the door. \"Vanessa? Are you ready? The council is waiting since fifteen minutes now..\" Felicia's head peeked inside and Vanessa could see that her new job as fuglewoman had to be exhausting. Fine beads of sweat decorated her delicate forehead, no wonder, Felicia probably had been running around a lot in order to get an atmospheric picture of her troops. \"Yeah, I will come now.\" With these words Vanessa stood up, took a sip of water and followed Felicia to the council chamber. It was full inside. Each and everyone of the 100 council members was there staring at her in anticipation. Although she felt her heart beating faster, Vanessa forced herself to make a serious face. Then she gracefully paced to the speaker's platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fellow free men and women, first of all I want to congratulate you on your election victory. Also thank you that you showed up so numerously, I appreciate your dedication to our cause. Now, I am not really good in making long speeches. I prefer to come to the point as fast as possible, also with regard to the fact that we clearly don't have enough time to digress. The reason why I need you is that the success of the rebellion mostly depends on our level of organization and coordination. Having the SSS as our enemies doesn't make things easier. If we really want to reach the downfall of the inhumane system in Stenchlandia, we need to constantly land critical hits against hit, absolutely everywhere in Stenchlandia. Besides me and Felicia you are the chosen ones to represent each and every one in the LTFK. So, in order to be able to coordinate attacks from everywhere at any time, we need eight leaders. Two for the north, two for the west, two for the east and two for the south. The center will be coordinated by me and Felicia and we will also distribute information and orders. Thus, the first action this council will take right now is to elect the eight leaders. Afterwards we will celebrate a bit to pump up the morale, then the freshly elected leaders will take their new positions and start recruiting new members for the LTFK. Ladies and gentlemen, it's getting serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Vanessa ended her speech, the council chamber remained absolutely quiet for some seconds. She started to worry already if she hadn't found the right words, but then a storm of jubilation surged to the speaker's platform and Vanessa saw Felicia nodding in approval. The relief almost made Vanessa forget about her serious face and so she quickly jumped of the platform and left the chamber. Her moment of joy only lasted for a little while, then the first sorrows began to prey on her mind. \"Hopefully the council proves to be worthy and elects suitable leaders and not just friends..I can't afford power plays in my own ranks! Besides, was it really smart to gather everyone here? What if the SSS finds us? We have been lucky and no one betrayed us to them so far, but you never know.. If they catch us here, we're all dead in the water and Stenchlandia's only hope for freedom will be gone.\" It was as if an apprehension befell Vanessa and her body began to shiver for a moment. Soon enough however, she nagged at herself to stay reasonable. \"Come on Vanessa you have made it so far. Don't draw in your horns now! You are a fighter, you have nearly 2000 persons who will defend this base for all costs, you have the best fuglewoman one can imagine and are about to bring democracy back to Stenchlandia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these words to herself, Vanessa made her way to the common rooms and joined the celebration. She drank one beer and after a little while she had drunk some beers and was in this slightly foggy-brained mood of absolute happiness and complacency, paired with a snugly rising tiredness. She scufflingly returned to her office and slumped on her bed where she closed her eyes, not knowing what the future had in store..    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa awoke with a crude belch and yawn the next morning. A fierce stabbing pain in the sides of her head startled her, but as soon as she tried to stand up, everything started to spin wildly, and she fell back down again. \"Uuughhh... uughh, what's going on...\" She mumbled, waving her hand around and suddenly creating some loud, metallic impacts. She shook her head and saw several empty beer cans bouncing and rolling on the ground. \"Agh... Oh, alright. That.\" Taking another attempt at rising, she finally succeeded and fought her way out of her bed, the covers tumbling to the floor and revealing even more beer cans. \"Damn! If forming this council wasn't a reason to get drunk again finally, then I don't know, but my beer storage was supposed to last for almost one month... Oh well...\" She sulked as she kicked some away absent-mindedly. \"...We got real lucky that nobody disturbed us yesterday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany minutes later, after Vanessa had freshened herself up as good as possible so that she wouldn't look so much like an unwashed hobo, she realised just how true that last statement had been! As she paced around in her new headquarters... Her fortress, as she liked to call it, due to its immense size and tactical importance; She spotted more than one drunken soldier. Some were downright dozing on the floor, sometimes over each other, sometimes alone... Some were wandering around drunkly, seemingly searching for some place they would never find in their state and eventually falling down a few times. Some were even still holding tightly on bottles with unknown liquids inside them, singing or moaning something vaguely resembeling some song in a way that made Vanessa's ears bleed, while leaning to walls or lying on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, the place was a complete mess. \"Sheesh... What happened yesterday?\" \"Oi! Hey, Vanessa!\" Vanessa turned around and was almost knocked over as Felicia tumbled into her. \"Hey... hey, where WERE you last night, huh?\" \"Well... Asleep.\" \"You didn't attend our great party!\" \"You threw a party?\" \"Uh... Sorta. It wasn't really planned, and it wasn't so much a party in the classical sense. We didn't have any music, which was the worst thing. But! We all got really drunk, and that's what counts the most, right?\" \"Uhm... sure. Well, you know what they say Felicia... <i>Man kann auch ohne Spa\u00df Alkohol haben!</i> So I really didn't miss that much.\" Vanessa slurred with an uncharacteristically dumb grin. \"Yes, I can tell by your spooky, blood-shot eyes and your breath. But hey, way to go, pal!\" Felicia cheered, smacking Vanessa on the back a bit too hard. \"Yeah... But in this state, I doubt that I'll get any planning done.\" \"Ah, don't worry. With our council elected and with our four main attack teams able to function pretty much on their own, I think we'll be able to take a lot of work off your shoulders. Besides, I've had it planned that we give our guys this day off, anyway...\" Vanessa raised one eyebrow. \"I hope we're not losing too much time by this. The enemy won't sit idly by, now that we've formed a serious threat to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia grinned as they reached the main council chamber. Upon opening it, a wide sea of empty alcohol vessels was revealed and a stale smell, almost as bad as if Vanessa herself had taken her shoes off flooded the corridor. \"I see... Cleaning all that up will take AT LEAST one day, anyway. Well, I guess the whole thing was a great morale boost, at least!\" \"You're DAMN right about that, sis!\" \"And let's hope our enemies WILL have to wait for some reason...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit! Look at this! Tell me what you see!\" A high ranked SSS officer yelled at her scared subordinates, slamming her fist on the table so hard that she almost broke it clean in halves. \"It's... it's the newspaper, ma'am...\" \"But what does it <i>say</i>?\" \"Presence of a large-scale rebel movement confirmed... Approximate members: At least 1000. Could this be the end to our glorious-\" The lower ranked agent didn't come any further, as her boss was so enraged at hearing this again that she literally flipped the table over. \"Raaargh! How could this happen! Dirty rebels! Not just in our wonderful nation, but right at our heart, the capital, as well! How could we <i>let</i> this happen! Argh! ...Oh, and also get me the responsible woman from the propaganda department... How could they let anyone print such rubbish??? End of our glorious nation, huh? Well, we will show them! I want those rebels, preferable alive! If you get their leaders, bring them to me alive at all costs! And most importantly... Find their hideout! And then destroy it, or reclaim it, I don't really give a shit, just get rid of that rebellious scum! And you know what happens should anyone of you fail this time...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer walked up to her subordinates who were all standing still in one line, not daring to move a centimetre, but internally shaking in fear. \"Then <i>this</i> will smell like roses...\" The officer said, taking one of her boots off and fanning the hot, moist air from the inside directly into the faces of her underlings, who cringed in shock as they inhaled the powerful scent. \"...compared to what I'll do to you. Now GO!!!\" And with that, all of them stormed off immediatly. The officer sighed and walked lazily to a nearby chair, where she dropped down, holding her head. She remembered the last time when she messed a big thing like that up... Her direct boss back then, a powerful and cruel woman called Amber by her closer colleagues had threatened her to use her face as her personal footstool for several hours should she fail. She somehow did fail, and Amber kept to her word. She had been out cold for almost an entire day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office trembled shortly, and then swiftly jumped up, smacking herself in the face. \"Arghh... I will not let that happen again!\" Although she had been moved to an entirely different building since last time, she couldn't take any chances yet. During the next hours, she saw to it that almost every single woman after her command was out in the streets, hunting for the infamous LTFK movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she wasn't the only one. All across the city, most of the SSS stations and bases sent out their entire forces to deal with this threat. And unfortunately for them, the LTFK was aware of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news, commander! Our spies confirm that base C-27 has just sent out at least 80% of its entire force!\" Vanessa nodded, her hands folded and otherwise unmoving, as she stared down on an immense and incredibly well-detailed map of the city. She marked said base, closed her eyes for a moment and said \"This is it, then. Men and women, people of the LTFK... This is the perfect moment to strike. I doubt the SSS expects us to take over one of their bases... Let's see their faces when we take several! This is the plan...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smacked her index finger on the map, dragging it across paths and tipping certain structures with it twice. \"For this operation, we will concentrate our attack on the north-west area of the city... As you can see, all the bases in that area have been left almost without defence and their agents should be moving further to the east as we speak... We believe it will take at least three hours until some other armies pass by there, again, on their search for us. The plan is quite simple: Each of our main attack forces will target one base, we will overwhelm their defenders and take them for our own. If we take only one... Then we'll be crushed once the others are manned again. But if we take all of them, even if their original garrisons come rushing back right away, we'll be able to drive them off. Additionally, should they attempt to lay siege on us and lock us in until they get reinforcements, we will have a fifth team ready, to strike them from their vulnerable rear just then. Then we will attack them from both sides and completely out-flank them... They will stand no chance, and should a great army really appear later, we will be long gone. I will be leading the first main attack team. Felicia, you will stand back at first and lead the backup army, in case we need to be rescued.\" \"Awwww, Vanessa...\" \"Just think of it that way; You'll be leading the biggest force, and also potentially the most important one. Should everything else go wrong, you'll be the one to bring us the glorious turnabout victory!\" \"Ah, alright then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa nodded as she stepped off her little podium and rose her fist. \"We have an army now... Time to finally free this country! For equality! For freedom! For LTFK!\" \"<b>FOR LTFK!!!</b>\" The crowd boomed, before quickly breaking apart and forming the five seperate armies. Vanessa exhaled heavily and then went to her army, with which she would attack the very first base. Felicia suddenly appeared next to her and pat her roughly on the shoulder. \"Cheer up, Vanessa! I just know you'll do this job no problemo! Heck, I'm just a bit pissed that I'll be waiting somewhere, with nothing to do!\" Vanessa let out a troubled laugh. \"Haha... I doubt that will happen. The SSS will send a bigger force, as soon as they realise their bases are in danger... And with that, the other armies will try to hold us in place... So, to be honest, I can guarantee to you that you'll get your action.\" \"Really? Ok, if you're so sure, then how about this... If you succeed with no problems and don't need my help, then you have to personally give me a foot massage.\" Felicia said with a smirk, wiggling her eyebrows twice with a sly grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Vanessa just laughed again in a strange, almost sad way. \"Oh, Felicia. If I could make sure we took over their bases just like that, then I'd gladly rub your feet any day of the week.\" Felicia attempted to say something, but found herself at a loss of words. Vanessa knew how her feet were! This had to mean that this mission would be seriously difficult. \"...Alright. Good luck to you.\" \"To you as well.\" Felicia managed to do an awkward half-hug with one arm, but Vanessa was already hurrying away. This mission meant business!</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa's group had soon arrived close to their destination, one of the smaller SSS bases located quite close to their hideout. The other parts had already split apart and were heading to their supposed bases, so they were already out of sight. Vanessa's people were shifting and pacing around anxiously as their leader was waiting for a short while... Vanessa was keeping an eye on the guard patrolling the bases rooftop. Usually, there would be more than just one woman up there, which was a good sign; they obviously didn't have enough women in there to defend it properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the guard on the top turned her back on Vanessa, she nodded and made a gesture that looked like someone pulling a train's emergency breaks. Immediatly, most of her people and Vanessa herself stormed around a corner and towards the building's main entrance, without making a sound. As the two guards standing next to the front gate noticed them, it was already too late! Vanessa came literally flying towards them, slamming both of them down to the ground by their throats with one hand each! After landing, Vanessa instantly jumped up again and charged again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe downed guards swiftly got overwhelmed by following LTFK members, and as some more SSS agents came out of the building because of the noise, they were almost instantly smashed out of the way by a roundhouse-kicking Vanessa! Some more agents came swarming out and threatened to surround Vanessa, but her allies had just managed to reach her again and where now covering her back. Some of the LTFK members managed to put up a good fight as well, but with Vanessa on their lead, there wasn't much for them to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe SSS in that building had been hit completely without warning and many of their agents where quite shocked to see so many enemies out of nowhere, creating a perfect opening for Vanessa and some of the more combat-skilled LTFK guys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe SSS defended the base stubbornly, but as Vanessa, followed by her small army finally breached the doors and ran straight inside towards the core, some of them began to flee, critically out-numbered and intimidated by Vanessa's fierce display of speed and skill. Vanessa herself managed not to take a single hit; She just kept evading attack after attack as she swam through groups of enemies, disabling and stunning many of them with lighting-quick attacks of her own and leaving the few remaining soldiers driven apart and shaken, ready for her followers to crush by sheer numbers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the SSS's infamous zeal and radical determination, all of their agents who were still able to run did so as Vanessa finally knocked out their commander in the main control room with an elegant spinning kick. Vanessa clenched her fist in triumph and yelled \"Victory! We won this battle, but the war has only yet started... Drive the remaining enemy out of this base, it needs to be completely clean before we can move on to the next phase!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer followers cheered shortly before heading out on their own. Vanessa nodded with a grim smile on her face; She knew that right now, she wouldn't even need to assist her people. They were practically frenzied with wild motivation and the enemy was already escaping in fright. It wasn't a tactical retreat either; most of them were in a blind panic, trying to get as far away from the demonic Vanessa as possible. With her allies cleaning the base for good, Vanessa quickly headed up to the top of the building, ascending several staircases with unreal speed. As she emerged on the top; She found a very startled agent there, the same one as she spied earlier. \"Ah! Wanted to keep out of the battle, I see?\" Vanessa said with a broad grin, cracking her knuckles as she walked closer to the last remaining guard. The guard backed away from her as far as possible, until she was standing right on the edge. \"I... I was ordered to hold my position, no... no matter what!\" She said, shaking. \"Well, it didn't make much difference in the end... This base is ours now! And soon enough, all your bases will belong to us!\" Vanessa said threatingly, moving her head to the guard's face until it was almost touching it. The guard cringed as Vanessa came this close, the air around her suddenly got warm and moist, and there was a very noticeable scent of sweat in the air. \"Now you're the last one we have to deal with!\" Vanessa said with a broad grin, staring intensely at the last agent, who was already scared shitless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" She yelled, throwing herself against Vanessa in a desperate attempt to drive her away, but Vanessa simply caught her in mid-air and sent her straight on her back. The agent wheezed as the impact knocked the air out of her lungs and in the very next instant, she saw Vanessa looming over herself, moving her foot into position. \"I think I'll just knock you out real quick and move you away later. This should do nicely... sweet dreams!\" Vanessa taunted as she kicked her shoe off, sending a cloud of hot, damp air over her prey's stunned face... Before bringing her entire, long foot, dripping with fresh sweat down on it! The agent shivered as she felt the wet, squishy impact of Vanessa's sweaty sole on her face! She tried to free it by moving her head around frantically, but Vanessa quickly dug her long, flexible toes into the agents hair, plastering the glistering moist sole of her foot directly and unmovingly over her nose. One sniff was enough to completely crush the agents resistance, allowing Vanessa to rub her entire foot over her face once, before another whiff, this time directly from in between her toes kocked her out for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa giggles as she stepped back, putting her battered old shoe back on. \"I guess I have at least one thing in common with those SSS lunatics... Knocking someone out using only your feet sure is great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Vanessa's heroic victory,  the other three bases didn't do a much better job at defending themselves against the angry hordes of pissed off rebels. Finally being able to let off some steam against the system under which they had suffered for so long was driving many of them into something like a trance, pushing forward and fighting without thinking once. Many of them performed much better than Vanessa, or more importantly, the SSS had thought a bunch of random civilians with only a few experienced fighters among them to ever perform. This, combined with their overwhelming advantage in numbers allowed them to seize victory with minimal loss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about just one hour, all of the four bases were in LTFK control, and Vanessa gathered her army once more, this time all four parts of them, forming a much bigger group then before, at least a thousand men strong. She nodded and smiled as she looked over her personal army... She was expecting the SSS's counter-attack, which was sure to follow, but with how well her people had performed just now, she was more than certain they would sieze victory once again! \"People of the LTFK, listen to me... Together, we managed to claim several of the enemies bases, not just in a single day, but in a matter of hours! You have all made me so proud.\" Vanessa made a brief pause and smiled as the crowd began pounding the air with their fists while cheering so loudly that the earth beneath their feet seemed to shake. \"At this rate, we will undoubtly win this war! But we must not relax even a little bit... Only with perfect focus and determination can we finally rid this country of its infestation of discrimination and injustice! So what do you think, my friends... Can we do it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa grinned as the army in front of her was downright screaming now, some of them clapping their hand and whistling, some of them stomping the ground in an effort to make even more noise. Vanessa half-closed her eyes and simply marvelled at that display of morale and loyalty. It was truly wonderful to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Vanessa had been right, at this very moment, a huge force of SSS agents and less-specialized soldiers of the state gathered at their main headquarters, marching off towards their hated enemy mere minutes later. Many of them grit their teeth in anger, spitting and yelling at the mere thought of a rebel daring to lift their hand against a SSS member in any way... Let alone outright attacking their bases! Their commanders preached some hate to them for only a short while, most of them were already in an angry frenzy! They began to move towards Vanessa like a force from the depths of hell; grim, threatening and filled with endless hate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe SSS obviously had the more skilled fighters and their numbers almost reached Vanessa's army in the field... However, they didn't suspect Felicia's group laying in wait all the time, waiting to strike them from behind once they turned their back on that direction. But would that action be enough to stop the enraged feminist force? The outcome of that battle was far from predictable! </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria paced up and down her room in the SSS headquarter, always checking the clock. It was 16:31, still almost an hour to go.. She didn't want to wait while the LTFK kept celebrating their \"victory\" as if they already had won this struggle. She wanted to wipe the priggish grin off their dirty rebel faces and hear their fearful, desperate, muffled screams under her merciless feet once the time had come. \"The LTFK idiots may think that the SSS was weak and that they have won, but they will get a nasty surprise!\", Maria excitedly thought to herself. \"In less than one hour, my masterplan to crush these insects will finally get going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had happened earlier this day really had been an object lesson in how events could start to come thick and fast. At first several emergency calls from other, smaller SSS-Bases had reached her, informing the headquarter about \"an unstoppable army of LTFK attackers, overrunning base after base\". This had been quite early in the noon and Maria had been dashed to the ground by these news. Thinking about how she would report this to Amber had been like drawing up her last will. \"If I will ever leave her office again, I will have to wear her sneakers as gas mask forever!\", she had panicked but then suddenly and unexpectedly the tide had turned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Officer!\", an obviously excited SSS-Agent from the interrogation department, had bolted in Maria's office. \"We are currently interrogating a man who was arrested two hours ago because he was walking around alone like a free person, without an owner far and wide. Well, after half an hour in the interrogation chamber he suddenly started to mumble incoherent stuff about the LTFK and a hidden base. It seems he is the first one we captured, who really knows something! The interrogation is still under the way, so do you want to attend it personally, Officer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertainly Maria had wanted! Full of hope to not stand in front of Amber empty-handed, she had followed the interrogation specialist down to the headquarter's basement in which the interrogation chambers were located. She actually had been down there for the first time and although she usually was so unpitying, she could feel the fear, loneliness and desperation coming out of the cold cells in the heavy air. Besides of the unmistakable smell of stinky, sweaty feet of course. When they finally had arrived in the right cell, Maria had seen the suspicious man secured on a lounger specially designed for the interrogations. Except Maria there had been three interrogators. The one who had brought her to the cell also had asked the questions. The other two interrogators had been there to create the necessary initiation for the man to talk. One had sat on the right of the secured subject, the other one on the left and whenever the man wasn't answering the interrogator's questions good enough, the left one had slammed her heel into the man's mouth to cut of his air flow through the mouth. Then, the right one had cupped her sweaty toes over the helpless man's nose causing him to scream muffledly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Officer\", the agent who had brought Maria to this scenery explained, \"we have to work very thoroughly and efficiently. You see that Randa here, who is responsible for the smelly part of the interrogation (she chuckled), wears one nylon sock and that the other foot is bare? This is because every subject reacts differently to all the kinds of footstench caused by the various possible materials of footwear. We found that this man reacts the most intense to sweaty bare and sweaty nylon feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria really had been impressed and almost felt a bit touched by the dedication her interrogators were displaying. Expectedly, it hadn't taken the interrogators long to break the man completely and so the words blustered out of his mouth. \"Ugh, *cough*..please, please mercy..I'll talk, I'll talk! My..*cough*..my name is Gus and before the feminist...errr I mean you took over Stenchlandia, I have been locksmith in a huge belowground textile factory. The factory was shut down during the revolution and since I am male, I wasn't allowed to do anything anymore. So I went with the LTFK and showed them the factory. They use it now as their main base, I promise!  If I show you where it is, will you let me go in another country maybe? I won't have anything to do with the LTFK anymore then..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words, as if the SSS would let itself in for a deal with a rebel <i>and</i> male, had made Maria furious. She had stepped in front of the lounger, removed her right boot and slammed her slender but wet with sweat sole on Gus' face (her balls shutting his mouth and her toes wiggling under his nostrils). \"What we do with you after you told us where this headquarter is located is of absolutely no relevance! But if you don't tell us what you know <i>right now</i>, you will enjoy my foot-aroma for a lot longer! Is that clear?!\" Gus had immediately \"hmpfed\" yes and so Maria had removed her foot again. After the location of the LTFK's main base had been finally cleared, Maria had laughingly denied the other agent's suggestion to start a career in the interrogation department and hastened to Amber's office. With these news there had been nothing to fear anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut sometimes it all adds up. These news hadn't been the only good news for the SSS today. Surprisingly Amber hadn't been alone in her office. Another unknown woman had been there as well and as Maria and Amber both had stated that there was good news, Amber had suggested Maria to report first. \"The day is getting better and better\", Amber had cheered and clapped with her hands after Maria had finished speaking. \"May I introduce you to Keyla? (Maria and the unknown woman, who apparently was called Keyla, had shaken hands) She was a member of the LTFK till recently, but she is back on track now. Would you please explain the story once again, Keyla?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeyla had nodded and turned to Maria. \"I have joined the LTFK about two months ago, because I was frustrated that the local administration rejected all my applications, although I just wanted to serve my country in a high position. I hoped that the LTFK would win the civil war and that I would finally receive a high position afterwards. However, I learned that they are just a bunch of liars and hypocrites. It's true that they treat men and women equal but I didn't know <i>how</i> equal. When I checked the bag of a man I found interesting, just to learn something about his character, I was arrested for invading other person's privacy! Since when do men have privacy?! Some others even called me a thief. That was when I opened my eyes again. I understood that the LTFK wasn't fair and wouldn't bring freedom and I remembered my rights as woman protected by the SSS. So when I finally was released, I went here as soon as possible to sincerely apologize, to bear any punishment I deserve and to offer my services.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She left out the best of the story\", Amber had added after Kayla's report. \"On her way to us, Kayla was able to eavesdrop on the LTFK's leaders and council from a side room. She knows the exact plan and strategy of the LTFK today! Although she was misguided once, everyone deserves a second chance and that's why I intend to accept her service. She will explain the LTFK's plans to you so you can lead our forces to a victorious surprise attack, Maria. Also make sure, that we occupy their headquarter of which we know the position now, thanks to your interrogation efforts...Ah, and one last thing! The French feminist group who made me the present of my footslave, sent us about one hundred of their elite fighters in order to help us with crushing the rebellion. They are also under your command now, so use them wisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had been completely overwhelmed by all these awesome news at first, then, after the first shock, she just had been excited, happy and filled with a grim anticipation. After Kayla had explained Maria the complete plan and strategy of the LTFK in her room, she had sent Kayla back to Amber so that Amber could start to induct Kayla into her new job as SSS-Agent.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was where Maria was now, pacing up and down her room and checking the clock over and over again. Once again she went her masterplan through in her mind. \"We will split ourselves into four groups. Three of the four groups will be rather small with about fifty agents each, while one group will be huge with all the rest we have. The one hundred French fighters will act separately since the only one of them who is able to understand us is their leader, which means that they will have to coordinate themselves in French. I really hope that these French fighters are called \"elite\" for a reason, because they will be sent to attack the LTFK directly in order to lure this Felicia out (I still have to settle an outstanding score with that bitch!). Then, While the French units march out, the huge group of SSS-Agents will quickly take the LTFK's almost unprotected main base. Once it has been cleared, they will support our French fighters by attacking the backstabber Felicia in the back. The three smaller groups will sneak to the bases captured by the LTFK and retake them. To maintain the power of surprise a little longer (and to see their stupid, puzzled scumfaces) every group except the French one will be in plain clothes. In their arrogance, these LTFK idiots will probably think we are cheering civilians who want to celebrate the LTFK's \"victory\". Well once again, they will get a nasty surprise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Maria had finished thinking everything through for good measure, she stopped pacing up and down her room. Confidently she squared her shoulders and clenched her fists. All doubts and worries were blown off and she felt ready for the fight. One last look at the clock set the hare running. \"Almost 17:30. Time to go!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cracking her knuckles, Maria ordered her personal group to follow her with a single handsign. She couldn't help but grin as the mass of elite agents and soldiers began moving out as a whole unit, wordlessly and without hesistating a second. Those rebels could never hope to prevail against such discipline! The commander of the french forces, a young but cruel looking woman with sharp facial features and a deathly cold glare in her eyes that even made Maria herself a tad nervous was looking at her expectantly now. Maria nodded and then spoke \"Yes. Move your liga du french girl fighters, or something, now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe french commander looked a tad indignant for a moment, but then simply nodded herself. \"Very well. <i>La ligue des partisans du f\u00e9minisme</i>, ready.\" Maria waited for a second, then added \"Yeah. Like I said. Go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the commander started to bark words at her followers which Maria couldn't possibly hope to understand. She had to admit though, her soldiers did look impressive in their sharp, blue uniforms, standing closely together and salutating. Much less than her own women right now, dressed in common garb, but still moving in a quite militaristic way... It wouldn't be a problem once they joined a larger group of civilians, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, all of the teams were heading to their planned destinations, the three smaller ones were out of sight quickly, seeking ways of reaching the recently lost bases without getting spotted by the enemy right away. Maria's personal army and the <i>partisans</i> were sticking more closely together, although her team would have to act fast once the French supporters would draw the LTFK out of their little nest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, they were doing a good job at appearing relatively subtle, despite their great number... Which was also because of the nearby army marching proudly in their regal blue, their color shining through the gray city like a lighthouse! Maria smiled and rubbed her hands as she watched the <i>partisans</i> from afar... Everything was going just as planned!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of marching briskly eastwards, the surroundings near the hidden entrance to the abandoned underground factory came into view. Without the detailed description that Maria had received only hours ago, she would have had no idea that any rebels could be lurking anywhere around here, save for a few small-time criminals that could sometimes be found hiding in bad parts of the city. But a massive, hidden, underground base? \"At least they were smart when they picked their new hideout... Hmmph. Well, it's not like that alone will save them. Listen up, women!\" Maria raised her voice a bit and turned around to see hundreds of determined faces of what appeared to be harmless civilians at first. \"We will now break apart and walk to the other side of this area... Under normal circumstances, we'd still look relatively suspicious despite our casual clothes, because of our large numbers. However! I doubt the LTFK scum will pay us a lot of attention with <i>this</i> marching straight towards their doors!\" With a proud grin, Maria pointed to the huge, gleaming blue squad of French females who were indeed walking directly to the hidden entrance. There was absolutely no way the enemy would overlook them. \"And once they come out to deal with our allies, we'll charge them from behind and absolutely <i><b>CRUSH</b></i> them between our two forces!\" Maria cried with a broad grin, pounding her fists together demonstratively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicia? Felicia? Where's our commander, I need to find Felicia right away!\" A panicked young man screamed, running through the corridors of the LTFK headquarters in a hurried rush. Felicia herself just so happened to step around a corner in that exact moment, and thus suddenly appeared in front of him. He screachingly came to a halt and saluted sharply. \"Hi there! Well, here I am, so what's the big news?\" Felicia said, squinting her eyes and laying her head to the side a bit. The guy in front of her didn't look too happy. Those better not be some bad news! \"I'm afraid I have bad news for you, commander!\" \"Damnit! I knew it! Ok, so what happened, tell me, tell me, tell me!\" Felicia said, gritting her teeth nervously. The plan had been to ambush the SSS's army, completely without being spottet! If that failed, Vanessa might be in trouble... And with that, their entire operation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's... there's a large group of soldiers marching straight towards us!\" \"What? Don't tell me the SSS-\" \"No! Not SSS. They have a very different kind of uniform... And they have only about one hundred soldiers, I'd bet... exclusively female though.\" Felicia squint her eyes and tapped her chin. \"Huh, seems like I have to get a bit creative, huh? Oh well... We should head out to meet them.\" \"But commander, we can't possibly let the headquarters unguarded!\" \"I know, dummy! What, do you think I would take all of our people just for... one hundred, or so enemies? No, no... This might be a trap. Maybe they aren't actually soldiers, or something...\" \"Uh, with all due respect, they do very much look-\" \"Well, I say we take about half of our men and walk directly at them. If they pose a legitime threat, this should be enough to deal with them. Or at least to buy us enough time to send the others as backup. And if the whole thing was just a lure, then the people who were waiting here can defend the place until the first group has rushed back here! And if the SSS has sent a seriously huge army, then we'll call for Vanessa's help; In that case they can't also attack her group in full force anyway, and with Vanessa charging them from one side and us defending this place, they will be out-flanked.\" Felicia concluded. \"B-Brilliant!\" The man sputtered, his eyes gleaming. \"Yes. Yes, thank you. Alright, let's move out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere minutes after that conversation, a sizeable army of LTFK members stormed out of their home base and towards the <i>partisans</i>. Maria was still laying in wait, watching suspiciously as the rebel army, outnumbering the French severely, threatened to smash into her allies and blow them from the battlefield. \"Commander! Our allies are about to get crushed by all those rebels! We ought to-\" A lively SSS agent shouted at Maria, but was quickly cut off. \"No... If my information is correct, then the LTFK has at least twice as many people... Which would mean one group is somewhere else, and my guess? They're hiding in their little hole, waiting for us to attack first and then outflank us just as we're planning to do with them. We will wait here and let the Frenchies play with their first group a little... Actually, this would be a nice chance to see how good they really are, don't you think?\" \"But... they will get beaten! What if  your information had been wrong and-\" \"Don't forget your position, soldier. Now go back to your position before I get impatient!\" Maria barked at the younger woman, making her jump a little in fear. \"Y-Yes, ma'am!\" She added with a quick salute and was gone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia had just reached the French group with her own and wasn't quite sure what to do for a moment. They certainly didn't look friendly, but Felicia wasn't really sure if they were enemies, either. Unfortunately for her, the French commander exploited this little pause of hers and suddenly ordered all of her girls to attack... And it was devastating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia's mouth hung agape as she watched the blue demonesses dish out impressive series attacks, not unlike the SSS, but still with some differences. Where the SSS used brute force and terrible power, these women were moving incredibly quick and gracefully. Unlike with the SSS, some of the LTFK members were still fighting after having suffered a few hits... But these soldiers were attacking so rapidly and unrelentingly that it almost didn't matter. Many of them also talked, or at least they mouths were making some sounds, because Felicia couldn't understand a word they were saying. Gritting her teeth as she saw her own troops getting knocked out like nothing, Felicia did what she usually did best: Leaping high into the air, she dove straight into a large group of enemies, aiming to take them all out quickly with her own masterful fighting skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, it didn't work so well. As usual, she was delivering quick and precise hits, but those soldiers were incredibly fast themselves! Felicia found it impossible to dodge all their attacks and hurriedly pulled back again after almost getting overwhelmed. Gasping in shock, she realised that the enemy had already decimated many of her own forces... A few of them were downed, too, but at this rate, her group would lose, even if she attacked the enemy more carefully from now on. So she did the only thing she could think off: She called for backup from the headquarters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Now, we move!\" Maria said triumphantly and jumped up as she saw another army of the LTFK come out of the headquarters and dashing towards the battlefield. \"Oh god! You... you were right... If you did what I suggested...\" A horrified young soldier to Maria's left stuttered, but Maria just laughed heartitly and pat her on the shoulder. \"Don't worry, that's why I am the commander here. Also, I might be able to overlook your minor insubordination if we can still win this... And if you offer me a nice foot rub after the battle, hehe!\" Maria said with a wink and laughed some more as the soldier's face paled. \"But enough talking! <i>Zeit, den Feind zu zerquetschen!</i>\" Maria shouted and lead the charge immediatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't looking good for the LTFK at all! As their second army appeared on the battlefield, the French forces were dramatically outnumbered for a moment, but the very next, Maria's massive force of SSS soldiers charged them from behind, just as planned, completely devastating their ranks!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felicia looked around in panic as she tried to look around and get a good view on the situation of the battlefield while also busying herself with several elite fighters at the same time. It simply didn't work out. She received hit after hit, and the worst part was that even though she tried to fall back a little and surround herself with her fighting allies, more and more of the LTFK troops were replaced with SSS soldiers attacking from the other side, which of course lost no time in attacking her as well! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could even attempt to think up a last ditch escape plan or anything of the sort, her group was completely swamped by the enemy, the few soldiers who were still standing tried to run away in blind fear or outright surrendered. The fact that they still lacked the morale and discipline of professional soldiers was now becoming painfully evident! Within seconds, Felicia was standing alone in a big circle of SSS and french troops, who stared at her aggressively but didn't attack yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr! You may have defeated me, but I'll take you all down before I fall! Arrgh!\" Felicia screamed, charging into the enemish mass with a flying kick, but even though she hit and knocked away her target, she was almost instantly thrown back. \"What's the matter? Want to wait for me to starve in your little ring here, huh?\" \"My, my... Aren't we impatient?\" Felicia gasped and turned her head as she heard those words, sharp, cold and radiating with seething anger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers made space to let someone through... at first, she didn't seem to familiar to Felicia, because of the casual clothes she was wearing right now, but as soon as she looked at her face... \"Ah, it's you! That SSS spy or something, you tried to sneak into our first base! Hehehe, and then I kicked your ass and you ran away like a scared kitten!\" Felicia taunted and had to grin as she saw Maria's face turn red with incredible rage. There was no way out for her now anyway, Felicia figured why not at least have a little fun before it all ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little imbecile! You got lucky once, yes, but now you will pay double the price! Arrgh, just for being the traitorous rebel that you are, you'd deserve the worst I can think up. I'll have to get really creative to find new ways to make you suffer, you can look forward to experience suffering you didn't even think to be POSSIBLE before!\" Maria walked a bit closer to her, then stood still while she cracked her knuckles loudly. \"Oh yes, this one is personal. Your beatdown has been long overdue!\" With a feral scream, Maria charged at her, even fiercer and more threatening than the first time Felicia had seen her in action! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia managed to jump to the side quickly, but as she tried to land a swift counter jab to Maria's side, Maria reacted <i>immediatly</i>, bashed Felicia's arm away like an insignificant insect and slammed directly into her shoulder-first, causing Felicia to tumble backwards and fall to the ground! Maria jumped up to start a powerful stomp to her downed opponent, but Felicia managed to roll away just in time! The impact of Maria's attack thundered like a bolt of lightning hitting a house and left a little crater in the ground, but she also had to regain her balance. That was only for about half a second, but that was enough for Felicia to jump up once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Felicia took the offensive, hoping to catch Maria somewhat off-guard: She bolted forward with unmatched speed and delivered some of her fastest punching combinations, aiming directly at Maria's head! But Maria had been quick as well: Instantly, her fists and lower arms appeared in front of her face, blocking and sucking up the force of Felicia's onslaught like a mighty stone cliff standing against a tidal wave. Just as Felicia tired a little and tried to jump back once again, Maria's hands suddenly moved, grabbing both of her own hands and pushing them away... Felicia thought of maybe countering that situation with a swift knee, but suddenly everything exloded into a ringing, blinding white mess as Maria's head shot directly at her, her forehead slamming directly into her face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria then let go of her, Felicia took a few unsteady steps backwards and then shook her head to clear it once more. \"Hehehe, good to see that you're still standing... I wish to knock you out with the smell of my feet alone... And I'm quite sure it will be more than enough to knock you out right now! But see for yourself!\" Maria walked to a stunned Felicia, grabbed her and attempted to push her to the ground, where she would finish her off for good with the foulest stench imaginable! However, somehow Felicia managed to weaken Maria's grip just for a moment, slapped her across the face and escaped with an overly high and long jump backwards. \"You slippery, goddamn rodent! This time, there is no escape, for any of us! Weaken her a little, girls... But make sure not to knock her out completely... That honor belongs to me alone, understood? Now GO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia's irises widened in fear as the silent, unmoving mass of enemy soldiers suddenly came into motion. Her last hope of at least achieving something this day, namely defeating her arch-enemy again, was completely shattered as numerous soldiers threw themselves on her at once, completely eliminating any possible escape! As they forced her to the ground and made sure she couldn't move, Felicia could only watch in terror as the enemies started to make efforts to remove their shoes and combat boots. Some women reached down with their hands, some moved one foot up at the time, some tried to rub and bash their feet together, but in the end, it all had the same effect; Their feet were freed. And thus, an incredible storm of combined footstench was released, centimetres from an directly in Felicia's poor face. Felicia retched as the waves of sour, cheesy foot aroma gathered around and seeped into her nose, even though she didn't even breathe in yet. Almost every girl there had feet which had been soaking in their own sweat for time and smelled like it, due to marching and fighting continouesly in tough, resistant footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was their combined strenght that made this situation so unbareable, the smell seemed to add up and get worse with every single foot, and there were many. Together, they created a thick, dense fog of warm, moist air, smelling even worse than Felicia's own feet, and it all piled up the most on the ground, where Felicia's head was also resting. And then, the feet came down. Bare, hot and covered with slimy sweat, they pushed into Felicia with their warm, soft soles, pinning her to the ground. There were feet of all kinds, some larger than others, some tanned and peachy and some milky white. But what they all shared was a smell. The typical, repulsive, sweaty stench of hot, unwashed feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, most of them had a rather unique note to them, as well. Some smelled more cheesy and dull, some very sharp and sour like vinegar and together, they created an unforgettable crescendo of united stench! One after one, all feet were bare now and on Felicia. Some girls stood next to her, with just one foot on her, while some others outright stood ON her, their weight making sure there would be no way for Felicia to move any part of her body. The vile sweat kept flowing in litres, soaking into Felicia's clothes and covering herself everywhere, a feeling that made her skin crawl. And of course, they targeted her face the closest, rubbing foot after foot straight across it as slowly as possible. At first, Felicia attempted not to smell directly through her nose, but then she took a full five toes diving straight into her opened mouth, denying her that option!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer instincts kept telling her to cover her face with her hands or move her head away, but with all those feet plasted over herself, the only thing she could do was watching foot after foot descend onto her face as smell the terrible aroma each of them brought! With every foot that was held into her face, releasing its pungent fragrance through deadly, wiggling toes, Felicia got weaker and weaker as she breathed the repulsive smell in. Just as everything seemed to start fading away, the woman on top of her finally left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia retched and spat as her mouth was finally free of feet and she gasped in horror as she looked down on herself: She had sweaty imprints of footsoles all over her clothes and even with the feet away now, her whole body stunk terribly of them. But then, it got even worse as Maria came up to her again and started to take off her shoes. \"Well, now that you had a nice appetizer, time for the main menu!\" Maria's incredibly big, long and well-shaped feet were presented to Felicia, who grunted in pain as she tried to jump away from them... But her body just wouldn't move. \"Remember when you tried this, and failed? This is how you do it... enjoy!\" Maria said with a grin, as she forced the long, thick toes of her left foot into Felicia's mouth, easily filling it completely and overwhelming her sense of taste with the strong aroma. The ridiculous amount of sweat steadily dripping from them wasn't making things easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, the toes from her right foot swiftly went into Felicia's face and cupped over her nose, entrenching it in the deepest depths of foot-hell. Felicia had thought her own feet to be the smelliest. Right now, she learned just how wrong she had been. Maria's feet were unlike anything she had ever smelled before! The smell was still very much the smell of feet, but it came with such an intensity and thickness that it seemed to affect her brain directly, as through a sixth sense. After just a few breathes, Felicia was completely knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria rose with a sigh and put her shoes back on, smiling as she looked around and saw her own soldiers having backed away as well. \"So... that's that. Tie her up real good... We're taking her with us... She has to know something, and I <i>will</i> make her talk. And now... Let's finish the rest of the LTFK!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a last look back to the SSS group who was tying Felicia's limp body up for good, Maria once again gathered her troops around her. It was time to move onwards! The French Elite Squad had done its job great, she had to admit, and now they deserved a break. The rest of her fellow SSS members were enough to crush the rest of the LTFK anyways. \"Okay ladies. Our mission has been a great success so far. But it is not the time to celebrate yet. We still need to finish off the rest which camps in our old bases. After that no one will ever challenge our feminist claim again!\" Maria had to cut the outbreaking jubilation with some harsh gestures in order to be able to continue speaking. \"While the fight here was still going on, I received some radio messages from the smaller squads. Two of the three bases are already reoccupied but the third is still hard-fought. This is where we will leave for. Let's go, ladies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe march to the aforesaid base wasn't disturbed in any way and therefore didn't take too long. The streets were dead, and it seemed as if the whole city was. No one stood in the windows and a deathful silence lay over the scenery. After a while this silence became so burdensome, that Maria began to ask herself if this mission was actually real or if everything had been a dream. Finally, about three blocks away from the contested base, the now audible battlesounds, cries of pain and desperation as well as the morale slogans of both fighting parties brought life back. \"Where there\", Maria hissed to her troops, \"and it seems our companions could use some help! Since we heavily outnumber the enemy, I'll let you just charge however your want, but fight intelligently! Check the situation first and then do helpful things instead of playing the rambo, okay? Everyone who gets knocked out will suffer my..lets say..disappointment afterwards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, chiefess!\" hundreds of female throats screamed before the lines of her units began to dissolve just to hardily rush towards the fighting. Maria followed afterwards. She hated to admit  it, but the short fight against Felicia had been a bit of a challenge at least and she was too exhausted and bugged to fight at the front line again. When she arrived at the plaza in front of the base, she saw that the SSS was already controlling the plaza as well as the garden behind the base. The rests of the LTFK were helplessly surrounded and tried their best to defend the entrance. <i>\"They are trapped like mice in a cage!\"</i>, Maria contentedly thought to herself. \"It will only be a matter of time until we get them.\" Besides the fighting SSS members, there were some agents establishing two provisional camps on the right and on the left of the plaza. One obviously was for the knocked out or injured agents, while the other one seemed to be something like an arrest camp for captured LTFK members. Maria saw how four SSS-Agents pulled a bridling man towards the implied camp. He fought back with all his strength until one of the agents exasperatedly barked an order. Then two of the four agents held the man's struggling body still, while the commanding agents slipped out of her boots and took off her socks. Next, the third agent punched the man in the belly and when he opened his mouth to gasp, the commanding agent brutally shoved her socks in and brought one of her feet close to his nose. The rebel winced and whimpered but the foot was kept firmly in place until his body stopped to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching this, Maria smirked and once again was filled with pride considering the repartee of her troops. She helped to clear the plaza and garden completely, catching fleeing rebel after fleeing rebel always making sure to knock them out properly. One time, she even shoved her left foot so deeply into some LTFK scumbag's mouth, while pressing the other one on his nose, that she could hear his jaw crackle. However, regarding his terrified eyes, which were already glassily staring in the nowhere, Maria doubted that he still felt the pain. After the whole surrounding of the base was cleared, Maria visited the camp of injured SSS-Agents to buoy them up a bit. Normally being excessively nice wasn't her thing, but the constant foot torturing she had been able to perform brought her new cheerfulness. Also she wanted to explain everyone her plan on how to retake the base without any further injuries on her side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the base, Vanessa was getting more and more desperate. Everything had went to hell so fast. Yesterday it had seemed that the LTFK won the rebellion and now? Now all she could see in front of her was her inevitably approaching defeat. Everyone of her men around the base was knocked out and arrested and she was left with the last 30 men and women, giving their best to hold the entrance against the outnumbering enemies. Should she maybe wave the white flag? No, this wouldn't change anything. The SSS would still knock out, arrest and torture everyone of her helpers. What if she took one of the pistols she had found in a small storage inside this base and for fucks sake made her worthless life an end? The thought sounded sweet to her, but when she took one of the pistols and began to load it, she already felt that she hadn't got the guts to shoot herself. No, this was not the way. This would end after a chanceless fight, but at least after a fight. Vanessa was about to stand up and order the troops she had left to prepare a final charge, when suddenly one of her officers tugged at her sleeve. \"Vanessa, we found something interesting. There is a hidden door in the basement, we didn't notice at first. The door covers a small staircase leading further down. Once you arrived on the ground, you find yourself in a huge system of corridors. I think we found the catacombs. This is our chance to escape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis message excited Vanessa and she felt how new hope rose inside her chest. \"But do we know the way out again? What if we get lost and never find our way back?\" The officer impatiently shifted from one foot to another. \"Yeah that's right but listen. This is our only chance! We can stay here, fight and will surely be arrested. Or we use the only slight chance we have to get out of this mess and maybe get lost. I personally would take this risk rather than to lose for sure. But it's of course your decision.\" Vanessa nodded. \"Alright then, you convinced me. Let's go!\" The officer made an unhappy face. \"It's not so easy, Vanessa. If we all just magically disappear now, the SSS will notice it and probably guess what we have done. They have maps of the tunnel systems and will positionate agents at all possible exits. We need to win time and can't afford losing time. You'll have to let some of your men and women here.\" Although Vanessa hated it, she saw that her officer was right. Fortunately it wasn't hard to find twenty volunteers who would sacrifice themselves and stay. Affectedly, Vanessa, her officers and some other LTFK members rushed in the basement, down the hidden stairway and towards an uncertain future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\", Maria said, \"that's my plan. I don't want to lose any other agents and with lose I mean knocked out, injured or even just branded with a new mark. These LTFK idiots want to camp in our base? Well let them camp then, I say. Why should we risk more than we need by rushing the entrance, when we can adopt way more effective methods? I spoke with the equipment manager and organized a brandnew ST1NK-Machine! We will smoke these rebels out, or better said, our feet will! For them, it will be very uncomfortable to breath in our little biochemical weapon and soon enough they will be all knocked out inside their hideout. For us it will just be pressing a button and waiting for five minutes. Then we can retake our base without further struggle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan was concordantly approved by everyone and so the SSS installed the ST1NK-Machine on the backside of the base. The machine itself consisted out of one one meter wide and long with an opening above. Furthermore it covered a large auger and a flexible tube. Once installed on the wall of the base's backside, the auger almost silently drilled a hole in the wall. Then the flexible tube which just fitted in perfectly was inserted in the whole and fixed there. Next, the equipment manager opened the opening above and every possible SSS-Agent threw his well-worn socks or nylons in. When the box was literally brimful, it was closed again and Maria pushed the button to activate this terrible machine. With a high pitched buzzing sound the system began to work and the ST1NK-Machine began to constantly pump the foul footstench gases in a \"stench-intensifier-tool\" and then through the flexible tube inside the base. After one minute the first coughing and gagging sounds were coming out of the building, only a bit later even cries of agony. It didn't take very long and everything went quiet again. Maria then shut the machine down and said: \"Now the victory really is ours! Well-fought, ladies. This is a great day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo herself she thought about all the good stuff she was in for now. Amber would surely have to promote her for this accomplishment. The end of the rebellion also meant that she would have a lot more freetime again. And most importantly: She would get to make that bitch Felicia sing some songs about the LTFK and the rebellion itself!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria striked a heroic pose as she watched some of her own agents casually getting out and putting on some gasmasks before they entered the now smoked-out base, to gather the KO'd rebels from the inside. Maria chuckled as she almost felt a bit bad for the women who would have to be stationed in this base in the near future... Using the ST1NK-Machine on a building usually resulted in making every room smell like the inside of her boots for at least a week... And that was considered they opened absolutely every door and window, for the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smirked again as she slowly turned around... She herself wouldn't have that problem; She would simply return to her place in the SSS headquarters, in the central district. And she wouldn't go there alone. Maria licked her lips in anticipation as she looked at Felicia, who was lying on the ground close to her. Maria had ordered some of her closer agents to carry Felicia around, right behind her all the time... She would never let her out of her sight again. Right now, Felicia was blindfolded, gagged, and all of her limbs were tied to her body tightly with multiple ropes... Maria wasn't sure if she was still sleeping, but even a girl of <i>her</i> skill and agility couldn't break those binds. And even if she could, against all odds... Maria would knock her right back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria then soon decided to start walking back to the HQ, after having appointed another high-ranked SSS member as the base's commander. She specifically denied having herself brought there by car, or helicopter. Even though her feet have had their fair share of sweating for one day, she wanted Felicia to experience only the <i>best</i> results her feet were capable of... And a long march would be just the right thing for that! Maria also took a few agents with her, who took turns in carrying the immobile Felicia... Even now, Maria wouldn't give her any chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as it turned out, it was an even longer walk than Maria had remembered it from before... \"Damn... must be the exhaustion from all that fighting...\" she sighed as she ran the back of her hand across her forehead, wiping away sweat that was rapidily re-appearing. It was late afternoon now and the lowering sun kept blasting he lands beneath with terrible heat. Maria's feet soon heated up as well, they felt a tad itchy and sore at times and as Maria clenched and flexed her hidden toes a few times, she felt the pressure of liquid everywhere as her toes sloshed through a seemingly endless lake of pure sweat. Usually, the sweat would help cool her feet down, at least a little, but right now, not only her big feet themselves, but the sweat also were feverishly hot, which of corse made them pump out even more sweat instinctively... Maria laughed deeply as even she herself dared not to imagine what inhuman stench her heated feet would unleash now, if she released them from their ungodly prison... But Felicia would have to find it out for her, even if she most likely wouldn't be able to speak properly for quite some time directly afterwards... Oh yes, if Felicia knew anything, and of that Maria was sure, then she would get her to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for several more minutes, Maria and her team finally reached their destination... The few agents she had taken with her were completely exhausted and ready to collapse, despite being experienced veterans... And Maria herself wasn't feeling much better. But her mood rapidly rose as she entered the building... Many agents looked at her in awe as she strode by, followed by her soldiers who carried Felicia... Most of them knew who Maria was and what her latest task had been...  Her returning now could only mean one thing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have come back... I presume your mission was a success, then? The LTFK...\" A strong, commanding voice inquired and Maria turned her head and saluted with a grin as she saw Amber walking towards her. \"...is no more. One of their two leaders is this girl right behind me...\" Maria said, pointing to the tied-down Felicia \"And the other one was in their last remaining base, together with the rest of her pathetic group... Well, they were still in there when we activated the ST1NK-machine!\" \"Ooh, excellent choice! One full load, I presume?\" \"Yes, I had it filled to the brim with the socks and nylons of every agent who happened to be wearing any... At some point, it was overflowing a bit, even.\" \"Magnificent. In that case, there is absolutely no way anyone could survive that sort of stench without protective gear!\" Maria nodded smugly. \"Exactly. And even if some of them found a few masks in there, I had the majority of my force storm and seek out the place as well, just to be extra sure. Nobody could take them on alone, not even that blasted Vanessa... As soon as my teams are finished with gathering the knocked out bodies from that place, both of the LTFK leaders will be ours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber has listened intensely and nodded a few times as Maria had spoken. Now, she finally dropped her serious face and laughed loudly as she smacked Maria on the shoulder. \"Beautifully done, my dear Maria... Yes, that mission was a complete success! As soon as Vanessa is here as well, it will be 100% perfect. I knew you would do it. We may have lost hold of a few bases for just some hours, but in the end, the biggest threat our glorious nation has faced so far was smashed down, and with minimal losses too, as I've just heard. I'm proud of you, girl. Seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had to control herself not to blush or start giggling like a girl. She was used to receive praise like that from many people, but to hear them from Amber's mouth meant something else. Maria knew that Amber would also keep rewarding her if she did good work... Amber was incredibly strict and her expectations were very high... And if someone failed to meet them, Amber would get really cruel and nasty quickly. But if someone actually managed to do everything Amber ordered, then she was suddenly benevolent and kind... At least until the next mission came in, which usually happened very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nevertheless, Maria grinned as she could practically see her next promotion coming up... and maybe even something else! She remembered how she asked Amber for a personal slave not too long ago... This just might be here chance! And if she could keep Felicia specifically... oh, it would be the most perfect thing! And then another thing came into Maria's mind as she tapped one foot and heard the loud, squishy noise from the inside. \"Oh yes. I thought it might be a good idea to interrogate this one, Felicia right away. The LTFK is gone, but we need to find out how exactly it formed and rose to such power, unnoticed to us... So we can make sure the same thing will never happen again! As of why I want to do it right now... It will be both very effective and-\" Maria stomped down, creating a very loud, wet, slapping sound, which was clearly audible to Amber as well. Amber smiled diabolically as she understood just too well where Maria was going with this. \"-incredibly satisfying. After all, personal satisfaction is also important every once in a while, wouldn't you agree?\" \"Hahaha, oh yes. Very well! Go ahead, do to her whatever you want and don't forget to tell me everything she said... Although it might also happen that I come up with some different questions later and thus <i>unfortunately</i> have to question her myself, hehehe.\" \"Understood! I will try not to completely destroy her with the smell of my feet, although I make no promises...\" Maria saluted again. \"I'll be in my office for that... should anyone decide to disturb me during that session... Well, they would probably pay the price just by smelling the air in the room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Maria went towards her office, which thankfully wasn't too far away, as she was now hauling Felicia by herself. \"Damn... she's such a light and nimble girl, but when you carry her, she's heavy... Damn, how I will make her pay!\" Maria grumbled as she opened the door and let Felicia slide to the ground. Maria closed the door slowly while starting to laugh deeply, rubbing her hands together... She had been waiting so long for what was about to happen!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felicia whimpered quietly as her body hit the floor. At first, she didn't even realise where she was or what has happened... She couldn't see anything and even worse, couldn't move her arms or legs at all... Something was painfully holding all her limbs together... And then she remembered! The battle, the defeat, the suffering and humaliation beneath those agent's feet, followed by a very short sensation of experiencing that Maria's feet - then, everything stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... So you were still asleep all the time, after all! Hehehe, good that you wake up just now... Because I have some questions for you.\" A harsh, loud voice suddenly rang out. Felicia's body shivered and she felt a chill going down her spine as she remembered that voice... It was the voice she had heard just before getting knocked out. The very next second, the blindfold was yanked from her head, as well as the fabric from her mouth which had served as a gag. Yes, this was definitely the same woman who had put her into this terrible situation! \"M...Maria!\" Felicia gasped weakly as her mouth came free, she had tried to sound angry and menacing, but it only came out weak and pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! That's me!\" Maria responded with a fat grin, before getting down in front of Felicia, who was still lying on the floor, completely unable to get up or move in any way. \"You know, it wasn't very nice of you to go to sleep so quickly, just after I started to make you smell my feet. Remember when I smelled yours? Hah, of course you can't compare the lowly stink of your little rebel hooves to the lordly and superior stench of my divine goddess feet... Pffffhhaha\" Maria stiffled a laugh as she couldn't say that with a straight face. But it didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyhow... I smelled yours. You owe me one by not smelling mine. Plus the fact that you need to be punished in some way, not to forget that. I mean, you are an enemy of the state, after all. And, I also need a method to get you to talk. So all in all, I'm doing you a huge favour by combining all those things into one! Hehe... I'm not saying this will be the last time you smell my feet, though...\" Maria suddenly bolted forward and moved her face so close to Felicia's that their skins were almost touching. \"If all goes right... Then you will be my slave. You will be <i>mine</i>. Your futile dreams of misguided freedom forever crushed under my reeking soles!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria retracted a bit once again. \"Well, but let's not waste any more time...\" With that, she swung both of her feet, still in boots, towards Felicia's head, resting them just next to them. Felicia gasped as the strong smell of sweaty, unwashed feet suddenly became present! \"They are... they are smelling <i>through</i> those thick boots?\" Felicia uttered dumbfounded, at which Maria just laughed. \"Hahaha, just wait until you smell them for good! You haven't smelled <i>anything</i> yet! Oh... but I guess I should at least ask you the question before I question you, don't I?\" Felicia looked at her skeptically and tried to rub her wrists together, or lift her legs just a little bit. It was hopeless. \"Well... What do you want to know, anyway?\" She finally said, hoping that she could somehow avoid the worst... Even though a deep part in her somehow knew that she couldn't avoid this by herself, not in that situation. And who would come to her aid now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm supposed to ask the questions! Anyway, the LTFK is pretty much destroyed, but how did it manage to rise to such power? How could you remain hidden for so long? Where exactly did you find your followers, and how did you recruit them? I want details!\" Felicia's face became pale as she heard those questions. She had no idea. Unfortunately for her, she did not only join the LTFK pretty late after they had been founded anyway, but she had also never had much interest in bigger schemes and grand plans, at least before that thing with the bases recently. What was she supposed to tell her? \"I... I don't know.\" \"Ahhh, the textbook wrong answer! It's not like I needed an excuse to make you suffer, here in my own four walls, but thanks for being cooperative, anyway! Oh... and one last thing...\" Maria said, pointing in the air a few times as she got up again, and walked to a drawer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, my feet have been fermenting and cooking the perfect brew of devastating footstench for quite some time in these boots... The initial shockwave as I pull those boots off will be... epic, to say the least. So, I will have to make sure you won't miss <i>any</i> of it... Let's see here... Hmm... <i><b>YESSS...</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia looked around worriedly as she heard Maria take something out of the drawer, but couldn't quite make out what that object was. As Maria came back to her and sat down again, she held it right over her head whilst grinning though, making it very obvious: It was a plain, regular roll of duct-tape. Felicia squint her eyes as she saw that dreaded thing. She hated it! Maria did not waste any more time and simply removed a generously large strip of duct tape which she cut with the sharp edge of her right thumb, and then placed it directly over Felicia's hapless lips. It was obvious to Felicia that she couldn't open them now, but she still tried... But nope, nothing. The duct tape was holding her lips firmly together like an iron lock. There was no way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, Maria readied her feet into position... and now, she did not waste any words! Pulling on her boots with both hands, the long, shiny black leather pieces of footwear came off with a sickeningly loud, wet plop! Maria's bare feet sprung forth in all their glory, darting directly towards Felicia's face and and stopping centimetres from it. A brutal wave of incredibly moist and hot air was sent blasting through the entire space of the relatively small office room and it even hit Maria herself hard: Her feet stunk. And Maria knew how her feet usually smelled. It was so much, much worse right now; The intense, cheesy sensation of well-aged salty sweat combined with the leathery bite of the insides of well-worn boots was rounded to perfection with the sharp, piercing bite of vinegary sourness, that only Maria's feet managed to craft into perfection. All in all, it was a satanic masterpiece, perfect in its ways to torment any human nose endlessly! And despite how much Maria herself suffered as she smelled her feet... it was <i>nothing</i> compared to what Felicia had to go through!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia had had no ways of escaping the smell. The demonic, brutal feet of Maria were floating there, directly in front of her nose, literally running with sweat and radiating heat like a coal oven. And then, there was the stench. With her lips sealed, Felicia had to breathe through her nose. Which mean <i>sniffing</i> the worst feet in her entire life, aged to perfection in their sweaty confines for many hours and assaulting all of her senses with endless, pure stench! Felicia's whole body started to twitch and shake spastically as she was forced to inhale the stink... And with every desperate sniff, there came more and more. Felicia was soon driven into a state of blind panic, but the more her mind told her to get away from those terrible, stinking things, the more her breathing intensified and quickened, forcing her to breathe in even more of Maria's wicked foot odour!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was driving Felicia utterly crazy! It was so intensive that it seemed to surpass the mere sense of smell; It seemed to fill the entire body of Felicia and torment her through every last fibre of her own self! Her nostrils ached, her lungs burned, but the pained breathing just went on and on as she simply had no other option. \"Yes... This is what you deserve... Experience my feet in their purest form, lowly vermin. The essence of your worthless self, preaching endlessly of wrong, blasphemous heresy shall be burned into pure nothingness by the divine justice my feet's aroma!\" Maria started to laugh like crazy as she decided to stay silent for a while and simply watched Felicia suffering!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as Felicia's body twitched and shook with every sniff, her nostrils flaring in offendance as they were forced to carry endless amounts of cheesy foot-reek directly into Felicia's lungs and all into her system. Felicia also made coughing and gagging sounds, and at times, it seemed as she tried to say or yell something, desperately. But the tape over her mouth surpressed those foolish ideas completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smiled as she finally let her heavy, wet feet drop of Felicia's face for good, making a slapping impact that sprayed warm sweat everywhere, the soft, smooth skin of her soles getting into contact with the skin of Felicia's face, and irritating it with waves and waves of salty sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, Felicia was amazed at just how big and powerful Maria's feet were. They seemed everlasting; covering her entire face with no effort, her long, strong toes kneading into her hair and making them stick with sweat as her heels were still way beneath her chin, at her throat. Worst thing, right under her troubled nose was the rounded, sweaty ball of Maria's foot, the second most stinky part of her feet, and as its skin pressed directly onto Felicia's nose, her pained sniffs delivered even more stench per breath into her body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia was nearing unconsciousness! She had experienced getting knocked out by feet before... It wasn't pleasant. Everything faded to black, safe for the thick, warm, moist feeling of oppresive walls of foot flesh smothing her face and of course the cheesy, sour stench of litres of sweat stuck to said feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Maria finished her off! Placing her long, slimy toes over her nostrils, Maria was forcing the most smelly part of her feet directly onto the most vulnerable part of Felicia's nose. Her muffled screams of horror were heart wrenching as she sniffed those wet, hot toes directly! Everything started to slowly fade to black and spin around as the endless waves of reeking foot aroma overtook everything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then... With a final, pained groan, Felicia was knocked out again, and it was finally over for her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa cursed silently as she hurried through a series of long, narrow and dark tunnels, supposedly leading out of the base which was doomed to become everybody else's deathtrap and somewhere relatively safe. Vanessa was feeling like a lowly traitor, leaving her loyal allies behind and at the mercy of hundereds of feet... Yes, she had heard what the SSS likes to do with captured enemies, and those things made even a regular interrogation seem like a walk in the park. As Vanessa had heard some horrified, muffled screams of agony and despair when the building behind her had been flushed with devastating S.T.I.N.K. gas, she felt as if her heart had been impaled by a knight's lance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet she fought on, driven only by the distant hope of somehow gathering another force... And even bigger, stronger one and with that she would save and free all those who had served her so selflessly before... Of course, the regular population as well, but especially her allies. Right now, everything seemed to be lost but Vanessa stubbornly clinged on to that final, best hope she still had, because it was the only thing she could do right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally and after hurrying through that wicked tunnel system, Vanessa emerged on the other side, blinded by the bright rays of the sun. She looked back for a brief moment, at the monstrous, imposing skyline of the city's buildings. \"I'm sure you could be such a beautiful place... if only <i>those</i> hadn't turned everything to shit. But just you wait... I will liberate you yet! I will do <i>whatever</i> it takes!\" Vanessa spoke to the unresponding city, threatening it with her fist a bit before turning around and running away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, Vanessa was already very much in the outskirts of the city and thankfully for her, this would mean less police presence. Vanessa was sure that as soon as the SSS would search her base... and NOT find her unconscious body, that the entire land would start a manhunt on her, right away! Vanessa smirked as all the intense studying of Stenchlandia's maps finally paid off: She knew that a few miles ahead, there would be a national park. Even before Stenchlandia had formed, the former country's border on this side has always been going somewhere through that gigantic, forest-ish wildland. And they never bothered to change that as they generally cared little about places without economic or strategical value. Sending their troups through the thick vegetation would be pointless and counter-productive and even though Vanessa figured they could have just chop down all the trees and build factories there or something, Stenchlandia seemed to have some respect for the wildlife there, still. As a result, the park area was largely ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's plan was settled: She would escape Stenchlandia entirely, go to another country and... somehow convince them to fight in her cause. Escaping through the park was not unheard of; In fact it happened quite often that anyone disagreeing with the state's ideas tried to cross it in order to achieve freedom. Because of that, there were usually some troops stationed there who watched the entire region, since it has hard to tell the exact line of the border from outside the forest. However, Vanessa knew that the SSS had gathered all available troops on their assault on that very base, so she figured they had called back those watching the park as well. Maybe allowing a few regular civilians to flee wasn't that high a price if it meant to help crushing a true rebellion. Allowing the rebellion's leader to flee was an entirely different thing, of course, so Vanessa could only pray that they hadn't already sent something after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's escape went really well, after continuously running for some time, she had finally reached the park and was soon swallowed by a thick mass of vegetation, trees in all forms and sizes and various high bushes and ferns. Vanessa's initial worries were confirmed quite soon after: She heard the unmistakable noise of a flying helicopter over herself, going away and coming back a few times. Vanessa's grinned when she imagined how frustrated the agents in the vehicle must have felt; from above, all you could see was a huge, green carpet. Sometimes, there were a few holes in the green ceiling of branches and leaves, but Vanessa avoided these without problems. She still hurried up again though, just to be safe, in the case of foot soldiers also following her on the direct path. Vanessa ran and ran and it was slowly but surely getting darker and darker. Finally, she reached a huge fence, which was unmistakably the state's border. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... it seems to be at least three metres high and there's rolls of barbed wire up there, as well... Climbing is no option, but you hear about people getting through all the time - Ha Hah!\" Vanessa didn't have to look for very long; after walking up the fence for a short while, she came to a spot where the fence was viciously bent in many places and had a few large openings cut into it. Slipping through effortlessly, Vanessa beamed and threw her fist up in the air. With all that had gone wrong recently, that almost felt <i>too</i> easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe there was a real chance for her goal after all, what she would have to do now was getting out of the woods once more and finding some signs of civilisation again... Of the neighbour country! If all went well... This really could turn things around once more!</span></div></div>",

But now she wasn't in Stenchlandia anymore. Now she was safe... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly after she had crossed the border, she had met a patrol of border guards. Fortunately they had belonged to the neighboring country and not to Stenchlandia, else her little journey wouldn't have lasted all too long. After Vanessa had been able to appease the first mistrust of the guards with stating that she was a refugee, they had escorted her to the next border guard base. There she had been able to tell her whole story, which, to her own surprise, the guards had believed instantly. When she had finished talking, one guard dutifully presented her a form Vanessa (as refugee) had to fill out in order to be allowed to stay. Of course she hadn't hesitated a second and therefore she was officially welcomed in the \"Free Republic of Equmria\". The country was the eastern neighboring country of Stenchlandia and actually was a Union of the ancient Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltic States.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile some of the border guards had taken Vanessa in a truck and driven her to a refugee camp in the nearby capital of Equmria, they had explained to her that this union had been formed during the time, when Europe was shocked by massive feminist revolutions everywhere. The citizens of Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltic States had been some of the few who had refused to accept this social change. Vanessa had interestedly listened to the story and thought to herself: <i>\"That is valuable knowledge. It seems that here, the majority is against what is going on in Stenchlandia. Maybe I can use this for my aims. I know that I can't just gather some civilians and cross the border once again, but maybe, when I am able to talk with a representative of the government here, I can convince them to take actions..\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when she had arrived in the refugee camp, she had been forced to forget all her plans for a while. Instead she had been buy to register herself, to organize a tent and some goods and to find a place where she could pitch her tent. In fact she had almost given up to ever get a chance to speak with a representative of the Equmrian government and had been halfway ok with her new life, when one day things had turned to good account again. Unexpectedly Vanessa had been visited by a member of Parliament who wanted to interview her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name is Vanessa right?\", he had begun, \"Do you know that you are famous?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had bashfully smiled and answered: \"No, not really. I mean I have fought for freedom in Stenchlandia but I didn't know I was famous here in Equmria. Also, after my cause failed, I was sure that the people would forget me sooner or later..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis answer had made Vanessa's interviewer laugh. \"Hahaha, oh really? Maybe this would have been the case, if their agents would have caught you. But now our account executives in Stenchlandia, and yes we do have some, report that basically everywhere, in every street, in every train, in schools, in bars, just everywhere are wanted posters with your name on them. And we also noticed that with you crossing the border, all the rumours about you and your abilities crossed the border as well. That is why I came to interview you a bit. We could really need any information about Stenchlandia we can get. By the way, did you really escape all alone? I mean that's impressive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa had shaken her head. \"No I didn't escape alone. I had some close friends and fellow LTFK members with me, but after we had successfully passed the catacombs, we decided to split up. We knew that the SSS would pull out all the stops to find us, dead or alive, and if we would have stayed a group they would have found us way easier. Also I think that they understood very soon how we escaped the house we were trapped in, and after they followed us through the catacombs they found many different traces leading in different directions. To sum it up, it was a hard choice to leave each other behind and to go through hell all alone but it was the best we could do in this very moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe member of Parliament had approvingly whistled. \"That indeed is a story deserving my respect. I hope that your friends made it on their own. We all hope that I guess. You might check the refugee camp from time to time, maybe you're lucky and someone you know crossed the border like you. Oh and I just noticed that I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Lysander and as you know I am a member of the Equmrian Parliament. One day, already too long ago, I crossed the border like you and left family behind. I don't know why I tell you this, but I somehow feel that you deserve to know.. I actually have a certain respect for everyone living in such conditions as in Stenchlandia without giving up and without adapting to their inhumane ways. Many of those who fought and after the fight was pointless came over here to help making Equmria a better place than Stenchlandia are now the most important buttresses of our society! My personal assistant and friend Joe came here the same way. He is still pretty young, just fourteen years old by now and yet he is so strong. He never gives up. He is barely a child anymore and trains himself in several fighting techniques. Also he has made friends in the army who are teaching him to shoot. To be honest, in his young age he is one of my idols. You should definitely meet him some day soon. But I think I've got to go now, thanks for the interview.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\", Vanessa had answered. \"Lysander..I...I..really appreciate that you told me all this, but please..we can't let the people living in Stenchlandia down! We have to help them, change the ways! There must be something we can do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander had turned around after hearing these words. His eyes had glanced and the corner of his mouth had twitched. \"I share your opinion..but I am only a member of Parliament. Then again (he had started to grin saying this) I am known for my charisma and my speeches are famous for being thrilling and convincing. I'll see what I can do.. Also I will see if we find an apartment for you. You might be valuable for us, and valuable persons like you shouldn't live in such poor conditions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories of her successful escape and the new hope Lysander's appearance had given her always made Vanessa happy in the morning. <i>\"Aaaaaah this bed is really the best thing about my new apartment. Or is it the refrigerator always brimful with all kind of tasty things?\"</i>, she thought to herself when finally getting up. She took a shower, put on some fresh clothes and did what she did every morning. She visited the refugee camp, always hoping to see some of her old mates. Today it seemed that she would be disappointed, like all the times before but then suddenly..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"July!\", she shouted happily and ran towards the other woman who was noticeably overwhelmed by emotions. \"Vanessa!\", she cried and sobbed. \"You made it, oh thank god you made it! I already feared they had gotten you in the end. Oh my god it feels so good to be safe again, finally safe..\" Vanessa hugged July and put her arm around her. \"Shhhh..shhh. It's okay. I made it and they didn't get me. Yes we're safe now. I also have a nice apartment located in the center of this city, where you can live with me. You don't have to sleep here in a tent. Do you know anything from the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuly slowly shook her head. \"No, nothing. Well..I was in contact with Kevin for a while. We used our mobile radios but one day I just couldn't contact him anymore. I don't know if he was caught or if he decided that the mobile radio was too risky.. He always told me that if he ever gets the feeling that they can spot him because of the mobile radio, he would destroy it right away.. Maybe he was just so far away that he was beyond reach of these rather shitty mobile radios..I don't know. I destroyed mine, when I couldn't speak with him anymore because I started to worry about beeing spotted as well. By the way thanks for your offer I'd gladly live in your apartment..Finally safe..these words really sound like music in my ears. Does this actually mean that we're done? Are we through? I mean..do we live our lives now and leave Stenchlandia in the past?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa frowned and answered: \"Actually I don't know, July. I will never give up, that's for sure..and maybe Equmria will take actions against Stenchlandia. I don't know that. It all depends on these days Parliament conferences.\" July looked in Vanessa's eyes and worriedly asked: \"What do you mean with 'take actions against Stenchlandia'?\" Vanessa bowed forward and whispered in July's ear. \"Maybe..just maybe..Equmria will declare war against Stenchlandia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lysander sighed deeply and mentally went over all the crucial points he was about to address in front of all those people... The president would be there, the minister of defense and countless other officials. Lysander knew that even he, with his infamous silver tongue and irresistible charm, would get only one chance to make something like this happen! Declaring war against the most powerful nation on the continent... It seemed insane even to himself, and yet he was about to tell hundreds of people the opposite! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do this, Lysander...\" He mumbled as he looked into a mirror on the wall, fumbling around with the elegant blue necktie on his chest, despite it being in perfect position anyway. \"You have to...\" Finally, someone was rushing over to him from around a corner. \"Sir! Preparations for your speech are complete... The president has given his go as well, the people are waiting.\" \"...Very well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot losing any more time, Lysander strode out of the corridor and through a wide series of doors onto a large balcony with a shiny, polished podium in the middle. He glanced to his sides and saw several officials, as well as the president in specific seats and as he looked down from the balcony, he saw endless masses of common people. After Lysander had announced he was going to hold another one of his legendary speeches, most people were interested. And after telling everybody that it would be the most important thing he had ever done before, everybody who was able to show up in any way did so. The people had always loved him, and now, he could finally use that fact for something truly significant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People of Equmria! The light of a new era is about to shine over our magnificent, free nation, as well as the entire world! As you are sure to know... There is a threat of critical magnitude looming over our world! A dark spot that has already stained the wonderful history of our lands and is threatening to turn into a black hole; Swallowing and completely destroying anything in its reach! I am of course talking about... Stenchlandia.\" Lysander closed his eyes for a brief moment and listened to the crowd's uproar. The people's hate against Stenchlandia had been boiling for quite some time and most people liked to take every chance to insult and ramble against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my dear friends, Stenchlandia... The unspeakable crimes commited by their officials are unforgiveable. Their actions are downright... indescribable. But truth has spoken for itself; I am aware that many of you, who have come from that hellish place in seek of a safe haven have experienced their torturous injustice on their very own bodies.\" The mass of people was getting even angrier now, and Lysander was about to use this fact! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as it pains me to remind you of their crimes again... This is the time to finally make them <i>repent</i> for their sins against humanity! For a long time have we thought about putting a stop to them through diplomatic methods... Needless to say, this proved more than futile. And outright attacking them we couldn't, because of their superior numbers and military resources! But now... the time has come! Just a few days ago, another young woman has crossed the border from Stenchlandia to our Republic. Not just any woman, though... It was the legendary Vanessa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow most of the people down there were making \"Ooooohhh!\" and \"Aaaahhhhhh!\" sounds, their jaws hanging down agape in surprise! Lysander smirked, his beamingly white teeth reflecting the sunlight like glass. \"I am sure most of you have heard of this Vanessa's doings... She alone had managed to start a rebellion in the Totalitarian state... All on her own and without a group of specialists behind her! She and her brave army, called the 'LTFK' had seriously challenged the Stenchlandian State Secret police, better known as the SSS, as well as many regular soldiers. Ultimately, she was driven back, and out of the land... But she came to us, and with her, she brought a priceless treasure! Information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the crowd had grown relatively silent. They were quite intriqued, which almost made Lysander smirk again, but he had to maintain his serious face for a little longer. \"Yes, information. Our state has many soldiers and weapons as well... A significant reason why we never dared to move against Stenchlandia was this uncertainty... Just what will happen to our brave troops once they invade? What sort of unknown weapons will be turned against us? This fear has slowed us down for long enough... Now we have the answers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander smashed his fist on the podium and many people were shocked by the sudden outburst of emotion. \"Vanessa has information about their military bases, their combat tactics, their equipment... Yes, she has even met some of their most dangerous women up close. As long as Stenchlandia doesn't know that we know this... We have an enormous advantage! And this is why we need to act fast now! As mentioned before, Vanessa has recently led a series of attacks against Stenchlandia's military, leaving it somewhat weakened. We will never get another chance like this! We must move now! In the name of freedom and justice and ultimately, to save all of our own lives as well. Because it is no secret that the maniacs behind Stenchlandia's power won't ever stop to claim new territories. We don't know what is going on in France... But most likely, we would be their next target. Our peaceful and liberal ways are an affront against all their twisted ideas. We will put a stop to them for humanities sake! For great justice! For <i><b>Equmria</b></i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>EQUMRIAAAAAAAAAAA</b></i>\" The mass thundered and began screaming and cheering in a mad trance, all their fists in the air. Lysander nodded and gave a polite bow. \"Thank you.\" With that, he proudly strode back into the building. Finally, he allowed himself to grin widely, and even to rub his hands together like a scheming cars salesman. This had been easier than expected! And it was pretty much all he could do... Everybody knew that the people's wish right now was to put Stenchlandia back into its place... Meaning absolute destruction! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome days later, Lysander was standing aside a broad street, watching the steady stream of soldiers with a satisfied grin. \"Well, Lysander... You did it again, ahehehe...\" He laughed quietly to himself when suddenly, a soft voice behind him spoke \"You certainly did. Thank you.\" Lysander turned around sharply and looked into Vanessa's beaming face. \"Oh! You have come!\" \"Yes, I thought I would find you here... I just wanted to say, you did an amazing job up there, the other day. I was listening, as well.\" \"Oh! Well, I'm glad you liked it... Making speeches like that <i>is</i> my special talent, after all...\" Lysander said with a slightly smug grin. \"Yes, I could tell... And I am quite good at giving them myself, you know!\" Vanessa said with a slight giggle. \"Oh, I'm sure of that, my dear... It seems hard enough to form an army even with the support of some officials behind you... I can't imagine how it must be to do it all on your own. But anyway... Now that our troops are marching... What do you intend to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa grinned and pierced the air with a few lightning-fast jabs. \"Well, my place is not only behind the microphone, but also on the battlefield. Like you said, I have experienced Stenchlandia's troops myself, this experience will surely prove invaluable for your troops. I wil join them, maybe take part in leading them. Aside from that... There are still many LTFK members imprisoned there... It wouldn't be right to sit idly around here while Equmria's troops do all the work. I owe those people a lot.\" \"You are right, Vanessa...\" Another voice suddenly said and July showed up, placing one hand on Vanessa's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"July? You just managed to escape from there...\" July giggled. \"Haha, as did you, silly!\" \"But I have responsibilities as a leader!\" \"It is like you said... it just wouldn't feel right to wait around here while my brothers and sisters do all the fighting. Watch out, SSS scum! The LTFK hasn't perished, yet!\" Now Vanessa had to laugh as well. \"Haha, oh yes, I like to hear that... Well, we can use every arm on our side and while I wouldn't force you to do anything of course, having one of the last free LTFK members as my ally in this upcoming battle would be quite the honor!\" \"Yeah!\" July cheered, raising her fist into the air. \"Let's blow them away! They'll never know what hit them!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few hours after their departure, the first of Equmria's troops were getting close to the Equmrian/Stenchlandian border. Vanessa was walking directly to the leader of this branch, General Dobranski, who was explaining some of the details to her. \"Our army is the largest of the three, and it will go directly towards the base in which you were defeated, after a small detour to a smaller SSS outpost... I do hope you won't mind this cruel irony.\" \"Oh, not at all. In fact, this is good, we may manage to free some of my people that way.\" \"Yes. Anyway, there are two more major armies of us, one is marching in from the north-east and another one from further in the south... It would have taken too long to let them all gather together in the capital, but it doesn't matter anyway, because of the plan we have worked out.\" Vanessa nodded sagely. \"Yes. My plan. My glorious master plan! It requires many smaller, seperate groups!\" The General sighed. \"I know what you plan to do... You want to completely surround Stenchlandia's forces that way, don't you? It's not a bad plan at all, but their women are as wicked as they are smart... They won't fall for simple tricks!\" \"Don't worry, General... I've got a few aces in my sleeve. As soon as they realise what's going on, we will be ready to <i>dash</i>! But first, and most importantly! Operation Blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Dobranski sighed heavily. He didn't like that codename very much, but it had been Vanessa's idea and it seemed brilliant. \"Yes... Since the SSS has a small outpost close to here, they will undoubtly spot us quite soon. They will see us like this, in our battle armor, but without helmets or anything of the sort and with their favouring of gas-based weapons, we will lead them into a trap!\" Vanessa nodded and rubbed her hands. \"This is sure to work. Just wait and see, General!\" General Dobranski sighed and shrugged. \"You know what you doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome distance away, on a small observation tower atop a hill, one SSS scout was screaming loudly as she spotted the large number of enemy soldiers approaching. \"Oh my god! Come here, commander, it's the enemy and they are coming en masse!\" \"What... What is it?\" The SSS commander's jaw hung down as the stared upon the moving sea of enemies. \"Are those... Equmria troops? So, they decided to attack us first, hmmm. This... this isn't good... With those numbers, they will overrun us completely! Hmmm... Unless...\" The commander was getting out a pair of binoculars and looked at the incoming threat closely. \"We need to call for backup, right now! Or... better yet, let's retreat, commander!\" \"Hmmm... No. No, wait. I have an idea.\" \"What? What is it?\" I have taken a close look at these enemies... They aren't wearing any kind of... protective gear, if you know what I mean.\" \"Ma'am?\" \"We still have one of those S.T.I.N.K. machines standing around somewhere, don't we?\" \"But... but even then-\" \"Well, do we or do we not?\" \"Yes! Yes, we do, Ma'am!\" \"Good... We will position it on the edge of the mountain and once they are about to come up, we fire it up, unleashing the entire stench of our powerful feet upon their unsuspecting noses, creating massive chaos! Then, we charge in, breaking them apart and driving them back, while capturing as many of them as possible!\" \"Great idea! It will be done right away, Ma'am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the steep hill was coming into view, Vanessa nodded and yelled \"Now!\" Since the high angle of the mountain was blocking the view right now, the Equmria troops had a little time to do whatever they needed, unnoticed. Vanessa had planned it out exactly; Numerous backpacks were opened and combat helmets with integrated gas masks taken out. Vanessa grinned as she put on her own, a standard variant also used by the Equmrian military. Because of their close position to Stenchlandia and the infamous battle tactics of those opponents, Equmria had begun to manufacture these special helmets: The top part looked very much like a World War II style steel helmet, but the lower half of the head was also completely covered by armor, as well as the obvious breathing part that regular gasmasks had. All in all, it was designed to repel any kind of biological or chemical weapon... Which in Stenchlania's case would mean, it mostly had to keep the deadly stench of their girl's feet out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first troops had almost reached the top of the hill, a machine most familiar to Vanessa suddenly appeared up there. \"Hah! I knew they would do that! I just knew it! You see that, General?\" Vanessa muffledly said behind her helmed, jabbing the General lightly on the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud, metallic noise, the S.T.I.N.K. weapon suddenly sprung into use and all of the troops below felt the surrounding air getting warmer and somewhat heavier... But aside from that, it had no effect! As the first soldiers rushed up and defeated the machine's operators effortlessly, Vanessa came cheeringly running up as well. \"Hah! Hahaha! It's going just as planned! Yes! Now, it's time to <i>dash</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe SSS commander's plan had backfired spectacularly: By relying on the machine's power alone, the other SSS soldiers and agents were barely prepared for combat at all! As soon as the Equmrian forces stormed in, lead by a furious Vanessa, complete chaos broke out! Vanessa did what she did best; charging into the enemies without any kind of weapon, she swiftly punched and kicked her way to victory. Before long, all the SSS forces who hadn't been defeated already were making a hasty retreat now, down the other side of the hill and further towards Stenchlandia's capital! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one of them left... And after quickly searching some of the spaces around the outpost, Vanessa found her herself: The SSS commander suddenly jumped at her from behind a corner; desperate and stubborn to take at least one enemy down before falling herself! However, she had picked the wrong target; Vanessa jumped back in mid-movement, faster than anybody could have anticipated, making the commander hit empty air with her little charge! Vanessa then followed up with a swift kick to the head, sending the SSS woman tumbling to the ground! Vanessa then quickly jumped on her and held her down with one hand, fumbling with her helmet with the other! Finally, she ripped it off and grinned beamingly into the terrified agent's face. \"Know who I am?\" She simply asked, grinning. \"You... you... Your entire rebellion was repelled! How can this be?\" \"Hah, the real rebellion hasn't even started yet... But it's about to! Oh, and was it your brilliant idea to rely on your little special power alone?\" Vanessa teased, grinning widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander only glared at her, but Vanessa took that as a yes. \"That didn't went too well, now did it? Oh, but if you insist so much on the power of smelly feet, I'll let you know that it can still be done, at least as far as you personally are concerned...\" The commander's face paled. She knew where this was going. \"No...\" She weakly said, but Vanessa had already brought her combat-boot clad foot beneath the downed agent's face. \"No!\" Vanessa smiled as she started to slowly pull the tight, high boot off. \"No! Oh please, no!\" \"Yes! Yes yes yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a disgusting, wet noise similar to a bottlecap getting ripped off a bottle, the boot finally flew off, unleashing Vanessa's huge, long foot, slender and beautiful like a king cobra, but just as venomous and deadly! Shining glisteningly with the freshly accumulated sweat of marching and fighting, it was radiating with wet heat like a thousand saunas! \"This is for what you people have done to my allies, you <i>fucking animals</i>!\" Vanessa screamed, before dropping her dripping, sopping wet foot sole-first directly on the agent's face, muffling her last cries for mercy under endless, silky soft soles of sweat-soaked suffering!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so wrong... hero or not, she shouldn't be doing this...\" A bystanding Equmria soldier disapprovingly exclaimed, even though he was still safely behind his mask-helmet. Vanessa paid him little heed as she feverishly grinded her deathly foot into her helpless prey's face. With every thought of her friends, still trapped in the SSS's vicious claws, Vanessa pushed her foot a little harder into the woman's face, until her lips were completely pushed shut and her nose trapped in the death-zone that was Vanessa's toe cleaveage. She was forced to sniff, and the very first sniff shook her entire body with vicious, salty notes of well-aged cheese, stale sweat and distant traces of sourness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole body of the agent started to shake convulsingly as the thick, brutal stench of Vanessa's feet had it's way with her sense of smell. A few desperate cries were attempted, but only muffled \"Hmmmphhh... Hnnnnng!\" sounds managed to come by Vanessa's slipperly sole. It soon became too much for the agent to bear, all senses faded away, replaced by the cheesy aroma of Vanessa's personal footsmell and soon enough, she stopped moving entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa got up again, sighed deeply, and put her helmet back on, before rejoining the other troops, which were already waiting for her some meters away. \"Well... I declare Operation Blue to be a great success! But still, we need to push on now! This little outpost has almost no meaning, we need to move now!\" Vanessa cried, running ahead and irritating the others a little, as they had been waiting for her for the past few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Maria. Now that you have the information of the recent attack, what do you intend to do?\" A high ranked official of the SSS spoke, many miles away. \"Don't worry, Amber... I have a plan. I will not let them even reach the first base in their path, you know you can trust me.\" Was the response of another ranked SSS agent. \"Of course. I know you will not fail us. You must not! Make us all proud, Maria...\" Maria nodded and cracked her knuckles loudly as she walked down a long hall... Oh, she would make them all pay for striking back now, after she had just won. \"They will never see it coming...\" She said with a sly grin.</span></div></div>",

Tak-tak-tak-tak!</b> Ever since the advance of the Equmrian forces got stuck and the two frontlines had formed themselves, the nerve-wracking sounds of war were omnipresent. Exploding grenades, singing machine guns, cracking rifles as well as hundreds of throats shouting, crying, moaning or whimpering. The surprising strike of the Equmrian army hadn't been such a huge advantage in the end. Before the onset of the nightfall, the Stenchlandian Defense Department had been able to organize heavy resistance and soon enough it was clear that both parties would have to face static warfare for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa sat in front of her tent behind the frontline carried away by thoughts. <i>\"This isn't going as planned at all. It seems Stenchlandia was way better prepared than I thought. Actually it seems they were about to attack Equmria, regarding the massive amount of troops they could send against us so fast. Also they are well equipped. No wonder General Dobranski is out of sorts with me.</i> <b>BATCH! Fut-fut-fut-fut-fut! Prrrrt! Prrrrt!</b> <i>This freaking noises are making me crazy! If war just wasn't so loud!\"</i> Vanessa's thought shortly were interrupted by a helicopter she was able to hear somewhere over her, she couldn't say exactly where since the treetops of the little forest her squad was camping in blocked her field of vision. Also it was dark, the sky was almost black, starless, as if even nature had given up any hope. Of course the helicopters were flying without their lights on in order to not be spotted by an enemy with a missile launcher. With raw nerves Vanessa jumped up and started walking. She just needed to get her head free and calm down. How was she supposed to fight out an entire war, when her heart refused to stop pounding like crazy?! She wouldn't go visit the field hospital once again, that was for sure. She had done so earlier in the day, because she felt like she had to care for the ones getting injured during the collaborative struggle for freedom. However she soon had learned that this was not the place for her. What she had seen as well as the bloodcurdling cries of agony she had heard inside the field hospital had turned her stomach immediately and forced her to leave the tent before something embarrassing could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking and breathing in some fresh air for some minutes, Vanessa decided to return to her tent and get some sleep. On her way back she heard someone rant and another annoyed voice answering with \"You know I can't go back and I won't!\". For a moment she wasn't sure how to react, but then decided to step out of the bushes and confront the two cockerels. One of the two guys obviously was an officer of the Equmrian army staring angrily at a young boy, who couldn't be more than a teenager. \"What's this about?\", Vanessa asked and the officer immediately reported. \"Ma'am, this is Joe, a fourteen year old friend of mine. He is underage and shouldn't be here, in a warzone, but apparently he just sneaked behind us. He ignored my order to stay at home but he is a good guy. I don't know why he is so eager to risk his young life. Maybe you could help me to convince him to take a safe track back at home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smirked and said: \"Oh so you are Joe. I didn't meet you yet but I heard some stuff about you, from Lysander. He seems to think highly of you and your ambitions. He also said,  that if you want something, you never give up. I start to understand now, what he meant. But really Joe, this is a warzone and you are fourteen. Fourteen! When I was in your age I just stopped playing with my puppies and had the first crush on a boy in my life. You could get severely injured out here. Is this really what you want?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe unimpressedly stared back and made a serious face. \"I'm sorry but I think I do know very well what I am doing. Stenchlandia taught me to forget about my puppies and to not trust any girl all too soon. I am fourteen, yes, but I have trained myself in several fighting techniques now, and I do know how to handle a rifle. Some of my soldier friends even called me the best shooter they have ever seen. And now that I arrived here, my decision seems every more right to me regarding the resistance Stenchlandia is able to put up. I want to stay here, and you can either accept me as one of the official soldiers, or I will just search a nice place in the woods from where I can badger the enemy for good!\" His answers really impressed Vanessa and she slapped the obviously confused officer on the back. \"Listen mate, I'm pretty sure he will do fine and if he really wants to do this, it's his decision after all. Yes, he is very young and I'm sure you only want to protect a friend but he grew up in Stenchlandia for some time and I doubt that there is much childhood left in him. In these times we all mature pretty fast and if it is anyone's right to fight against Stenchlandia's cruel ways, then it's his right! Also I think it's better for him to stay with us than to risk his life all alone in some treetop. Show him where he can pitch his tent and give him something to eat. <b>BANG! BADUM!</b> I will go and get some sleep now, I fear tomorrow will be a long day!\" With these words Vanessa turned around and made her way back to her own little tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout one kilometre further west, Maria was studying a map of the eastern forest lands in order to find some places of strategical importance. <i>\"This forest leaves us plenty of possibilities to sabotage the enemies or build up traps. But for that I need more information about the real important spots for our enemies! After all I don't want to waste our precious time sabotaging minor targets and I also want that my traps actually trap someone.\" </i>At least everything had been going well so far. She had managed to stop the Equmrian advance pretty fast and built up a nice defence line. To her luck, all the other important officers and generals, as in Officer Daina Perkowitz, General Gina Lambertz and even the legendary General Maraleena Deutrich (she had led the ultra feminist revolution in Stenchlandia to victory and probably enslaved dozens of men under her feet) had accepted Maria's co-leading position, although she was an SSS-Agent and not directly part of the military. <b>BOOM! Tak-tak-tak! Prrt! Paff-Paff!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust now, when Maria looked the map over for a last time, two ideas crossed her mind like two lightnings. She stuffed the map back in her pocket and went of her tent. After some minutes of searching she had found an officer entitled to spread her orders and shared her newest idea. \"You! Yes, you! I have something you need to spread. You see this little river over there? It it the only water source nearby and it leads directly through the enemy lines. Although I'm sure that they have some water reserves with them, they won't last forever. We in comparison have as much water supplies as we need. So, I want that you tell everyone in every camp that they will use this little river to wash their worn socks, tired feet and even to rinse their boots. I'm not sure how strong this will effect our enemies, but it surely won't do any harm to play out all cards!\" The officer nodded yes and immediately rushed away to do what he was told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria complacently grinned and turned in the direction of the soldier's tents. <i>\"Now there's only one thing left..\"</i>, she thought to herself. <i>\"I need more information for my sabotage and trap plans and I think if the information doesn't come to me, I will simply provide the information myself! Under cover of darkness it shouldn't be too hard for our well-trained women to sneak in some small enemy camp, to overwhelm some of them and eventually capture them. I'm sure they will know <b>something</b> at least! Haha, and I already know who the four fighters are, that I'll take with me..\"</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright... you know the plan!\" Maria whispered very quietly, unlike her usual self, playing around with a special combat helmet in her hands. Said helmet had integrated night vision lenses and was in a very dark, almost pitch black color, making it perfect for undercover night-missions. The four agents in front of Maria had all already donned their helmets and were also equipped with the fitting armor as well, one that was much lighter in weight and allowed even quicker and noiseless movement but in a darker color than the regular soldier clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If what our scouts have told us is correct, and so far it has always been, then we know the exact location of tents belonging to high-ranked Equmria commanders. Vanessa and their General are currently out of reach, unfortunately... Their place is far too well-guarded, we would need a team of at least three times our size and that would most likely alarm the entire encampment... No, but we have these here...\" Maria took out a small map which she showed to her allies once more. They had all seen it already, but it wouldn't hurt to make them remember once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lieutenant Markunas, in this tent about <i>here</i>, we expect a few guards, nothing too heavy. Lieutenant Rascalov, basically just next door, over <i>here</i>. Should be similar to the first one. And then there's an interesting one; Major Stokowski. I've heard this one is a woman, so maybe those Equmrian bastards do have a little sense in their heads after all, hehe. But jokes aside, her place should be right <i>there</i>, and we have received information that it is especially well-guarded. We can safely assume that she will know the most... Very well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nodded and put the map away again. \"We move in unseen, avoid every conflict if possible, and if not possible... Then we must deal with them <i>swiftly</i> and with <i>great precision</i>. We take out our targets, make absolutely sure not to inflict serious wounds, we still have to interrogate them afterwards... Two more agents stand ready to transport the bodies away, they are hiding just out of sight right now, closer to the enemy camp. If any of you does get caught, don't expect the rest to rush to your aid. Those Equmrians believe themselves to be the good guys, so they won't kill you or outright torture you for information, at least I think so. I don't need to tell you what <i>we</i> will do to you should we find out that did you speak. Because it is certain that we <i>will</i> eventually win this... Anyway...\" Maria sighed and finally put on her helmet. \"I don't expect you to fail anyway. Now follow me lead... <i>Let's do this</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small group of agents moved quickly and almost invisibly under the thick cloak of the night's darkness. Even the natural sounds of the night, the distant howling of wolves and the ever-present shifting and crawling of small animals was enough to mask the silent steps of their potent feet. Maria smirked as she watched the women next to her move like shadows; she really did pick the right ones for this job!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Equmrian soldier was unsteadily leaning on his rifle, yawning dully before staring around aimlessly. \"Hey. Hey! Pay better attention, alright?\" His colleague, a women wearing the same uniform spoke sharply, but yet relatively quietly. \"Ahh, I'm trying. I'm just so damn tired. Besides, we've been watching this area for hours, and nothing ever happened.\" The soldier spoke in his defense. The other soldier didn't approve of that, though. \"Don't say that! The Stenchlandian's are just waiting for us to drop our guard, if only for a moment... I know how treacherous they can be.\" \"Alright, I just meant- Hey, did you he\" <b>*THUD*</b> As the soldier turned his head to the left, he saw something speeding at him for the fraction of a second before the butt of a rifle connected with his skull sharply, instantly knocking him out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did- *guuuhhh*\" The other soldier had no more luck as one arm suddenly appeared from behind her neck and placed a choke-hold on her, strangling her throat mercilessly. Her eyes bulged as she tried to scream with all her might, but only a faint rasping sound came out before she lost consciousness as well and dropped to the ground limply. Five dark figures in the night swiftly hid the bodies in some high grass before hurrying onwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind a large boulder, Maria quickly whispered \"The second one was done alright, but smacking them over the head isn't the best method, as it still creates some noise... Up there are still two guards before we reach the main camp area, watch and learn, girls.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria dashed out from the hiding with unreal speed, making her way unseen to the two guards who seemed to be talking with each other, as cunning and terrifyingly fast like a demon. Maria suddenly appeared behind the first guard and struck the soft, vulnerable area between his neck and right shoulder with her right index and middle finger, diving them in like a pickaxe into a goldvein and hitting a nerve directly! The soldier's whole body froze up for a brief moment before he went completely limp and collapsed like a dead man. The second guard instantly tried to turn and face Maria, but before he could even open his mouth, Maria had dashed behind him and leaped upon his back! Her left leg clutched around his stomach, giving it a brief, tight squeeze that forced all the air out of his lungs and adjusted Maria's own position, while her right leg went over his shoulder, her deadly foot almost directly next to his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier could only stare in horror as one of Maria's hands swiftly removed the boot from her right foot and a hot, putrid wave of moist air hit him directly in the face! He only had about one second to marvel at the sheer size of this long, well-shaped foot, dripping with hot sweat, before the very same hand that freed it suddenly grabbed the back of his head and pushed forward! His head was driven face-first into the warm, moist sole of Maria's sweaty foot, making a slapping, wet impact! He didn't even get the time to attempt screaming again as a wall of soft sole was suddenly pushing his lips shut and his nose was snugly fitting between five enormously long toes. With no other choice left, he took a deep, deadly breath inhaling the strong aroma of Maria's feet directly! Instantly, he was knocked out! Maria jumped off from his falling body and put the boot back over her right foot. The other agents had followed now, all staring at her in awe. \"And this, my friends, is how it is <i>done</i>!\" Maria smugly said before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the five agents quickly went on and reached the first tent of their targets in no time. Luckily, it was not especially well-guarded and two agents slipped in without problems. They spotted the Lieutenant sleeping on a makeshift bed peacefully. They quickly decided to do as her master had shown them; They both jumped at the unaware man and kicking their boots off, held four moist, warm and nauseatingly strong smelling feet directly in his face! The mass of feet was so great that they piled atop each other a little, burying the unfortunate face of their victim under even more soft, warm footflesh as the combined weight of their bodies sitting on him prevented him from getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey listened to the painfully forced sniffing for over a minute, and exchanged a few worried glances. \"That's strange... He's shivering and convulsing as he sniffs our feet, so it obviously has some effect, but he just won't go to sleep!\" \"Just... let's just keep this up for some more time. It'll work eventually!\" Thus the poor Lieutenant was forced to smell four sticky, wet feet toes-to-the-nose style for about ten more minutes, his entire body shaking as the thick, cheesy scent shook him with every breath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he was out cold and the two agents re-appeard outside, where the other three had been waiting, watching for more possible guards. \"There you are! What took you so long?\" Maria asked indignantly. \"We... we did just as you showed us, but he just wouldn't stop moving!\" \"Hmmm... I know your feet aren't exactly scentless, so those guys must actually be a bit tougher than expected... Very well, for the next target, take this:\" Maria said, getting out a small, air-sealed container. \"What's...\" \"These here, are two of Amber's socks. After Amber had realised how useful her outerworldy footstench can be for warfare, she always wears a pair of socks under the worst conditions for about 3-4 days straight, before sending them to the front. I don't think I need to warn you about this, but these socks are <i>extremely</i> strong. We normally use them like grenades; Hurling them far away and letting the blast of stink take care of the enemy... Not even I am immune to them. So be sure to hold your breath after you open the container. And lock them in again, afterwards! These things take days to produce, like I said, and they are extremely effective. We can't just let them lie around everywhere. No go inside the next one! The two others will swiftly carry the Lieutenant away and I will make sure that no aimlessly wandering soldier will interrupt you. Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two agents took the deadly weapon with the utmost respect and fear. Not even holding a bomb had such an effect on people! With this type of weapon, what could possibly go wrong?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two agents waited slowly and patiently in some bushes surrounding the Lieutenant's tent. There was a lone guard wandering about, the first agent was already moving in to take him out, but the other one silently insisted on waiting, by pushing her down by her shoulders. And true enough, the guard soon walked away somewhere into the night. After the two Stenchlandian girls couldn't hear his steps in the distance anymore, they dashed out of their hiding place and into the tent in a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they were inside, the one holding the deadly container with Amber's deadly socks in it lifted the doomsday thing up, placing her hand on the lid and looking at her ally with grim determination. They both took a deep, long breath, taking in and saving all the oxygen possible... Just before the one agent walked to the sleeping military man and opened the container! The rush of preseved, purified footstench created by the deadliest feet in the land was incredibly powerful; Like a coiled spring did the bio-hazardous foot aroma stream out, covering the air of the entire inside space in mere seconds! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agent gulped and started to shiver as she felt her eyes starting to stream tears... Despite her holding her breath tightly, the unreal stench of those well-worn, sweat-soaked socks was getting to her! With shaking hands, she took hold of one of the deadly things, completely covering her hand in stale, cool sweat by doing so and then swiftly mashed the deadly thing directly into the face of the Lieutenant, who was just about to wake up from the nasty stench! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agent couldn't help but smirk as she felt him struggle and scream in horror for only seconds as a smell as bad as thousand regular feet was released directly into his face! Just one sniff had been enough; As he went limp, the agent quickly put Amber's sock back into the air-tight box and ran out, the other agent transporting the unconscious Lieutenant, they would have to tie him up outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the agent who had already stowed the sock-box away again, now with free hands rushed outside and took a deep, well-needed breath, she was shocked to see the same guard from before, standing right in front of her again! <i>How can this be... He was well out of reach and we took two minutes, at most!</i>, the agent thought in panic. Thankfully for her, the enemy soldier wasn't a very experienced one and looked just as shocked and clueless as she did! Doing the first thing that came to her mind, the agent simply grabbed the soldier by his shoulders and threw him towards the entrance of the Lieutenant's tent! He crashed through it and tumbled to the ground inside! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the second agent had arrived as well and the two Stenchlandian girls quickly took off from the poisoned tent as terrible coughing and gagging noises sounded from the inside, followed by a dull thump, telling them that the guard wouldn't pose a problem anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter safely tying their prisoner up, the agents met again with Maria, who was nodding proudly. \"Well... I see Amber's socks worked well, didn't they?\" \"Worked like a charm!\" One agent said breathlessly \"We could feel the bad air damaging us... even though we held our breaths!\" Maria just laughed as silently as she could. \"Hehehe, yeah if you didn't hold your breath you would be out cold for at least the night... Good job, my ladies, good job indeed. So! Now it's two down and one to go. Last one's the Major... Stokowski, was it? That one is also the most vital target for the night. Don't you lose that one. As far as this operation is concerned, this person could mean everything or nothing. Now let's go... I will join you once more for this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her special  hand sign again, Maria took off, her loyal agents following close by...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rushing ahead silently through the night, Maria was closely followed by her two comrades. Making a beeline through small gaps here and there and lurking in the shadows for just the right time to slip by while some guard's eyes were looking elsewhere, Maria dashed through the camp with unreal speed. Occassionally, some nearby enemy soldier was just about to notice her, but every time that happened, said soldier would end up deep in a forced sleep mere seconds afterwards; be it induced by a speedy strike on a nerve bundle, or a especially sweaty sole directly to the face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria took care not to let her feet out in the air for too long, even while using them to take out enemies, as their foul, potent aroma might make others notice its source. And that, even though they were out in the open. Maria's feet were simply in a different class than most others, even considering the agents in the SSS. Even her followers had troubles at times, when they failed to hold their breath in time and caught a slight whiff of Maria's incredibly thick, piercing foot smell. Even from two meters afar, this powerful odor of strong cheese, vinegar and litres of sweat, kept fresh by Maria sticking her feet back into her airtight, high black leather boots every time, was by far enough to bring a tear to the eye of even those well-trained SSS forces!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some intense minutes of travelling closer towards the heart of the enemy encampment, the group of three reached their destination: The large tent of Major Stokowski. Maria hissed almost noisessly as she noticed a small group of soldiers standing in front of it. As the sweat was pouring out of every pore of Maria's skin, due to running and knocking out enemies left and right, she was silently thinking of a way to solve this problem. One of her fellow agents tapped her on the shoulder and whispered into her ear \"What are you thinking about, boss? It looks quite simple to me; Just knock those losers there out and in with us! Just like you do it every time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria squint her eyes and shook her head slowly. \"No, it's not quite as simple... While I can easily take those, all of them, myself... Even in a fair fight, let alone ambushing them; Even I can't guarantee to do it so fast that none of them manages to raise alarm... And even with your help, let's see... there are 8 guards... So if I take five of them and each of you two... Nah, it's pretty risky, still.\" Maria mused, grinding her teeth gently as not to cause too much noise. Planning carefully like that and not storming in and just blowing her enemies away was not very much like her, but if she caused an alarm almost in the middle of an enemy camp... Even she wouldn't be able to fight dozens, if not hundreds of enemies at the same time, her two allies wouldn't make much of a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I do have an idea... but...\" \"What is it, chief?\"  \"Well, we still have Amber's socks... I could throw them in; Aiming directly for the heads, of course and them charge in to finish off anyone who managed to hold their breath-\" \"That's genius! Let's do this!\" \"...Let me finish, damnit. The problem is, Amber's socks smell bad. I mean, both of you know how much I am understating this right now; The other side of the camp will most likely smell the unholy scent of pure terror streaming from those devilish things... Meaning, it might cause something of an alarm, as well...\" \"But chief, as soon as someone comes, we'll be already gone and with the Major, as well!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria seemed to think for a moment and then she nodded sharply. \"You know what, you're damn right. What am I thinking; worrying about Equmrian scum and maybe a few rebels here and there! Let's waste them!\" The other two cheered silently as Maria moved forward a bit, around a corner and got the container with the deadly socks out... Her hand on the lid, just waiting for the perfect time! And there it was; the two other agents started to hold their breaths as they saw Maria's arm move and not a second too late: With one fluid movement the lid flew off and with it, two large, absolutely wet and inhumanely reeking socks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they still flew, some of the enemy sodiers slowly began to turn around, almost like slow motion. They never knew what hit them! Two of them received one absolutely moist, shiny and sticky sock directly to the face, just as Maria had planned! With a horrible, wet squishing sound, they pressed themselves tightly to the horrified faces of their victims, sticking to them like glue due to all the sweat. And bombarding their faces directly with one of the most potent, vile stenches ever, all it took was one tiny sniff for those victims to go to the ground in pained groans! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, hit by surprise, the Equmrian soldiers took even bigger breaths than necessary and completely flooded their bodies with the incredible smell of Amber's well-aged socks, collapsing like felled trees without even a single attempted scream. The other six soldiers were hit by surprise as well and fortunately for Amber, none of them began to hold their breath before taking one whiff beforehand... And thus sealing their fate! Two of the six were going down just like that, still clasping their throats and gagging, but slowly stopping to move! One of the rest tried to stumble away, the thick stench had poisoned all of his senses already, he was tumbling around like a drunk man, trying to scream <i>Help! Help! Intruder alert!</i> loudly, but all that left his throat was a tiny, strained gasping sound. And then there was Maria, pushing him back and down to the ground, closer to the deadly socks, sealing his fate. The other three tried to flee as well, but Maria - together with her two allies who still held their breath well - swiftly pushed them all back together, before forcing them to the ground, sending those to sleep as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria then hurriedly took the socks once more and sealed them in, before rushing into the tent. Her allies stayed close; The air outside was still not fit for humans to breathe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd from that point on, everything started to go downhill! Maria looked around in surprise as she saw nobody in the tent, everything seemed completely empty... And her surprise began to grow as she looked up and suddenly saw something coming rushing down at her with great speed! With Maria's supreme skills and senses, it was possible for her to jump to the side, but the Equmrian Major was not done yet and went for Maria's allies instantly, before Maria even landed her escape move! Unfortunately for the SSS agent, she had seen the move coming just as much as Maria had... but she sadly lacked the needed skill and agility to evade it! A powerful knee landed straight in her stomach, making her tumble to the ground! While Maria began to charge at her target, the Major had already grabbed the other agent and was wrestling her to the ground! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria made a wide, powerful swing to remove the enemy swiftly, but her eyes widened in shock as the Major suddenly let go of the SSS agent and dropped to the ground! While Maria took all her strenght to stop her attack mid-air to not hit her own ally - who was still regaining her balance - with full force; The Major had rolled away, gotten up again and was now sweeping their legs with one powerful round-kick! The lower SSS agent was literally knocked over by this, but Maria stood her place like a gigantic boulder getting hit by a powerful wave. Turning her head around in pure anger, Maria forgot all sense and charged at her target, mad with rage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Major showed some skill, evading some attacks and dancing around swiftly. In the end, she stood no chance for Maria, but just as she was kneeling over and about to receive a juicy footsole bare to her face to seal the deal, the opening of the tent was ripped open and Maria twirled around like a tornado to see at least 10 enemies staring at her in disbelief!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not a second later, all of them began to shout loudly! \"Alarm! Alarm!\" \"Enemies in the base! Help!\" \"Need some backup here!\" Maria grit her teeth as she charged at the mass of enemies and jumped into them with the blunt of her body in full, flying motion. Not surprisingly, she smashed through, but it was harder than she had imagined and she almost fell to the ground outside. As Maria looked up again, her worst fear became reality as dozens of enemies were streaming towards her from all possible directions! \"Shit... I'm really sorry for you girls...\" Maria whispered as she began to run as fast as she could, taking the closest route that would probably lead her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria ran and ran with all her might, hearing thunderous footsteps of hundreds of angry soldiers and even some shots fired here and then, as she finally reached the end of the camp and escaped blindly into the dark abyss of the night. It hurt her sense of duty painfully to abandon her allies like that, but Maria knew that she herself was too important for this whole war to risk herself like that. With the enemy warned and two of her comrades in enemy hand, Maria could only hope that things wouldn't turn to the worse right now and that her other allies had removed the bodies of the other two Equmrians before this whole riot had broken loose.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the failed night mission things swiftly started to turn grim for the SSS government. While Maria had managed to successfully escape with the two Equmrian military men, they proved not to be of much use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry commander... but the prisoners have fainted once again...\" One frightened looking agent spoke to Maria, who was seething with rage. \"Well, wake them up and question them again...\" Maria shot a glance into the space where the prisoners were being kept; they were bound to chairs, neatly tied up with rope and duct tape with several interrogators standing ready as well, about to unleash their feet on their victims over and over again. The strong aroma present in the air told Maria that they had done this several times already. \"With all due respect, ma'am... But I think they sincerely do know nothing...\" The lower ranking SSS agent said, mustering all her courage. \"I don't care! Make them taste feet! Make it count, girls... We'll most likely have to move out soon again anyway... The Equmrians won't sit tight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's words proved to be true: The very next morning, the Equmrian forces were marching onwards again, even swifter and more dedicated than before. Their spiritual leader, Vanessa, was not entirely innocent in that aspect: \"Go, go, march onwards my friends! During the last night, one undercover act was attempted by our enemies... One most dishonorable and foul! They came in the darkest hour and attempted to take one of our Majors away! While they did unfortunately manage to kidnap two other of our men, so did we! They failed; We noticed them and now, two of their agents are ours! Now is the time to strike! We will have the advantage! <i>Go go go</i>!\" Vanessa screamed while running next to the marching soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a tent not far away, two females were silently waiting. They were not Equmrians, however. \"Oh shit... what are they going to do to us? When will we be rescued? What will-\" \"Just calm down already, alright?\" One of the SSS agents sighed \"You know what Maria said... those fools won't dare using anything noteworthy against us. We will just have to wait until they move on. We're most likely too worthless to keep around while they're hurrying along as quickly as possible, as much as it pains me to say that...\" \"So... are you sure we'll be fine?\" \"Yeah yeah, we'll be-\" \"Oh hello!\" A cheerful, loud voice suddenly broke the quiet conversation. Both of the SSS agents turned their necks (The rest of their bodies was tied up well) to look at the visitor. \"This is... oh shit, this is one of their top fighters!\" \"Yup, I am, but my friends call me Felicia. You're not my friends, but you can still call me Felicia, hehehe!\" \"Alright... Felicia.\" One of the SSS agents replied in annoyance. \"Whatever you want from us, we're not cooperating. You better just leave us here, otherwise you will waste your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia giggled and jumped up and down a few times before suddenly charging closer to the bound women, making both of them flinch instinctively. \"Ohhh, but I can't do that! Vanessa thinks you two might... have some interesting things to say! And I agree!\" Even though the SSS agents knew they were in a really bad spot right now, they still wouldn't just give in. \"Well good luck with that, because we won't tell you shit.\" Felicia started to giggle again, much to the displeasure of the speaking agent. \"And what's so funny about that?\" \"Duh, think we haven't thought about that? I will simply <i>make you talk</i>!\" For a moment, Felicia spoke with a terrifying sense of authority which made the SSS agents as pale as snow. \"...And trust me, I'm good at that! Hehe...\" The one SSS agent gulped down and decided to talk back one more time. \"Well... what are you going to do? Just beat us nicely into a pulp? Is that what you guys do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia shook her head eagerly, dropped down onto her butt in the front of her two victims and eagerly exclaimed \"No, we can't do that, sadly. But I can do something even better! Like this!\" With a swift movement, Felicia raised both of her feet up in the air and with another one, she removed her trademark, old, filthy flat shoes. As one of her gigantic feet came soaring towards her prisoners faces, one of them still had the audacity to taunt \"Hah, with feet? I'll have you know, we are professionally trained- ughhh!\" but not for very long! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their intense training, none of the two SSS agents would have imagined the feet of one rebel girl to be as mind-numbingly stinky that they would put even some of their own finest fighters in shame! But that was precisely because they haven't met with Felicia's fantastically fabulous foot funk so far! Felicia giggled again, as she saw her victim cough and gag just from catching a whiff of her feet like that. \"Hmm, what do you think of my feet? Oh, do you have to get a better view?\" Felicia hummed, pushing both of her long, drippingly wet soles directly into the SSS agent's faces, making them gag in agony as every breath they took now consisted of the pure stench of Felicia's incredible feet! \"I hope you enjoy them! Smell them while you can!\" Felicia sung, beginning to grind and rub her feet around their faces mercilessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long. \"Hnnnngh... Stop! Stop, please... I tell you everything!\" One of the SSS agents cried desperately as she couldn't take the nauseating smell of Felicia's feet anymore. \"No... don't... we must... not... urgh...\" Her ally tried to prevent that, but fell unconscious in just the wrong moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, the other two main branches of the Equmrian military were heading into Stenchlandia now as well, while they came from slightly different directions, they all headed straight to the capital. The few scattered Stenchlandian forces often had to choice but to make hasty retreats while the Equmrians just rushed through! Slowly but surely, all three main forces would come together, somewhere close to the capital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Vanessa knew that things were still risky; While her part of the army had managed to outrun Maria's group flawlessly recently, they would surely stay close. And the main defensive force of Stenchlandia hadn't even arrived yet! If they managed to pin her down while the other part then moved in and crushed them by superior numbers, before the Equmrian backup could arrive, then their massive forward force to their invasion would be halted and in the worst case, all their armies would come to a stillstand... Deep within enemy territory and completely surrounded! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa couldn't let this happen and the easiest way would be to quickly join the branches of Equmria's army together. However, Vanessa wasn't the only one who thought of that plan! \"It's really simple, once you see it...\" Amber explained to some other high-ranking members of the Stenchlandian military, while pointing her fingers on a huge map. \"This here is our main defense force. While its numbers are vastly superior, if the enemy manages to attack us from here...\" Amber pointed directly to the front, where Vanessa's group would most likely come to \"And here and here...\" Amber pointed to the northeast and southeast, where the two other Equmrian armies would most likely arrive \"Then they might attempt to fully surround us with their forces. And even with our strength... We can't say for sure what would happen then... It is entirely possible that they win in that case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber closed her eyes as she heard all the other women in the room gasp loudly at those words. \"So what can we do? I suggest we send teams here and here, to slow down or completely stop their reinforcements... there! Then, they will either try to come here anyway... In which case we'll reach their middle part before them and completely destroy it. Afterwards, we can deal with those two easily. Or! They will try to fall back a little and join their main force further to the east. The full force of Equmrian's military is a force to be reckoned with, and while we would most likely win even in an all-out battle, I suggest we place a little trap for the enemy in that case... Draw our forces back suddenly, while letting some spread to the north and south, we will have the direct defensive bonus of our main bases while creating a chance to surround <i>their</i> forces at the same time... So! What do you say?\" All around the room were thoughtfully nodding faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, a gigantic battle was almost certain to follow at this point. The only question was when... and how!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa was uneasily pacing up and down in her little tent, occasionally glancing on the map in the middle of the room. She went to the opening and glanced outside; There here soldiers were already gathering to continue their march, and thus their righteous invasion of Stenchlandia! \"Oh man...\" Vanessa sighed to nobody in particular as she returned to the table. \"Somehow, it feels like I didn't get any work done in a long time...\" In truth, it hadn't been that much time since their last clash with Stenchlandian forces, but it sure felt that way. Vanessa slowly walked to the map again and stared down intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know right! All the more reason to kick their asses now, wouldn't you say? So, what's the big plan, chief?\" A loud, cheerful voice suddenly rang out to Vanessa's left. \"Hmmm? Ah well, like I said earlier-\" \"But I wasn't here earlier!\" Irritated, Vanessa lifted her head up... And looked directly into Felicia's beaming face. \"Hey! Happy to see me?\" She chirped. \"Wha... Felicia! What are you doing here!\" Felicia <i>tsk</i>ed and put on a mock frown. \"Awww, she is <i>not </i>happy to see me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's mouth turned into a grin so broad that Felicia feared it may snap her face in half. \"Felicia! Oh my... I thought you've been captured by the SSS!\" \"Oh, yeah, they got me alright.\" \"And did you just break out?\" \"Hah, I wish I could say that... But no, it had been hard, real hard. That agent Maria of theirs is one fierce bitch. Kept watch over me most of the time, kept me tied up real good. She also gave me a taste of her feet, quite literally, and...\" Felicia hesitated. \"Oh... it must have been bad...\" Vanessa said grimly. \"They might have been worse than <i>yours</i>, even.\" Vanessa was honestly impressed. \"Really? Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, either way... Even though she usually watched over and tortured me personally, she was gone one day for some reason and sent a team of five other agents in there. Wanted to have a little fun with me as well you see, but after some time, I said I really had to take a pee and they should untie me for that. Well, it looks like they thought <i>Poor little rebel girl, all too weak and useless after smelling our stinky feet, what can she do?</i> Alright, their feet WERE pretty bad as well, but yeah. As soon as they loosened my ropes a bit, I jumped up and gave them one hell of a fight! And yeah, I managed to run, in the end...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shook her head slowly and beamed at her friend all the time. \"You're simply amazing, Felicia. Either way, it's good to have you back! Where was I... oh yeah, the plans. Well basically, this army here will merge with the two other Equmrian ones, all the while pushing forward and when we are finally united at the gates of their capital, we simply storm it!\" Felicia nodded thoughtfully. \"It sounds good enough... But what if they can prevent the merging of our forces somehow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa gave a deep, long sigh. \"That's exactly what I fear right now. We have been able to fend off some of their recent actions, but if the other two armies aren't that successful... This force alone might not be strong enough to take their capital. And if we are stopped for good here, right in the middle of the enemy's land... Then it will be over for good. I don't think there can be another chance.\" <br>\r\nFor once, Felicia gave a deep sigh as well. \"Yeah... let's hope all goes well. Ah! What am I saying!\" Immediatly, her voice was jumpy and high again. \"With the two of us joined together, the entire Stenchlandian army plus all their snobbish agents couldn't stop us!\" Vanessa chuckled as she watched her comrade march outside, fist raised high and singing some sort of battle song loudly. She could only hope that Felicia was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... You know what to do...\" Maria whispered. She was leading a small team of SSS agents, all clad in stealth armor and night vision goggles. Before them was the camp of the northern Equmrian backup-army, which was about to take a rest for the night. Maria was not about to let them. \"...we can't possibly spare enough women to stop those fool entirely, but all we need to do is harassing them endlessly, slowing them down and still returning fast enough to the capital when <i>that girl's</i> army reaches it...\" Maria growled lowly and cracked her knuckles at the thought of Vanessa. \"...so all we need to do is cause some damage and confusion. Then leave before they can strike back. If you take some of them down, all the better, but don't ever leave yourself open to an attack! Understood?\" \"Understood!\" Her small team replied quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next minutes, the black-clad SSS agents ran into the enemy camp. Some sweat-filled boots were cupped over the noses of unfortunate guards and somewhere simply sent down by precise and fierce strikes and before they really knew what was happening, the big commando tent, where their leading commander was sure to be in, was high in flames. Maria and her followers were safely returned to the surrounding woods as the enemies gathered themselves. When they started to actively hunt for the intruder, the SSS women had been long gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria laughed cruelly as she watched some of the people down there put out the fire on the tents while others ran around aimlessly, carrying rifles. Maria and her girls were safely hidden behind many dozens of trees up a hill, from which Maria was gazing down right now. \"Ahhh, beautiful, isn't it? Look at them screaming, running around, shouting at each other. That should give them a good night's rest! I wonder how far they can march, should their hardships continue, don't you girls?\" And they all laughed silently together. <i>Ahh, being at the front is simply the best!</i>, Maria thought, as she began to walk down the other side of the hill, glad she had came to lead this group herself once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attack on the second Equmrian back-up army, many miles in the south, went relatively well as well. Although the first attacks happened flawlessly, the enemy slowed down and confused while the SSS agents were already long gone, it had turned a little worse later on. Their leader wasn't Maria, and on one of their attacks, they finally found themselves completely surrounded by enemies. While they put up a splendid fight, each agent taking at least 10 Equmrians down before falling herself, they were eventually overwhelmed. For the SSS and Stenchlandia as a whole, it was still a good success, as the army was still sufficiently slowed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome days later, Vanessa was gazing nervously at the horizon, where the sun was rising. She turned around and could already see the great Stenchlandian capital in the distance. Yet, none of the two supporting armies were here right now. \"I'm not going to lie to you, Felicia...\" She said to her friend who was standing besides her. \"It's not looking good. Without our support, we might not be able to take the city. And we can't afford to wait either, unless we want the Stenchlandians to combine their forces and come for us. Retreating is out of the question as well; This wild charge was and is our only hope, we won't ever get this chance again even if we manage to get out of Stenchlandia once more... which isn't a given.\" Even the ever-cheerful Felicia remained silent at those heavy words. She just cracked her knuckles as she looked in every direction again and again, as if she could will the armies to appear if only she put enough effort to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Vanessa had to make a decision. Her army was gathered and ready. It was time to move forward. Vanessa knew that there was no other way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Striking at the heavens, Vanessa's fist pierced the air. \"Attack!\" She screamed and everyone seemed to fall absolutely silent for a second. Just as Vanessa began to wonder if perhaps their morale had betrayed them, it became clear that this had just been the literal quiet before the storm: Thousands of men and women alike shouted and cheered with all their energy as the gigantic mass began to pour forward with frightening force. The ground was literally shaking with the thundering of footsteps as Vanessa felt a familiar hand dropping on her shoulder. \"Heh... Even now, in this dark hour you manage to rally their spirits with just one single command. I gotta say, you still got it, Vanessa!\" Felicia beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa sighed heavily one last time before forcing herself to raise her own spirits now. \"...I just hope it's enough.\" \"Ahhh, I'm sure it will go well!\" \"You're... sure?\" Vanessa wrinkled her brow. Felicia couldn't help but giggle. \"Haha, no, not really, but we might as well charge in thinking we will win for certain!\" \"Usually, I'd disagree, but... This isn't really the time for defensive tactics; Time is definitely on their side... So yes, let us charge in with mad fervour! ...If we can break the enemy force apart, we might even stand a chance.\" Vanessa smiled as she rubbed her chin. \"Their numbers are vastly superior, but they probably would expect us to retreat now, seeing how it's obvious to all that our backup armies won't arrive in time!\" \"Those better have a good excuse!\" Felicia chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa nodded before realising that she was now almost at the back of her army, since the others were steadily rushing by; Shouting and cursing and laughing as they went. \"Ahh, let's catch up!\" Vanessa huffed as she ran off as well, hearing Felicia's sing-song voice from somewhere in the mass. \"See you at the front in ten seconds! Huzzah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up you fools! They are already on the move; I'll leave you behind if I have to!\" A hurrying Maria cried out. After having made perfectly sure that Equmria's two backup-armies wouldn't arrive in time, she and her allies had intended to return to the rest of the Stenchlandian army anyway, still waiting at the gates of the capital. However, they had suddenly spotted Vanessa's army going forward once more... And it was very close to the capital already. It wasn't really like Maria and her few girls would have made an importance to her allied forces number-wise, but Maria simply <i>really</i> wanted to be at the front when all hell would break loose. Especially if she had the chance, no, the guarantee of meeting her old nemesis there once again... And finally putting her down for good and maybe keep her as a slave afterwards. <i>Oh yes... she will be there, obviously. And I will cross swords with her personally, I just <b>know </b>it...</i> Maria thought silently as she licked her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, in the end, the incredibly athletic Maria did manage to leave some of her colleagues behind as she sprinted forward unrelentingly. In the end, she did reach her destination just as planned. Only, the battle had already begun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fight, my brothers and sisters! Arrrrrrrrrgh\" Vanessa screamed loudly, in a wild mass of both allies and enemy forces, having just barely evaded an attack. \"We can still do this!\" Vanessa's desperate plan had worked much better than intended. The Stenchlandian troops had well expected a big battle to take place here, but nobody would have thought that the main Equmrian army would charge forward <i>just</i> after their reinforcements had been cut off. In fact, the Stenchlandian army had just begun to prepare for moving out themselves, to overwhelm the Equmrian forces. Ironically, this has left them rather open and Vanessa's army simply charged in on all of them, causing great chaos and disarray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the group Vanessa's army was fighting right now wasn't the main bulk of the Stenchlandian forces, they were still outmatched by numbers. However, their reckless charge had given them just the boost they needed! Unfortunately for the Stenchlandians, the place they were fighting right now was just in front of one of the greater city gates. Because of their strict control of the populace and also because relations to neighbouring factions weren't always good, there were large walls around certain areas in Stenchlandia; On the side of the capital which faced in the direction Equmria lied in, there was one for instance. And that was where Vanessa's army had come from!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant that the Stenchlandian's they were fighting now had the gate on their backs, while they were partially surrounded by walls, with Vanessa's force in front of them... Overally not the worst situation to be, yet this changed when somehow, the gate was damaged. Nobody, not even Vanessa herself knew how it happened, some thought that Equmrian spies sabotaged them somehow, Vanessa kind of suspected Felicia herself of having done something mad or maybe, it had been damaged before and the great fighting in front of it had further damaged it. Either way, with a noise as loud as a thousand bombs exploding, the part of the wall which was around the gate suddenly collapsed, causing everybody in the area to frantically run back a little bit, regardless of factions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dust cleared, it became clear that the Stenchlandian forces were now completely trapped, with a big mess of rubble and debris behind them. This proved absolutely devastating to their morale! \"Now!\" Vanessa screamed with all her might \"This is our chance!\" Now, it wasn't simply fending off a large mass of rebels from their city gates for the defenders. Now, they had become the prey and almost instantly, some of their women began to break away, trying to flee in any way possible. This, of course, made it much easier for Vanessa to attack the rest effectively!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You useless damn cowards! What do you think you're doing? Argh! You'll cost us our victory!\" A very displeased Maria screamed as she realised that despite her best efforts, she had been too late and the Stenchlandian defenders were running away left and right. \"Arrrghh... I'll have you all <i>under my feet</i>!\" she shouted as she fell into a terrible frenzy, blasting away enemy Equmrians with her fists alone seemingly aimlessly. When they realised just who they were dealing with though, many of them decided to make a bit of a distance instinctively... Letting large masses of the remaining defenders run away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey! What are you all waiting- Oh! It's you! Hi!\" A shrill, loud voice suddenly sung out and Maria's eyes almost burned with anger as they spotted Felicia, jumping in her direction. \"<i><b>You</b></i>! You never should have come here; Never should have dared to escape! I don't know what exactly you did but I swear by my name, if I ever manage to catch you again, you will <i>not</i> be free ever again and if I have to bury you alive! And now I'll see to it! Aaaaaaargh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria charged forward with such fervour that both friend and foe was thrown aside by sheer power. Felicia managed to evade once more, jumping aside in that illogical way of hers. Maria had forseen that though and changed her course quickly. <i>Just a bit closer...!</i> Maria thought... Just as she found herself being thrown <i>back</i> all of the sudden, a dull, throbbing pain suddenly becoming existant. \"What...\" \"Oh... And here I was thinking I just saved my friend from some random crazy chick, but look who we have there, the great and powerful Maria!\" Vanessa exclaimed with a smile as Maria slowly staggered to regain her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That... bitch! She kicked me! From a blind spot!!!</i> Maria thought as she rubbed her side, growling like a wild cat as Vanessa changed into a combat stance again. That little pest, Felicia, joined her gladly. \"Yeah! Let's kick her great and powerful butt, what do you say?\" She chirped happily, bouncing up and down. Maria was huffing beastly noises now and it felt as if her mouth was about to start foaming. <i>Those... filthly... little!!!</i> \"Yeah... And then I'll say, force her to smell the feet of us two a little bit, see how she likes her own medicine!\" Vanessa taunted as she stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria simply lost it. Letting loose a scream that made even Vanessa flinch, she charged in and threw everyone inbetween them aside! The last of the Stenchlandians were running away somewhere and even the Equmrian forces were watching silently in awe as Maria got locked up in a fierce duell with both Vanessa and Felicia at the same time! Vanessa would have never thought it possible, someone matching her, maybe, someone matching Felicia, MAYBE, but both of them, at the same time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had proven her wrong. Her attacks were more than wild now, surpassing even the ideas of animalistic; Whatever Vanessa or Felicia tried to do, Maria was there first. And Maria kept attacking with unrelenting fury, knocking both of them back again and again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as Vanessa was feeling the attacks really getting to her, Maria's onslaught ended. Both Vanessa and Felicia were crouching on the ground now, completely exhausted from the continued evading, ducking and blocking of Maria's attacks. Maria also looked a bit dumbfounded as she felt her superhuman rage dwindle away. She swiftly looked to both sides, saw that all of her allies had retreated as well and then exclaimed loudly \"Alright... This'll be a tactical retreat. Don't you think this is over!\" Then, she did retread, although she did not run away as much as stride away proudly. None of the Equmrians had either the strenght, the heart, or simply the courage to try and stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa sighed heavily as she let herself drop to the ground. \"We... have won. Somehow, but... Yes... This battle, we have definity won!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was about to turn night, one day after the shameful loss of the Stenchlandian troops. Maria and hundreds of grim female soldiers of Stenchlandia were awaiting the long overdue attack of the Equmrian forces. This time though, they were ready. This time they would crush these maggots. It just had to work; Maria felt it inside her body. But what had happened exactly after Vanessa's surprising victory?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the defeat had turned out less shattering as Maria had initially expected. Most of the fled soldiers had returned to the Stenchlandian camp, some hours after the battle's end, and therefore Maria had been able to take command again in order to form an acceptable defence line. Some others however had not returned at all. Maria knew that she wasn't able to search for them now, but she promised herself that a search party would be created as soon as possible, and that these cowardly, dishonorable worms would pay for their disobedience! Regardless even of the fact that Maria actually needed every single one for the upcoming fights, she had felt herself obligated to punish some selected soldiers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This will teach them a lesson to never ever run away when being under my command.\"</i>, she had thought while ignoring the muffled screams under her merciless feet. <i>\"And in addition to that, the other soldiers should be reminded that they are fighting for Stenchlandia. Any future disobedience will have very stinky consequences!\"</i> In the late afternoon of the day after the defeat, the best news in a long time had reached Maria. Amber had sent her a note saying that the SSS had initialized a massive recruitment campaign across the whole country and indeed, less than one hour later, a huge number of fresh female soldiers had reached the camp. \"You are really arriving exactly in the right place at the right time, my fellow Stenchlandian fighters!\", Maria had welcomed the newcomers. \"I, or better said, <b>we all</b> don't have time for long speeches now. Drop all the non-relevant equipment and swing your hips to the frontline, ladies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Stenchlandian troops began to arrange themselves into a decent defensive position, they were suddenly able to hear the enemy. Depending on the direction and the force of the wind rushing equally through the Stenchlandian mountains and woods, the sounds of trampling feet, clanking steal equipment and even distant traces of conversation and yelled commands would switch between barely noticeable and alarmingly loud. Encouraged by some worried faces in the ranks of her fighters, Maria began to motivate her party. She jumped on a rock nearby, so that each and everyone could see her. Then she started speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you hear that, brave women of Stenchlandia? This is the sound of our bitter enemies, our abhorrent foes, the dirty Equmrians marching towards us! I would even go so far as to say that they and their perverted equal rights system are our <b>natural enemies</b>! There is no chance to avoid war and battle between our nations, it's either us or them. They won't show mercy and we won't either! Look at how far things have come. These bastards are ridiculing our country by their sheer presence and with our country, they are also ridiculing us! Let us show them tonight, that we won't be the ones being crushed in the end. Steady, courageous and strong for the victory! FOR STENCHLANDIA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was not a single soldier who was not shouting out \"FOR STENCHLANDIA!\" after this speech, the morale was rescued. In the new arising friskiness and self-confidence, it almost got unnoticed, that there were no noises anymore. The dusk had really been approached now; the sky was black, starless, as if mother nature had decided to disdain the inevitably upcoming violence and fighting by denying her calming and consoling light. \"It's quiet.\", Maria stated drily. \"This means that they stopped moving. They are probably already very close and in position to attack, so keep your eyes open and get ready!\" Her words hadn't come one second too late. <br>\r\nOut of nowhere, a hoarse and yet impressive war cry wafted across from the woods in the face off Stenchlandian lines. Maria knew this voice and hoped that she would be finally able to catch and imprison its owner. But there was not much time to think about these things because only seconds after the lone war cry, a huge wave of hundreds of war cries followed. And then they were there..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of Equmrian silhouettes left the protective cover of the woods and rushed towards Maria and the Stenchlandian defense ranks. Within a few seconds the oppressive silence from before the attack turned into an indescribable cacophony of cries, screams, bangs, clattering and groans. Maria herself fought bravely, she felt her Equmrian opponents, male or female, old or young, being no match for her. <br>\r\nUsually she just had to intercept some hesitantly executed attacks, launch one or two absolutely basic counter attacks and her enemy was lying on the ground in front of her, being knocked out for good, or even worse. In this merciless fighting machine mode, Maria usually applied when she was about to fight, hours passed like seconds. Soon enough she had lost all sense of time and just kept going without noticing any   signs of exhaustion. However, despite all her fury, she didn't manage to find either Vanessa or Felicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria already began to think about shouting out their names, hoping for a chance to show them both that they would stand no chance against her superiority, but then suddenly, she noticed how the Equmrians were already retreating. After several hours of fierce fighting, the attackers disappeared into the now old night as fast as the darkness had spat them out before. Slowly but surely this awareness began to spread across the Stenchlandian lines and the at the outset held back cheers soon swelled to roaring cries of victory. <br>\r\nLara Badle, one of Maria's most promising supportive officers suddenly appeared in Maria's field of vision, grinning and saluting. \"Extremely well done, Maria, as always! Tremendous victory!\" Maria nodded in approval. \"You don't need to flatter, Lara. Spare that for our final victory, then I will be expecting a speech from you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously a little bit snubbed, Lara swallowed and continued speaking. \"Yeah, sure Maria, you're probably right..Eeerrrh I mean you <b>are</b> right, as always..I must dare to insist though..Wouldn't it be the best thing to follow them now when they are weak? So we can crush them completely once and for all?\" Maria remained silent for a while and scratched her nose, like she used to do when she was thinking hard. She also wiggled her hot and humid toes inside her fighting boots. Her feet were actually aching! This hadn't been the case in a long while. \"<i>Shit!\"</i>, she thought to herself, <i>\"It would be so good to have a footslave right now..\"</i> But before she could lose herself in the satisfying dreams and thoughts of a man or woman being tied up under her feet, forced to sniff, lick and suck them clean, the asking face of Lara brought her back to reality. \"No, Lara, I don't think so.\", she explained decidedly. <br>\r\n\"We have no idea how high their numbers really are or if they even brought everyone they had for this assault. This could also be a trick of Vanessa and this sneaky Felicia. Maybe the <b>want</b> us to follow them into a trap or an ambush! Also, look around you a bit..we have not exactly been spared from casualties. We need to check how many soldiers we have, who are still able to fight in the near future. Besides, I don't intend to leave our camp completely unprotected and unprepared..no no no, we need some plans. Some <b>good</b> plans! And, at long last, I am very tired and exhausted now to be honest..better said, I just started to notice how tiring the fight actually was. I need to relax a bit and sleep. Tomorrow is another day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing outclassed this heavily argument-wise, Lara couldn't help but biting her lips. \"Ohhhhh, I see. Seems..very..logical and..reasonable. Excuse my ignorance and overhastiness..\" Hearing the disappointment and self-doubt in Lara's voice, Maria couldn't help but smile. Lara reminded her so much of herself, when she just started out her career in the SSS. \"Don't be so strict with yourself, Lara. This is how we learn. Remember what I said and try to think your suggestions through more intensively and creatively the next time! Think like your enemy thinks and you'll be able to predict a lot. Now I allow you to take this evening off and relax a bit. From what I saw you fought extremely well and always remember, keep your feet stinky! Dismissed!\" <br>\r\nLara giggled. \"Oh I will, don't worry officer!\" Then she turned around and disappeared into the crowd of Stenchlandian soldiers carrying away allied and enemy bodies equally, in order to clean up the battlefield.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two months after the last-described victory for Stenchlandia, Maria stood inside her tent. For hours already, she brooded over several maps, reports and aerial photographs, desperately trying to combine all the information she had and convert it into a strategic masterplan. A masterplan, which would finally cause a military breakthrough! However, it seemed very unlikely that today would bring any difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation between the Stenchlandian and the Equmrian armies had very soon after her last great victory developed into a stand-off. Even more than just that; it had developed into a freaking static warfare! One day it went ten miles forwards for the Stenchlandian army and on the next day they would lose those ten miles again. <i>\"At least it doesn't go backwards..\"</i>, Maria tried to motivate herself, but she couldn't help getting more and more frustrated as time went by without any change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had passed every day for the last two months like today, reclusively in her tent, longing for a flash of inspiration. But so far, it had brought her nothing apart from a violent headache every single time. Right now she could already feel how a new one was building up behind her careworn brows. \"AGH!\", she suddenly screamed out loud, while banging her fists on her table in the same time. \"Fuck this!! Fuck me!! Shit, why don't I have any ideas!? Comon, Maria think!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but constantly the pent-up anger and frustration flowed out her body and Maria was able to think clearly again. It was now, when she noticed that her little outburst hadn't gone unnoticed. Unfortunately, a messenger must have had just entered her tent when Maria had been about to lose it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\", she quickly asked in her usual, strict commanding voice she used when speaking with inferiors. Her quick reaction also was an attempt to catch the messenger out and to overact the weakness she had showed before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Officer, ...I mean commander! I'm here to inform you of the newest advancements on the frontlines and in the camp..\" Without doubt, Maria's reaction had made an impact, considering the nervous looks of the messenger and the way her ponytail was shrugging around. One nod of approval was not enough, to make the messenger dare to go on speaking. Instead Maria had to ask \"So..what is it? I've got no time to lose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuhm, the frontlines remain the same again. No breakthrough at any point. Also no enemy attacks. Today at 1 pm, 291 fresh fighters arrived in the camp. They are waiting for instructions. Aaaaand here is a personal letter for you, from Amber.\" With these words, the messenger pulled out a grey envelope and handed it over to Maria. \"Okay, soldier. Tell the officers at the frontline to hold the positions. No more attempts to attack for today. For the freshly arrived backup, go to Lara Badle, I hereby entitle her to take care of that. Now let me read this letter alone. Dismissed!.....Wait a second! To make things clear: No one will ever get to know what you saw before, <b>no one.</b> This static warfare has already damaged our soldiers morale enough, no need for them to think that their commanders are becoming crazy. If I ever find out that you spoke about my little 'moment of weakness' with anyone, I will personally make sure that you'll regret it! Everything clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clear, commander!\", was the only thing the messenger was still able to say, before she left the tent as fast as possible. <i>\"Okay\"</i>, Maria then thought to herself, <i>\"let's read this letter then..\"</i> Since she used her fingers, it took her a while to open it, but eventually the envelope was open and Maria held some handwritten lines of her boss in hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dearest Maria,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear you're doing great at the front. Seems you are not only a very talented (if not the best) special agent, but also a skilled commander. Keep in mind that although it's neither going forwards nor going backwards, it's only a temporary situation. We will win eventually, since we can rely on almost infinite amounts of potential recruits and even volunteers, whereas Equmria seems to run out of supplies soon. I've sent you 291 proven women so that you or your supportive officers can hold the lines as long as it takes to prepare an attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut let's talk about something else. As I already mentioned quite often, you have proven yourself in many ways. I think you deserve some vacation from all the stress. I offer you to take this letter as a ticket home, if you want. Of course, you would have to return to the front immediately if something bad or unsuspected happened but as long as things go well, you can enjoy the pleasures you'll be getting offered here in the capital. You would probably be treated like a celebrity because, what you don't know, here at home everyone has heard of you and your actions. You are kind of a national hero now! Besides, the annual SFA's (Stinkiest Feet Awards) are starting soon. I thought you might enjoy participating in this festival for the first time? Don't dream too much about winning though because I intend to defend my title of the Stinkiest Feet of Stenchlandia!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully I'll see you soon!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber</span></div></div>",

Maybe this little time off will help me clear my mind. Focusing my thoughts... Perhaps then I will come up with the plan I need, the plan we all need!\" Maria slammed her fist down onto the table and began to walk towards the exit. \"And aside... it is a competition, what Amber mentioned there... And one I could very likely win as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maria moved to open up the tent, she heard muffled voices from outside \"Damn... you hear that? The commander's talking to herself again!\" \"No kidding... Poor woman will snap one day if she keeps forcing herself so hard!\" Maria jumped out from her tent. \"Ahh! Holy crap!\" \"I'll show you who the poor woman will be! Come back here, you little-!\" Maria began as she gave chase, but after a short while, she was already out of breath and came to a skidding halt. \"Damn! I really am in a strange shape right now! The more I think about it, the better does the idea of a little vacation sound! Actually, I think I'll start moving right away!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes and a hasty call later, Maria was waiting a bit outside the camp; A SSS helicopter was supposed to come and pick her up. She could have just ordered an armored car or something, but when possible, Maria would try to travel in <i>style</i>! Plus, it'd be a lot quicker. \"Oh! Good meeting you, chief!\" A voice to her right suddenly rung out and Maria turned her head to look at a smiling Lara who was standing straight, saluting. \"Ah... hello.\" Maria said, somewhat lacklustre. \"Say, what are you doing out here? Taking a little break?\" Lara said as she walked closer. Maria frowned; She would have very much liked to tell her subordinate to go away right now since she'd prefer not too many people watching her leaving the front suddenly... But there was something about this Lara, somehow, Maria just couldn't get pissed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... Yes, actually. But not as you think; I'll head back to the capital for a little while.\" \"What?\" Lara screamed, causing Maria to lift one eyebrow. \"You can't do that now, what about the war?\" \"Don't tell me what to do! You forget your position, soldier!\" Maria thundered in return, making Lara shrink down instantly. \"Damn, I'm sorry! Please forgive me!\" \"It's... quite alright. To be honest, it doesn't feel completely right to leave the front now, even to me. But I'm just exhausted, I feel drained, Lara. Besides, it was Amber herself who suggested it and I know better than to argue with her, hehe! Oh, and have you heard of the SFA's?\" \"Ahh... some sort of feet competition, right?\" \"Only Stenchlandia's greatest! And I will win it this time!\" \"Ahh, that sounds marvellous! I'm sure that if you participate there, nobody else might stand a chance!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smirked and said \"Heh, not even Amber? I believe you haven't met Amber's feet yet...\" \"Nobody!\" Lara screamed with burning fervor, making Maria chuckle. <i>Damn, she sure admires me...</i> \"Either way, I just hope you won't miss me too much... I think I can hear the helicopter now!\" Maria said, looking up to the skies and really, the roaring of a helicopters engine was becoming quite noticeable now. \"Huh? You mean I can't go with you?\" Lara asked with a pout. \"Hmm? Of course not; I earned this vacation time by my hard work and all I put into this, you are still pretty new here, I'd say!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... But I have learned so much from you already! I'm sure it would benefit my own skills tremendously if we were together for some longer time! Besides, maybe there'll be some things I can do for you during the stay or so or OH I know, maybe I could even take part in the competition myself!\" \"Heh... hehe...\" Maria just chuckled and shook her head as she listened to Lara's prattle. <i>Normally, if someone tried to sway my opinion or talk back, I'd smack them in the face or worse, yet with this girl... It's just different! Maybe... This COULD get interesting...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what...\" Maria said with a wave oh her hand just as a huge, roaring helicopter came into view and began to descend onto the ground. \"If you really want to, you can come with me. Since I'm also in charge here, obviously, I also doubt that anyone might have a problem with that.\" \"Ah!\" Lara's eyes beamed as she heard that and she began to bounce up and down in place. Suddenly, she stood still again and bowed deeply. \"Many thanks, Commander!\" Maria chuckled and waved her closer as she went to board the helicopter which was beginning its landing right now. \"You know what... I think it's alright if you simply call me Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes into the flight, Lara was looking out of the small window and down on the mass of soldiers below. <i>Oh dear... such vast numbers! And to think... I can't even make out our enemy's forces from here!</i> she thought as she scratched her chin lightly. \"So... Lara. Were you actually serious about joining the competition?\" Maria asked, drawing Lara's attention back to her companion. \"Hmm? Oh yes, absolutely!\" Maria suddenly displayed a curious, almost naughty smirk. \"Well you do know that for you to stand any chance, your feet would have to be absolutely devastating...\" Lara gasped as she saw Maria's hands slide down to her combat boots. \"...Something like... <i>this</i>!\" Maria cheered, removing them with a powerful, fluid motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara remembered catching faint glimpses of the scent of Maria's feet a few times, but it had always been from rather far away... She had always heard that they had to be one of the stinkiest feet in all of Stenchlandia, so how true did those rumors really be? Lara gulped as she felt the air in the small space suddenly heating up and she could feel her eyes starting to water... That was when she took a deep breath, directly through her nose and without thinking. A second later, she was bending over and fighting a violent coughing fit as her senses were overwhelmed with the thick, cheesy smell of Maria's tired feet and gathered sweat. Maria watched Lara squirm in agony as her own feet continued to spread their violent aroma all through the small, confined space, filling it completely with her extremely potent stench in seconds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... Maria, is *gag* Isn't this... *cough* extremely dangerous?\" Lara said with a horrified expression, pointing forward. \"Hmm? Oh, no don't worry about the pilot; The ones who come to pick up me personally are used to bring gas masks at all times... Many have paid a price for this lesson, but oh well...\" And really, the helicopter pilot shortly turned her head back and displayed a shining black gas mask and a thumbs-up to the suffering Lara. \"But, really... Right now, I'd worry more about your own well-being!\" Maria cooed, extending her feet further to her subordinate and lifting them up so she could get a good look at her soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara squirmed a bit; She couldn't contain her disgust as the sweat was slowly dripping down the enormous foot being held directly at her... The cloying, vulgar stench continuously streaming from it was making her nauseas and dizzy, yet Lara did not dare risking to anger Maria by holding her nose or turning away. <i>No! I must show strength!</i> Lara thought defiantly and took a huge, audible sniff... Just as Maria moved her foot almost directly under her face and spread her toes widely. Lara's face paled and her irises shrunk in terror as a huge blast of pure, moist footstench came rushing all over and completely engulfing her head... And streaming through her nose rapidly, engulfing her senses!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Be careful girl, those have been in my boots for all day!\" Maria said with a laugh, retracting her feet a little to give Lara some air. But it was almost too late; Lara was pale as a corpse and slowly swinging back and forth in her seat. \"Yes...\" She mumbled, barely conscious anymore. \"With those feet, you are bound to win for sure! But still... at least check out mine as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria watched closely and with some amusement as Lara's hands descended down to her own feet right now...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though she was barely conscious due to having inhaled the brutal stench of Maria's overpowering feet that closely, Lara managed to give a small smirk as she grabbed the upper part of her own boots. \"I have to admit... That was pretty... breathtaking, but... What to expect from the great and powerful Maria! Even so, I think it would be a shame not to show you what I've got!\" Lara mumbled, that smirk still on her face. Maria found herself chuckling \"Hehe, well, go right ahead! Show me what you got!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara didn't need to be asked a second time! Without hesitation, her boots flew off both at a time and Maria's eyes were instantly glued to her now exposed feet. One thing became obvious instantly; Lara's feet were overall much smaller than Maria's. Although not overly small, they were pretty average in size for a girl of Lara's height; but when held directly next to Maria's, they seemed very small. Maria also noted that Lara's feet were not far behind her own in the sweat department... Much like her own, they were not merely moist with sweat... they were literally dripping with sweat, some of it dripping down on the ground every few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took her first whiff, Maria was shocked as she had to learn that the smell of Lara's feet was quite impressive as well... It was a very heavy, pungent aroma of endless masses of strong cheese and stale sweat. Unlike her own feet, they barely had that certain sour, sharp flavor, instead her feet had a slightly bitter, almost sweet scent mixed in with all the cheesiness, with the distant traces of something corny. All in all, it was absolutely devastating to any nose unfortunately enough to be within their area of effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't quite so bad for Maria, naturally, although it did catch her off-guard and caused her to let a few quiet coughs out. \"Ahh! So, my feet are strong enough even to affect the amazing Maria! I say... Simply amazing!\" Lara was obviously quite pleased with seeing how her feet were causing Maria some discomfort, even if it was by far not as harsh as the stench of Maria's feet was on herself. But still, Lara smiled as she mimicked Maria and lifted her feet up, putting one much closer to Maria and spreading her toes far. \"Hmmm... I have to admit *cough cough* Those are some pretty nice soles you have, girl...\" Maria murmured as she felt waves of moist, warm air wafting over from Lara's sweaty toes, further intensifying the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Lara's feet looked rather delicate from below, they were very slim with a very pale colored sole and relatively long toes for her feet's size. They looked perfectly smooth, like flowing velvet, their tender, soft surface glistening with thousands of tiny sweat droplets like dew on a fresh spring morning. \"So... what do you say? Do you think I might seriously stand a chance?\" Lara beamed. \"Uh, well... Yeah, actually. Not against the likes of Amber's, or mine, but I think your feet will be able to carry you pretty far in the tournament at any rate!\" \"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria soon became somewhat... curious of the stinky foot dangling in front of her. It looked ever so soft that it gave her an irresistible urge to feel them, to see if they really felt as soft as they looked. Maria reached forward and gasped quietly as her fingers gently brushed against the tender skin of Lara's delicate foot. The smoothness of those feet was simply astounding, although her fingertips were wet with the sweat within seconds. Lara's foot suddenly twitched as she gave a startled giggle. \"Hey, that tickles, you know!\" Lara laughed and Maria gave a broad grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you don't like it when I do... <i>this?</i>\" Maria purred softly as she took hold of Lara's ankle with one hand... And then slowly dragged the very tip of her index finger all the way down Lara's foot; From the tip of her big toe down over the ball of the foot, traveling all across the long, shapely sole until it went up her heel again. A crescendo of nerve impulses were sent throughout Lara's foot and she found herself shaking in hysterical laughter. \"Aaaiiiiiiih! Hihihihehehe *gasp* stop, stop this- Huuuaaahhahahahaha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara felt some tears welling in her eyes now as her body continued to vibrate heavily, shaken by uncontrollable laughter. \"Ohhh, I love it when someone's actually affected by this for a chance!\" Maria grinned as she now used four fingers at once to tickle the ball area of Lara's foot. \"Muahaha, you like that, don't you- Hummmphh!\" Something wet and heavy had suddenly hit her squarely in the face! With a tinge of rage Maria realized that Lara had just stuck her other foot straight into her face! Maria's nose was pressed against the toes of Lara and in surprise she had taken in a big whiff, thus inhaling a hearty amount of pure stench directly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Maria experienced a real coughing fit... But it didn't last for long! Moving quickly, Maria brushed Lara's leg aside and sharply pulled her closer by the torso. The helicopter was shaking slightly by the sudden movement which caused the pilot to grumble. \"Hey, what are you doing back there? Cut it out, sheesh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Lara's eyes widened in fear as she saw what Maria was about to do... namely, she saw Maria's own foot coming straight for her face and with Maria's iron grip, she couldn't even try to move away. \"Wait, Maria plea- Hmmmmppghhh!\" Lara's pleading was cut short by a nasty, wet slapping noise as Maria's huge foot placed itself tightly over her face, covering entirely. Lara shivered as she felt the oppressive, hot sole pushed so tightly on her helpless face, drenching it in stale, salty sweat. Her horror intensified as she felt the sole of Maria's foot suddenly pressing tightly on her lips and Maria saying \"Whoa, not bad, I have to admit, but... Try <i>these</i> for a change!\" Just as she spread her large, deadly toes directly over Lara's poor nose! Lara had no choice but to inhale and instantly, her lungs were filled with the most noxious, disgusting stench she had ever smelled before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Lara's entire body was shaking as Maria simply let her foot do all of the work, letting it lie in place perfectly still. It was more than enough. Withing minutes of pained and forced sniffing, Lara finally became limp. Maria sighed and shook her head. \"...I kind of got carried away here...\" She said to herself and looked out of the window for a change to see the helicopter was just about to land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems we have reached the destination safe and sound, commander, now what- What the heck has happened here?\" Maria turned her head to see the pilot looking back at an unconscious Lara and Maria's huge, naked feet. \"Uhm... nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing that would concern you, at least!\" She said, putting a bit more authority in her voice. \"Oh... I understand, sorry commander!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome minutes later, Maria was walking away from the helicopter, with Lara stumbling behind her. \"Well I say... that had been most, ah... impressive.\" She said weakly, rubbing her face. \"Agh, don't you complain. Just holding your feet in my face like that; If another one of my subordinates did that to me, they'd end as my foot slaves for at least a week!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously and with all due respect, commander... What were you doing here?\" The pilot asked from behind, having taken her shielding mask off and instantly backing away from the reeking helicopter. \"Not concerning me... It looks like my machine will stink like hell from now on!\" \"Ah, don't worry!\" Lara chimed in. \"We have just been, uhm... Expressing a token of our promising mutual friendship.\" \"What?\" Maria and the pilot said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In... any way... We should head into the city now, Lara... If what Amber says is right, then the people will be looking forward to seeing me again... Heh, maybe even celebrating me as a NATIONAL HERO, or something! Not that I didn't deserve it, but yeah, that's something alright!\" Maria said to Lara, grinning. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Maria was walking on a broad street in the middle of the capital. She knew that street very well; It would lead her to the SSS headquarters, a path that she had walked countless of times before. Next to her was the amazed Lara, staring in awe at all the faces that turned towards Maria as she strode by, beaming, saluting and waving at her. \"See?\" Maria said with a smirk, glancing at Lara sideways without turning her head. \"National hero.\" To prove this, Maria simply raised one hand and returned the waving motion, causing dozens of the surrounding women to cheer loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's that famous agent!\" \"Maria! Maria is back!\" \"This woman... I hear she might be stronger than the current leader of the SSS!\" Lara couldn't help but grin widely as she heard the voices of the surrounding citizens praising her mentor so. \"Well, I'll be... you truly are a hero!\" She said in awe, making Maria shrug and reply \"Ah, all I do is serving my beloved motherland and our righteous principles, like all of us should do.\", although it was obvious that Maria enjoyed the whole thing a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Lara turned around and saw that many of the citizens were closeby still. \"It seems to me they are following us now...\" \"Hmm?\" Maria said, glancing back. \"Oh yeah, looks like they are. Maybe they expect a speech or something. Or they just want to bask in my glory some more, bwahaha!\" Lara giggled, though the idea of that didn't seem to be so abstract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after that, they reached the front entrance of the SSS headquarters and before they could even walk closer, the doors suddenly flew open and a very happy Amber stormed out. \"Maria! I was informed of your arrival already! It's so good to see you again!\" Amber rushed down to her subordinate like the wind and then stomped her heels together with a force that almost cracked the concrete, followed by a salute so sharp that her hand cut through the air like a sword cutting bamboo. Maria mirrored the gesture perfectly and Lara swiftly attempted to do so as well, as she realised that this woman in front of her was not just her superior, but her <i>bosses</i> boss as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! And who might this lovely lady be?\" Amber said lightly, although Lara could feel herself being scanned up and down as Amber's piercing gaze wandered all over herself. \"Yes Ma'am! The name is Lara, Ma'am!\" She replied instantly. \"She is pretty much my, uh... personal assistant of sorts?\" Maria wondered. \"Advisor, lady, part-time rogue... And at your command, Ma'am!\" Lara said smiling, saluting once more. \"Yup. That. She's also shown great potential to me recently, back at the front lines a few miles south-east from here and even better, she's going to compete as well!\" \"Ahhh, yes!\" Amber said, snipping her fingers. \"The tournament! Hehe, are you looking forward to congratulate me when I win again, this year?\" Amber teased, her grin broadening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's grin grew as well, showing her fang-like teeth \"Not this time, Amber... I will give you a nice pat on shoulder from the top of the podium though, when you are standing next to me, on second place.\" \"Ohoho, I accept your challenge!\" Now they were shaking hands, but Amber and Maria stared at each other with such fire in their eyes that Lara feared they would jump at each other's throats here and there. Fortunately, they didn't and Amber instead turned her head a bit and whistled as she saw all the amassed people down there, who had been walking behind her all the time. \"Hey, nice crowd you amassed there! Planning to give a speech?\" she asked, but Maria just shrugged and scratched her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I'm not too fond of giving speeched, unless maybe if it's about encouraging my fellow agents and soldiers into SMASHING our enemies to pieces, but yeah... That's hard to do right here, isn't it? Heh, I could ask them if they have nothing better to do then just standing around here and-\" \"No, no, this will not do. Think about it, many of these are capable women who might serve us even better if given just the right motivation. Don't get me wrong; I do make sure <i>all</i> our citizens are properly motivated to our cause, but still... Hearing you talk would be something special!\" Amber urged. \"Ah, alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria took a deep breath and looked up for a second, at the high, imposing SSS building. The time and place for such a thing were superb, she couldn't deny that. \"Good citizens of Stenchlandia! Yes, I have returned for the time being!\" She started, turning around dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire crowd stopped murmuring and talking instantly, all eyes glued on the imposing Maria. \"My fights have been many, hard and demanding. Yet I do not mind giving everything I have if it is in order to serve our glorious, beloved nation and our truthful cause!\" Now the crowd cheered and Maria made a small pause, smirking slightly. \"Needless to say, all these battles have been overwhelming successes for our side!\" <i>Can't hurt to stretch the truth a bit, here and there... Besides, who would object to something like this, here and now?</i>, Maria thought \"Oh yes, we drove the rebels out of our beloved, sacred land just as they deserve it, and when they came crawling back, having cowardly persuaded the dishonorable Equmrians to save their sorry asses somehow, we've done nothing than <b>kicking</b> said asses over and over again! Kicked some Equmrian scum, too!\" Now, many of the listeners were loudly cheering, laughing or screaming something. <i>Now this point is important...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However!\" Maria thundered with all her might, silencing them all once more \"We must not forget that this war still isn't completely over. Right now, the enemy forces are sulking around in our territory still. Needless to say, we have them completely surrounded as we speak, they are out-matched and out-gunned. But still, one must not forget that a cornered rat, no matter how lowly, treacherous and dirty it might be, can still inflict damage if it is not handled with care. Therefore! I need- No, our wondrous <b>nation</b> needs every single one of <b>you</b>!\" Maria said with such fervour that it was almost outright screaming, pointing into the mass and slowly moving her index finger around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, every single one of you! You, the strong, superior women on who our land is standing on, you are our greatest strenght. You must never forget that this strenght will be needed if we are to remain at the absolute top... So that our glory and power will be remembered for <b>ten thousand years!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Maria was finished and she gave a graceful little bow as the crowd began to scream in joy and burning, zealous spirit. As she turned back around, Maria allowed herself to grin very widely once more and whisper \"Well, how was I?\" \"Ohhh, absolutely astounding! It was beyond amazing; I could feel my very spirit being lifted as those truthtful, inspiring words of morale and wisdom enriched my entire self! It was flawless, marvelous!\" Lara sighed, drooping with admiration. \"It was good.\" Amber said, with a curt nod of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me! I have one question, if you don't mind...\" a light, clear voice suddenly rang out. Maria and Amber dropped their smiles and Lara looked downright angry. \"Someone dares to <i>question</i> Maria, at a place like this?\" she angrily said, but Maria shrugged and said \"Ah well, I was happy that I got this over with, but... Alright, let's see what that girl has to say. Nobody would be stupid enough to say something wrong right in front of thousands of witnesses, not to mention Amber and myself.\" Maria turned around once more and squinted her eyes. \"Yes? Show yourself, then you may ask!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Very well... Here I am!\" That same voice rang out once more. But this time, the crowd around its source dissipated swiftly, exposing a single girl standing there in the middle, defiantly. She had a strange, angry expession on her face that annoyed Maria on the spot. <i>What the hell is HER problem?</i> she thought, but instead she swallowed once and then said \"Yes?\" in a more demanding tone than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl needlessly ran one hand through her auburn, shoulder-length hair before she deemed it timely to give her response. \"My name is Kate!\" \"<i>that wasn't really what I asked her...</i>\" Maria whispered to herself. \"And my question is the following: How come you are here, standing in the safety of our capital while preaching to us about fighting on the front?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, everbody else in the crowd shrieked and cried out in panicked disbelief! Each and every one of them moved further away from Kate, leaving her fully exposed to the deathly glare of the three SSS agents in front of her. <i>Damn... what IS with her? Surely, she must have a greater idea behind doing something like that... But it doesn't matter, I suppose she has already dug her own grave...</i>, Maria thought, while Amber was shouting loudly \"Unacceptable! Seize that girl at once!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, a group of four SSS guards who had been standing close to the entrance as well rushed over to Kate. \"Hold on a moment, please...\" Maria said, holding out the palm of her hand. The agents hesitated for a moment; Daring neither to defy Maria nor Amber. \"Fine. Just do as she says...\" Amber said, waving her hand. \"<i>Do you plan to let her speak?</i>\" Amber whispered into Maria's ear. \"<i>I think she may be planning something...</i>\" Maria responded \"<i>I'm getting the feeling as well, to be honest, but... why not just interrogate her somewhere in seclusion?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" The cutting voice of Kate chimed in, making Maria's eyes snap to the front again. The look in Kate's face instantly pissed Maria off again, making her clench her fist. <i>No, no... let's just play along for a while...</i> \"Well, my dear Kate... The thing is just, I did fight at the front. For a long time, too. I just came back  here right away. Surely, you're just a little confused, aren't you?\" \"No! I mean, why did you come back then, if you didn't finish your job? Did you become lazy and scared? Decided to give it all up, suddenly?\" Maria clenched her teeth, silently. <i>Well the last thing I should do would be blindly giving into her provocations, now. I guess it would be best if-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's line of thought was broken as she felt something rush forward next to her. There was Lara, and her face was red like a ripe tomato, out of sheer rage! \"You bloody heretic! You dare question the honor of our nation's greatest hero?\" \"That didn't answer my question!\" Kate replied with a smug grin, causing both Maria and Lara to utter a hiss of anger. \"Oh well? Let me explain it to you: Our war is going on right now; Splendidly so due to Maria's wise tactical movements. As mentioned, both our and their troops are out there, in our territorry. That means of course, they will slowly suffer from attrition while we can easily keep up our line of supply. Furthermore, what else could contribute so much to a person's honor than return to the heart of their nation and to inspire the loyal people there, personally? If anything, this has even increased my opinion of Maria!\" Lara was beaming, a triumphant grin on her face. <i>You fool! You just gave her just what she expected... although what she intends to do, I have no idea...</i> Maria herself thought whilst looking back to Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely enough, that irritating girl still had that smirk on hers on her face. \"Is that so... Well, you must be a bigger fool than I thought!\" Kate hissed and Lara failed to contain her anger this time. \"Aaarrrrgh! I'll smash you into a fine, red mist!!!\" she screamed, attempting to rush forward... But it only took Maria the fraction of a second to step forward and hold her by the shoulder. \"Please... no. Agents, you may take hold of her now!\" She commanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, the four women in their shining black were at Kate, twisting her arms behind her back and holding her tightly. \"And... another thing...\" Maria said, taking out a small piece of paper and scribbling something on it. \"...Take her to this adress. Make sure to guard her well until further notice. That's all.\" Maria continued, crunching the paper into a ball and throwing it at one of the agents, who caught it and unfolded it again. \"Yes! Consider it done!\" She replied, before leading Kate away with her comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Maria sighed, letting her gaze wander a bit and realising that most of the crowd had left the premises now anyway \"I guess this is over now. Somehow, I get the feeling we haven't heard the last of that girl.\" \"I... really don't understand it. I made <i>sure</i> that everybody who thinks like this is in a fitting place right now, be it a slave market, a prison cell or something like that...\" Amber said, scratching her chin. \"There must be <i>something</i>...\" \"Yes, this girl wasn't the common rebel type. It almost seems like she did that on purpose. Was it her plan all along to get caught like that? A saboteur maybe or... some sort of terrorist?\" Maria wondered. \"Not a bad thought... I'll call my guards right away and let them know they should check this... Kate... for some sorts of hidden explosives or the likes. Meanwhile... Why don't you head to the arena? The tornament will be starting tomorrow and regular participants are required to sign up some time before that. Of course, there's no way something like that would be required for me or you, but still, I think you might want to go there anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right...\" Maria had been watching the annual tornament for some time, yet she had never really been INSIDE the arena... Or the rooms the participants would be in before upcoming battles. Of course Amber had, being the champion and all, so it wouldn't hurt to check it out in advance as well. \"Yeah, let's go there, Lara. I'm sure if they make an exception for me, they'll let my faithful part-advising lady rogue, or how you called it, in as well!\" \"Ah, yes... Certainly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, they were off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So... here it is!\" Maria exclaimed, pointing onward. The thing she pointed at really wasn't that hard to miss! The SFA tournament arena was a huge building, built to resemble the ancient colosseum of Rome, only that this one was made of shiny metal instead of stone. \"Wow... I must say, the vast size of this structure does exceed even my most vivid expectations!\" Lara marveled in awe. \"Of course! We can't decide who has the best feet in the whole Stenchlandia in any boring, old house, now can we? Let's go inside; I bet some of the participants are already inside...\" Maria said, a grin flickering over her face as she imagined herself beating countless of other girls with the sheer force of her god-like feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, they reached the entrance, guarded by two women in exceptionally ornate uniforms. \"Halt! Do you have- Ah!\" One of them began as she spotted Maria and Lara, but soon corrected herself as she realised just who she was talking to \"You're that famous commander, aren't you? How may I help you, ma'am?\" she said with a salute. Maria returned the gesture. \"You can refer to me as Maria, just like that. Oh and yeah, I wish to take part in the upcoming tournament, I know that usually, one has to make a reservation quite some time before, but-\" \"Oh! It's no problem, no problem at all! For the famous, no... <i>exalted</i> Maria, we will of course make an exception!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smirked and rolled her eyes at Lara, who had to stiff a giggle. \"Oh yes, and... This is my personal assistant. I'm sure it will be no problem if she participates as well, or...\" \"Ah...\" This time, the guard did hesitate. But only for a second. \"Err, no, of course it's no problem.\" The guard cleared her throat and stepped aside with an overly large step. \"This way leads to the spectators area. This way to the participants chambers.\" Maria smiled and gave a curt nod. \"Thank you very much. Come, Lara.\" Lara grinned and waved at the guards as she hurried by, but they ignored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you smell that? *sniiiiiiiiiiff* Ahhh! It smells just like an upcoming battle! Or more... like the middle of an especially heated battle!\" Maria smiled as she opened the door. \"*Sniff* Urrrgg... That scent reminds me rather of unwashed feet, if you ask me...\" Lara groaned, moving her hand to her face. Maria disapproved. \"I wouldn't do that if I were you... Don't make yourself seem weak before you even start the fight!\" She hissed, and Lara promply put her hands back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been right, though. The stench in this room was almost unbearable; It reeked of old sweat, well-worn shoes or boots and mostly, of sweaty, rank feet. Even Maria had to fight down the urge to shudder as she proudly and loudly smelled the air in here. Everybody might as well know right now that she's made of tougher stuff! As the two of them walked a few steps, they came across the first few contestants. Most of them wore regular clothing, some uniforms, but all of them who'se feet weren't bare wore the same kind of footwear: A very hard, sturdy looking thing that could be called some kind of combat boot, made of shiny, black leather. There was no doubt that every foot would sweat like hell when enclosed in those things, let alone feet of women such as Maria, which basically sweat all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria saw some of the girls in here making sort of stretches or running in place for some reason, maybe to help their feet build a stronger stench. Some of them were sniffing their own feet or boots every now and then, to judge if they were smelly enough already. Some were even smelling the feet of <i>other</i> women in-between, maybe to see if their own could beat them, either way it seemed rather strange to Maria. \"Aha! I could beat that! *Sniff sniff* Oh yes! I could beat that! *Sniff*\" Maria heard one of them mutter, burying her face in some other girl's soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! If it isn't the great and mighty Maria!\" Maria heard someone from her right say. Unlike the guard however, this one sounded quite sarcastic. \"Think you can waltz in here just because you're so famous! Oh well, just wait until you face some true <i>warrior's</i> feet!\" some rather unimpressive looking girl with wild, black hair hissed, drawing closer. Maria put on one especially cruel smirk. \"Say... I trust you never came near my actual feet, have you?\" She said, very quietly. \"I... no! So what?\" \"Well, see for yourself!\" Maria said, suddenly charging forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Lara jumped back, yelping as Maria swiftly seized the other girl by her neck and wrestled her down on her knees. \"Ahhh! What are you doing! It's against the rules to do anything to a-\" \"Ahh, I just wanted to make you see for yourself!\" Maria shouted, pulling one foot out of her boots. The effect was instant! Like a tidal wave, the stench in the room instensified, instantly drawing the attention of anybody around. Lara steeled herself with all her will and kept standing straight, but many of the other girls began holding their faces or turning around, coughing and gagging. The girl in Maria's grasp had it even worse, of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive large, steaming toes were wriggling right under her nose, followed by a seemingly endless, glistering wall of moist sole. Maria's victim struggled in vain. \"Well, then... Smell my feet!\" Maria laughed, pushing her dripping wet, hot sweaty foot directly into the girl's face! She could smell it herself... the aroma of her feet was bringing a tear even to her own eyes! Her feet were obviously in a <i>very</i> good shape! Of course, this was nothing compared to what her victim had to go through!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling some more, Maria pushed the shapely ball of her foot hard against the girl's lips, while spreading her large toes all over her nose area. Maria watched in amazement as her victim struggled and twitched as the horribly foul, sharp and cheesy odor of Maria's stinky foot wrecked havoc on her senses! She didn't last very long, either, before her eyes slowly closed and her whole body went limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Maria said, letting the body drop. \"Does anybody else feel like challenging me?\" Right then, anyone except Lara had backed away as far as possible, downright horryfied at the display of Maria's powers. \"Good...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, they were walking out again. \"Well... this had been fun! ...if a bit short.\" Maria giggled and Lara shrugged her shoulders. \"Well, I didn't get to see so much of the actual interior, however, I did see <i>quite</i> an impressive something, if I dare say so. The guards at the front were obviously in some distress as they walked out next to them. Had anyone else just knocked out one of the contestants one day before the tournament, they would have stepped in an arrested them, instantly. But of course, the guards did not dare raise a finger against Maria. Lara smiled knowingly as she strode past them, waving once more. This time, they scowled at her darkly, but kept quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying? There's no way she'd take a vacation at a time like this!\" Vanessa said hotly. \"Ehh, I'm not so sure. Haven't you heard of the SFA?\" Felicia returned with a shrug. \"The SF- what now? No, and why should I? We're fighting a <i>war</i> here, remember?\" \"Well, it's just <i>the</i> event in Stenchlandia, you know... The \"Smelliest Feet Awards\", duh! Even I know of that, and I'm not a big fan of Stenchlandia in general...\" \"Well, no doubt in that, but...\" Vanessa gave a sigh and finally looked up from the map she had stared down on, shifting her gaze into Felicia's sparkling eyes. \"Do you really think Maria would leave the front for that?\" \"Yes!\" \"I... just can't imagine that. With somebody else, yeah, maybe, but removing the most potent commander when they are still most needed is just so unlogical. I can't see Maria doing something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, think about it: Maybe she knows you're thinking that, and uses this to hold you back here!\" Felicia exclaimed, slamming her palms down the table. Vanessa raised a brow. \"Would she go that far...\" \"From what I've gathered, the title of that award has been going to someone else, some even higher ranking SSS chick, I think, for the past few years. No doubt Maria wants that title. What if she's certain we would hesitate, claim the title in the meantime and THEN come back with a counterattack for us?\" \"Hmm, yes... The fights had been pretty stagnant lately... So do you propose to...?\" \"Yes... I say we attack as soon as possible. Without their supreme commander, the enemy forces will be much easier to deal with. Besides, I think nobody expects us to attack right now, at least Maria obviously didn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but that's if she really <i>is</i> gone... What if you're wrong and she's expecting us to do exactly what you're saying?\" \"Well... the thing is, we can't hold out much longer here, anyway. If we won't move now, they surely will. <i>He who dares, wins</i>, or something.\" Felicia said with a sad smile. Vanessa kept staring down for a while, before letting out one especially deep and heavy sigh. \"...I suppose you are right. We'll get the troops ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh, I just <b>love</b> this vacation!\" Maria beamed as they were walking back to the apartment she and Lara would be using tonight. \"Tomorrow is going to be big day and you know what? The adress I had that crazy rebel delivered to earlier? It's exactly where we will be staying! Hah!\" \"Do you intend to question her right today?\" Lara wondered. \"Hmmm... maybe, maybe. Either way, I'll probably run around the city a little bit. Get my little feetsies extra ready for tomorrow, you know.\" \"Yes... good idea! I will join you, if you don't mind!\" \"Hah! If you can keep up... Here we go! <i>Los!</i>\" Maria screamed, running off suddenly, in the direction of their apartment. \"Oh, I will impress you, somehow...\" Lara said smirking, as she dashed off herself.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh... this is a bummer. And I worked so hard last night!\" Maria said slouching her shoulder as she looked at a crew of women clad in protective gear and gasmasks with a big sign above them that read <i>All participants need to have their feet cleaned, due to reasons of fair play</i>. \"Haha, what you didn't know?\" A boisterous voice from Maria's left suddenly announced. \"Amber! Heh, we meet again every time, don't we? And yeah... I didn't know.\" Maria said with a grin. \"Yeah, it's a rule. After all, it would be possible for the girls to cheat if we didn't do that.\" \"Cheat... like how?\" \"Well, you know these socks of mine that I sent you as a secret weapon to the front? One participant once applied a weapon like that to her own feet... though they hadn't been <i>my</i> socks, they still were pretty strong... Either way, her feet ruled but once we found those socks and then cleaned her feet, let her get them smelly again and tested them anew, what do you think? They were almost scentless.\" Amber sneered. \"After that, I made sure she got a whole lot of socks. Mostly stuffed in her face, and some of them even my personal ones!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You reap what you sow, eh? Haha, good riddance. So... since you did that a few times, this whole contest I mean-\" \"You mean I <i>won</i> it a few times!\" \"Yeah, yeah. Could you tell us how exactly it will be done?\" Maria asked, scratching her head. \"Hmm? You didn't inform yourself before this?\" \"Nah. Yesterday, the both of us kept running for a long time and when we got to the apartment, both of us fell asleep almost instantly.\" \"It's true, it's true!\" Lara chimed in \"Maria almost fell asleep right on the floor. She didn't even bother taking those boots of hers off!\" \"Heh, and be thankful of that, otherwise you would still be knocked out right now...\" Maria said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, anyway... Like you just found out; First, they will rid our feet from every trace of sweat or smell, using brushes and water and whatnot. Nothing that has any scent of its own though, of course.\" \"That would be even more ridiculous...\" \"Then, we get our official tournament footwear and are allowed to do as we please for about 20 minutes, or so.\" Amber said. \"Oh... only 20 minutes? But that's quite the short time, if I might say so. It will be difficult to cultivate a proper foot odour in such a short timespan...\" Lara mumbled, tapping her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, that's actually the point of it. The strenght of our feet's smell will be judged by some volunteers.\" \"Hahaha, yeah, I love 'volunteers' like that!\" Maria laughed. \"Well, they're actually kind of volunteers. Mostly prisoners and personal slaves. We make them this offer: If they manage to remain conscious for at least five rounds, we will release them. So far, I think there have been five or so people who actually pulled it off. Surprisingly, all of them had been arrested again within days.\" Amber said, flashing her darkest grin. \"Hahaha, oh yeah like I said, I just <i>love</i> volunteers like that!\" Maria giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying: The point is not to knock every one of them out in the first rounds. As the contestents progress further towards the finals, their feet get deadlier and deadlier. In the beginning, the volunteers will tell which of the contestant had the smellier feet. Towards the end, we will try to judge who passed out first!\" \"Ohhhh... I like this idea!\" Maria said, smacking her fists together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, ladies... please form a queue and enter the cleaning room in a calm and orderly way.\" A lady in a striking white white gasmask said, clapping her hands twice. \"Alright! Let's do this!\" Maria said with an eager grin. As it turned out, it would take some time for her to get her place as several other women had been in front of her, even though they always allowed five girls at once inside that room. One thing however became clear very soon: Something was off about the whole thing; The closer Maria got to the door in front of her, the better she could hear muffled giggles, some pieces of strange talk and here and there even a loud shriek. \"Ahh, don't worry about those...\" Amber said waving her hand, even now she wasn't far from Maria. \"Of course, everybody is allowed to sign in for this tournament... However, it may happen sometimes that quite a few drop out early... Very early.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm? I do beg your pardon, but whatever do you mean by that?\" Lara asked, cocking her head. Amber had no time to respond properly, as a loud \"The next, please!\" indicated it was time for Maria, Lara (Who was literally right behind Maria) and three other women to enter the room. \"Ahh, you'll see!\" Was all that Amber said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Maria was inside that room, it became obvious why the staff here wore gas masks all the time. She wasn't sure if this condition was due to the participants having prepared themselves before this day (Like she did herself) or were just really talented foot-warriors at any time (Like she was herself, too), but the air inside the room absolutely stunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reminded Maria a lot of some locker room, as if an entire regiment of Stenchlandian soldiers had just taken off their combat boots and given their poor, tired feet some well-needed time to air out. But even though the smell was very strong, it hardly did as much as bother Maria at all. After all, even taking her own boots or shoes off in a confined space had an equaly strong, if not stronger effect. While Maria took the blunt stench like the true woman she was and even Lara showed only slight signs of discomfort, it was now becoming obvious what Amber had meant with some of the girls dropping out early: Two of the other women were obviously much more affected by the putrid smell of sweat and feet, one of them scrunching up her face with tearing eyes, but at least still taking the pain honorably, while the other one was downright gagging on it, before holding her nose. Maria noticed the disapproving scowls the others, including the staff women gave her and couldn't help but grin: If she was suffering now, how would it be after <i>she </i> took off her boots? Maria couldn't wait to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she didn't have to wait for very long: Each of them were showed to a plain white chair on which they were sat, with a forked pole in front in front of it on which they were to place their feet. Without much further ado, the cleaning crew moved in to begin their business: With some quick, precise movements of their nimble fingers, all of the feet were instantly freed. \"Ahh... This one will be a tough one...\" Maria heard the muffled voice of the gas-masked woman in front of her say, staring in disbelief at her gigantic, shapely feet, blazing hot and dripping with acrid footsweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Maria looked to her left and saw the girl closest to herself in visible agony as she now got a whiff of Maria's much stronger than her own foot aroma. The staff girls were getting out small things looking a lot like electric toothbrushes. \"Just be careful what you do to my divine feet...\" Maria growled, eyeing the thing with suspicion \"If you piss me off, I'll conduct some foot-related experiments on my own, with you of course!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the click of a small button, the tiny things sprung into life; The small brush head starting to rotate automatically, while also spraying a fine mist of water all around. Maria felt a tinge running all across her spine as the instrument touched the naked sole of her foot and began to brush it eagerly, but she remained perfectly still and without emotion; not a muscle on her iron face moving. Again, the girl to Maria's left was not as fortunate: as soon as the rotating brush touched her foot, she flinched and giggled loudly and shamelessly as it moved all across it. \"Aaaaiiii! Ahahaha... Don't- don't make it so fahahahahaaaaaast! It's... *gasp* tickling!\" She yelped, tears beginning to form in her eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can't- let me go! Hmmmmpphhh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl suddenly felt herself unable to speak as a generous strip of the tape was placed over her lips. \"Oh yes, we can. You know, such weaklings like you really have no chance in the tournament anyway, all you do is waste out precious time. Don't you dare complain about this, as well!\" One of the cleaning crew members said, grabbing another chair and sitting down in front of the girl. \"Actually... I think I'll just sit back and relax while I finish your cleaning.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bound girl eyes her suspiciously as she brought her feet up and rested them in front of her face. Horror began to show in her eyes as the crew girl took her shoes of, releasing a pair of shiningly wet feet, directly under her nose. \"Too bad for you my feet are in about as clean a condition as yours... Working all day in these temperatures can do this to you, you know...\" She said with a sigh, spreading her moist toes widely. The poor, gift-wrapped girl began to pale as horrid tendrils of cheesy smell now wafted all over her face... And with her mouth taped shut, she had no choice but to smell them. Even though the feet in front of her smelled absolutely disgusting, it was tolerable if she smelled slowly and not too deep... That was, until the staff woman began to apply her cleaning brush to her victim's feet once more, causing her entire body to shake as the tickling sensation overwhelmed her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no way to use her mouth, she instinctively breathed out hard over and over again, through her nose... And had no choice but to breath in once more, thus directly sniffing those horribly smelly feet being held in her face! Distant traces of well-aged cheese, vinegar and the interior of well worn shoes painted the rich bouquett of pure stench as the girl's senses were flushed with the sensation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria barely registered a voice much closer to her speaking \"Hey, I said we are finished. You can go now.\" \"Ahh... ah yes, thank you...\" Maria said absent-mindedly as she watched that other girl, still bound and gagged, the slimy foot now literally rubbing in her face. \"Don't worry about that one... Early disqualifications by sudden, unexpected fainting happen here, all the time.\" One of the cleaning girls said, winking. Maria cleared her throat as she finally broke her gaze of that spectacle. \"Yup, no doubt on that. Oh well, let's go Lara!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally left the room again, Lara gave an audible sigh \"I say... that had been a tad harder to endure than I thought it would be... More importantly, it somehow feels like an eternity is passing until the actual tournament does finally start!\" \"It doesn, doesn't it?\" Maria agreed. \"But don't worry, at least right now, I'm sure it's right around the corner!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the shenanigans in that cleaning room were over, Maria and Lara swiftly crossed the corridor leading away from it, towards the place where they would be handed their official footwear. At that same station, their old shoes were handed over and locked into small, tightly-locked safes. Probably not because anyone wanted to steal them, but rather to keep all the putrid smell locked away. The poor girl who had to handle Maria's shoes visibly paled as she was handed over the big, steaming things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you give me something that fits my awesome feet perfectly...\" Maria said nonchalantly, looking at her fingernails. \"Or else my shoes won't be the worst thing I make you smell in the near future...\" It was amazing that she could find a pair that large so quickly, but the girl behind the counter handed Maria her combat gear in record time: A pair of gleaming black, tough looking low leather boots. Maria regarded them fondly for a moment, she was pretty certain that they would keep any feet completely airtight at any time. As she put them on she smiled: They did fit like a glove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara and pretty much everyone else was clad in these exact type of boots swiftly, and soon some speakers on the walls announced: \"The first rounds will begin in 20 minutes. You will be matched randomly against your co-competitors. Until then, you have the chance to prepare your feet properly. Good luck!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria instantly pumped her fist and yelled \"Yeah! Finally! Let's do this!\" and began her warm up right away. Soon enough, when the time was finally over, her head was red and sweat was pouring down profusely. Maria wiggled her toes and felt them squish and slide around in her gathered footsweat. She smirked \"Alright! Let's waste them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's wish was soon to be granted as not too long after that the first rounds were beginning and the first group of participants was being sent out into the arena. Even though the arena itself was absolutely massive, it was not possible to have all the combatants out there at the same time, since there were simply that many. Instead, they always let as many participants in as possible. The fact which determined how many could be in there at the same time was of course the number of the unfortunate test subjects: Poorly clad men and women, blindfolded and gagged, bound in place were staying in their designated spots, each in front of a chair that would allow their tormentors to sit on and hold both of their feet straight into their victim's face! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arena as a whole looked very much like you'd expect an old roman amphitheatre to look, except everything was incredibly modern. Instead of a crumbly stone structure, you had perfectly durable, strong gleaming steel constructs. Instead of the plain stone rows serving as the spectator's places, there were comfortable seat; not unlike those in a regular sport arena, except more luxurious. And finally, instead of the combatants (And their victims) just playing around in the dirt like cavemen, numerous separated glass cells were present in the field. These were the places the real competing and judging would be taking place, they were also connected to cameras and huge monitors outside meant for a better viewing pleasure for the spectators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are really sure about this?\" An agitated Vanessa downright screamed at a very nervous looking scout. \"Oh hey, Vanessa! What's going on?\" chirped Felicia, who had been drawn to the scene by Vanessa's excited voice. \"Ah Felicia, good that you're here... This is big news! Remember this thing about the Stenchlandian Foot Tourney?\" Felicia scratched her jaw, tilting her head sideways. \"I think it was called-\" \"It doesn't matter! We've just received message that not only our old friend Maria is right there, but a large number of other high-ranking officers and agents as well... Including the direct boss of Maria, even!\" Vanessa was getting so excited that she was downright running out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia seemed to ponder about it for a moment. \"Well, it IS supposed to have the smelliest feet of the entire country competing against each other. It would only make sense for their best not to miss this chance!\" Vanessa shook her head \"No, it would make sense for them not to turn their backs on the raging battlefield just outside their capital. Lowering their defences like this NOW... It seems downright <i>foolish </i>to me. Not at all how I expect Maria to act!\" \"You're right, but as things stand right now, our position isn't looking too good for us, if truth be told. Both our field troops are basically at a standstill, only that we are caught in the middle of enemy territory while they have a huge, resourceful city right behind them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... yes...\" Vanessa whispered mostly to herself, while she began to pace back and forth at an alarmingly hectic pace. The poor scout was still standing there watching, not daring to leave unless excused. \"It does make sense. The longer this battle keeps going, the more we will dwindle. It's very unlikely that we'll manage to just walk back out of Stenchlandia unmolested even if we wanted to flee right now. And a direct assault on the city as it is... It is surely well-defended, and with masterful commanders such as Maria... Of course, they can't be counting on us knowing all of this! Oh... my... <i>Felicia</i>! Do you know what this <i>means</i>???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That we might still have a chance, eh?\" Felicia's easy-going and happy answer came in stark contrast to Vanessa's almost hysterical raving. \"It is our <i>only </i>chance to still win this war! The other possibilities I gave before were no jokes... Unless a true miracle happened, we would be defeated sooner or later. But if we can charge into the city while they don't expect it...?\" Felicia smashes her fist into the palm of her other hand \"Yes! I like this plan already!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was less eager. \"I can't say I like it very much myself, but as I said... It will be our one and only chance at this point! <i>YOU</i>!\" The scout jumped at Vanessa's pointing index finger. \"You <i>are </i>really sure about this, right?\" \"Yes, Ma'am! Three of our best spies have confirmed Maria to be in close proximity of their arena, all of them reliable people. One even reported her walking in. I came as fast as I could.\" Vanessa shot a quick glance to the late afternoon sky; dusk would come around pretty soon. \"Very well. Start the preparations right away! We'll have to get around or quickly break through the troops between us and the city and then get there as fast as possible. Furthermore, we'll need to make sure those in the city aren't alerted of our actions too early, or else this will be a suicide mission. Remember... this is the end of the line!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaaand he's out cold! Nice! Just one minute and seven seconds!\" the voice of the announcer boomed, sending the exclusively female crowd cheering. Lara gave a small yelp of joy before she pried her sickeningly wet soles back off from the face of her latest victim. The contact between his unfortunate face and her noxious soles had been so flawless that just one minute had been enough to make them stick together like glue... And to blast his senses away with the powerful odour of Lara's sweaty feet! It was easy to tell just when he got knocked out, because only them did the desperate struggling of his limbs and the horrified, nauseated groaning behind the gag in his mouth stop. As Lara shot a quick glance at his visage, she found it still gleaming with the spicy sweat her soaked soles had left there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara then jumped up in excitement, before she swiftly calmed herself by force, giving a deep bow and a curt salute to the spectators screaming wildly everywhere. \"Number 127 has passed as well. Please leave the cell as the subject is removed.\" The announcer's voice heralded and just as Lara was leaving the small glass cell, two women with gas masks rushed in, unbinding the knocked out <i>subject </i>and carrying him back away somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Lara was raising her hand, waving to the crowd, Maria walked towards her from somewhere behind and gave her a high-five. \"Well aren't you our little star of the show!\" She said grinning, looking around over all those women in the spectator seats going crazy over Lara. \"Had my performance... truly been this astounding?\" Lara wondered, scratching the back of her head. \"Well, you did do very well so far. For someone who's here for the very first time, yeah, I'd say you're pretty amazing. Great to see my hopes in you haven't been for nothing, haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maria laughed, the announcer began shouting once more \"And with this, the opening rounds are over! The combatants may now take a short rest while we prepare the arena for the next part of the event!\" \"Oooh, warm-up's over now! Are you ready for the real deal, Lara?\" Maria said with a grin, punching Lara lightly in the shoulder. \"Oh, I feel quite ready, if I dare say so. What will be next?\" \"Well, up to this point, you automatically passed if your feet managed to knock out the subject. That's of course to sort out all of those girls whose feet smell just... You know, not really <i>powerful</i>. If they kept that rule on, this contest would last forever, what with women like me and you here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee... Yes, I agree.\" Lara said, blushing ever so slightly. \"Yeah, from this point on, it'll get tougher. First, they'll time it, compare it with several subject who should have a higher tolerance and towards the end... The very best ones will have each other's feet in their faces, testing who can last longest. The ultimate test not only to the strength of your footsmell, but your endurance and willpower as well.\" \"But... that means-\" \"Yes, my dear Lara. Be sure not to do <i>too </i>well here, or you might end up with <i>my </i> feet in your face!\" Lara went pale and swallowed hard. Maria suddenly laughed loudly and smacked her on the back. \"Har har, just kidding, do your best, girl!\" Lara nodded, but the feeling was still uncomfortable. Maria's feet... She dared not to imagine how they would be up close.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dawn was still dark, the starlight weak and dull, but the moon shone bright. Vanessa and Felicia led their troops through thick forest, on and on towards the eastern side of the Stenchlandian capital. This way they would be covered as long as possible by the darkness and additionally by thousands of conifers. Vanessa remembered a time when she was still young..in these days she had not valued conifers in any way - now she was extremely lucky that they were there. She turned her head around and saw Felicia walking right next to her, and behind Felicia hundreds of men and women following their lead. Although Vanessa wanted to stay down-to-earth until the ultimate victory, she couldn't help but feel proud of herself. She was only twenty-two years old, an age in which other girls would be studying or trying to get a job. But she wasn't a normal girl. She had led a rebellion against the most dangerous of all regimes, and even after it had been defeated, she had found a way to pull up resistance against Stenchlandia...and now..now she was actually marching towards the Stenchlandian capital with her own <b>army</b>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she had not done everything alone. Felicia, only twenty years old,  was her friend, her right hand, her anything if everything else seemed lost..and of course an awesome fighter. Nothing would ever stand between her and Felicia! At least she could not see anything for now.. Suddenly after Vanessa and her followers crossed a hill, the forest started to clear a bit and out of nowhere the Stenchlandian capital appeared in front of them. \"Stop!\", Vanessa hissed and raised her right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are now, and I don't have time to give you long speeches. From now on everything has to go fast. According to our latest spy information, most of the Stenchlandian commanders, agents, operatives and even soldiers are attending their sick tournament, I forgot its name. For us this means that we can count on relatively few and weak resistance. Nevertheless we need to be careful. We need to occupy as many strategically important positions in the city as possible before we can, hopefully undetected, bottle their forces inside the tournament arena up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how do we get inside unseen?!\", a higher ranked officer dared to ask. \"That is a good question\", Vanessa answered right away, \"and another reason why we chose to attack this side. The Stenchlandian capital is built on a very old system of escape tunnels and catacombs. They once were designed secretly to allow nobles to escape the city unseen in case of a superior army besieging the capital. In the last fifty years, the Stenchlandian governments have begun to seal most of the entrances and some of the tunnels in order to prevent illegal activities. But apparently some of the oldest tunnels, like the one we are going to use, survived. We know that the entrance is somewhere around here and that it will lead us into a building at the east end of the capital. Felicia! And you two, officer, you are going to search it. Find it as fast as possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer and Felicia immediately got moving and began to sprawl. \"For you others\", Vanessa then continued, \"until they are back, let's honor our fellow brothers and sister who sacrificed themselves for our cause today. Everybody stay quiet and listen inside yourselves and remind yourselves what we are fighting for and how close we actually are to finally reach our goals!\" Having said this, not a single one of the gathered army made a noise, many of them closed their eyes, soundlessly moving their lips. Vanessa herself thought of the bunch of volunteers who had agreed to hold their ancient position all alone, just to make the opposing Stenchlandian soldiers believe that Vanessa's main army was still in the same place. It was obvious that this little trick wouldn't last all too long and that the stay-behind \"forces\" were by far too few to be able to offer any resistance against the Stenchlandian enemies our there. However, this trick would buy Vanessa and her main forces enough time to enter the capital unseen and therefore hopefully win the war.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeeply sunk into her thoughts, Vanessa was finally brought back to reality when Felicia and the officer came back with a smile on their faces. Some hours had passed and it was already noon. \"We found the entrance!\", Felicia exclaimed, \"It's right here, follow me.\" Vanessa nodded and so her army began to follow Felicia about three hundred meters downhill and inside the thicker forest again until they reached a really huge pine. It was about two and a half meters thick and Vanessa could only guess how high, but that didn't matter anyway. At one side of the pine, a large bush was growing. \"Seems like an ordinary pine, doesn't it?\", Felicia asked rhetorically looking in the gathered mass of faces, \"But look at that!\" With these words Felicia brought herself in a crouching position ans just walked right <b>through</b> the bush on the pine's side. For a while nothing happened. Than Felicia's slightly annoyed voice could be heard from inside the pine tree, muffled in a strange way. \"Comon, follow me already, this tournament is not lasting all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tug went through Vanessa's body as she heard what Felicia said. \"Yeah you're right, let's get moving.\" She followed through the bush and found that the pine was hollow inside and on the bottom, she could see an open wooden trap door with some stone steps leading down under the earth. \"That's brilliant\", Vanessa said with a smirk, \"Okay always two at a time, let's go hurry up!\" About half an hour Vanessa, Felicia and their troops had to march through a dark corridor which at least was straight without any mazy turnoffs. At the end of it was a blind alley with a small and rusty ladder leading up to something which looked like a gully cover. Vanessa carfully climbed up and lifted the cover. Even more darkness awaited her, so she finally took one pocket lamp and enlightened the scenery for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems we will enter a lost basement room or something like that\", she hissed down to her waiting followers. \"Looks safe for now, so everyone go!\" With these words she lifted herself up completely in order to make space for the next one to come. She used the time everyone else was taking to climb up and looked around with her pocket lamp a bit. She discovered several old and open cartons brimful with something like files and folders. When the very last one was finally up and safe, she wanted to move on with her soldiers but suddenly somewhere above there heads a muffled clanking sound could be heard, followed by even more muffled voices. \"Seems this basement or at least the building in which we are isn't as abandoned as we thought\", Felicia hissed through clutched teeth. \"Let me check the situation Vanessa, and if there are not all to many enemies, let me as well deal with it..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granted.\" Vanessa nodded and signalized Felicia with her hands to get moving. \"But be careful. Our whole mission's success might be in your hands now.\" Felicia just grinned. \"As if I didn't know..and as if it was the first time..\" With a last chuckle she rushed up some cement stairs, silently like a lioness going deerstalking. For a while, nothing could be heard. Then all of a sudden, Vanessa could hear very muffled fighting noise, mostly fast and heavy steps along with one or two clashing sounds, surpressed screams and then nothing. A disturbing silence followed by two dull <i>thunks</i>. However, before anyone could start to worry, Felicia came back down smiling as always. \"Zone clear. They were just two inexperienced detached SSS agents. They were actually more complaining about not being able to attend their tournament than paying attention. Didn't put up a good fight. One hit in the neck of the one agent, one kick in the solar plexus of the other one and finito.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa could not help it but being surprised about Felicia once again. This girl looked so innocent and even..pretty..yet she was a deep me and it was certainly best not to tangle with her once she was pissed off. \"Alright ladies and gentlemen you heard her. Everyone move!\" They left the basement and entered the ground-floor of an old watchtower as Vanessa could see now. The two SSS agents lay unconscious on the floor. \"Okay listen everybody. The most crucial part of our mission begins now. Seize control over the Stenchlandian capital. We may even outnumber the enemy but we fight on unknown grounds, their territory. We have to control the strategic points of this city for all costs, before we can think of surrounding them inside the arena. This means that we will split up now, which is surely risky, but I see no other way. All the officers which I will call now, will take twenty soldiers and spread out from here. Your objective is to gain control especially over watchtowers, radio stations and any other medium the Stenchlandian could use to warn themselves as soon as possible and of course unnoticed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa then called out the names of the officers and they immediately left the tower with their twenty soldiers to execute her command. After this had been done, she turned to Felicia and the rest of her army. Still way more than the small troops she had sent out. \"You stay with me. We will wait for a while and then head towards the arena directly. Just in case our stealth mission fails and we get reported before we have taken all strategic points in the city, it is better to cut them off just when they leave the arena. This way they can't really form defensive lines. Oh and before I forget it, Felicia, would you please fetter and gag these two agents?\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure.\" Felicia went into the tower's small cubby, the door right next to the basement door, and found several ropes and towels. She used the rope to securely fetter the two agents and the towels made perfect gags. When she was done, she looked up and asked: \"So, are we going to win a war now, or what?!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"This is it!\" Maria yelled, balling her fists and jumping up and down excitedly. \"Man, how long I had been waiting for this! Look, Lara! We're getting closer to the finals now!\" Lara did look and managed a weak smile. It definitely felt good and yet... It also felt somewhat scary. Having that entire stadium there; hundreds and thousands of excited women, eager to see some lowly slaves suffer the finest punishment Stenchlandia had to offer! You simply couldn't afford to mess up here, or else they all would see. Lara would simply have to put all faith into... Her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... You are indeed right, Maria... What a wondrous experience it is!\" She said, eyes sparkling. \"Listen up, competitors!\" The voice from the speakers boomed again. \"Now you are about to enter the real tough part. So far, every girl who\u2019s feet could knock someone out cold could go ahead. Which is good! But now! We are stepping it up even further! Are you ready to become the BEST OF THE BEST?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd started to cheer ear-deafeningly. \"That's right! Now, each of you will be put against another participant. Then we will see whose feet are truly the deadliest! The fellow sniffers will always be of similar age, size and weight, to ensure a fair match. And since every person may still have a different resilience to the godly aroma of feet... Well, you will knock out FIVE of them! And the best overall time decides who gets to move on... And who gets stuck in the dust! Godspeed, my brave foot gladiators!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria couldn't help but scream \"YEEEEAAAAAAHHH!\" while Lara remained silent. Lara glanced around, there weren't that many contestants left now, in any case. She supposed knocking someone out only with their feet was quite a feat, even for Stenchlandian women. Soon, an enormous screen above rolled numbers and thus matched the remaining participants against each other. Lara counted exactly 64 numbers and names... After just a few rounds like that, they would reach the final battle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number 27... That's me! Number... 47...\" Lara read, glancing around. She soon found the girl wearing the number 47 - a relatively plain-looking, tall brunette woman - and they were both led to an isolated chamber by two gasmask-clad staff girls. Much like when they had their previous rounds, they were locked into a big glass cube, only now the two of them were facing each other. Soon enough, ten guys were brought in, all tied up and gagged in place, leaving their faces pleasantly vulnerable to the Stenchlandian women's noxious feet. Both Lara and the other girl received five of the boys to deal with... Like the announcer had said, they all looked very much alike, relatively young, not too tall and skinny as well; they pretty much looked like easy prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, girls...\" One of the gasmask women said, wagging her index finger \"We'll be here all the time to monitor you. No foul tricks. Just foul feet! On your mark! Set!\" Both Lara and the other girl moved their deadly feet, still safely hidden within their confines close to their victims\u2019 heads. They wouldn't remain so safe for much longer, though... \"<b><i>GO!</i></b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara kicked both of her shoes off at once. The sharp, cheesy and sour stench that spread from her shining wet, hot sweaty feet surprised even herself! Well, she did take quite an effort to warm up properly... But not a second later, the smell in the glass cube got even worse as the other girl removed her gleaming black leather shoes as well. Lara gulped as she glanced at her feet... Although relatively small and petite, they were literally dripping with sweat... And the stench was hitting her from here! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough both girls were forced to breathe in the foot aroma, their fate was no match to that of the poor test subjects. Most of the bound, gagged boys began to trash around in horrible disgust and horror as they were forced to breath the foul smell of sweat and unwashed feet solely through their noses, all the while making horrified muffled sounds; distant traces of powerful screams of agony; pleasantly toned down by their secure gags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara wasted no time and instantly pressed both of her feet into the first man's face. If she thought his muffled wails of agony were pitiful before, she was taught an entirely new lesson... As her slick, wet soles pressed lightly into his unfortunate, helpless face; her acidic toes cupping around his nose for maximum smelling enjoyment, Lara could see the veins on his arms beginning to stick out as he began to thrash around with all his force, trying desperately to get away from those feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his defence, Lara's feet were incredibly bad right now. Not only so wet with gathered footsweat that it was covering his entire face within seconds, but the sickening, cheesy-sour stench so thick and sharp that it send his mind spinning after just the first painful sniff directly from beneath her deadly toes. \"Hmmmpphhh... Hnnngghhfffff!!!\" He screamed behind his bonds! And the next second, he was limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One out!\" The muffled voice of one of the gas mask girls announced. \"On to the next one!\" As Lara planted her deadly feet onto the helpless face of her next victim, she glanced at her opponent's turn. The other girl looked quite annoyed, her obviously smelly and moist feet held into her guy's face; He did trash around, he did moan in horrible repulsion and agony, but he didn't seem to fall unconscious! \"Aaaand second one out!\" Lara looked surprised! Surely enough, her dripping wet feet had made short work of her second guy, knocking him out with the first whiff. She smiled as she moved on to the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat guy looked different. Not panicked, he stared blankly ahead, shivering ever so slightly, but almost without emotion. It was as if he was hypnotising himself. Lara knew she couldn't allow that! As her slimy toes met the base of his nostrils, even his great spirit couldn't save him! The incredibly sharp, sour fumes of her wet toes dug into it like a drill into an iron vein, hitting his lungs hard with the heavy aroma of unwashed, stinky Lara feet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow his composure didn't quite look as strong, as he flinched and tried to break free instinctively... Which was of course impossible due to his binds. Several horrible \"Hmmmpfff! Hnnnnnnggggghhhh!\" sounds escaped his tightly bound mouth as Lara began to slowly rub and grind her feet all over his face, making sure a part of her soft, moist soles was always in contact with his nose. The sensation was too much for the poor guy, he panicked, began to breathe faster and faster, taking in more and more poisonous foot reek and- Down he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third one DOWN! Nice going!\" One of the gas masks announced, giving Lara a thumbs up. \"Aaaaaaand... first one down!\" Another one said, on the opposite side. Lara couldn't help but grin. She was going more than twice as fast compared to that other girl. Smiling with glee, she lowered her noxious feet onto the next guy's face... Grinning as his expression turned quite the opposite. Without a doubt, she was going to win this round!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright! Now who do I get?\" Maria said, rubbing her hands. \"I'm number 2, yeah... Pfff, I'll be number ONE once I leave this, ha ha! Anyway... Ah, there it is! Number 98! Let's go!\" The same procedure followed as with Lara and the other woman; Maria and her designated contender were lead to a big, square glass cube. The other woman, a relatively small, chubby black haired one visibly tensed as she looked into Maria's face. \"You... Aren't you...\" She stammered. \"Ahhh! Know me already?\" Maria said with a beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's the legendary Maria, alright...\" One of the masked helpers said just as the subjects were brought in \"Be sure to tie your masks on tight, ladies.\" She said with a wink to the bound victims and the other participant, who obviously didn't have such a thing as a mask. \"Hehe, yeah. I apologize in advance, but... It might start to stink quite a bit in here, and very soon!\" Maria said with a gleeful grin, placing her hands on her black leather shoes. Even through them, she could feel the intense heat. This would be a good round...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... Ready! Set! GO!\" One of the masked girls cheered, and Maria threw off her footwear with a grin on her face. The effect was immediate and devastating. The amount of hot, salty sweat on her enourmously big, long and beatifully shaped footsoles was beyond words; not only were they glistening in the wetness of slicky sweat, but it was continously dripping down on the floor. An overwhelmingly strong stench was spreading through the entire cube immeadiatly, hitting not only all of the helpless, bound victims, but the other contestant girl as well! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe downright flinched back, away from her actual targets, tears forming in her eyes as her hands clutched her face after just taking one whiff of the tainted air. \"Arrrghh... What the...?\" \"Har har har! Yes, these are the feet of a true winner! Watch and learn, kiddo...\"  Maria said mockingly, winking at her unfortunate victims before slowly dragging her feet over each of their faces. Every single one of them fainted after just one painful, forced sniff. It seemed as if even the other guys, meant for the girl on the opposite side were beginning to black out, all thanks to Maria! \"Well... I think we have a winner here!\" One of the masked girls exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an area not too far away, Vanessa was silently stalking around, trying to be as quiet as possible in any way. Creeping up the tower, she was followed by two of her most trustworthy followers. The bulk of her force remained in back in hiding; it seemed as if this tower had a very good outlook over the streets below and worse... it was manned. Vanessa quickly glanced over to her allies; one of them was carrying a long coil of rope, just as intended. As she stealthily snuck further upwards, she spied around the edge to the platform on top of the tower. Sure enough, it was four of them... And they could not risk any signal given by their enemies to alert the rest of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This won't be easy... But the success of my entire war is tied to this, damnit!</i> Vanessa though as she bit her teeth together and clenched her fists. She nodded swiftly to both of her allies, took a last breath, and then hurried in! The Stenchlandian agents never saw it coming; Vanessa launched herself into the air, hitting one of the women straight in the head with a fierce kick, while grabbing a second one by the neck, taking her down with her! Just as the remaining two turned, Vanessa's followers emerged, one jumping and driving both of her knees into one agent's back; smashing the air right out of her, while the other one simply rammed into his target and then followed with a fierce fist to the stomach; scoring a similar effect! When all of their enemies were down, Vanessa and the others swiftly tied and gagged them up. \"Nice... this should suffice for that. I believe this street might be safe to pass now. We'll have one larger-\" \"<i><b>HEY</b></i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa turned her head around in shock! On a rooftop not too far away, a woman dressed in a SSS uniform stood... pointing right at her! Vanessa's blood froze as she saw her reaching to her belt, surely to grab some sort of horn or communication device... And she saw simply too far away, would never get to her in time like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just then, a shadow seemed to jump up from behind the woman! Sensing the immediate danger; she turned around... Only to be overwhelmed by a violent flurry of kicks and punches! Vanessa couldn't help but smile as she walked closer to the edge of the platform, squinting her eyes to shield them from the rising sun of dawn - Nightime and its convinient darkness were all but lost now - to see... \"Felicia! I just knew it!\" Felicia turned to her, grinned and waved excitedly. Just like Vanessa, she didn't dare to just shout over the roofs, though. That would have been way too dangerous. Instead, she gave a long and furious series of complex hand gestures that Vanessa couldn't figure out at all. Vanessa just chuckled nervously before shrugging and heading back down. \"With me now, my loyal friends...\" she said softly to her two followers. \"This is just the beginning. We're making good progress in isolating their most dangerous foes... Yet the real battle has not even begun so far.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaaaand... Doooooooown!\" Lara gave a quick giggle as she removed her slick, warm sole from her subject's face. Sure enough, all of her's were out cold now. Not so much those of her co-competitor; right at the other side of the cube. \"And we have a winner!\" One gasmask-clad girl cheered as Lara tucked her deadly foot back into her gleaming black leather shoe, failing to hold back a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked back out, she was greeted by a very excited looking Maria. \"Lara? Hey! You're still with us! Amazing! At this time... Do you know what this means?\" Lara gave a slightly awkward chuckle. \"Uhhh... It means that I have just scored another victory, does it not?\" Maria laughed loudly at that and took the opportunity to slap Lara on the back, a little too hard for her taste. \"That you did! And better! You are in the finals now, girl! You and me both, sister! Heh, although with me... Was there ever any doubt?\" Now Lara couldn't help but laugh loudly as well. \"Haha, of course not, Maria! Well tell me... How many of us are in the finals?\" \"Not too many, to be honest. Eight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a short while, Lara was speechless. This would mean she was among the top ten of Stenchlandian's fiercest foot fighters, so to speak. Top eight, even. The thought made her a little dizzy and unstable, although it all seemed to be perfectly normal for Maria. \"Well... I wonder who will get to face off against Amber now... She's in the finals as well, sure as hell.\" Maria mused, scratching her chin. \"I might... I might have to face off against your boss?\" Lara said with some anxiety in her voice. \"Hah, one way or another! It's not like you'd lose to anybody else before it comes to that, right? Unless of course... if you're matched against me!\" Maria gave her a broad grin, but Lara simply blushed and wasn't sure what to say. <i>Maria... Not only my superior, but I truly look up to her. Me matched against her... How could that turn out well? Aside the fact that she has some of the strongest feet in the land...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smirked as she saw Lara getting lost in her thoughts and swiftly smacked her on the back again, although a bit softer this time. \"Haha, don't worry. You're one of the champs now! The best of the best! That's all that matters right now!\" \"Yeah... you're right. I will most definitely do my best here!\" Lara smiled and clenched her fists. Oh yes, she was more than ready for these finals now, in any case!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaaaaand now... The finals are about to begin!\" A loud voice boomed from the speakers all around once more. \"We have the best of Stenchlandia gathered right here... Who will stand to triumph as the absolute champion? From now on, the rounds will be a little different... As mentioned before, you will be holding your feet in your opponent's face. Whoever surrenders or falls unconscious loses! By now... all of the remaining contestants should easily have feet more than capaple to send someone to a nice, little sleep. So rise and shine, our great Stenchlandian heroes! Find out who truly has the strongest feet of this year! Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, several numbers began to show up on the huge board once more...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lara looked up to see herself matched against the number 7. After both of them walked to their designated cube, Lara noted that she had never seen that girl before, so she couldn't have been someone too famous. She also didn't think her to be too much of a trouble for herself... 7 was a slightly short, average-looking girl with raven black hair and a slightly aggressive looking face. Lara glanced down at her shoes, her feet didn't seem to be overly big - they actually looked somewhat small - but Lara knew that this wouldn't necessarily make things easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, ladies...\" One of the gas-masked women mumbled as she opened the glass arena for the two of them. \"...I take it you know how these rounds are played?\" Lara frowned; being here the first time, she didn't really know, but it was soon presented to be obvious enough: In the middle of the cube were two heavy metal chairs that looked a tad like a dentist seat. To each side were two tubes going down... The number 7 girl soon presented to Lara how they were supposed to use; climbing onto her seat and sticking her hands in, a loud metallic CLICK could be heard. Lara gulped and swiftly did as her opponent had done... With another CLICK, she felt two metallic shackles clasping shut around her hands, holding them down. Lara gave a sharp pull, but couldn't get her hands out. A shiver ran down her spine as she realised that both her and her co-player were basically prisoners in their seats now; Should one want to escape the others feet before they could knock her out, she would have no way to do so. That fact worried Lara quite a bit... But at the same time, it sent a sharp tingle of excitement through herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the chairs spun a bit and moved around, bringing the two of them closer together. Another two gas-masked ladies walked up and took hold of the contestants legs, bending them up and grabbing their footwear. Lara realised that the distance was perfect; the moment her legs were released, she could extend them and bring her feet directly to her bound opponent's face... And that one could do the same to her. \"Alright! Ready... Set... Go!\" The first masked attendant screamed and her two colleagues freed Lara's and Number 7's feet at the same time and instantly backed away. Lara felt a surge of adrenaline as she swiftly moved her feet, trying to aim for her target's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut 7 had been even quicker. Before Lara could see what she was doing, she felt a heavy, wet impact and was suddenly blinded by two pinkish, glistening moist soles! Lara flinched and instinctively tried to move back, but her bound arms gave her head and torso almost no room to move! \"Gotcha!\" The other girl cheered as her smooth, slightly reddened soles followed up to Lara's face in no time, pressing themselves over it tightly. Lara gasped as the oppressive, hot and wet feeling overwhelmed her, the smooth, soft skin of her opponent hugging her face tightly. Finally, Lara had to breathe in as well... And her body shuddered in reflex as an immensely powerful, thick and cheesy stench flooded into her lungs. <i>Blast it! Now I do see how this one could make it into the finals...</i> Lara thought in dismay, forcing herself to stay calm after the first hit; she knew that panicking now would mean her demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaand look's like the fight is one-sided already! The girl on the left has her face full of feet and is smelling like a slave while her own feet haven't even reached the right girl! Is this how a battle in the finales is supposed to look like?\" The announcer's loud voice teased and Lara cursed silently. She was right, though, with two soles and several gleaming toes in her field of view, Lara had no way of telling where her opponent's head really was. She moved her feet around aimlessly, brushing against her shoulder and then her cheek here and there, but somehow that bitch always managed to twist and turn her head away just before Lara could score a real hit. All the while she was carefully breathing through her clenched teeth while all of Lara's air was tainted with the thick scent of sweaty feet. Lara tried to breathe through her mouth as well, but suddenly a part of her enemies\u2019 sole was plastered across her lips, pressing down. Lara cursed silently and was sent shaking again as her next breath meant sniffing the glistering moist sole mere millimetres away from her nostrils. Lara could already feel herself getting woozy from sniffing these feet good two times. <i>I can't let this end right now! Not like this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, this is almost too easy! You can't even touch me!\" Lara's opponent mocked. <i>Yes, keep on talking. Where the sound comes from...</i> \"It's almost like I've already won! Just look at you- Hnnnghh... Hnnnnnghhh!!!\" <i><b>GOTCHA!</b></i> Lara thought with a mean grin as she felt something hot and slippery getting caught in-between the first and second toe of her left foot. Her opponent immediately began making horrified gagging sounds as the full taste of Lara's toes was forced onto her tongue. \"Ohhhh! Look at this! Now we see an exotic move!\" The announcer's voice said merrily and Lara could feel her triumph moving closer as she burrowed all her toes into her enemies\u2019 mouth. Her gagging sounds became more frantic and even worse, Lara had placed her second foot sideways across her face now, dragging the entirety of her slick, wet sole directly across her nose and stopping when it reached the crevices between her deadly, slimy toes. Lara's enemy bucked and squirmed in her seat when she found herself forced to sniff between Lara's toxic toes, not having been prepared for a stench that strong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara grinned as she easily brushed her enemies\u2019 feet off her own face; that one's concentration was completely smashed apart now, the only thing on her mind trying to escape Lara's hazardous toes, which were wreaking havoc upon both her nose and her tongue! Lara smiled in silent triumph as she watched her opponent starting to panic, thrashing against her bonds as her panicked movements forced her to breathe in faster and deeper... And this bringing herself closer and closer to the edge of defeat as the violent, cheesy aroma of Lara's feet was steadily flowing through her nostrils!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a good three minutes of continuous forced sniffing, Lara's opponent gave a horrible, agonized groan through the salty, wet toes in her mouth and sank down motionlessly. The crowd cheered and the announcer boomed \"We have a <b>winner!</b>\" Lara grinned and pulled her feet back, the expression on the other girl's face almost made her giggle and the area around her nose where Lara's toes had rested was gleaming with moisture as well. The gas-masked ladies swiftly returned Lara's footwear to hear and then a loud CLICK announced that her hands were free again once more as well. Lara cheered loudly and jumped up, watching as the loser was carried out by a few masked girls, although with much more care and dignity then they had done with the mere slaves in the earlier rounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Lara had won this little battle, she watched with great interest as Maria and yet another girl she had never seen walked in their respective glass cube. Their fight was a much shorter and less spectacular one than her own had been, yet the crowd went wild all the same; Almost as soon as Maria's feet had been unleashed, her opponent began to panic. Maria left her no time to retaliate either, smothering her shocked face with her huge, intimidating feet and the pitying struggle and squirming her victim gave as she was forced to breathe their smell in made it clear for everybody watching that this was the true scent of a champion. It seemed to only last a minute, then Maria was prancing back out of the cell, her fist raised high, screaming \"I am the <b><i>CHAMP!</i></b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara was still watching her in awe when she suddenly felt a heavy hand on her shoulder. \"My, my... Maria's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, I believe Lara was your name? You've come far, my dear.\" a powerful, commanding voice said. Lara almost flinched; she remembered this voice only too well. Sure enough, it was Amber who smiled at her when Lara turned around. \"To tell the truth... You gave quite a show when I last met you personally...\" Amber began with a chuckle and Lara blushed a little bit. She remembered losing herself completely when this Kate lunatic began spewing her treacherous nonsense. It had not been her best moment, surely, and that was the only time Amber had seen her so far. \"Don't get me wrong though, I do admire your zeal and dedication to our cause. And as it looks, you have very powerful feet as well! Getting to the final rounds on your first entry! That's really something. But still, I'm sorry to inform you that your next battle will be a loss for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara frowned and Amber simply smirked as she side-stepped, allowing Lara to see past her. \"Next battle, I'm competing against...\" Lara's voice failed and her eyes bulged. \"That's right!\" Amber said darkly, re-appearing in her face once more. \"The real number one. I'm sorry, but I can't throw away my final against Maria, even for a promising talent like yourself.\" Amber's grin widened, her teeth looking wickedly sharp. <i>That face almost makes her look like Maria...</i> Lara thought nonsensically, shaking her head slightly. Amber cleared her throat and straightened back up. \"Either way... It seems the next battle will commence soon. Onward to victory!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Let's go, let's go! Full speed now, we can take them!\" Vanessa yelled, leading her troops next to the faithful Felicia. Their mission had gone suspiciously well thus far; after infiltrating the capital and securing a few important tactical spots, her allies and Vanessa were now rushing directly towards the heart of the city. Towards the SSS headquarters and the tournament arena both. Vanessa wasn't sure which of those would be giving them more trouble, in case they even made it that far. Up until now, they had met with very little resistance which had been easy to overcome, but Vanessa was sure that her entire army couldn't possibly be simply overlooked up to this point, where they all were storming through the streets. However, as she had hoped, no sort of grand alarm had been rung yet. It would all be a question of time, whether they could hit the strongest of Stenchlandia's warriors unaware before they could respond... Or if those would realise the entire plot too sound, and easily surround Vanessa's forces in turn. Vanessa bit her teeth together and squinted as she ran even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! And it is just the two of us now!\" Amber said with a grin as she and Lara walked over to their designated glass cube. Amber grinned and gave Lara a wink \"Don't worry, this shouldn't take long!\" Lara clenched her fists and entered wordlessly. Amber still seemed almost impossibly above her. <i>The boss of my boss... I can't believe I'm actually going to compete against that woman!</i> she thought, and yet there she was. Just like last time, they were lead into the center of the square, towards the strange, metallic chairs. As Lara felt her wrists getting locked in place, a sudden feeling of dread as she looked into Amber's grinning face. \"There's no escape now...\" she whispered, seemingly having read Lara's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next instant, the ever-present gas-masked ladies strode up and both seized Lara's and Amber's feet, holding them up and getting ready to yank their footwear off. \"Go!\" One of them yelled and seconds later, Lara felt cool air embracing her heated, moist feet as they had been unleashed! But of course, this meant that Amber's feet had as well and even thought Lara had prepared herself to attack straight away, she couldn't help but linger simply staring at her opponent's feet now. Much like Maria, Amber's feet were very large; Having seen both of them now, Lara couldn't have said who had the bigger pair. The fresh, warm sweat glistered and sparkled on the perfectly smooth surface of Amber's soles like morning dew on a grassy field. Only the scent in the air was a little different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara almost choked here and there when she carelessly took a nonchalant breath, not realising the smell of Amber's feet had spread through the entire, confined space already! Lara struggled to keep her calm composure as she smelled the foul aroma of sweat, ripe cheese and a distinct hint of sour acridity in the air. The only feet that had managed to strike at her that quickly with only their stench had been Maria's... Lara's attention suddenly snapped back as she realised these huge, gleamingly moist feet slowly hovering her way, soles-first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara focused and moved her own feet right away! Almost instantly, she could feel the distinct sensation of having a human face beneath her soles as she hit her target spot on! Lara allowed herself to smile. <i>How's that, champ?</i>, she thought, warily observing Amber's feet, which were still floating not too far away from her face. She could feel the moist heat being emitted from them as all the sweat slowly but surely evaporated... But even though it already stung her eyes, Lara knew she would be fine as long as she didn't actually smell them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Lara could feel something else... Air getting sucked in from beneath her own, moist and warm feet! At first Lara grinned triumphantly. But then it came again... And again and again. Lara looked confused. <i>It's not... affecting her?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, the cruelly cheesy and hot stench of Lara's sweated, reeking feet did manage to deal some damage even to the battle-hardened and experienced Amber. However, exactly her experience with many other hideously stinking feet (First and foremost her own) just barely allowed her to suppress any reaction as she readily sniffed at the sticky, warm soles placed on top of her face, even though it was a close call. <i>This will pay off soon enough... Time to taste some feet as well, my dear!</i> Amber thought as she finally moved her feet swiftly, extending them all the way out. And even though she couldn't see a thing with Lara's feet plastered all across her own face, she heard and felt with a satisfying, wet impact that Lara's face had just become victim of the very same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara almost panicked immediately as Amber's feet suddenly smacked straight into her face, pressing their long, smooth and devastatingly sweaty soles into her own skin. Their emitted heat and sheer size gave a horrible, oppressive feeling and Lara knew that she had to hold her breath now... Smelling them from up close would be absolutely deadly. <i>But... my feet should show some effect! She's smelling... Why isn't it affecting her?</i> A small shiver ran down Lara's spine and she slowly slid her feet around on Amber's face, seeking to trap her nose somewhere in between her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Amber just continued to smell all the same. <i>It's not working! Why isn't it working? What can I do... No... No, no, no!</i> Lara tensed up and her body began to shake slightly as she realised that everything was becoming more and more hopeless by the second. Amber's feet pressed down hard on her face, sealing her lips tightly. Lara panicked as she felt the need to breathe. She shook her head frantically, but Amber's feet didn't move one centimetre. After trying that for a few seconds, Lara finally couldn't hold back anymore and frantically took a deep sniff directly from Amber's soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara's eyes shot open and began to water immediately as an incredibly thick, strong and downright repulsive aroma flooded through her lungs. The stench was infinitely stronger this close and even after stopping to breathe, Lara could feel it burn inside her nose. The prospect of having to smell this again finally sent her into a proper panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber smiled beneath her own foot mask as she realised Lara beginning to thrash around uselessly against her bonds, her entire body quaking. <i>Stop it! Please, I give up, just let this horror end!</i> Lara wished to scream out, but not a single sound managed to escape her sealed mouth. Her panicked frenzy soon forced her to take an entire series of absolutely deadly, quick and deep breaths, filling herself completely up with the potent, cheesy and sour foot stench of Amber's feet in their deadliest state! It didn't matter how prepared Lara had believed herself to be at first, she surely hadn't been ready for this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few torturous minutes of continuously sniffing Amber's sweat-covered, hot feet, Lara's world finally turned to complete darkness as her body went limp. \"Aaaaaaand we have a winner!\" The announcer screamed as usual. Amber smiled proudly and waited patiently for herself to be released and her footwear being given back. Just like the losers of the previous rounds, the unconscious Lara was then carried out by a few women in uniforms and Amber couldn't help but wave her goodbye as she walked back out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was there almost instantly. \"I trust you won your round already, as well?\" Amber said, beaming. \"Naturally! That girl wasn't even that tough, makes me wonder how she even got that far... So. You're, uhm... Finished with Lara, yes?\" Amber smirked and crossed her arms. \"Yes. It was a bit of an one-sided fight, to be honest. I'm sorry, I knew you had high hopes for the girl.\" Amber grinned at Maria in a way that told her she wasn't very sorry at all. Maria shrugged \"She's an ambitious one, that Lara... I still have high hopes for her. But then again, beating you in a contest like that... I do believe the only one capable at doing that is me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber was just about to respond with something, when very suddenly, everything went very wrong. A loud siren was suddenly heard, following by a short, great confusion of everybody inside the arena. \"Attention, women of Stenchlandia. This is an emergency of the highest order. Our defences have been compromised; large numbers of enemy soldiers are present within the city walls.\" A voice from a loudspeaker was booming over the entire commotion. \"Damn it! Damn them all to hell! Why now! Why <b><i>now</i></b>!!!\" Maria cursed, but Amber was already taking action. \"Get yourself together, Maria. We'll be having a little extra fun before our final round, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then strode up to several soldiers nearby. \"Listen up, as the highest ranking official, I'm taking control here. Have all the civilians evacuated to the northern exit. Gather every combat-ready woman and gather up here in the center. Distribute these orders; do not fail me!\" Just as Maria was about to join her and help with the preparations, a series of very loud bangs and crashed were heard from the southern entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's jaw dropped as she saw the doors flying from the angles and a vast mass of angry people storming in, led by no other than her two old friends, Vanessa and Felicia. \"They want a fight, huh...\" Maria whispered, her face twitching in rage \"Well then, let's go!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the other side, about five hundred meters away from Maria and Amber, things looked a bit different. The Equmrian masses, led by Vanessa and Felicia, stormed inside the arena, wildly screaming. Some people were even firing salvos in the air, as if they were celebrating victory already. In actual fact, their task was to accentuate the surprise attack - with devastating results. The still ongoing evacuation of the Stenchlandian civilians who had been present for the tournament lost all of its organization, when the first audible gunshots created a terrible mass panic. Hundreds of crying and screaming women were running towards the northern exit of the arena, paying absolutely no respect to their surroundings. Some SSS agents tried to calm the mob down, but it was too late. All of these officers and many of the panicking women themselves were literally overrun and stamped into the ground, as the huge mass slashed itself a way through the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The day begins in our favor..</i>, Vanessa thought to herself, when she saw the panic her attack had caused. <i>Seems like we really hit them by surprise!</i> In the very time Vanessa was noticing and thinking all this, she, Felicia and the army behind them still kept running towards the middle of the arena. When they had crossed two hundred meters, so that they were about three hundred meters away from the last standing SSS agents, Vanessa raised her right hand, the signal for her troops to stop. Answering Felicia's wondering glance she hissed: \"Never ever enter a battlefield without at least superficially checking it first.\" While she continued to speak her head turned from one side to another, her eyes warily narrowed, in order to check out the galleries and other dark corners with potential strategical importance. \"Although I'm not expecting it, our enemies could have set up a trap for us and just pretend to be surprised!\" Felicia nodded and began to glimpse around as well now, alarmed by Vanessa's remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is another reason in addition though, Felicia. I sent some small units to sneak around the arena, so that we can attack from the east and west side as well in the same time. They are not in position yet - a shot will tell us when they are. By the way I can't find anything suspicious or alarming, can you?\" When Felicia negated, Vanessa could feel a warm rush of confidence float through her body. A precious gift, standing face-to-face with the enemies. The final decisive battle, determining the fate of Stenchlandia once and for all was about to begin. Right now, right here, in this arena. <i>How appropriate!</i>, she thought. <i>Fighting all this out in an actual arena. The good versus the bad, heroes versus villains. It fits.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith new gained confidence Vanessa risked a look back at her men and women. All of them had been fighting with her for so long now, in the name of Equmria. All of them had suffered for the cause and the casualties had been many. But same thing applied to their opponents! During the months of war, the rather amateurish bunch of male and female volunteers had become pretty punchy and battle seasoned. About two or three months ago, they would have charged this arena for her as well, but with more fear in their hearts than their surprised opponents! Right now they stood behind her, silent, calm and attentive, ready to react and waiting for further orders. Vanessa could not help it but feel proud and she was pretty sure that Felicia, her only experienced companion from the beginning, felt the same way..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, about three hundred meters ahead, the remaining SSS agents followed Amber's order and began to form a long triple column facing the Equmrian forces. Although heavily outnumbered, Amber remained somewhat confident. <i>\"Class beats mass\"</i> was what one could call her military motto. And what on earth could the sheer mass of some Equmrian peasants, with weapons they were probably too dumb to use properly, achieve against the unchallenged class of her well-trained SSS agents?! Amber had to admit that their leaders, the infamous Vanessa and her little lapdog Felicia, were not to be underestimated but for that matter she was here..she and of course Maria. Despite her confidence, Amber didn't like too take completely unnecessary risks and so she ordered the most experienced agents, including herself and Maria, into the first column. This way, the ranks which would get hurt the most would be occupied by the toughest fighters.. As Amber took her place right next to Maria and almost exactly face-to-face with Vanessa and Felicia she was convinced that she had done the right thing. The grim look on Maria's face confirmed her in this assumption. <i>And even if we might not outright defeat them with so few agents, we will for sure hold out long enough for our backup to arrive!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, they are forming a defense line!\", Felicia said and tugged on Vanessa's arm. \"But why are they not attacking?! I mean..we have outnumbered the enemy before in this war..they always seemed to prefer self-coordinated aggression instead of staying defensive. Why not now?\" Vanessa's answer came slowly. \"Hmmmmmm. That's a good question. It's really not typical, that point goes to you..but you know what? Neither is what we do right here! Really nice that you pointed this out to me, it is the last proof I needed. They don't attack like they always did, because we <b>really</b> surprised them. They don't attack, because we caught them on the hop! Mighty Maria and her fellow inhuman villains are insecure.. No wonder, we just attacked them in the heart of their capital! They..Are..SCARED!\" With these words Vanessa turned around and raised her hand again. \"Make ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What are they waiting for..</i> Maria wondered and shifted from one foot to another. Something wasn't right here, she felt it. Normally the chance of taking part in a good old battle to secure the pure glory of Stenchlandia and their superior women filled her with excitement. This time however, she didn't feel excited at all. Instead she felt worrisome and restless, as if her instincts tried to warn her. <i>Comon, Maria, it is just a battle like the others you have been in.. Don't show stupid fear now, not in front of Amber!</i> Before Maria had the chance to continue to mull over possible reasons why she didn't feel as confident as usual this time, her boss made a decision..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber knew her subordinates well, another motto of hers. <i>If you don't know the ones you command, you might as well cast dices in order to predict a battle's outcome</i> Now she noticed, that many of her agents, even some of her most experienced ones didn't look all too confident. At first she didn't give too much about it, because she thought that in the fire of the battle, the confidence would come anyways. Then however, she noticed that even Maria seemed tensed and this was definitely a bad sign! <i>My women need me now..</i> \"Okay ladies!\", Amber said loud and with a calm, self-assured voice. \"I think we have been standing here long enough, waiting for these idiots to make a move. Seems however that all they are capable to do is staring holes into the air.\" Careful and nervous giggles welled up for a second. \"This ladies, is how you realize what these so-called enemies are. A bunch of dirty Equmrian peasants!\" This time a whole wave of loud laughter broke lose into the direction of Vanessa and her henchmen, several direct insults could be heard and Amber knew that she had found the right words. Even Maria smirked again. \"Let's move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this moment on, and without any warning hell broke lose. The triple column of freshly motivated SSS agents had just begun to make its first move, when.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BANG! BANG! </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n..suddenly some gunshots filled the air again, but this time they came from their left and right. <i>The east and west entrances!</i> Amber and her surprised fellow campaigners swung their heads around. From both sides, Equmrian forces ran towards their unprotected sides, ready to spring the trap. In the same moment Vanessa's voice could be heard, screaming <b>\"FOR EQUMRIA! ATTACK!\"</b> Her voice was immediately joined by hundreds of other howling voices. Amber's heart dropped into her belly. She knew she was beaten. There was no chance to win this or hold out long enough. Being outnumbered was one thing, but being outnumbered <i>and</i> encircled?<br>\r\nAmber knew that if she wanted to maximize the damage control, she had to do something she had never done before: Give up. \"RETREAT!\", she screamed. \"TO THE NORTHERN EXIT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE! JUST RUN!\" In the very moment these hated words left her mouth, Amber's eyes met with Maria's. Something in the way she had always looked Amber in the eyes died. And Amber knew what it was. Today, she had not only lost an important battle. Today she had lost Maria's respect and admiration. But that was a sacrifice she had to accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa stopped her army, when she saw the last enemies rushing out of the northern exit. There was no point in following them now, it would most likely just lead them into fights with backup forces. They had made enough prisoners and this arena was a perfect place for a base. Big enough and easy to defend. \"We have one this battle!\", she yelled raising her fist. \"We rammed a spear right into Stenchlandia's heart! And soon enough we will take the filthy rest and pulverize it. Our next and last task will be to bring the headquarters under our control. Once this is achieved, we can begin to establish a military court, so that the Stenchlandian responsibles can be punished properly and in a legal way. And then, this nation can be rebuilt under the star of equality and humanity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>EQUMRIA! EQUMRIA! EQUMRIA!</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even after this great victory, Vanessa knew that she couldn't sit back and relax even for an instant. \"Alright, my fellow fighters for all that is good and just... We have won this Arena, but we must keep on moving! Remember, we're in the middle of enemy territory right now! Secure this area, do a swift search for any enemies that might still be hiding somewhere, especially SSS agents!\" As her people went on running in all directions, Vanessa glanced at Felicia, who had come up to her as well. \"We should also send someone up these towers...\" Vanessa looked at a few lookout towers which were built-in to each corner of the arena. \"...to tell us what the enemy is doing right now, and where the fleeing troops are heading to. Which of you can move the fastest?\" At that, Felicia poked her into the shoulder with her index finger and giggled. \"Haha, do you even have to ask?\" And before Vanessa could respond, she had already dashed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Amber was leading her troops swiftly away from the arena. She cursed silently as she looked back over her shoulder and into the distraught faces of her followers. <i>They are not used to this... Receiving an order to flee; in the middle of our capital and from a bunch of jumped-up peasants, rebels and traitors. Least of all, hearing such an order spoken from my <b>lips</b>... </i> Amber mused darkly. \"Do not get this the wrong way, soldiers!\" She screamed while still running at full speed. \"We are not beaten! We form up inside the SSS headquarters now! There is simply no way they can storm that bulwark of a building and even though we might be critically outnumbered now, those petty insects forget that they are within OUR city! In no time, soldiers from all over the capital will come and surround them, leaving no way out and then we strike anew and smash them to pieces!\" Amber had to catch her breath for a short while, running at full speed and talking at the same time was tiring, even for her. \"There is no way out for them! Our victory is certain!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria strode up to her and for a brief moment, Amber thought she saw doubt sparking in those normally so frightfully zealous and aggressive eyes. Amber gave her a hard look. <i>You may have looked up to me more than you do now, Maria... But first and foremost; You are a soldier and I your commander. Personal feelings are all but irrelevant.</i> Amber thought, yet she remained silent for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was inspecting a few unconscious bodies that her people had brought to her, when suddenly she heard noise from her headset. \"Helloooooooooooo?\" \"Yes, I can hear you, Felicia. Are you on top of the tower already? How does it look?\" \"Looking very good, I would say. The Stenchlandians are running away like little puppy dogs! It looks like they're heading to... Some really big building complex. Looks like some headquarters of sorts.\" \"Likely the SSS headquarters, I figured as much. Any other groups of soldiers in sight?\" \"Nope, I can see nobody right now!\" \"Excellent!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa tapped her headset and gave a content nod. \"Sorry for the interruption. You were saying?\" She returned to a soldier who had presented her with the bodies. \"Yes... We believe those might be some of the victims of their sick... sports. As you can see, they're clearly knocked out; they were probably being carried somewhere when we invaded. And yeah, I guess it's easier to run away if you're not carrying some limp body on your back, so there they are!\" \"Hmmm...\" Vanessa mused, not entirely sure what to do with them. A good deal of them were men, although some women were present as well. Since they were likely slaves, criminals, traitors or something of the like, it was not entirely unlikely that they'd join her army, but in their state right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa also noticed a few females clad in uniforms. \"What about those?\" The soldier shrugged. \"Don't know, to be honest. They're unconscious as well, but other than that...\" Vanessa frowned, knelt down to one young woman and gave her face a quick sniff. She shuddered when she experienced the unmistakable odour of sweaty feet. \"I will never understand these Stenchlandians...\" Vanessa declared, standing back up. \"Tie these up... If we can't afford to guard them or something like that, just leave them somewhere. We'll take care of them properly once this war is won. As for the others...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just that instant when one of the unconscious people, a relatively young man clad in ragged, torn clothes suddenly shot his eyes up. \"Ahhh... Ah. Where... What?\" He mumbled as he looked around, a couple of soldiers drawing near and looking down at him in mild interest. Vanessa came as well. As soon as he spotted her, his eyes lit up. \"You! Can it be... Vanessa? Are you...?\" Vanessa couldn't help but chuckle. \"Yes, that would be me. Do we know each other?\" \"Ohhh, thank the heavens!\" The man cried out, trying to stand up, but falling down on his knees again. Vanessa rushed towards him to lend him a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The legendary Vanessa... Yes of course I know you! You might not know me personally, but basically all of the suppressed populace of Stenchlandia knows you!\" \"They... do...\" Vanessa was lost in thought for a short while. She did fight a few amazing battles right in these city walls... It seemed years ago, now. But it had been these very people, the beaten, abused, humiliated people, who had allowed her to achieve her victories. She suddenly felt guilty again. <i>After I escaped to Equmria, many had to stay back. Will they hate me for this? Think me a traitor?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we do!\" The man interrupted her train of thought. \"You did so much for our liberation, we all remember and then... After you were gone, the Stenchlandians had been very cruel to us...\" Vanessa bit her teeth together, but remained silent. \"...and we had been praying... Praying that one day, you would come again. Come again, to free us all! Me personally, I prayed as well, not only for being set free, but for getting a chance to fight aside the legendary Vanessa myself and do my part-\" \"Please, just Vanessa will do!\" \"-and now!\" He finally pulled himself up and gave a shaky salute. \"I am yours to command! Please, I beg of you... Liberate this city once and for all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa gave a wry smile. This man looked far from being fit for battle, but nevertheless, she was very touched and thankful for his sudden support. Even more importantly... \"All help is welcome. You mentioned there are even more? Those people who 'pray' for my return?\" \"Yes, yes! The government tried to cover everything up after a time, but the battles were too big to be hidden from the common eye, and even the lowly slave gets to hear what the common Stenchlandian woman says, every now and then. I'm sure there are hundreds- no, THOUSANDS who are just waiting to join the righteous cause!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa would be lying if she said he mouth wasn't watering at those words. <i>Thousands of fresh soldiers...</i> She cleared her throat and straightened her back. \"Thank you very much for that information... This is very important...\" Vanessa then crossed her arms and walked back and forth a few times. Having grown up in this city, she knew it well. The huge headquarters in the middle wasn't the only military base around and she was sure that if they waited for too long here, the enemy would simply come and completely overwhelm them. A swift storm to their base seemed to make the most sense. However, if she could rally more allies... More manpower... Her army was big enough that not only slaves and outlaws, but regular citizens would be ready to join her, if only they wanted. With an even bigger force, they would have a big advantage at cracking the last nut that remained... The SSS headquarters. Yet, if they waited too long and didn't raise enough new strength... Then their defeat would be certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you thinking about?\" A bright voice suddenly chimed in. Vanessa looked in surprise to see Felicia standing next to herself again. <i>Damn, she does look fast!</i> \"Ahh, Felicia! Maybe you can help me with this dilemma...\" Vanessa explained everything to her in great detail. Felicia seemed to ponder for a moment. \"Well, the way I see it, it's rather simple!\" \"It is?\" Vanessa cocked an eyebrow.\" \"Yes! You will need yourself plus a lot of power to go and get even more people to your side and at the same time, the SSS headquarters are really difficult to storm...\" \"That is precisely the dilemma!\" \"-so just sent a small team in to infiltrate it! A smaller crew always has an easier time doing that, you should know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was taking aback. \"Yes, but the SSS headquarters? You are from around here; This place is impenetrable, you know!\" \"Or so they would like us to think! Just send me in as the leader. Then nothing can go wrong.\" Vanessa looked at Felicia for a short moment. Her sparking blue, big eyes shone with determination, her gentle, soft face seemed almost aflame right now. Vanessa shock her head. \"Absolutely not. You are too important.\" <i>I cherish you too much, Felicia</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Felicia pouted angrily. \"Really now, Vanessa? Don't you trust me? I can do this!\" \"I just really... don't want to lose you, Felicia. You're... uhm... One of a kind, so to speak.\" Felicia's pout melted into a giggle in no time. \"Haha, that's right! And that's exactly why I will succeed doing this! I'm the only one who can do this! Because you're the only one who can rally the others!\" Vanessa frowned and remained silent for a while. She supposed that after all Felicia had done for her and her cause, it would be unfair not to trust her now... She really was capable of performing miracles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... Just do what you want. I have faith in you, Felicia.\" Vanessa said, a hopeful smile on her face. Felicia cheered \"Aaaaaaalright! Just give me my partners, and I'm off! I'll give you the headquarters in no time!\" Vanessa gulped down as she nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, she had a very bad feeling about this, but she couldn't refuse anymore.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A small team under Felicia's lead was swiftly formed and ready to start its way to infiltrate the SSS headquarters. She and Vanessa had hand-picked - as quickly as they could - about ten of Vanessa's most skilled and experienced men and women; mainly people who had been fighting alongside them from almost the very beginning. Vanessa clenched her mouth, squint her eyes slightly as she regarded the people standing in front of her before turning around and letting out a long, heavy sigh. The mission still seemed almost impossibly dangerous to her, but if this team couldn't do it, then it was certain nobody could. <i>But what will I do if it turns out that nobody <b>can</b> do this? To lose Felicia now...</i> Vanessa cleared her throat and faced her soldiers again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. You have my leave to go.\" Vanessa drew in a long breath, walked over to Felicia and put a hand on her shoulder, leaning in \"You know what's at stake her...\" Vanessa whispered \"I'm counting on you. Just... be careful.\" Felicia responded with a half chuckle \"Heh, the same goes to you, Vanessa!\" she chirped, her voice and facial expression light and chipper; the complete opposite of Vanessa's \"Don't you mess up rallying those people!\" Felicia had meant it as a joke, yet Vanessa found herself wondering what <i>would</i> happen to them if she did indeed fail.  <i>It doesn't matter. I just can't allow myself to fail. For the sake of all those people!</i> \"You're right...\" Vanessa said stiffly, turning away \"Godspeed, Felicia.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you heard her, ladies and gentlemen! Let's make Vanessa proud!\" Felicia cheered, smacking her clenched fist into the palm of her left hand and striding onwards. Her followers joined her instantly. Vanessa gathered her own composure as she walked in the opposite direction, some of her soldiers coming over to her out of habit, listening if she had any new orders. \"Ok, this is the plan...\" Vanessa said aloud while walking on, looking swiftly at the men and women next to herself. \"I will need to go a little to the southwest; towards the old market. I will need something high I can stand on, I'm sure I'll find something like that over there; that position will be ideal because the market is more or less surrounded by large apartment complexes. I'm also aware that they have always been trading their slaves preferably at that very market, so there has to be some sort of... Quarters for them nearby. In any case, I expect to gain the most attention if I speak there, also it's not too far away from here, so the risk is relatively low...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa took a breath \"I will need quite a few soldiers to accompany me, partly for my personal safety - A few stray Stenchlandian soldiers or fanatic loyalists of their regime are sure to intervene - but more importantly to make sure that anyone who decides to join our cause is safe. As much as it displeases me, I will have to split our forces here. Most of our troops are to remain right here, to defend this base we have established. However, about one fourth of our forces are to join me directly. Pass these orders on and have all the necessary troops follow me right away.\" Vanessa allowed herself another sigh \"...because time is still very much not on our side here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you propose we do now, chief?\" One of the SSS agents standing around a rather restless and frustrated looking Amber asked her. Amber had her arms clutched tightly together behind her back, and her facial expression seemed just as tense. As she remained silent for a few seconds, the agent who asked the question seemed to panic a little. \"We can't just do <i>NOTHING</i>, can we? I mean, I mean... We have... There are <i>ENEMIES </i>in the city! Right out there!\" Amber\u2019s eyes suddenly met with the agents and her hard, hot glare was enough to silence the lesser ranked woman and make her take a step backwards. Maria, who had been following Amber the entire time, cleared her throat and strode up to her boss, slowly but firmly pushing the other agent away. \"Leave us.\" she said and within seconds, she was the only one standing next to the supreme commander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that one had a point...\" Amber suddenly said, slowly and strangely calm \"...we really can <i>NOT </i>simply wait here until reinforcements come to save us. Not us, the very elite forces of our entire nation. Not here, right <i>INSIDE </i> our bloody headquarters... It would be a disgrace.\" Maria breathed in noisily through clenched teeth \"But at the same time, we can hardly afford to simply go back out there and fight them... We already took way too many losses back in the arena...\" Maria muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am well aware of that...\" Amber agreed \"The question is... What will the enemy do?\" Now Amber glared at Maria, as if she was daring her to say something wrong. Maria showed no sign of discomfort. \"In my opinion, they only really have two options... Since they can not afford to sit down and wait until our reinforcements have them completely surrounded and storming these headquarters is obviously out of the question... I believe the two most likely things to happen are that they will either try to gather more people to their cause - We both know just too well that this accursed Vanessa is very capable at doing so - or they could try to send in just a few, selected ones to infiltrate us here and sabotage the headquarters somehow. Or... they could try both.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm... We think the same on this one, then. Only, I'd say it's not very likely that they will try both plans.\" Amber noted. \"Because they would need to splice up their forces not just once, but twice?\" Maria suggested \"Yes, because of that, and because I believe that Vanessa is the only one of them who could pull either one off. Luckily for us, they only have one of her.\" Amber concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Maria furrowed her brow \"Just one Vanessa, yes, but we must not forget about her right-hand girl. I made the mistake of underestimating her once before... It won't happen again.\" \"You're talking about that Felicia lunatic, yes?\" Amber asked, but shook her head soon afterward. \"I say she is not capable for either task. I doubt enough people would join the enemies cause if <i>she </i> were to try and persuade them and while she is certainly extremely skilled in combat and insanely strong and quick... She can not possibly hope to enter <i>THIS </i> compound unnoticed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was not convinced \"But what if she does succeed in doing it?\" Amber's face darkened. \"I don't remember telling you to question my judgment, Maria.\" Maria's face reddened a tad, but she didn't utter a sound. \"Now...\" Amber continued \"I see two possible things we <i>could </i>do... openly engaging the bulk of the enemies forces is out of the question, but if they do indeed split up and send a part away to, uh... <i>convert </i> some of our people... Then we could very much attack these, thus crippling their forces possibly enough to finish the rest off on our own.\" Amber paused for a minute, tapping a finger against her forehead. \"However, we will need almost all of our women for this. If they do indeed try to infiltrate us right then, these headquarters will be lost. And sending out only a few of our women is pointless, we'd just throw them into the enemies maw. It's all or nothing, Maria.\" Despite the situation, Amber actually managed a smile \"And right now, I <i>am </i>asking for your opinion. Staying inside would be the safer choice either way, but if we end up waiting for our reinforcements to win our war, we will be the mockery of the entire land. Going out could make us the heroes who crushed the biggest rebellion our nation has ever seen... But it is possible that we lose everything if we fail. What do you think, Maria?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa soon appeared at the exact place she had remembered from a long time ago. The area which had once been a busy market was more or less in the middle of being re-constructed into something else, but of course the news of the recent enemy invasion has left every open area a deserted ghost-land. Vanessa climbed up a tall wooden structure and took a final, deep breath. Down below, her followers formed a large circle around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Citizens of Stenchlandia!\" Vanessa screamed from the top of her lungs. She had almost forgotten herself how powerful her voice could be \"Today is the day your prayers will be answered! Today is the day of your <i>liberation</i>! Too long have I been away from this place, but I do not come back here alone! See my army! Our all army! We are here, to finally SMASH those iron chains of oppression and set this nation free! So rise up... RIIIIIIIIIIIISE up, people of Stenchlandia! Rise against those barbaric fanatics that have attempted to seal all your fates forever! We all are bound by a common enemy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then, more and more people started to show up all around the place. Some of them looked like the very image of a slave, although most of them appeared to be regular civilians. A smile briefly flashed across Vanessa's face when she noted that once again, she was attracting men and women alike. Many of the newcomers weren't exactly silent, and Vanessa paused briefly to listen to the sounds of the crowd. \"It's her... It really is her again!\" \"Can it really be over? Can we win this?\" \"An army! She has an army! We may stand a chance!\" \"Let's send those bastards to hell!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a young man was moving as close to Vanessa as he could, before the soldiers below her kept him back. \"Vanessa! Hey, Vanessa! Do you remember me?\" Vanessa turned her head at his voice, but sadly could not remember him. \"I couldn\u2019t come with you, they got me, but... I was there in the beginning! Your LTFK... Our LTFK! Do you remember?\" Now Vanessa allowed herself to smile. <i>Oh yes, I do...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Today, I declare the LTFK to be reborn!\" Vanessa yelled and was instantly met with a loud wave of cheering from the crowd. <i>It seems my actions really have been legendary... They all know this name!</i> \"Yes! Tonight, we will turn the hunters into the prey! Tonight, we hunt every single oppressor down! <i><b>Sie sind das Essen, und wir sind die J\u00e4ger!!!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd's cheering was ear-shattering. So far, everything seemed to run perfectly for Vanessa!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That's it... I know exactly what to do...\" Maria murmured quietly to herself after she had finished her little argument with Amber. In the end, Maria's suggestion that it would be wiser to remain at the headquarters in case of Vanessa trying to infiltrate it had proven to be the best point of view... Even though Maria still suspected it wouldn't be Vanessa personally who carried out that attack. Nevertheless, it remained the most dangerous thing that could happen to the SSS and all of the current leadership of Stenchlandia and as such, it was Maria's holy duty to defend this point with her utmost capabilities! \"Get in place, girls...\" She spoke into her headset \"If we have all the points the enemy is likely to breach well under control, we will catch them for sure. I'm counting on you, heroines of Stenchlandia...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia was running at a relatively high speed, yet she had to slow herself to make sure her followers weren't lost somewhere behind. \"Hurry up! This is really important!\" She hissed as quietly as she could, after waiting for a brief while. The SSS headquarters were right before them. It was a huge, imposing building complex, surrounded by sturdy walls topped with barbed wire and well-guarded. Infiltrating this would surely be no easy feat. \"Don't worry, friends...\" Felicia whispered after her small team had caught up with her \"I'm from this place after all... I know where we can find a way in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while, Felicia and her followers had reached a place just outside the walls of those headquarters, where some sort of thick, metal cylinders were visible up above. \"Are those...\" One of the soldiers began, pointing a finger. \"Yup! Air ducts! It may seem a little clich\u00e9, but... It's actually the perfect spot to get into that stronghold! I'll open them up, you just follow me.\" Felicia chippered eagerly, clapping her hands together. \"Are you... sure you know the way?\" One of the soldiers rang out. \"Ohoho, you'd be surprised of the things I know of! Yes, yes, I do know. Follow me!\" With that, Felicia ran to one of the ducts, gave the iron grate a hearty punch, knocking it loose and then nimbly crawled inside, upwards. Her hand soon appeared again, to help the next person up. Within minutes, they were all inside of the passages leading straight into the SSS headquarters's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaand... We have signal of an intruder!\" Maria heard the excited voice of one of her comrades yell into her ears. Within seconds, she was standing next to her. \"What was that, soldier?\" Maria inquired, glancing over the shoulder of an agent sitting at a terminal, trying to spy at the display. Her subordinate realized that and politely moved to the side a little. \"Look here! Hostiles!\" The agent exclaimed, pointing at a few small dots traveling in a straight line on a map made out of thin, glowing, green lines. \"Where are they going? There aren't many of them...\" The agent wondered aloud while Maria scratched her chin. \"I know this building very well... The path those intruders are taking... There are no doors at this point, see?\" Indeed, it looked as if the points had just traveled straight through a wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... does that mean...?\" The agent began. \"Yes... They might be in the vents.\" Maria concluded, smiling and pointing a finger to the ceiling. \"But... That's kind of bad, no?\" \"Hahaha, oh no, not at all!\" Maria laughed. \"These pesky little vermin might not know we can flush anything we like through these passages... Like sleeping gas, S.T.I.N.K. essence...\" Maria gave a wide grin. \"I do hope you didn't misplace your gas mask, soldier, because some of it will of course seep right back into our rooms. But for those who are still inside those tunnels... All we will have to do is collect their unconscious bodies!\" Maria clapped her hands loudly and turned around, heading to the closest terminal related to her task in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... This seems like a good spot...\" Felicia whispered as she spied light coming into the tunnel she was crawling in from below. Bashing her fist against it a few times, she knocked a lid down and opened a passage. Felicia swiftly jumped down and landed in the room beneath. \"Come on, come on, hurry up!\" She called as her followers made their way through the opening, a lot slower than she had done. Perhaps they disliked the drop. \"I don't understand, Felicia.\" One of the soldiers spoke. Felicia - much like Vanessa herself - usually preferred having others call her with her name instead of <i>commander</i>, <i>leader</i> or anything of the sort. \"Why are we leaving these ducts already? I thought they were going to bring us right into the heart of this building?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia shook her head. \"No, we just had to get inside those walls somehow. But if we stay inside those vents, we'll be sitting ducks, more or less. I don't doubt the SSS has spotted us already on their radars.\" At this, some of her followers were shooting Felicia unsure and worried glances. \"Don't worry, friends, we'll simply overwhelm whoever crosses our path and then take this headquarters as swiftly as possible!\" Felicia paused for a moment, in which the latest of her followers got out of the tunnel above. \"I do hope we won't have to face one of their leaders, myself... But even if we do; Just leave 'em to me! For the sake of freedom and our country, I will defeat whoever it takes!\" Felicia nodded as the last of them lined up in front of her and turned around towards the closest door. \"Alright, follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander! Commander, they are moving again! But different, somehow!\" Maria heard one of her agents speak. \"What???\" She barked back. Maria had just finished programming the command to release the emergency S.T.I.N.K. stockpile - Once per week, every SSS agent was required to donate at least one smelly foot item to that load constantly, in the case the headquarters ever needed their potency - to be distributed through the air ducts. Putting on her personal mask, Maria strode back to the agent at the radar terminal, who was still fumbling with a gas mask herself. Nevertheless, she pointed at the screen as Maria approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! They are no longer traveling in a straight line and look! They are only passing through the passages shown here, now!\" The agent explained. \"Hmmm...\" Maria tapped her chin. \"They think quicker than I expected. It doesn't matter, at least we forced them out into the open. They will come right here to seize control, no doubt... We absolutely can't remain sitting around here, they'll try <i>some</i> dishonourable trick, to be sure! Let's set up an ambush real quick...\" Maria concluded, already striding on and waving her agents to follow her. \"They aren't many, but so are we. We have a great warrior with us - I'm talking about myself, I admit it - , but so do they. I know soldiers appreciate the truth, so...\" Maria took a moment to look her following agents in the faces. With delight she noted that they had all equipped their shining, lean black SSS gas masks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might very well not be an easy fight. A lot is at stake here; so remember this! Your actions may change the outcome of this war; the very fate of Stenchlandia! You <b><i>must not</i></b> fail. For Stenchlandia!\" Maria raised her fist. \"For <b>STENCHLANDIIIAAAAAA</b>!!!\" The SSS agents cheered and Maria nodded with a grim smile. Then she was off, listening to the hurried drumming of footsteps behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! It can't be much further now!\" Felicia yelled at her already exhausted followers. <i>I have to remember they don't quite have the stamina I do. If we have to fight right now...</i> \"Just across a few more passages, and we'll be in the control room!\" As Felicia and her soldiers were hurrying on through a relatively narrow passages, a small number of black uniformed women suddenly appeared in front of them! Felicia's eyes bulged and she allowed herself a tiny grin. \"Chaaaaaarge!\" She screamed and dashed ahead in front of her soldiers to be the first one to meet the enemy. Much like the times before, Felicia's onslaught was quite fearsome indeed! She almost smashed through the SSS forces, sending enemies flying left and right with her supreme power and skills!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, terrified screams from behind made her turn her head. More enemies had appeared... Right behind her own comrades! \"What... No!\" Felicia yelled, feeling the cold touch of dread creeping onto her skin. The accursed SSS bitches had invaded the passage from both sides - Somehow getting some of their women behind her own lines - and where now surrounding them in the narrow tunnel. With rising fear, Felicia saw that some of her followers were already shaking in terror as the enemy fell onto them from behind! Felicia had no choice but to rush back to them... But right then, even more SSS agents sprung from the side Felicia had turned to before! Both exits of the corridor where now filling with SSS agents... And they were rushing straight towards Felicia and her allies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short, terrible battle followed. Felicia was fast, but not quite fast enough. Many of her men and women were already down before she even reached them, and more followed. Felicia herself fought magnificently, but there were simply too many enemies and too few of her own! Their entire plan was crumbling to pieces! And then, suddenly, Maria herself was standing in front of her! \"Ahh, would you look at this!\" She exclaimed, sounding quite pleased with herself. \"The source of the problem right here! And I <b><i>KNEW </i></b>it! I knew it wouldn't be Vanessa herself! Instead, she sent her little puppy again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you <i>little puppy</i>, you damn psychopath!\" Felicia growled. \"Oh please. If anything, I don't believe <i>you </i> have any right to call others psychos... But very well... We will engage in single combat. And this is no offer of mine, you rebel dog!\" Maria cracked her knuckles. \"I insist on it. Everybody, step back. This one... is <i><b>MINE</b></i>!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's almost as if you SSS scum had honor!\" Felicia provoked with a sly grin, rising her own fists up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's expression didn't change in the least. Silently, she continued to move slowly to one side... When suddenly, Felicia sprung forward! Maria had foreseen this and caught Felicia's high kick with her own leg, effectively parrying it! Knocking Felicia's leg aside, Maria dashed forward and delivered a fierce swing with her right arm, one Felicia managed to only barely dodge under in time! Felicia used the momentum of the movement and tried to sweep Maria's leg, but Maria jumped up and attempted to slam her elbow at Felicia from above! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia rolled to the side and jumped back up again, Maria already coming for her! Felicia dodged another punch of her opponent, but she was unable to step aside when Maria came rushing straight into her, carrying her towards the closest wall! Felicia weaseled free of her grip just before Maria slammed into the wall without her! As Maria turned around, Felicia sent a few flickering, lightning-quick kicks at her! Even with her skills, Maria couldn't block them all and suddenly, a kick connected with her jaw, sending her head reeling backwards! Just as Felicia jumped into the air to deliver a devastating blow, Maria regained her senses and stepped forward, her arms extended! Once more, Maria had caught Felicia and this time, she didn't miss a second and straightaway threw Felicia down to the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia managed to somehow catch her fall but she was badly off-balance and before she knew it, Maria had thrown herself on top of her. Felicia felt a surge of panic rising inside her as Maria pushed her against the ground, landing right on her stomach and smashing the wind out of her. Instantly, Felicia tried to buck her off, but Maria had mounted her as tightly as a rodeo rider would do with his bull; her hands slammed down onto Felicia's wrists, forcing her arms down and away from her body and the sheer mass of Maria's body sitting on her, aided by gravity was enough to pin her to the ground. Felicia gasped in shock as she realized she couldn't even kick her legs now properly... A cold feeling of dread washed over Felicia as she realized she was being completely immobilized!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's dark chuckle, coming from above, didn't help. \"Hahaha... Game over, little rebel girl.\" Maria grinned at her with such a crazed, intimidating fierceness that Felicia could almost feel her blood freezing. This was definitely <i>not </i> the kind of woman you'd want to be lying under, helpless. Yet this seemed to be the case for Felicia. She almost broke into tears here and there when Maria shifted around on top of her, raising her two large, black boot-clad feet right towards her face. \"I guess you know what this means, then? Hahaha... The situation we are in might be dire, but not like I can't allow myself a <i>little </i>fun just before I got back to work...\" Maria began, kicking and rubbing her feet together in order to shake the boots loose, as she didn't dare to let go of Felicia's wrists with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... NO, damn you!\" Felicia yelled, bucking and squirming with all her mind, but it was hopeless. \"You better appreciate this. Between the tournament and now, I obviously didn't get a chance to wash my feet. All the massive stench I had built up for my opponents is still in there, just for you. Not to mention all the sweating my poor feet had to do whilst running away from the arena, waltzing up and down in here, this little fight right now... Why, you're about to taste the best I have to offer, my dear!\" Maria chimed, her eyes shining with joy and rage. Felicia felt a drop of sweat running down her brow as the heavy, black leather boots of Maria began to come loose, centimetres from her face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here you go, enjoy!\" Maria's voice exclaimed and the next second, her large, though long and slender feet slipped out of her much-worn leather boots. Instantly, Felicia's eyes were drawn to those immense, creamy monstrosities! The entire surface of Maria's spacious soles was covered with fresh sweat and they were giving off such a thick, moist heat that Felicia felt as if her head was suddenly trapped in the middle of a tropical rainforest! Maria lost no time and spread her long, slimy toes widely before moving her huge feet downward, pressing them squarely into Felicia's horrified face! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia shuddered as the heavy, hot impact of sweaty feet met her face and for a moment, the sight of glistening, moist footsole filled her entire field of vision! As Maria pressed her feet down fully, a horrible, squelching noise was made and even Maria felt the need to comment \"Ooohh... It's even... wetter than I had expected!\" She said cheerfully, beginning to slowly rub her feet up and down. \"I'm sure you'd like one of our gas masks by now, don't you? Hahaha!\" Felicia was in pure hell. The thick, slippery and warm skin of Maria's moist feet seemed to cover every bit of her face, slowly, almost gently spreading their salty sweat across her face. And up until now, she had even managed to hold her breath! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finally did breathe in, the stench exploded all across Felicia's senses! She has more than had her share of smelly female feet in the past but this... A thick, cloying stench of ripe cheese, pure salty sweat with a horrid, burning sour note was dashing through Felicia's nose like pure acid! She opened her mouth to scream more out of sheer instinct than anything else... And the very next second, Maria had jammed the ball of her right foot in-between her lips, sealing it shut as best as possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia's whole body began to tremble and shiver and more than once did her muscles flinch violently, but Maria was unmoving like a rock on top of her! Felicia's cried of agony were muffled almost completely beneath that massive piece of foot in her mouth and to make things worse, Maria's acrid toes were now covering her nose completely! \"Night-night...\" Maria said in a sing-sang voice as all she had left to do was wait until Felicia knocked herself out by sniffing her noxious toes directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take her too long. After just one whiff, Felicia's eyes rolled aimlessly while tears streamed out of them, her muffled cries of suffering and occasional muscle spasms went weaker and weaker with each agonizing breath that was forced directly through her nose, carrying the certain doom of Maria's tainted toes! After a few minutes, Felicia stopped moving for good, and Maria climbed off from her, quite satisfied and slid her boots back on. \"Damn... I can't even begin to describe how good that felt...\" She mumbled, more to herself than to anyone else. \"Tie her up and bring her along.\" Maria said, already striding onwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... I'm terribly sorry, commander, but we left in such a rush, and... I don't think anybody has brought any sort of rope or the like.\" One of the SSS agents spoke. Maria shot her a brief glance of indignation but then simply shrugged. \"Oh well. Just carry her away then, but be quick about it. We head back to the terminal room. Also, have this room flooded with S.T.I.N.K. gas as soon as possible, just in case one of her little friends thinks about getting up any time early. We will properly deal with them once the fighting is officially over...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Maria and her agents swiftly moved out of the corridor and towards the heart of the headquarters once again. Not too soon after they arrived, Amber herself suddenly turned up, followed by a few elite guards. \"By all gods... You were right!\" She said breathlessly as she watched one of Maria's women sit the motionless Felicia down on the ground. \"I rushed over as soon as I heard about intruders in our headquarters! And... as it turns out...\" \"Yes...\" Maria finished for her. \"It was not Vanessa herself. It doesn't change much, though, Vanessa is still out there and with such an important member of hers help captive by us, we have quite an ace up our sleeve, so to say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Amber was thinking the situation through, beginning to pace around \"Would Vanessa dare to lose the life of her most trusted comrade? We have to consider even that possibility... But either way, their forces are dwindling, and time is on our side! Say... Why is she just lying around like that, though?\" Maria pointed to Felicia. \"I mean, if she wakes up...\" \"Don't worry. She won't, not any time soon!\" Maria boasted and gave a hearty laugh. Then she got serious again. \"You are right though. <i>LADIES</i>!\" Maria screamed loudly, making quite a few agents jump. \"Can't anyone of you find me a piece of good, sturdy rope???\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Certainly, commander!\" A few voices rung out and they scrambled to go find some. Just as Maria and Amber were about to discuss the next course of action, they heard a sudden voice coming from behind them!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!\" Felicia roared from the top of her lungs as she suddenly awoke again, startling pretty much the entire room! She jumped up instantly, her entire body shaking so hard she looked like she'd collapse back down any second. Felicia's face was still pale as death and her eyes were bulging as she beheld the two woman standing almost right in front of her, Maria and Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk, see, I just knew it. You forget to tie them up just once...\" Amber sighed, stepping forward herself. Felicia jumped back from her with such force that she slammed her back against the wall not too far away. \"S-Stay away! Don't- don't come near me!\" Felicia shrieked shrilly. \"Easy now. Come on, we both know it's over.\" Amber's lip quivered and she cracked her knuckles as she came closer \"Don't make this any more difficult than it needs to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia however, had the intention to make it as difficult as possible! As Amber came for her, Felicia jumped up a nearby terminal and jumped widely away from her. Maria was now rushing to Amber's aid as well. \"What is this bullshit? Take her down, but don't kill her!\" Maria commanded as she ran, and all the agents in the room gathered from where they were being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia managed to run on top of a few large computer terminals that were all around in the room, Amber hot on her trail. Suddenly, Felicia saw something and leaped at it. Amber was almost at her when Felicia landed next to a wall and came back up, a large, heavy wrench in her hands! Amber stepped back right in time as Felicia swung it at her, hitting only empty air. \"Alright, that's it!\" Amber yelled, reaching for her handgun. \"Enough with your games! Drop that!\" She ordered, pointing the gun at Felicia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Felicia didn't care, simply stepped in into Amber's range once more and tried another attack! Amber fired a shot, but it missed Felicia slightly! Felicia then slammed the wrench into Amber's outstretched arm, smashing the gun out of her grip which fired again as it fell on the ground on its own, hitting the screen of a nearby terminal, which shattered in a small explosion, throwing glass shards and sparks all over the place! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber took a step backwards, cursing, but Felica had headed to the closest terminal instead. \"Oh yeah! This is your important control center or something, right?\" She screamed, smashing the wrench into the screen as hard as she could. Only this time, it did more than shatter it, thick smoke soon poured out as a small fire was started, right inside the machine! Just then, Felicia was tackled by Amber from the side, throwing them both to the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia managed to hold on to her wrench, but Amber suddenly had another gun in her hand and aimed it directly at her head! \"It's over!\" She barked and for a moment, Felicia froze in fear! The very next instant, however, everything was turned upside-down as the smashed-in, burning terminal from before suddenly began to wheeze from the pressure of the heated steel, exploding violently not a second after!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia and Amber, who had been right next to it, where thrown away, just as Maria and the other agents were hindered from getting closer from the rapidly spreading fire coming from nearby machines, sealing their way off! Felicia blinked in pain as she opened her eyes again, lying on her back on the floor. She tried to clench her fingers around her wrench, but found that it had flown away somewhere. Instead, she winced as she cut her fingers instead on something. There also was a dull, greatly unpleasant sensation in her left left, but before she could even take a look, she heard a clicking sound and the gun from before suddenly appeared in her field of vision again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike herself, Amber had managed to hold her gun tightly, which she was now pointing right at Felicia's face once again. \"You know... Fuck the war... Fuck everything... I'll just kill you here and there...\" Amber said darkly, a trickle of blood running down her darkened face. Felicia didn't have time to think as she saw Amber's finger's clenching, she just threw herself at her, aiming at her with whatever was in her hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed to move in a pained blur. As Felicia looked, she saw a big, jagged piece of glass in her right hand. Not only was it cutting into and stained with the blood of her own hand... But the sharp end was now deeply embedded directly into the throat of Amber! Amber's eyes were opened starkly, her gun dropping to the ground as her hands raced to her throat, gripping the glass and yet not daring to pull it out. As Felicia tumbled back, letting go of the glass - and further cutting up her hand in the process - a dark stream of blood was gushing out of Amber's neck and she went down with a terrible, strained gurgling sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia tried to take another step when suddenly, a blinding pain raced through her left leg, so fierce that she was falling again for a moment. Felicia gasped as she finally took a look at her leg... A large, sharp piece of metal was lodged deep within the flesh of her upper tight. Felicia felt a surge of panic as she saw the cloth of her pants already soaked through in heavy, warm blood of herself! <i>It must have... It must have severed the artery! No...</i> Without thinking, Felicia grasped the metal with both hands and gave it a yank with all her power, ripping it free with a sickening sound! The wound it left was beyond terrible and Felicia knew she had made a mistake when more and more blood came pouring out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia felt incredibly dizzy all of the sudden and before she could do anything, she was lying on the floor again, barely feeling the force of the impact over the deep, deadly throbbing in her leg. She curled up in a little ball and gasped as she felt the blood and life steadily flowing from herself. By now, she was flanked by numerous SSS agents who had crossed the room by then, but Felicia barely even saw them. She clenched her leg as hard as she could, but the bleeding wouldn't stop! Letting out a final, pained gasp, everything was fading to black in front of her eyes as they slowly fluttered shut. In her last moments, Felicia felt as if somebody was lifting her up, but whether it really was the agents in the room or that was just a natural part of dying, that Felicia never found out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa was about to brood over her tactics and strategies once again, all alone in the small room of an occupied building, when suddenly some turmoil could be heard right on the other side of the door. \"You may not enter now. Vanessa..eeeerh I mean our leader is very busy!\", said one of Vanessa's two personal guards who had taken position in front of the mentioned door. They had not left the position even only for a second since she had been in the room. They were unquestionably loyal, so loyal, that Vanessa sometimes worried about their health. After all they had to go to the toilet sometime, or get themselves something to eat and drink, in order to survive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..please..it's important! Me and my fellow have been sent to the front lines personally by the Equmrian government. He currently distributes the leaflets we brought with us and I have a personal letter for Vanessa..signed by Lysander, now President of the Equmrian Parliament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We told you once\", Vanessa's other guard could be heard, \"and I am going to tell you another time. Our leader is..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\", Vanessa shouted loudly with a voice used to giving orders, causing everyone outside the door to be quiet immediately. For some seconds everything seemed to remain in the quiet state, creating a surreal situation in which Vanessa awaited some reaction, some sound, but all she heard was the reverb of her own voice ringing out, fading. Then, finally, after how she felt an eternity had passed, the door was slowly opened and a small caricature of a man pattered inside. He was at least fourty years old, but probably barely one meter tall, yet not thickset, rather quite the opposite - dinky and thin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at him, Vanessa thought that a slightly stronger wind gust was probably enough to swing him right off his feet. As he closed the door behind him and proceeded to patter towards her, Vanessa could see the large white envelope in his hands. Vanessa had always admired Lysander in the short time of their acquaintance back in Equmria, maybe she had even had a small crush on him, although she would most likely not admit it. No wonder that she was excited to receive a personal letter from him. In fact she had to contain herself, stay calm, smile at the envoy, gracefully accept the envelope, when she actually wanted to   just rip it out of this laughingstock's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she managed to maintain her self control and even forced herself to make some small talk with the envoy. Some minutes later he saluted, sputtered something about \"continuing his job\" and pattered away in the same manner he had arrived. Finally being alone again, Vanessa opened the letter impatiently. The first thing she noticed, was that Lysander had written it by hand, not with a computer, in a very neat and pleasant handwriting. She couldn't help but smile and so she started reading. Only seconds later her smile froze. Her eyes widened. Cold sweat started to cover her forehead and began to drip onto the letter. Her right hand holding it started to shake uncontrollably. Vanessa couldn't believe what she read. Fear, no,  more than just fear: straight panic ran through her veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe read the neat lines over and over again, but their content didn't change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hello my dear Vanessa,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCongratulations! You've made it. The war is as good as over, as good as won. As our glorious general as well as my personal friend you deserve to get informed personally about our future plans. I'll keep it relatively short for now, but be sure that once we meet again, I will explain everything to you in detail. So, let's get to it. The tyranny of Stenchlandia and it's cruel female leaders is over and I intend to make sure it will never come back. The geographical territory of Stenchlandia will be annexed and integrated into Equmria as the so-called \"New District\". We will create a huge wall and other safety installations around it and furthermore level each and everything that is connected to the SSS and their brutal regime to the ground. Their rule will also be erased from any contemporary and future history book! Last but not least, the \"New District\" will be converted into a convict colony for any imprisoned SSS agent alive after the war and also for any other Stenchlandian woman who ever did harm to a helpless man. This goes, at least how I see it, for as good as every Stenchlandian woman. They will all scrape their living in this colony and the guards, only men of course, will make sure that they experience the suffering they once have caused firsthand. Some people have to learn the hard way, Vanessa, and I will make sure they'll do. You yourself don't have to worry. Your extraordinary merits regarding Equmria and its shining future whitewash you from any cruelty you might have once forced upon an innocent man. I can't wait to see you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears deluged Vanessa's eyes and she felt dizzy. She heard a distant cacophony in her head, something droning, buzzing, hissing and banging. She didn't pay attention to it. She was too overwhelmed by the treason she held in her hands. Everything she had fought for since the LTFK had been shattered, every bit of pain she and her courageous allies (with Felicia leading the way) had endured was in vain. Destroyed by those incredibly neat, fine and proper handwritten lines. Not only had this whole war been in vain, this treacherous bastard Lysander, the man she had still admired just minutes ago, had used her. He had used her for his shortsighted and cruel vendetta. She had been the pawn on his chessboard. She thought of his smiles, his careful touches, his encouraging words when she had been at her lowest..had all this just been coldblooded calculus, in order to move the pawn where he wanted it to be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt how sickness rose inside her at the thought of this. All her vigor, her will to end a tyranny had been used to help establishing a new tyranny with switched roles. Her belief in humanity, justice, equality and human dignity had been abused to create the opposite. With a sob, Vanessa wanted to submit to her aching soul and cry, cry like she had never cried before but the strange cacophony in her head just became louder and louder. In the end, it was so loud, that she didn't even hear her own sobs anymore. Suddenly she realized. It was not in her head! Electrified by this realization, Vanessa shot up her chair and ran towards the door, slinging the letter which had not brought anything but sorrows and grief, away, down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened the door of her room, the noises became even louder, she could hear screams and shots now - her guards were away. Undeterred she kept on running, speeding herself even up until she reached the camp of her army right outside of the occupied building. The camp wasn't quite a camp anymore. Somehow it was all haywire. Then she saw it. Everywhere on the ground were those bright yellow leaflets spreading the same things Lysander had written to her personally. Now, men and women of her own forces were fighting each other. It had started most likely with some verbal disputes between male Equmrian soldiers and her Stenchlandian women but by now the situation had completely escalated. Lifeless bodies, male and female, paved the ground and the fight was still going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stoooop! Please just stop!!\", Vanessa screamed with all the power she had left, but no one deigned to look at her. From the corner of her eye, Vanessa noticed three or four Equmrian soldiers, who were beating, kicking and undressing a crying and struggling Stenchlandian woman from her reconnaissance unit. Pure anger boiled over in her and she sprinted towards the scenery. Vanessa burst out a high pitched cry of wrath as she reached the first of the soldiers. She kicked him in the balls as hard as she could and landed a forceful stroke of fist in his solar plexus at the same time. He went down with a pressed, squeaky hissing and crossed eyes. \"What the heck do you think you're doing!\", Vanessa flashed at the remaining men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer slight hope that this shocker could snap all of the crazy people around her out of their self-destructive trance didn't come true. In fact she provoked quite the opposite. One of the Equmrian soldiers pointed at her and screamed: \"There she is! That's their leader. We called her our leader as well but that was wrong. She is just another Stenchlandian bitch who deserves to rot in the \"New District\"! Let her have it!!\" From that point on, the things really escalated as if they hadn't already escalated long before. Vanessa knew that she couldn't alleviate the situation anymore, it was too late and even if, it would be rather pointless. There was nothing to rescue. The camp was akin to a ruin and her once so hard-hitting army was destroyed, the combat had already caused too many casualties. The only possibility left was to fight for one of the two sides and since the male Equmrian soldiers had already declared her enemy, the decision had already been made for Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour, the battle was finally over and the devastating results appeared in their entirety. Seventy percent of Vanessa's army was either dead or badly wounded, another twenty percent were beaten and now imprisoned Equmrian soldiers (mostly male). Their bound and gagged bodies filled up one of the larger tents which had survived the raging combat. Only ten percent of her once so large army, Vanessa herself and some other female soldiers (mostly old and experienced comrades from LTFK times or Felicia's students) were left. Inside, Vanessa didn't know if her sadness and desperation would outweigh the wrath or if  was going to come the other way round. What she knew for sure was, that she needed Felicia now, her best friend. Once she was back from her mission, they would confer about what to do and where to go, since Equmria wouldn't offer shelter any longer. Yes indeed, she needed Felicia by her side now..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa stumbled ahead through the ruined outskirts of her camp, looking ahead aimlessly. Wherever her gaze fell, she saw nothing but destruction, chaos and misery. A few of her still-loyal comrades had begun to flank her left and right when the worst was over, but to Vanessa herself, it felt as if she was walking there all alone, with nobody left around here. At least not anyone who wasn't dead, captured or a still on the loose traitor. <i>It seems to me... The whole world's... away...</i> Vanessa thought dimly as she tried to regain her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Felicia? What has happened to Felicia's crew?\" She asked, but Vanessa's usually so strong and commanding voice had been reduced to a pitiful whimper by the recent events. Those of the women next to her who even heard her words could only weakly shrug their shoulders. Vanessa bit her lip as she looked at them; Even her most trusted, brave and loyal followers looked hopelessly lost and desperate right now. <i>Of course they would do... Just look at their leader...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa cringed as she spotted her right hand colored darkly with half-dried blood. She could not remember where it had come from, or even getting it in the first place, but now she wasn't sure if she even wanted to know. \"Va-Vanessa...?\" A small voice next to her asked. Vanessa didn't even bother to look at the direction it had come from. \"What do we do now? What should we do?\" Vanessa would have loved to yell at them all, telling them that for once, how about they tell <i><b>HER</b></i> what to do when things are grim like that... But instead, she just shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to need Felicia... If her mission was successful, then maybe... Somehow... Maybe we could still turn things around. Yes... Yes!\" Vanessa was beginning to sound horribly desperate. Her hair had already begun to stand off wildly and her eyes bulged slightly as she ruffled it further with shaking hands. \"Felicia will know what to do! She <b>ALWAYS </b>comes up with a solution when I'm at the end of my logic...\" The soldiers around Vanessa looked at each other with unease as she clenched her hands in each other forcibly, fighting hard to remain control of herself and not to break down here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a voice rang out from behind. \"Let me through! Let me through! I need to...\" Whoever was speaking was also gasping and huffing terribly \"Need to get to... Vanessa herself!\" Within a second, they had reached Vanessa and her eyes shot open as she recognized the girl in front of her as one of Felicia's followers on her latest mission. \"Yes???\" Vanessa demanded, holding her breath at what was about to come. The girl looked absolutely terrible and not just from having ran for quite some distance over here; part of her uniform was singed and torn and heavy bruised marked her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I bring terrible news, my commander!\" The girl finally managed to utter. Vanessa's heart seemed to stop as her jaw opened slowly and spots danced in her vision. <i>No... No, I don't want to hear it. Please, don't let Felicia be-</i> \"Our mission... has been an overwhelming failure...\" <i>NO!!! No, no, no!</i> Vanessa swallowed hard, opening her lips. Her mouth felt dry as sand paper and when her voice rang out, it seemed to her as if somebody else was speaking \"What of Felicia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier in front of her began to shake visibly, not wanting to answer straight away. Vanessa went hysterical quickly \"What happened to <b>FELICIA</b>???\" She screamed shrilly, causing the soldier to flinch. \"The leader of our mission... Felicia... Felicia has fallen. I was with a group of captured soldiers when the room we were being in caught fire. I saw Felicia slaying one high ranking SSS member, I think her name was Amber, maybe? In the ensuing chaos, I managed to escape, but when I looked back one last time, I could clearly see Felicia breaking down in a huge puddle of her own blood. She had been gravely wounded by an explosion and flying shrapnel. My commander...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the soldier had been going about on the story, Vanessa had been silently staring forward, her eyes seemingly going blank. Her face was draining of all emotion as she relived some of her latest moments with her dear friend. <i>\"You have my leave to go... just be careful\"</i> Vanessa could hear her own words repeating as if hearing them for the first time <i>\"Godspeed, Felicia\"</i> Vanessa clenched her fists tightly, her body ever so slowly beginning to shake and tremble. Her breathing became shallow and rigid and the soldiers around her looked at her in worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Commander? Were you listening?\" The soldier from before asked, but Vanessa didn't seem to hear her. \"Please, we need commands now! Only you can pull us through this!\" <i>Felicia, my friend... Of course I knew that this was war and danger was lurking everywhere... But you actually dying on me?</i> Vanessa gave an unpleasant sound that seemed like something in between a sob and a gag. \"Vanessa...?\" One of her comrades tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden, Vanessa's eyes locked onto the soldier in front of her, her vision clear and her face contorted by pure rage. \"You let Felicia die and now you have the <b>INSOLENCE </b>to stand before me again?\" She yelled, spittle flying from her mouth. \"You are a failure! Get out of my sight! All of you... Piss off! I'm done with you! I'm done with you all, I'm done with everything!\" Her soldiers looked in silent shock at Vanessa's outburst. Some of them soon broke and ran away somewhere in blind panic, some chose to stay by their leader's side even now. It was not like they had a place to go, either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vanessa felt the surge of violent rage die down, her feeling shifted drastically. She let herself fall to her knees, clutching herself tightly. Some of her soldiers began to turn away in disgust as she began to sob and cry softly. \"Some leader you are...\" One said, spitting on the ground as she strode off quickly. Vanessa barely noted it as she rocked back and forth gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Everything was for naught! Everything that was not lies and deceit was bloody useless and for nothing! Those damn Equmrians... If not for those blasted traitors, we might have made it... Traitors, traitors are everywhere! Is it not enough with all those SSS women? Don't we have enough enemies as it is? Nobody is left on my side, save for accursed weaklings and failures. Those Equmrians! That fucking Lysander, treacherous, dishonorable rat that he is! It's all their fault! It's all HIS fault! Oh, if only I could get him... I'd made him suffer so much that he'd beg me for the mercy of death! THOSE EQUMRIANS!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Vanessa threw her head back and let out a violent, blood-curling scream, full of agony, despair and pure rage! At least for a moment, she had felt strong again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander? Maybe you should take a look at this...\" One SSS agent noted, still looking through her binoculars towards the rebel camps below. After the disastrous loss of Amber, Maria and her followers had retreated to another room, further up in the headquarters. At least the infiltration had been thwarted and no other agent had lost her life, but still, it was by far a too heavy price to bear. Nevertheless, Maria did her best to command her subordinates like usual and it seemed to work out somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" She spoke, drawing closer to the window. \"The rebels are in complete disarray! Their camps are burning, numerous are dead and it seems as though their leader is having a nervous breakdown, or something. That piercing scream, just seconds ago? I believe that was her, from all the way down there.\" The agent explained. \"But... how?\" Maria wondered, taking hold of the binoculars. \"Our reinforcements couldn't have arrived yet. Did something else attack them?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Commander. I've been watching them non-stop, as soon as we entered this room. They just suddenly began fighting each other, it began rather slow and harmless. But within minutes, everything was pure hell down there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Maria rubbed her chin, seemingly deep in thought. \"I believe I should head down there, then. They are obviously in no shape to launch an attack now and waiting in here while they scatter themselves into our city or get run down by our backup... No, I want to deal with these rebels personally. I'm not even going to need much of a bodyguard for that one...\" Maria mumbled, zooming in on one wailing and screaming Vanessa down below. \"...I could probably arrest each and every one of them alone by myself, even that Vanessa. Very well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria took a deep sigh and stepped away from the window.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria was walking briskly down towards the disarrayed, chaotic rebel camps. She was flanked left and right by exactly two other agents; she had personally insisted not to take any more with them. <i>It should be my personal aura that overwhelms Vanessa, not the number of soldiers I bring</i> It seemed as of now, Vanessa had finally more or less regained her composure or at the very least, she was not kneeling on the floor and crying loudly anymore. Some of her still-loyal people clung to her side and looked in apprehension and fear as Maria approached them. None dared to move a muscle as Vanessa herself turned to Maria and looked at her, silent, devoid of all spirit. <i>Broken, shattered. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanessa.\" Maria spoke loudly, with all the authority she could muster. Luckily, such things came natural to her. \"Your rebellion is finally over. You have lost.\" Maria scowled at Vanessa after these harsh words, waiting for a response. Even though Vanessa looked straight at her eyes, it seemed to Maria as if those eyes didn't actually make out anything. \"Yes... I suppose. It's over. It's all over. We came so far, and yet-\" Vanessa began and stopped abruptly, as if searching for words. Maria simply kept staring at her hard for a couple minutes. \"I wish to have a talk with you. Privately.\" Maria finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the remaining soldiers on Vanessa's side stepped back immediately. Only three or four remained standing by her side, shifting slightly and frowning at Maria. Maria shot them back her iciest glare. \"Know that you are beaten, fools. If you delay the inevitable, you only end up hurting yourself. I could have you arrested by force any second.\" She said darkly but by then, Vanessa herself had come up to her. \"It's alright, my dear sisters...\" She sighed. A part of her had wanted to say <i>my brothers and sisters</i>, but obviously, that was not possible anymore, not after the treason of the Equmrians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nodded and got close to Vanessa as they walked away a few paces from the others \"I thought as long and hard about this as I could, I assure you...\" Maria began \"...as things are right now, it is obvious that Stenchlandia will win this war. Yet the rest of your troops are still running wild in here and with all this chaos, I might lose several of my already far too few women that I still have under my command. I wish to deal with this situation as swiftly and cleanly as possible. And because of that, I offer you something I have never ever offered to anybody else.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria stopped and looked Vanessa in the eyes, long and hard. \"What you did, Vanessa, was rebelling and waging war against your own nation and their government. High treason; that's what this is, let's not sugar-coat this. I am not known as a very forgiving or kind person, but right now, I consider giving you an option to redeem yourself. I will be blunt with you, Vanessa. I merely do this because you have immense skill and I have need of this skill right now. Anybody else, and I would sentence them to life-long slavery right away. Needless to say, I can't simply forgive your crimes just like so...\" Maria snapped her fingers loudly, while Vanessa remained silent, simply staring at the other woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So listen up. If and only if you manage to help me arrest the rest of the remaining rebels so swiftly that we can prevent the reinforcements from the others districts from stealing the spotlight <b>and </b> avoid needless causalities and fighting, then I will grant you the chance to redeem yourself.\" Maria's stone-hard demeanour seemed to soften for a second. \"You have great skill, girl, you really do. It pains me so that you used it to help those rats and traitors.\" Vanessa's face flinched hard at the mention of the word <i>traitors</i>, Maria noted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, either way. If you fail me, you will be a footslave for the rest of your life. If you refuse me, it will be the same. This is your one and only chance to turn your life around.\" Maria concluded, her face once again hard, cold and unmoving as frozen rock. All of the sudden, a spark of fire seemed to lit up in Vanessa's eyes. \"Did you kill Felicia?\" She demanded, just like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was almost at a loss for words for a moment. <i>How can she simply ignore my proposal like that???</i> \"No. I did not.\" Right now, Vanessa stared very intense right at Maria's eyes, who met her gaze, unwavering. In the end, it seemed as if Vanessa took her word for the truth. \"We had captured her... Just before we could tie her up properly, she broke free and went full berserk. Amber - who used to be my superior - went after her but Felicia caused some machines to overheat and explode and I couldn't quite make out what was happening when fire and smoke suddenly filled the room... When I got to the two not much later, both of them had fallen. Blood loss, it was the same for both of them. It had gotten Amber straight in the throat and Felicia's entire upper leg was cut open. First I wanted to have them moved, maybe try and... do something about it, but... you know...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Maria herself seemed at a loss for words. <i>The ever-strong, commanding Amber, my boss for such a long time... And just there she was, lying before me. And there was nothing I could do...</i> \"But the bleeding was simply too strong. When he had carried them to another room, neither of them still had a pulse.\" Maria paused for a while and looked at Vanessa. Vanessa's furious expression melted away swiftly and now tears were glistering in her eyes. Maria lifted one eyebrow. \"Was it the loss of your friend that hit you so hard? I mean... I saw you break down real bad, right over here... Heard you, as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa took a deep breath. \"It was... also that, yes. For me, it was mostly that.\" \"For you?\" Maria continued, intrigued. \"Yes, for me, not so much for everybody else. You see... there was another thing... Pretty much the trigger that caused my troops to break into full chaos in the first place...\" Vanessa began, but hesitated. \"Ooooohhhhh? Do go on.\" Maria encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are aware that we had been working with a nation not too far away from this one? With Equmria, and pretty much their recently most powerful and influential man, someone named Lysander...\" Vanessa continued. \"I don't know that name, but the nation is very much known to us.\" \"Well, he had betrayed me. Has betrayed us all. We, who had been fighting for freedom and equality all this time... Lysander wanted to throw this all away. He not only meant to annex the territory of Stenchlandia as just one district of Equmria, but he...\" Vanessa lost her voice for a moment and made something of a retching sound. Maria saw some tears stream down Vanessa's eyes, but she remained silent and waited for her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but he sought to turn it into something like a gigantic prison for all the women of Stenchlandia. For the crimes committed by the government, he wants to punish the civilians. But then again, just one gender...\" Vanessa had a spout of rage and smashed her hands together \"The exact OPPOSITE of equality, that! All this time, I had just been a pawn in his game... But no, he did mean to spare me, and only me...\" Vanessa suddenly shivered and shook. \"I don't even know what to think anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria, who had listened patiently all this time, finally allowed herself to grin, shrug her shoulders and shake her head \"Oh, my dear, naive, short-sighted Vanessa. How could you be deceived so? I always thought you were a bright one.\" Now Vanessa shot her an angry look, but that was just as well for Maria \"That was your mistake, then. Trusting a man in the first place. You see, it's not even that hard. Since we women are naturally the superior sex - Surely, you can not still doubt that? - then any act to overthrow this is by itself a deceitful, dishonorable act of treason. If this Lysander of your would go against the natural way of things, why would he stop before stabbing you and everything you stand for in the back? It's only natural, really.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria placed a hand upon Vanessa's shoulder. \"The only place fit for such filth is at our sweaty, smelly feet. Their divine scent and godly touch is what shall remind them forever of their fate and eternal duty to us. It is the only way we can keep them from acting up and of course at the same time, it gives us pleasure and comfort, which we surely deserve. If you are willing to learn, I will put you back at the right path. Everybody aside from this path will only ever try to deceit and lie to you, such is the nature of things. But with me, dear Vanessa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria once again locked her own gaze firmly into Vanessa's widened eyes \"...if you stay with me, and serve Stenchlandia well, I will make sure that nobody will ever betray you again.\" Maria waited for a short while and as soon as she heard Vanessa mumble \"Nobody... ever again...\" she knew that she had her. Maria smiled and gave Vanessa a hard pat on the back. \"So, come on now. We have a lot of work to do. You round up the rest of your loyal women, I call upon mine and then we will put the rest of these chaotic, scurrying rebels into their right place. I know you can do this, Vanessa, because if you fail this, no matter because of what reason...\" Maria stared at her darkly for a moment \"Then I will make sure you pay dearly for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa took a deep breath, closed her eyes and then looked back at Maria. \"No, I will do this. Right now, I have nothing to lose, really. I will not fail you.\" Maria smirked and nodded at her. \"That is what I like to hear!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa closed her eyes and clenched her hand nervously as she walked back to approach her own soldiers again. What she was about to tell them was more or less to do the exact opposite of what she had always told them before. <i>How will THEY take such news? It doesn't matter... I have no choice.</i> She took a deep breath, ready to unleash her voice when she finally arrived in the center of the ruined and smoking camps. Thankfully, by now, the remaining people had more or less nicely re-arranged themselves for her already; at least Vanessa could tell that all the women who were still willing to follow her were standing in close proximity and once more flocking to her as they saw her. Everybody else - traitors, deserters and the like - were already too far gone to prove much of a problem right now. <i>Or at least I hope so...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People of the rebellion! You brave, loyal women who still decided to stay by my side... I can finally tell you the way we need to be heading right now!\" <i>God knows there's already far to few of you, anyway...</i> Vanessa thought as she glanced over the women surrounding her. She had come into this city with an entire army, and now she was left with around a hundred women, give or take a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am very sorry to say this, and my failure shames me greatly... But our mission was doomed to fail from the moment we misplaced our trust. From the very moment we let those treacherous Equmrian bastards know about our plans, we paved the road to our own demise.\" Vanessa concluded. \"But what about before?\" One of the women yelled \"We didn't need those traitors before and still gave the SSS a good run for their money! Our cause... our cause was righteous, was it not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shook her head firmly. \"No. I'm afraid I have been misguided from the very beginning. My entire hopes and dreams rested on the illusion that something like my ever-praised equality could truly work out. Well, now I saw and learned that it did not, and the illusion was shattered. Far too many lifes have been wasted, for nothing...\" Vanessa took a deep breath and steeled her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But enough of that! Now is the time to look forward again, as long as we even have any time left! My good sisters... The only way opened for us is to join the Stenchlandian ranks and help them deal with the rest of the now free-roaming rebels.\" At that, a cry of outrage and disbelief went through Vanessa's soldiers. \"What? Joining them? The enemy?\" \"But that would only make us turn-cloaks as well!\" \"I came too far to throw my principles away now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa frowned, she had feared they wouldn't take it too well. But then, a few other opinions mixed in there as well. \"You know... I'm game. Right now, I don't really care about anything anymore.\" \"Yes! Let's do this! I want to take revenge! I want to make those traitors pay!\" \"Yes! Those Equmrians... Let's take the betrayal right back to their worthless asses!\" \"I will always follow you, Vanessa, always!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Vanessa thundered, silencing the turmoil beneath. \"Every woman willing to follow me, step to this side. Everybody else, go over here!\" She commanded, pointing left and right with her hands. \"But of course know that if you choose not to follow me now, your fate is sealed. I hate to say this, but right now... If you're not with us, you're against us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa waited, her fist twitching, as the women took sides. <i>We really don't have that much time, right now...</i> Finally, Vanessa allowed herself to smile as the majority of the women before her had chosen to stay by her side. \"Very well, soldiers. I'm proud that even after all this, you are willing to find the true way, together with me.\" Vanessa turned your head to the other group. \"Are you absolutely certain about this?\" She yelled at them, pointing one finger accusingly. They remained silent for a while, then two or three of them yelled back \"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well...\" Vanessa felt a surge of adrenaline as she mentally prepared herself. \"You have failed to follow a direct order. You will be arrested!\" She declared and within a moment, but Vanessa herself and her still-loyal women were at them from all sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too long after that, Vanessa and her followers met up with Maria, who had just like she said before, gathered all the SSS agents and soldiers still present under her command. Even though Vanessa had even less soldiers following her than before, when she saw Maria's team she was surprised to see that she didn't have any more women than she herself did. Right now, both of them had about fifty left. <i>We've bled them out pretty bad, hehe...</i> Vanessa thought with a certain pride, but quickly shook those thoughts off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there you are, Vanessa! Good to see that you did as I said... But the real work begins now!\" Maria allowed herself to smile grimly as she smacked her hands together, glancing briefly over Vanessa's soldiers. Most of them eyed her warily, with mistrust and apprehension in their eyes. But on the other hand, the looks the SSS agents had to offer to Vanessa's side weren't much warmer, either. <i>It will just have to do, for the start...</i> Maria thought, before clearing her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Now, we will catch every single last rebel vermin once and for all! Vanessa, as well as <b>any </b>good woman under her command will be given a chance to be welcomed back into our society, once this is over.\" <i>Do you see? I am not like the man who has betrayed you!</i> \"I trust you know this territory well enough, Vanessa...\" Maria concluded. Vanessa simply nodded. \"The goal is to capture every last one of them without causing any bloodshed, if at all possible. And we must do so quickly enough... Alright, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actual hunt for the fleeing and panicked rebels went smoother than either Vanessa or Maria would have thought. There was barely any resistance from them, most of them tried to run away still, but with their superior knowledge of the city and teamwork, Maria and Vanessa easily caught them. A very few of them tried to talk or bargain their way out, a handful even tried to fight back; but with someone as forceful as either Vanessa or Maria facing them, such resistance was absolutely futile. Within half an hour, both of their teams had gathered back in front of the SSS headquarters, bringing with them dozens and hundreds of prisoners. Thanks to the chaotic outbreak at Vanessa's camp before, most of the male soldiers had already been captured or knocked unconscious back there, so Vanessa was fairly certain that the number of women they both caught should match up with the number of people still missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe we have most of them now, Commander.\" Vanessa spoke, addressing Maria. <i>Saying that feels so wrong, and yet...</i> \"It may be that a handful or so managed to hide somewhere, but it can't be more than... say, one dozen in total. They can't possibly pose much of a threat.\" Maria nodded. \"The regular Stenchlandian police will be more than apt at sniffing them out. And that won't be the only type of sniffing, following that, haha. Oh well... Job well done!\" Maria congratulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too long after that, just when the two leaders had almost finished gathering up all the captives and transporting them to the headquarters, a very large number of soldiers lead by a woman unknown to Vanessa appeared, looking around themselves in mild confusion. Their leader instantly ran up to Maria who greeted her with a smile and a salute. \"We came as quick as we could, but the city is big... However, it seems that you are not in need of our help anymore?\" The newly-arrived commander wondered. \"That's correct. We've had... quite a big mess here, I can't deny that...\" Maria began, glancing over the smoking and shattered rebel camps and the dozens of prisoners - the last of them, but still quite a few - being led to their prison. \"...but in the end, I did manage to keep everything under control by myself.\" Maria gave a proud smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so... Oh well.\" The other commander gave a look of mild disappointment. \"I was hoping I could catch myself a few slaves for free, making taking a thin slice of the glory of the fighting...\" <i>Oh, I know that too well. Only you would have gone for the entire cake, not just a slice...</i> Maria thought as she shrugged. \"Yes, we could almost call it unfortunate that we don't have uprisings of this size more often, right? Hahaha...\" Maria cleared her throat. \"Tell you what, for the trouble of coming all the way over here for nothing, you can pick one of our prisoners for every ten of your women. One for you personally, as well.\" Maria said with a smile. <i>They came here with a few hundred soldiers... Yet we have <b>hundreds</b> of prisoners ourself. I wouldn't even know what to do with all of them.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other commander's face lit up. \"Ahh, thank you for your kindness, comrade! Believe me, after this long march, being in these boots all the time, my feet are just begging for a dutiful slave to take care of them... And I'm sure my soldiers feel the same!\" Maria nodded with a smirk. <i>This way, every one of the prisoners will have to deal with about ten pairs of sweaty feet which just walked across half of our city... I would NOT want to be in their place...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the reinforcements had departed again, Vanessa met up with Maria once more, this time inside the headquarters. Maria had already given orders that for the first thing to be done right now, all the damaged and destroyed buildings and part of infrastructure to be repaired. All of Vanessa's women were obliged to take part in this, as part of their \"rehabilitation\". For Vanessa herself, Maria had different plans. \"You see, Vanessa... It is all nice and well that we properly reclaimed this city... But we can both agree that we can't let Equmria stay, not after what they did to both our sides?\" Vanessa nodded grimly. \"Yes... I, too, wish to take them down. And I know quite a lot about their capital and leader, having been there myself...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the next few hours, Maria was overwhelmed with questions about how the things could and would go on. Most of the ones asking her this were terrified citizens or fresh recruits. Although she detested their obviously shown fear and helplessness, she didn't allow herself to burst out in anger. Instead she answered in a nice and calm way, which was nevertheless sparkling with authority. Once she would be fully established on top of the Stenchlandian government, she would make sure that every girl would be educated well in the most important virtues: Discipline, Reliability, Reason, Loyalty, Courage and Effort!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now she had to rebuild what had been destroyed in large part. Not only buildings and infrastructure, but also the will to combat and the sense of superiority which had distinguished the Stenchlandian soldiers and the SSS before the cold waves of war had surged against the walls of the capital, the now only slow and diffident beating heart of Stenchlandia. To achieve this, Maria had to be someone she had never been and never wanted to be. She needed to provide new hope for the scared female citizens instead of demanding absolute dedication to the cause, like she usually did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Heck! Some had even been so scared that they had freed their own house slaves, the reason why several police units are now busy chasing through the damaged streets!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short moment of ironical inspiration, Maria realized that she had to what had always been Vanessa's strength. Vanessa, who was busy getting her remaining comrades in shape again and reeducating them in the way Maria had shown her, on the other hand, had to act as demanding as Maria loved it. They basically switched roles without even noticing it. That was the first time after the storming of the arena, when she really laughed heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Maria was not only confronted with scared people, longing for her help. There were also so called \"highly qualified and experienced\" officers, who bombarded her over and over with different advices as if Maria herself was not highly skilled and probably three times as experienced as these busybodies. The most annoying aspect however, was that the advisors didn't agree with each other most of the time and started fighting whose idea was the better one. For Maria it was way harder to control herself in situations like these. People who knew her close enough would have noticed her anger by the way she clenched her fists and by the way her toes started to wiggle wildly inside her combat boots..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the early afternoon, Maria took a break and retreated inside her personal quarters to take a nap alone, but things worked out differently. She had just swung herself on her bed when someone knocked at her door. Being really furious now, Maria got up again and walked towards her door. <i>\"If this is just another unimportant bullshit coming at me, then I swear that the intruder will get a good taste of my combat boots, no matter who it is!\"</i> With all her force she tore the door open and..stared into a familiar face. After what felt like hours, she found her voice again and asked: \"L - Lara?!\" The woman in front of Maria didn't answer. Instead she jumped forward and cuddled Maria with a scream of relief. \"Thank god, you've made it as well, Maria! I heard Amber is...dead? I'm so glad to be with you again..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, relax Lara, relax\", Maria answered while awkwardly patting Lara's head. \"Yes it is true, Amber is gone..but you should know that no one is going to kill me easily! The war is over for now and we've won. Most of the enemy is dead or imprisoned, but we even got some new recruits from their old ranks. Vanessa herself is among them.\" At this point, Lara looked up. \"What? Why is she helping us?\" Maria grinned. \"Although the forces were still kind of even, I guess that she just didn't see another way to go. Besides she's got some other, more complicated reasons..I guess if you're really interested, you should ask her yourself. But what happened to you actually? I didn't see you anymore, after the arena, and I feared the worst to be honest..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara sighed deeply. \"Well, when the arena descended into chaos, I didn't manage to escape early enough. I guess I was too surprised and shocked by the situation. When I finally started moving, it was already to late. The pull of the panicking mass caught me and shortly after, I slipped like many others. We were trampled by the crowd, I was lucky and got away with a broken arm and a blue eye.\" Saying this, Lara first pointed at her left arm in plaster, then at an eyepatch over her left eye. \"The rest of my body was, as macabre as it may sound, successfully covered by other bodies who absorbed the hits, kicks and general weight. I don't know how long I laid there on the ground and played dead, but eventually I had a chance to slip off unseen. At this point I believed that everything was lost and so I wanted to flee from the capital. A pathetic moment of weakness I now dearly regret. However, I didn't make it all too far. My head and eye was aching like crazy and my arm hurt at least ten times as much. I found myself a small, empty, almost destroyed house and passed out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria listened to all this and couldn't help but being amazed at how exciting the story was. \"I don't know how long I was out, but I barely remember waking up several times and losing consciousness again over and over. The next thing I remember is that someone woke me up. I thought that everything was over, because I obviously expected them to be Equmrians who'd arrest me for good, since I was still wearing my SSS-uniform. However, it turned out that they were Stenchlandian policewomen. They quickly brought me into the field hospital of your reinforcements, who were just reaching the capital. There I got a medical treatment for my eye and arm, as well as some painkillers. In there I heard the rumours about Ambers death, and after I had slept for a few hours, I came here as fast as possible.\" After Lara ended, a strange feeling overcame Maria. At first she fought it, but then she gave in..and cuddled Lara herself now. \"It is awesome, that you are back, Lara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Lara's turn to grin. \"That's natural, Maria. You taught me! But, if I may ask, what are we going to do now? I mean not we as in us both but we as in Stenchlandia.\" Maria nodded. \"You may ask. Well we are going to fight back and bring this war to <b>their</b> capital! But not just yet. We need some more time to regain our strength, recruit new soldiers and improve our technical support. A fatal counterstrike needs precise preparation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good!\", Lara shouted. \"But another thing..can I shower here? I haven't seen water ever since the arena, and my feet even longer. I think they haven't been washed since before the preparation for the tournament. It has been so hot in my combat boots, my socks were away I guess they stuck in some slave's mouth. Let me tell you, Maria, my feet don't even swim in sweat anymore. It's more like the sweat and stink literally baked to my feet! Back in the field hospital, one nurse wanted to take my boots off but I advised her not to do. Else I guess, I would have been accused for launching a bio attack against our own soldiers.\" Maria laughed loudly. \"Sure, I've got a shower here, but why don't you shower later and use this unique state of your feet against one of our many prisoners? If he survives you can even keep him as your personal slave, if you want! I need to go now anyways, so I can bring you to them.\" Now Lara started smirking and giggling. \"Okay, that is indeed an interesting idea. I like the 'if he survives' part. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly seconds later, both of them left Maria's quarters and headed further towards to new camp's heart. Suddenly they were joined by an averagely ranked officer who brought some news for Maria. \"Commander, the recruiting is going better than expected. We're having three times as many volunteers and from time to time, deserters are coming back asking for forgiveness. What shall we do to them?\" \"Hm\", Maria said. \"I would have taken them all back, if we would have severe recruiting problems, but since that is not the case.. Create a random list of all these deserters and then give each of them a 1, 2 or 3 as number. Make sure that each number is presented about equally often. Everyone with the number 1 will be fully pardoned and get back in with the old ranks and possessions. Everyone with the number 2 will be pardoned but they'll have to start all over again from zero, and without any ancient possessions. They'll have to proof their loyalty. And everyone with number 3 will be arrested and face lifetime footslavery, to prevent anyone from deserting again. Oh and, once again, make sure that the list really is completely random. Everyone needs to see that our values are more important than wealth, influence or ranks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye-aye, miss!\", barked the officer. \"There is just another thing about the new recruits..\" Maria hated it, when people just couldn't be straight and just had to make a mystery out of everything first. \"What about them?\", she asked, a bit less nice and with more authority in the voice. \"There is this woman, she says her name was Laurie. She's also got a younger girl, something between 17 and 19 years old, named Sarah with her. Both of them volunteer either for the SSS or for the army. But the real interesting thing is the story, Laurie told us. She claims to be..President Lysander's mother! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!\", Maria could not help but let out a shout of surprise. \"Now that really sounds interesting! You've done well by informing me so quickly, girl. You're up for a promotion soon. Now get back to work, I'll have a talk with those two.\" While the officer scurried away with a broad smile on her face, Maria turned her head to Lara. \"Things get more interesting every minute..\", she said, \"Hahaha, anyways come on Lara, let's get you to those prisoners. You've got a nice breeze to share!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Now, while we make our way to the frontyard - This is usually where volunteers show up, we can easy stop by one of our impromptu prisons. To be honest with you, Lara, we've caught so many of them that we barely know where to keep them all. Of course every woman in Stenchlandia would love to have her own footslave, but we can't just let prices drop beneath their natural value, now can we? Either way...\" Maria took a breath as they turned around a corner. \"You should have ample choice to pick a slave most to your liking. Thanks to the deserters and women in Vanessa's army - Those who did <i>not </i> listen to the true way - we even have a proper number of female slaves; something which is usually an exotic delicacy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara couldn't help but grin broadly as she listened to that. \"Yes, I am sure I will find one suited to my needs... Someone who does not get knocked out right from the start... That should do nicely, I would say.\" \"Haha, try them as you wish. Besides... You did say you wanted to wash your feet, didn't you? Well, why waste perfectly good water when you can have a slave's tongue do all the work, \u00e9h? Anyway, we're here now...\" Maria concluded, pointing at a few large metal cages. That room had not originally been designed to be a prison, that much was for sure; it looked more like some sort of big conference room. At least there was ample space for the prisoners to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more or less bored Stenchlandian soldiers were guarding the cages, swiftly saluting as Maria strode by them. \"This agent here wishes to pick one of the prisoners as her slave. She has my permission to try them out for as long as she wishes!\" Maria commanded and the guards stood aside, one of them handing over a small key. \"Don't worry, the prisoners have their wrists and ankles both shackled together, since we've had to deal with some nifty lock-pickers in the past... It should be perfectly safe for you to enter the cages!\" One of the guards said to Lara, who only laughed lightly. \"Oh, you need not be concerned about myself... I have handled many a dangerous situation and these few bound and helpless prisoners should hardly pose a problem... Although I would advice you to take a few steps back, once I am inside. It will get quite a bit... malodorous here in this room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria chuckled to herself \"Hehe, you better listen to what she says! Anyway, I will take my leave now. Try not to have too much fun without me, Lara!\" Giving her a wink, Maria did as she said and briskly left the room again, heading for her volunteers. \"Alrighty then!\" Lara exclaimed happily, clapping her hands together and walking up to the closest cage and turning the key. There were multiple people locked inside, three men and two women, and Lara wasted no time grabbing the closest prisoner - one rather scrawny, thin looking guy - by the neck and dragging him closer to her. He offered no resistance at all and the bruises on his face told Lara of what he had been through before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... Don't make me smell any more feet...\" He begged weakly \"Those soldiers... Numerous of them already made me smell theirs...\" Lara giggled hysterically at this! \"Hahaha, oh my, didn't I just make the perfect pick right for the start? Let's see for long you will survive <b>these</b>...\" Dragging his head down to her black combat boots, Lara began to kick them off. Even though it took some effort, her feet finally sprung free... And directly into the unfortunate face of the man in front of her! A soft, juicy sound was heard as Lara's gentle, slender soles placed themselves all over his shivering face! Within seconds, her footsweat was running down his chin and dropping lazily to the floor... And that was when he took his first breath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, it was also his last breath. As soon as the hot, humid fumes of Lara's overworked, unwashed feet entered his nostrils, an agonized, violent shaking fit hit him and he passed out under horrible, strained gagging. Not a second later, Lara herself was taught just why it had been so intensive; her own footstench reached her nose! With all their heat and moisture stored, Lara's feet were distributing her toxic smell into the air like smoke from a smoke grenade; within sheer moments, it had spread throughout the entire cage, and beyond!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara took a deep, curious sniff through her nose and immediately regretted doing so as the tell-tale aroma of her own feet - rich with the flavors of sweat both stale and fresh, old, well-aged cheese and vinegar - clouded her mind like sleeping gas and seemed to set her nose on fire! Lara began coughing and felt her eyes starting to stream tears. \"Oh... oh dear! It's even... stronger than at the tournament! You guys should consider yourself lucky! You won't get to smell something like this anytime soon! Who wants to be the next to taste my feet?\" Lara said with a broad grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other captives in the cage had already backed away as far as possible as the horrid, cheesy wave of pure, rotten foot stink reached them, some of them desperately trying to cover their faces as best as their bindings allowed them! Lara seized one of the two women, slowly dragging her closer and extending one foot, aiming for her face. \"Come here, come here! Do you have what it takes to clean my feet?\" Lara exclaimed cheerfully, spreading her shining, moist toes widely. The girl's eyes rolled up as she was hit with the pure blast of those things. \"No... urgh!\" She retched. \"No, no, no, aaaiiiiigh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cries of agony were cut short when Lara pressed her dripping wet, slimy footsole squarely into her face. \"Smell them, smell them! Smell my feet!\" Lara sang in excitement as she played with the helpless girl's nose, squishing and rubbing it slightly with parts of her foot. She giggled with glee as she felt the cool stream of air on their hot surface as the poor girl beneath her sole wasn't left with much of a choice. A terrible, pathetic whimpering and weakly muffled gagging sounds emerged from her victim, yet she wasn't knocked out yet! \"Yes! You're doing quite nicely! Now, for the next part...\" Lara said maliciously, spreading her toes directly beneath the girl's nostrils! Lara sighed happily as she felt her hot toes getting cooled and the girl beneath her bucked and squirmed in panicked frenzy as her mind went blank at experiencing the sheer stench!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her feet off from her once more, Lara pouted. \"None of you in here who can take the smell of my little feet here? Come on!\" She demanded as she headed over to the others. There was one particular woman who caught her eye; Unlike the others still left, her eyes didn't tremble with pure terror and instead she looked at Lara with nothing but cold, hard hatred. \"Ohhh? You seem like an interesting girl, don't you?\" Lara said as she approached her. The woman flinched visibly as the stench of Lara's feet intensified even more, but otherwise kept perfectly still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your deal, hmmm?\" Lara demanded, but the other girl simply kept silent for a while. \"Very well! I'd prefer it if you deal directly with my feet, in any case, hahaha!\" Lara exclaimed, wasting no time and planting one of her moist, warm feet firmly over her target's face. Now she did grunt in disgusted agony and suffering as she got her first taste of Lara's feet up close and personal. \"They are quite something, no? If you do a good job, you can smell them every day!\" Lara said, slowly beginning to rub her foot up and down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, the woman didn't pass out, even when Lara let her smell directly between her toes, although she did sink down a little and began to shake dangerously. \"Good... good... Now lick them.\" Lara commanded. Finally, the other woman spoke up as well. \"N-Never!\" She managed to sputter as Lara's foot slipped off her face. \"I will never- hmmmpffhhh!\" Lara had taken none of it and swiftly jabbed her toes into the woman's opened mouth. \"Ohh, you still got spirit, I like that! You may need a little training in proper behaviour, but I would be more than happy to grant you that! Now LICK!\" Lara demanded, squeezing her toes deeper into the mouth of her victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she began to struggle real hard! Lara was almost knocked away from her, but then she grabbed her tightly and pressed the toes over of her left foot across the free parts of her face, all the while pumping her right one's toes in as deep as possible into the girl's mouth. Lara grinned with pleasure as she felt the hot, slippery touch of a tongue brushing ever so gently against her toes. The girl retched and gagged and trembled as she was forced to both taste and smell Lara's feet in their most dangerous state... And not a minute later, she was out cold as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. That was quite something!\" Lara concluded, putting her boots back on and striding back out of the cage. In mild amusement, she noticed that all the guards had backed away to the closest wall, staring at her in terror and repulsion, some of them outright holding their noses. \"What? I <b>did </b>tell you it would smell, didn't I? Either way... I believe I will choose that one!\" Lara said, pointing at the girl she had knocked out right before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise you... I will take good care of her, bwahahahaha!\" Lara giggled, rubbing her hands together.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria smiled as she strode briskly out of the front doors of the SSS headquarters and towards the large square in front of it. She was really quite curious about meeting this woman that was promised to her... Lysander's mother. <i>The mother of one of my worst enemies... And coming to me to aid our side. Life really is delicious, somehow.</i> Maria soon came upon several several columns of women standing in a row; these were most likely the \"normal\" volunteers, waiting to be picked up to be checked and valued. Pretty much any woman with two legs and a working brain could serve in the army, but the SSS was privileged only to the most capable, cunning and fit people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maria let her eyes wander, it did not take her long to spot the two women she had been looking for! Despite not having seen them before, it was quite obvious that there was some connection when the younger one of them suddenly began to jump up and down, pointing at Maria. \"There she is! That's the one I told you about, Laurie! The legendary Maria, coming right for us! Oooohhh, I am so honored!\" As Maria strode closer to them - suppressing the urge to smile at the young woman's behavior to maintain a stern and authoritative face - a nearby SSS officer approached her as well, giving a short salute. \"Good day, commander. I think my colleague informed you of these two...?\" She said, and Maria responded with a nod. \"Indeed. I will talk to them personally. Dismissed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer saluted again and swiftly turned away while Maria took a closer look at the two women in front of her. Just from the first glance, Maria would have guessed them to have good potential as SSS agents, as both of them looked rather slim, slender and all around very fit. The younger one gave such a sharp and quick salute with her hand that Maria could almost hear the air getting cut by her hand. Her murky, greenish-blue eyes shone with enthusiasm as she began to speak. \"Commander! It is such an honor for us to be met personally by someone as great as you!\" Now Maria did allow herself to smirk shortly. \"Thank you, I actually heard you say that before as well, if truth be told. Am I really that famous?\" Of course Maria knew very well just how well-know she was, but the girl took the opportunity without a second thought!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Your willpower, tactical ingenuity and close combat fighting skills are unparalleled in the entire Stenchlandia!\" The girl almost yelled, her eyes burning with zeal. <i>Well, she certainly isn't lacking spirit. Congratulations, Maria, you just got yourself a fan.</i> Maria's face hardened again. \"I am told both of you wish to join the SSS. Tell me then, why should I take you?\" Maria glanced closer at the older woman for the first time. Perhaps calling her \"older\" was uncalled for; Maria guessed her to be in her early thirties at best; her sandy blonde hair and very attractive face making her look most likely something younger as well. Maria could see the muscles on her arms and legs and it was plain that this woman would wield tremendous strength in a fight, if properly trained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was the younger girl who spoke up right away, once more. \"Two reasons, commander! For one, we both are very capable, able-bodied and disciplined women!\" <i>If you weren't, it would have been foolish to come here, in the first place...</i>, Maria thought, but nodded her to go on \"...also, both of us have a clear and important goal in mind! Mine is revenge!\" Maria simply had to smile as well. If anything, she could understand that reason very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to know, commander, before I decided to join the forces, I lived in a family of three people. My father having already died, there was a younger brother of mine, Joe, our mother and me left. Some time after the war broke out, my mother tragically died when an armed conflict got out of control, not too far from her working place. And, well, my brother is gone as well. But not dead, he has escaped. And this is the part you might find interesting; he went straight to Equmria!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria raised one eyebrow slightly and nodded again. She did not find that all too interesting, after all, there had been many escapees making there way into that blasted nation! \"But that's not all! Guess whom he befriended there? Yes, the great and mighty Lysander!\" Now Maria's interest <b>was </b>piqued. <i>So, this girl connects to this Lysander as well, through her brother. If she has the skills, I see no reason to deny her wishes. It's just...</i> \"And why do you feel the need to take revenge against your brother?\" Maria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he refused to be my proper footslave and dared to flee from us! Is that not reason enough?\" Very bluntly spoken, but Maria had to admit this girl had a good point. Nothing quite irked her herself than when a slave didn't know his proper place. \"Plus, he is working with the enemy as we speak; a traitor to our nation! A <b>traitor </b>, and of my blood. My brother... I feel like it is my <b>duty </b>to bring him to justice!\" Maria smiled widely, nodding again. <i>Yes, I really do like this girl's zeal.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. And what of you...?\" Maria began, pointing to the other woman. She cleared her throat. \"It is quite similar with me, as well. My name is Laurie. It is also my goal to carry out a certain duty, maybe you could even call it revenge... As you may have heard, I am the Equmrian president's mother... Lysander is my son. He left me several years ago, never explicitly stating just what he was going to do... Needless to say, I could never have anticipated anything of this sort! I would never have let him leave had I know he would wage wars and the such...\" \"Yes, let alone a war against our glorious Stenchlandia!\" Maria interjected sharply. \"Of course, but back then, Stenchlandia hadn't been declared yet. It was still the old nation, you know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nodded thoughtfully. If this woman had allowed a soon-to-be rebel traitor out of the country, this act by itself could have been viewed as high treason. But even in Stenchlandia, you couldn't persecute crimes against laws which at the crucial time did not exist at all. <i>At least, not officially.</i> \"Hmmm, still... You said you let him leave, yes?\" Maria added. \"That's correct... I do regret it a lot. But back then, it seemed such a little deal and he was always a free spirit. Besides... It was usually really uncomfortable for him at home.\" Laurie said, glancing off for a second. \"Ohhh? And why is that?\" Maria urged, intrigued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to be honest... It was because of my feet.\" <i>This is just TOO perfect!</i> Maria thought, her smile flashing \"Why do you say that in such a bashful voice? That's a great trait to have for any Stenchlandia woman!\" \"Oh, I know. But... you know, I AM his mother, after all. Being in the same room as my bare feet is not a pleasant fate...\" \"Hah, I can vouch for that!\" Sarah laughed, waving a hand in front of her face \"...and having to smell that all the time, well. Lysander has always complained about the smell of my feet and everything only became worse after I became a professional hunter. Prowling the wild for hours and hours, stalking after and running at my prey with my feet encased in hard, withstanding boots... That did not do well for my foot aroma at all. Just my boots are usually enough to stink up an entire room within minutes. With my socks alone, I can knock out most people just by making them smell them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria gave an acknowledging whistle at that. What Laurie had describe was a well-known, relatively middle-leveled technique of the SSS, yet to pull it off without any kind of official training was not bad for a start at all. \"Either way, I would have found it really cruel not to let him run away from me, back then...\" Now Maria's expression hardened again. \"But naturally, this opinion of yours has changed... Correct?\" \"Of course! After what he did to our nation, and that's not even covering the rumors about him planning to create his own personal set of laws, something which I hear is basically the opposite of Stenchlandia...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shook her head sadly and then locked her eyes onto Maria's, a dead serious, hard expression on her face. \"No, I can not forgive him that. If I ever meet him again, I will smother him beneath my reeking, sweaty soles until he doesn't even have the strength to complain anymore!\" Maria gave a contend nod. \"Well spoken, comrade. Good, good... Both of you seem very fit for your roles, in my eyes! I will see to it that you receive your official equipment today, if possible. I will of course need to have a few more talks with you about Lysander, Laurie... as his mother, I am sure you know a few things that could prove useful in catching him. And naturally...\" Maria turned to Sarah, with a smile \"If we manage to find your brother, I will make certain he gets delivered right at your feet, comrade! Both of you... let's make Stenchlandia proud!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Maria turned away from the two newcomers and walked back towards the headquarters again. After a short while, Vanessa turned up close to her. \"Are you already heading for the stage? I believe you did say I could come, correct?\" For a moment, Maria was completely lost. Then it came back to her. \"Ahhh... of course... That. Right, right, that was today.\" Vanessa seemed positively stricken. \"How could you <i><b>forget</b></i>? It is today they are planning to officially announce you as the next leader of the SSS; after the recent one has... departed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nodded. There had been no other woman anywhere near who had extinguished herself in the war quite in the way Maria had, plus she had been a long-serving agent even before that. There had been no real competition for the next leader, really. \"Yes... I know. I just don't like such big, fancy festivities that much, is all. Especially when there are still important things to be done.\" \"Ah, but Maria! You will be <b>the star of the show!</b> I hope you will give a good speech... I love speeches, myself!\" Now Maria had to chuckle. \"Yes...Yes, I am quite aware of that, Vanessa. And yeah... we should probably get going... Time's not on our side quite yet.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The arena was, although being severely damaged in some spots, brimful with people. It was not a coincidence that Maria would hold her speech there. Although the main organizers of the \"event\" had wanted to convince her to hold the speech somewhere else, Maria had insisted to do it exactly here. Where the battle of this city had begun. Now, a few minutes before she would go up the stage and speak to hundreds of Stenchlandian women (mainly SSS or army members, but also ordinary citizens) she felt calm and ready. All the prior stress and excitement had went away as if Maria was used to all this. For the moment, she just wanted to get started as soon as possible, fearing that waiting for too long could bring the excitement back. Then, finally three loud and low rings of a huge bell could be heard, the sign to start. Immediately, the babbling mass in the arena's galleries was quiet. \"Ok. Let's get this over with!\", Maria thought to herself and got up on stage..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the very second, Maria appeared on stage, the crowd began to applaud and cheer. She was able to sound her name out as well as the words \"heroine\" and \"leader\", yet she forced herself to stop paying attention to irrelevancies like these and focus. So Maria clothed her face in smiles and waved her hand unostentatiously. After about two minutes everyone was quiet again. The most important part of her appointment ceremony was about to happen: The presentation of the regalia. Every new leader of the SSS received three personal regalia. The SSS was proud of this tradition and without the successful ceremony, no woman could ever call herself legitimate head of the SSS. Three bemedalled generals of the SSS made their way up to Maria, two of them carrying a small red and golden embellished box. With a brief look into the tense crowd, the most exalted general started speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have gathered here, to dismiss our old leader Amber, who was killed in action, and to select a new one. Amber was..\", her voice broke for a second, \"..she was not only a strong person and leader. She was also a friend of mine. We've attended the SSS-academy together, fought together, won together..and now she is gone. Brutally robbed from her life by..this war.\" Maria looked to the ground and made an affected face. She knew the script for this speech, and actually the general had wanted to say \"brutally robbed from her life by a dirty rebel named Felicia who is now rotting in hell\". Maria had forbidden that, because it was too risky. She needed Vanessa on her side, not against her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we are not here to talk about Amber. We are here to present our new leader, Maria. But before we go on, I ask everyone to honor Amber one last time by holding a moment of silence.\" The demand was accommodated dearly, and after a minute had passed, three fusillades were fired up in the air, accompanied by three loud cheers: \"AMBER! AMBER! AMBER!\" After a short while to gather herself again, the general continued to speak. \"As I said before, now it is time to present our new leader, Maria! I am sure all of you know her and the efforts she dared, for the good of Stenchlandia. I ask you now: Do you want Maria to be your leader?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was not even finished, and the crowd already started to cheer wildly. <b>\"Yes! We want her! We want Maria! MARIA!\"</b> \"I'll take that as a clear yes\", the general went on: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it is up to you, Maria. Do you want to take this responsibility?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you swear to do everything you can, to prevent Stenchlandia from any kind of threats and downfall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you also swear to bundle all your energies in order to make Stenchlandia greater, mightier and to spread the Stenchlandian idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I vow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. My last question for you is: Do you swear here and now, in front of all these gathered people, to put Stenchlandia and its needs first - forever and always?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I gladly do so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case..you are now head of the SSS, Maria! We got a new leader!! You've proved worthy to receive the regalia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as these words faded away in the arena, a loud storm of enchantment branded through all galleries. The two other generals now opened the box and presented the regalia. The first one was a pair of boots. They were custom-made, composed of extremely dark and precious leather with some metal parts to stabilize them and make them battle ready. A small and filigree red M was worked into both boots. \"These boots are made extra comfortable and stable, without leaving the feet any way to breath. The material inside encourages sweating\", one of the two general announced before the other one presented the second regalia. It was a red pair of socks! At first Maria was a bit surprised, if not piqued about such an ordinary gift, but then she heard the description. \"These socks are made of a special material, which is capable of absorbing an extremely high amount of liquid, preferably sweat. Different to ordinary cotton socks or nylons, they don't tighten, when becoming wet. Instead they expand. This way they are still easy to remove quickly, even when they are completely wet. Also, to effectively gag someone with a big mouth you need two or three ordinary socks. This type of sock however, when sweatsoaked, can easily gag even wide mouthed people more than sufficiently!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", Maria now thought to herself. \"So far, everything I got is highly practical. I like that. These boots and socks even make an awesome combination!\" Next, the third and last one of the regalia was presented. This time it was not as practical, but beautiful and worthy to be the official proof of her legitimacy. It was a huge pure gold ring. Symmetrical rubies in the shape of female soles were worked in all around. In each of the dark red \"sole-rubies\" you could find a tiny silver \"M\". Maria had no clue what kind of master was able to craft such a beautiful and precious thing, but it didn't matter. Once all the regalia had been presented, another wave of applause filled the damaged arena. Once it died away, the general who'd been speaking first began to speak for a last time. \"Commander Maria. I am pretty sure there is some things you want to say now. It's the time now.\" With these words, she and the other generals quit the field, or better said, the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria proceeded to the lectern immediately and breathed in deep. For a second, Maria's eyes caught Vanessa and Lara sitting next to each other in one if the closest galleries..then she started speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fellow ladies of Stenchlandia. I am honored to speak to you as commander and head of the SSS for the first time. Let me tell you..I am not a politician. I am neither used to holding long speeches in front of huge crowds, nor do I like it. I prefer to leave this to treacherous villains, like the Equmrians!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScattered nods of assent and approving murmurs in the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am what Amber and every SSS-commander before me was as well. An elite soldier, a fighter for the good of Stenchlandia. I can't promise, that we will never go through tough times again, I can't promise that our road to glory will be straight and flat, there might be rocky passages but if so, we will cross them. Since I don't like talking all to much, I will make it short and clear and come to the things I can promise you. I promise that everything I vowed before will be done in the best way I can. I will do my best to make Stenchlandia triumph over any kind of enemy! I will build up again what the war has destroyed so far and make it better! And most important of all: I will make sure that no one who suffered or died for Stenchlandia has done so in vain. Not today, and not tomorrow..but soon enough we will be ready to march towards Equmria, take what is our and take revenge. I will end this war, and we will win! The only thing I demand is your courage, to go this way with me. Your loyalty to stay with me, even if it gets rocky. And your unswerving belief in the Stenchlandian idea. Can you do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some seconds the audience needed to leave their tension and realize that this was the end of her speech, each and everyone got up in their galleries and cheered. The shouts and screams were so loud, that Maria feared the whole construction could collapse. After the crowd had calmed down again, Maria addressed them once again..  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"To end this ceremony I am going to proof to every woman here, that all men are good for is reproduction and foot slavery.\" After saying these words, a flap inside the stage opened and another platform was accelerated onto the stage. On it lay a completely naked man forced into a straight jacket, with duct tape tying his hands, knees, feet, also placed firmly over his mouth. \"This is the general of the male Equmrian forces we managed to capture. Now watch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria walked over to the helpless and embarrassed man, who looked into her eyes terrified. He didn't have the courage anymore to put up any resistance. Making sure that no one saw, Maria found the hidden cannula inside his right armpit and jammed it into his vein. Within seconds, his terrified eyes started to roll like in a trance and his constricted muscles relaxed. Maria slipped out of her boots immediately and held the sweaty toes of her left foot right over the man's nostrils. Maria saw them flaring once, twice, then...<b>OUUUUUH!</b> A surprised roar went through the entire arena. Maria smiled, knowing that her plan had worked. The man smelling her foot, supposed to suffer and scream into his gag, had a raging boner, perfectly visible for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria didn't waste any more time. She brought her right foot down to the bound man's crotch and tried to grab his penis in between her big and second toe. She needed two or three attempts due to the usual, extremely sweaty state of her feet but then finally, she got it. With the toes of her left foot still over the man's pumping nostrils, she used her right foot to give the trapped penis a single short but hard jerk before drawing her feet back and stepping aside quickly. Another, even louder scream (a mixture of surprise, disbelief and utter disgust) could be heard throughout the galleries.. In the same second the supposedly tortured victim passed out from Maria's stench, he was cumming all over the place in a fountain! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the man was now ramped down and off the stage again, Maria turned towards the audience again, a grim smile on her face. \"Ladies! As you could see, men are foot slaves, if they want it or not! If you still don't believe it, look at this!\" She pointed towards the puddles of cum, the last witnesses of the former presence of a male. Of course they couldn't know that Maria had filled him up with tons of fast-acting aphrodisiacs and potency-enhancing drugs as well as tranquilizers. Was this a lie? Had she herself, as much as she hated treason, betrayed her fellow Stenchlandian women? <i>\"No\"</i>, Maria decided. <i>\"I have sworn to do everything I can to lead Stenchlandia to glory, and giving our women their sense of superiority back is only step one. In other words: This was my first little trick to help Stenchlandia and to seal the Equmrian's fate!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even nature supports the Stenchlandian idea! Women of Stenchlandia. No matter if citizen, soldier or agent. Use your feet, they are your weapons but also the proofs of your legitimate rule over men, here in Stenchlandia and everywhere! For Stenchlandia and the Stenchlandian idea!\" Being finally done, Maria left the stage under deafening cheers. As expected she now was confronted with dozens of congratulants. Maria was pretty done and would have preferred to be left alone for a while, but this was business. She accepted all the congratulations, smiled, shook hands and raised the one or other shot glass. Sooner or later, she had lost her sense of time a bit because of the alcohol, Vanessa and Lara joined the others as well. That was the point when Maria told everyone except those two, to leave her alone for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody wanted to insist or maybe just no one dared. Being alone with Vanessa and Lara, Maria drank even more and had a great evening. The best one in a long time. The three even became a bit girlish, started to sing old Stenchlandian chart songs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another two hours however, Lara wanted to go to sleep and Vanessa still had to see her fosterlings in order to observe their progress. Suddenly, Maria remembered something else she wanted to do all day. Recently she had often thought about and old friend of hers, Gina. She had served in the police together with her and another girl called Betty for several months, before Maria had been recruited by the SSS. Half a year ago, Gina had written Maria a letter, that she was taking a position in special research laboratory of the SSS close to the capital and encouraged Maria to visit her for once. Unfortunately, several things started happening very fast and, if nothing else, resulted in the current situation. Therefore Maria had not been able to see her so far, but she wanted to go for it now. On the one hand because she wanted to see an old friend again, on the other hand because she knew that any technological advantage would be worth a mint in the war against Equmria. Maybe Gina could develop something similar to her boots and sock regalia, just that it would have to be ready to go into mass production.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria clothed herself in something warmer, then she walked towards her bodyguard's quarter. The first steps were difficult, but then she recovered. <i>\"Damn this alcohol! I really need to resist next time!\"</i> Actually she didn't need her bodyguards at all, not even in this half-drunk state, but she didn't want to go all the way to the central SSS-quarters (or what was left of them) alone. It was half an hour afoot, but she needed to go there in order to find the top secret list of research stations and other military bases. Her bodyguards got up immediately, dressed, and went with her without any back chat..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty-five minutes of walking, with rather sparse small talk, Maria suddenly noticed something highly suspicious. A dark shadow rushed towards her, directly from the front. Her bodyguards noticed as well, but some seconds later. Maria as well as her bodyguards brought her right leg forward and raised her fists. Combatpoise! The shadow would reach them soon. Three seconds, two, one..the shadow fell on his knees in front of Maria. It was a man, barely clothed and with fanatical traits. He looked up into Maria's eyes, kneeling in front of her and stammered incoherently. Her bodyguards already wanted to arrest him, but Maria held them back. \"No! Wait! I want to ask him first..what do you want?\" The man curled up at Maria's feet and started to hug her boots. \"May I...may I kiss your feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Maria was completely speechless. Then her eyes narrowed and she got leery. <i>\"What is this about? He can't be really wanting to kiss my feet?! Is this a trick to perform some kind of treason, of..assassination? Or is he just crazy? It sure looks like it. Either way, I've got my bodyguards right here and I am pretty strong myself..I am not exactly vulnerable at the moment. So..let's play a bit!\"</i> Maria turned to her two bodyguards. \"If he does anything suspicious, get hold of him immediately!\" Then she looked directly into the shaking man's face. \"You sure are a pathetic one, lying down there and hugging my boots. But since you've been asking for it so kindly, I just can't refuse!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these words started to remove one of her boots. Only one. <i>\"One should be enough..\"</i> Following her movements, the eyes of the man began to develop a golden shine for a second, which broke as soon as Maria held the warm, wet, sweaty and sticky ball of her foot one centimeter in front of his mouth. The sheer warmth of Maria's stinky foot hit him like a train and the cheesy and narcotic fumes crawled their way up his nostrils. He didn't even need to breath in for that. \"Now, do what you wanted to do..kiss!\", Maria chuckled. The man shuddered and slowly pressed his lips against the ball of her foot. It was so sweaty, that his lips just slid off, work undone. \"C'mon, you surely can do better. I mean you were begging me to let you..\", Maria kept on taunting the obviously confused guy. Hearing her ridicule, tears filled his eyes and he forced himself to kiss her foot two more times, then he couldn't stand it any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria however was prepared. As soon as the man got ready to push her foot away and escape, she pushed her leg forward and down with a lot of force. As she had expected, the man tilted backwards due to the sudden impulse and was now pinned down successfully. Although the only contact Maria had with him was through the ball of her foot, which pressed hard onto the man's mouth, he didn't seem to be strong enough to put up serious resistance. At first he just lay there like numbed, but then after a few sniffs he started to moan into the ball of Maria's foot. \"Hmmmmmpppff! Hmmmmmpppff!\" By now, Maria was laughing loudly. She kept him pinned to the ground easily like that, although he tried desperately to push her foot away with his free hands while his legs just jerked uncontrollably. His struggles became more and more desperate and therefore he pumped in her cheesy foot air deeper and deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria enjoyed the cool breeze between her long, slender, hot, sweaty toes and began to wiggle them wildly over the poor man's nose. His moans of protest resounded shriller and shriller, he pumped in air deeper and deeper and his face skin began to develop a greenish note. Finally, after a last deep sniff, the man's eyes crossed and closed. He was out. With a sigh of deep relief, Maria drew back her foot and slipped back in her boot. Her bodyguards had silently watched the scenery without a single comment but now they were looking at Maria with a quizzical face. \"Bring him into my quarters, strip him and make sure he is well fixed and gagged. I am going to have a lot of fun with this guy! Maybe I'll pass him around, so that my friends can enjoy this wimp a bit as well. It's only five minutes to the central quarters, I can do that alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer guards saluted and did exactly what Maria had ordered. She herself enjoyed a deep breath of fresh night air and headed off in the opposite direction.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmmm, no... No, that's not quite it...\" A silent, soft voice rang through the halls of the secret, underground SSS research facility, only accompanied by the soft beeping and buzzing of some machinery here and there and the ever-present struggling and moaning of test subjects who still had too much fight in them. Too much fight for the researcher's taste, either way. Gina ran her fingers through the tumbled, slightly unkempt hair that stood off from her head in various angles. It hadn't been this way when she began her work in the morning, however, working through 12 hours straight and sometimes even longer could definitely sometimes take her toll on the scientist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to reinforce this material in a way that <i>keeps</i> the moisture in, aiding in the building up of natural footsmell while still being comfortable and hardy enough to serve as practical footwear...\" Gina murmured, mostly to herself, as she ran her hands over several blueprints and some fabric samples lying around over a table. Growing tired of that, she turned around and faced one of the test subjects. Her mouth curled into a tiny, hard smile just from that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina worked directly under the SSS, in a branch dedicated to perfecting the already potent power of Stenchlandian women's feet as much as possible. Because of that, she was readily supplied with test subjects all the time. Said subjects were sometimes criminals, traitors, freethinkers... or simply males. It didn't matter very much to Gina, as long as she had something to suffer beneath a sweaty pair of female feet - most preferably her own! - she was satisfied. Her current goal was to create a material for shoes or boots that enhanced the natural footsmell while being even nicer to the touch than general fabrics, something which Gina was fond of reminding herself over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooo... How are we feeling, subject 17?\" Gina said with a growing smirk as she reached a restrained young man, held tightly by metal bindings on all his limbs, lying on a table. Taped over most of his face was a sock - one which Gina had worn herself for several hours while testing out the new fabric - and even getting close to him was enough to make Gina wrinkle her nose. \"Ohhh, I can smell that from over here! Hee hee, did my feet really produce that smell?\" She snickered in mock surprise as she watched the man mutter something unintelligible weakly, straining his hands with little effort. <i>It's certainly affecting him, only... He should be out cold by now!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark shadow flared over Gina's face. She hated it when things weren't going her way! \"Ohh, you must be so tired smelling my nasty socks! How about I take this load off of your shoulders, so to speak?\" Gina spoke, holding her composure as well as possible as she ripped the material as well as the tape keeping it from the man's face. For an instant, she saw pure anger flashing on his face, then... Something like gratitude? \"Please... can I go now? I will... I will forever be a good slave now, I promise!\" The man whimpered weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina squint her eyes and re-adjusted her slim, frame-less glasses that rested on her nose. Oh, that one was about to leave, alright! \"Why, certainly. On behalf of the SSS, I like to thank you for the good cooperation you showed us! Clearly, having my socks plastered over your face is not a pleasant task to be faced with, I should know! There is just one little thing...\" Gina bit her lower lip and a slight blush crossed her face. She always loved this part. \"Huh... What... What do you mean?\" The man muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you are not allowed to know the location of this facility, you will have to be unconscious when you leave! Please, just relax while I make sure you are out nice and cold...\" Gina said, beginning to climb onto the man right on top of the table. \"Ahhh! Can't you just, like... blindfold me? What are you... No! Oh please, no more!\" The man began to panic as Gina raised her feet to his face and slowly brought her hands to the shoes still covering them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were smart-looking, slim dark brown shoes with a slightly raised heel and partly open on the upper side. Behind them, the dark fabric of Gina's nylons could be seen sparkling weakly in the dim lights. As Gina began to slowly tug and pull on her shoe, the man beneath her started a last ditch effort. \"No! Please no, no more smelly foot stuff! I told you... I will do everything you want! Just... please-\" \"Good, good...\" Gina cooed \"Because I want you to <b>suffer</b>!\" With that, she ripped her shoe off, sticking her nylon-clad foot directly into the helplessly bound man without losing time! Instantly, Gina herself felt the heat of her foot as the air around it felt impossibly soothing and cool... and the very next instant, she received a proof of their potent aroma, as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man bucked and squirmed with all his might as he drew in the first breath through his nose, the sweaty, hot nylon surface of Gina's foot firmly rubbing over his nose and thus exposing him to the full strength of her powerful foot aroma! Gina giggled lightly as she beheld the signs of pure agony on his face, pinching his nose with her long, flexible toes. <i>The socks might have only weakened him, sadly... But that is nothing compared to the real thing, no?</i> Gina said as her face lit up. \"Ohh, my dear boy, don't you be so... greedy!\" She scolded playfully, pressing his mouth shut and clenching his nose as the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man tugged and wrestled against his bonds, fighting for dear life as his face slowly turned a purplish shade. \"Do you want to smell my feet so bad? Very well...\" Gina said with a smile as she cupped her toes over her victim's nose loosely, listening to the strained, painful sound of him inhaling deeply not a second later. \"Hmmmpffff... HmmmppPPGGHH!\" he tried to scream out his suffering, but Gina's sole wouldn't budge from his lips. By now, even Gina herself was getting a little sick of the strong, sharp aroma of sweat her feet spread throughout the room. <i>It shouldn't be long, now...</i> And truly, after the very next smell, the man tried one final, strained groan before going limp for good. Gina gave a satisfied smile as she climbed off him again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty! Another one is ready for removal! Bring him back to the checkpoint, I don't remember where we picked that one up!\" Gina exclaimed loudly. A few seconds after, a slightly taller, black haired woman showed up. Coughing into her palm a few times, the newcomer managed to say \"Whoa, girl... I know I'm not one to complain, but it <b>reeks </b>in here...\" \"Hehe... And there I thought you of all people should be accustomed to my feet's aroma?\" Gina said teasingly, raising one still-clad foot and tapping it with her index finger. \"Yes... But even with that...\" Betty complained, even though she was already beginning to unbind Test Subject 17. She was nothing if not dutiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haaahhh...\" Gina yawned \"I suppose working on these here feet for an entire day gets them extra potent, even for my standards. Oh well.\" Gina looked at Betty again, an easy smile on her face. The both of them shared a similar past, having known each other for a very long time; they had worked as basic police officers, carrying out traffic controls and the like for a time, until Gina's superior intellect and spirit - as well as her sadistic, cruel tendencies - got her into a place directly beneath the SSS's command. Shortly after that, Gina had managed to get Betty in as well. Gina had made exceptional progress in her experiments from the start and receiving a certain person as her personal colleague hadn't been that much to ask... Of course, this had been more than alright for Betty as well. Much easier work, for better pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's already getting late...\" Gina observed, glancing over her watch. Here, in the underground labs, it was much harder to tell the time of the day as no sunlight at all made it's way in. \"Did you made any progress on the new project?\" Betty asked, having stripped the subject from his table and throwing him over her shoulder. \"Yes, however... it's just not enough, by now. The result is simply too weak. My bosses are expecting results, of course, so I have to hurry now... Although... I think I might call it a night, by now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Gina said this however, she heard the loud opening of a door, followed by a series of loud footsteps. <i>Who could that be? Not many people know of the location of these labs...</i> Gina thought, but as the person in question came into view, she couldn't help but flash a smile. \"Maria! I told you you could visit me any time, now you are finally here, haha!\" Gina said, walking over to Maria who smiled at her warmly. Nevertheless, she also gave her a sharp salute. \"As the current head of the SSS, I greet you, brave scientist!\" Even with Maria's serious expression, it was obvious to Gina that she was fooling around. \"Ahhhh... That was today, wasn't it? <b>That</b>, that?\" Gina suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll seriousness faded from Maria's face as she laughed heartily. \"Bwahahahaha, ohh, it's so good I'm not the only one who almost forgot it!\" \"Oh... Oh, I would never forget it, I was just... Kept busy all day with my research, really...\" Gina said a tad gingerly, rubbing her fingers together. Maria grinned at her, giving her a slightly too powerful slap on the back. \"That's what I like to hear! Always hard at work, you've always been a bright one, either way. To be perfectly honest with you... I know just how big an honor this is for me and the entire SSS and whatnot... But such ceremonies have just never really been my thing, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, both women looked at each other silently, then they almost simultaneously broke into laughter. \"Hahaha, you haven't changed at all, Maria!\" Gina said, wiping her eye with one finger. \"Yeah... Heh, it is good to see you again. Although... Part of why I'm visiting you is also because of one important thing.\" Maria's face became more serious once more. \"We will face the Equmrians soon, once more. We will have to take any advantage we can. How does your research go?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gina wasn't surprised that Maria asked about her project. In fact she had known for quite a while that finally someone would come and ask her about the progress, but due to all the recent events she had secretly hoped to get some more time. \"Hmm\", was all she said until she had found the right words. \"It's fine, it goes on. But unfortunately a lot slower than we actually expected. We've had to deal with some unforeseen problems..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of problems?\", Maria interrupted her. Her face was showing different emotions: concern, curiosity, stress, distant traces of fear and anger. But at the same time she was able to emanate a self-confidence and calmness, that made it impossible for Gina to feel herself put under pressure. \"Well at the beginning we made great progress and everything went well. We were able to eliminate many possible types of footwear, because their desired effects were too small. After some weeks however, many of our test subjects began to develop a strange psychological disorder, some kind of stress syndrome causing them to break out in screaming, crying or even passing out just by seeing our feet. That obviously makes it impossible to perform appropriate studies, since we wont to optimize the stink-level of shoes, socks and feet to be used against healthy targets. Not some completely stressed out human wrecks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had to admit that this was right, so she nodded. \"True, but why didn't you just get some new ones?\" Gina gave Maria an offended glance and rolled her eyes. \"Goodness Maria! You should know me well enough to know that I am not an amateur. Of course we thought about that right away, but just before we were able to order new subjects the Equmrians attacked the city. From that point on the SSS had better things to do than to provide us with new subjects, I'm sure you know that. There was a point on which everything was at stake since it wasn't clear who would win the battle. According to the SSS order 22 regarding all secret military and secret research institutions we prepared ourselves to annihilate and evacuate this facility. No wonder that we were not able to work during this period of red alert. Luckily we won and some days ago I was able to catch new test objects myself. I found them out there on the streets..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Maria realized for the first time that this war, this battle of Stenchlandia, had not only affected herself and the persons around her. It had affected absolutely everyone and everything! She would have to inspect a lot more important institutions, like the ones being responsible for the supplies, to see if they were working properly. At least she would have to send someone trustworthy to do the inspecting for her. But that was something to do later. \"Okay I see. Being honest I have to say that I don't like to hear that. I was hoping that things were ready to go, so to say, but I reckon that no one here has had an easy time. Now it's my job to deal with the situation and to make the best out of it. What is it, that you need to get your job done as soon as possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely some more subjects for the tests..hmmm..and a bit more time I guess\", Gina answered in relief. Knowing how impatient Maria had been back in the day, she had feared some kind of eruption or at least plenty of accusations but instead Maria stayed calm. <i>Time changes everyone. This new Maria is still as ambitious as the old one, but a lot smarter and more mature. She certainly grows together with her tasks.</i> Maria smiled and pattered Gina's shoulder. \"You shall have both. There are plenty of new prisoners only waiting for some treatment. I'll make sure that you'll get a load by tomorrow. And for the time..take as much as you need. The outcome of our mission depends to a huge extend on your success. But keep in mind that we can't wait forever. Soon enough the Equmrians will know that their army failed to beat us and as soon as their small and wimpy hearts recover from the shock, they will prepare their defense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Gina's turn to nod. \"I know, I know dear friend. I promise that I'll do my best..maybe, yes maybe tomorrow everything will seem easier.\" Maria laughed. \"Haha, yes that's some good optimism! Just how I like it, Stenchlandians never give up and this will be your road to become a national heroine yourself. But now I fear I'll have to go. Business never stops calling when you are the leader. It was really great to see you again, Gina. I'll certainly visit you more often from now on.\" With these words and after hugging Gina one last time, Maria turned around and left the underground facility the same way that she entered. </span></div></div>",

As usual she tried to handle everything as nice as possible but after three hours and with a terrible headache she had to end it for the day because else she felt she would lose it. When Maria was about to enter her private chambers she met Vanessa who offered her to go drink or eat something, but Maria declined. She was too exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she thought about going to bed directly, but then she decided that she wanted to have her feet massaged. Usually foot rubs were nothing Maria was longing for. She considered it something too girly. Dominating a man or a treacherous woman was business and duty, and quite fun as well, but still..having them rub your feet was an unnecessary luxury. Today however, she felt like she wanted to try it out - and why not? Maria called some SSS agents and ordered them to bring her a slave for the night, with free hands. Only minutes later they came back, carrying a wooden rack, similar to a gymnastics horse. Strapped on it was an almost naked man (he only had some underwear on). His legs, upper body and head were fixed so well, that he could barely move at all, his arms were still free. \"Is that how you wanted?\", one of the agents asked Maria. \"Yes it's perfect, thanks. You can go.\" When the two agents left her room, Maria locked the door to really be undisturbed. Then she went to one of her chests and pulled out an electroshock staff. Not that she considered this bound wimp of a man a threat. Even without any bonds and together with three other guys of his kind Maria was pretty sure that she would take them out all alone. But still, safety was always first, especially when you are in such a high and important position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving everything set up like she wanted, Maria approached her helpless prey. She could see him shake under his bonds, which made her grin. When she finally stood right in front of him, she bowed down and stared directly into his scared eyes. Then she took two fingers of her right hand and stroked the tape over the man's mouth. \"Well, well, well.. So you are my little companion for tonight. Do you know that you have been gifted with an extraordinary honor? You'll be my foot rubber! Such an honor and you don't even introduce yourself? What is your name?\" The man obviously couldn't speak due to the tape over his mouth, so he remained quiet until Maria asked the same question again, with a more dangerous tone in her voice this time. \"Hmmpph Hmmpph Hmph..\", was all the man could answer which caused Maria to burst out in a short laughter. \"Oh, what an interesting name, Mr. Hmph\", she chuckled. \"Let's not waste any more time, I want my feet rubbed. By the way you are lucky. My feet are actually clean today..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually her feet weren't really clean, they were still pretty unpleasant and smelly judged by common sense, but in comparison to the usual level of Maria's feet, they were not strong. This was because today she had showered in the morning and not in the evening like she usually did and after that she hadn't been doing anything overly exhausting..at least not in the physical way. Also, which was very unusual for Maria, she had been wearing a new pair of thick cotton socks which didn't collect stink so well (normally she wore her boots barefoot or with some old combat nylons). A mistake she would not redo. Finally Maria took both her boots and the socks off, then she stretched her big and beautiful feet, wiggling her long toes and making her slave face the slender soles. \"C'mon, get your hands to work. I let them free so use them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot daring to ignore her orders the imprisoned man started rubbing Maria's soles with his hands, but he really behaved stupidly. Soon enough Maria just boiled over. \"Seriously?! What are you doing? My feet are supposed to feel better, but they don't. One should think that an easy task like rubbing someones feet shouldn't be too much for anyone, but then again, what are you to expect from men?! I'll do it myself, but I'll use you for it. This way you don't have to do anything but to be here. Oh well, and additionally you can also wash my socks for me!\" Saying all this Maria took her electric staff and gave the man a big load into his side. He squeaked into his gag and then went limp for some seconds. This was the time Maria used to fix his arms as well with some strong tape she found in one of her chests. Then she removed the tape over his mouth, stuffed her warm socks in deep before the man could say anything and then renewed the tape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the desperate moaning of her slave, Maria used his face and nose to massage the soles of her feet. She especially rubbed her heel, the balls of her feet and her toes against his nose and enjoyed the feeling. The combination of softness and hardness that formed the nose felt good and the regular cool airflow was quite enjoyable too. Sighing deeply in relief, Maria kept going for at least one hour and due to the fact that her feet were not as bad as usual, the man didn't pass out and had to endure the smell all the time. After some time, Maria got really tired and decided to go to bed. With a mean grin towards the slave she brought the wooden rack in position in front of her bed, made herself comfortable and then taped her feet right under the mans helpless nose. \"There we go\", she chuckled. \"This way you can experience your honor throughout the whole night, while I get some well-deserved sleep.\" Still smiling about her own joke, Maria closed her eyes and fell asleep..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Come on now, baby... Think, think, think!\" Gina chanted to herself as she stood over her desk in the lab with her back bent. \"Hmmm... Ahhh!\" Gina made loudly and smacked her lips as she took a sip of incredibly strong coffee. She always figured if just normally thinking about something didn't get her the desired results, it was time for more caffeine! More coffee in general was always very good and if there was one thing unrelated to the SSS that Gina had learned while in their labs, it had to be that there was simply <b><i>no such thing as too much coffee</i></b>! Because of that, the little coffee machine next to her was almost constantly running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina wiped over her forehead and paced back and forth a little bit. She remembered Maria telling her she could take as much time as she needed with this research, but at the very same time, she had also insisted that time was of the essence. In other words; Gina had to make sure that her results were nothing short of perfect while still not taking too much time to achieve. Also, she would never have dared to fail either one of her superiors in general, nor Maria personally; and for various reasons. Maria was almost something like an old friend to her, but Maria was also known to have a thin patience, especially after she already gave someone something like a second chance. \"She won't tell me to take my time again, should I not deliver her what the SSS desires... No, she'll let me speak to her feet face-to-face and even then I'd have to be really lucky if I remained in this position afterwards... I <b><i>must not</i></b> fail!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina was getting truly fired up now, both on caffeine as well as on her renewed determination. \"Let's think this over, again...\" Gina found that sometimes, talking to yourself could really help you focus. Or at the very least, take some of the pressure off of you, somehow. At the very least, there was nobody around right now who could complain about her speaking to herself in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I need to think outside of the box... Yes...\" Gina grabbed a few sheets of paper and a pen - one that had already been badly mutilated by her nervously chewing teeth - and began to scribble on it as she went on. \"...the material we use has already been optimised for our purposes, even before I began working here. I might be good at what I do, but it might be arrogant to think I could improve the past work of our scientists and engineers in a way that truly made a noticeable difference... That is, of course, on a field they have already worked on themselves... However!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first page was already full of angry, frantic scribble. Gina grabbed another one. \"What if they overlooked something... As I've said, the SSS has already worked hard to find the perfect material for their socks and nylons; the one in use right now... However...\" Gina grabbed a piece of cut-out SSS-grade nylon and one of the \"pre-war\" kind. \"...while the material here is different, both of it is woven in almost exactly the same way. It's just a really tiny net... Hmmm...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina thought back on an old advertisement she once saw, some years before the revolution happened. It was about some kind of shoe that was supposed to allow air from the inside to come out, while preventing water from the outside coming in. Gina figured that the same principle could possibly be applied to her current problem; but in a rather reverse way: Air would still be required to be allowed exit of the fabric, but the sweat from the <i>inside</i> shouldn't be allowed to be lost. Gina remembered having seen videos of women sticking their feet into plastic bags or such... The production of sweat on the inside had always been insane; but of course, it only ever smelled when the bag came off. With her new idea, perhaps she could secure that incredible sweat production for an unlimited time while also allowing for maximum distribution of stench! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Let's do this!\" Preparing herself yet another cup of coffee, Gina ran to one of the machines in the lab and began hitting a few keys on its control panel. It was for precisely designing and calibrating the nano-structure of the material used for the SSS-grade nylon stockings. After that, Gina worked several hours on creating the perfect structure and actually having the machines craft a pair of those nylons just for herself. Gina liked to be the test subject, as long as she was still the one conducting the tests and there were still other persons on the actual receiving end... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Gina was now very well about to let one grand test happen, and not just to herself! With a pair of untested, prototype nylons ready for herself, Gina did not hesitate for a moment before putting them on her feet. Thankfully for herself, Gina's feet had already gone a bit sweaty from being stuck in shoes while she was working feverishly, however their current state right now was nothing compared to what an SSS Agent would need to produce in combat. Still, it was a good start. Leaving her lab for a bit with her new nylons on, Gina decided to kill two birds with one stone and take a sort of break from the usual labwork: She was not planning to sit around idly, but rather to go outside to have a quick run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina strolled to her office; as head scientist she was allowed a lot of space and she kept several personal things with them as well; one of them being a relatively old pair of running shoes. Gina had always found it to be a great change of pace when she could slip out from the stressful, efficiency-oriented environment of her labwork and just go out on the streets, to let her mind wander freely while the only thing that had to work was her body itself. Because of that, those shoes had seen many, many hours of hugging Gina's pretty feet tightly, and they looked and even smelled the like. Despite having been locked away and not being used for some time now, Gina could still smell the faint hint of sweat and cheesy feet, simply from taking them into her hands. Gina could only grin as she pictured what wonders these would do in combination with those prototype nylons...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having equipped those as well, Gina finally went outside and squinted as she looked at the sky. She had begun to work in the morning, and it was well after noon now; the sun standing high and the temperatures likewise. Gina didn't mind though and started her little workout right away. A couple of SSS guards who were posted on the area surrounding the laboratories glanced at her idly as Gina ran past them, but didn't pay her all that much mind. Simply running around for a bit to get oneself in an even sweatier state wasn't all that uncommon and even if it had been, Gina did have several privileges in her position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe run went amazingly, better than Gina would have first pictured it. With all that caffeine still surging through her veins, Gina just kept going and going until her legs almost went numb, she could occasionally feel the sweat stinging in her eyes but she paid it little mind. When she finally came to a stop some time later, Gina was a little surprised to see that a bit over an hour had passed since she had begun her little experiment. \"Whoa... Didn't know I even had this much constitution left...\" Gina murmured as she went straight back into her laboratories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her senses calmed back down, Gina became more and more aware of the state she was now being in; namely, just how sweaty and heated she had gotten! In the dry, much cooler air of the underground labs, Gina could occasionally see small tendrils of steam rising from her now damp, warm clothes... Gina licked her lips in anticipation as she imagined just how wonderful of a spectacle it would be once she unleashed all that power that was now sure to sleep within her shoes!<br>\r\nShe could already feel it on her feet... They felt so hot as if they were on fire and as if they were swimming in their own juice, which would be exactly what was supposed to happen with those nylons anyway. But no matter how it felt already, there was only one way to really know, of course...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina chuckled darkly as she walked into a larger room, in which she often carried out some of her tests. Preparing a small table in the middle of it swiftly, Gina got ready to fetch one of the test subjects as the last step of preparation. Since safety for the SSS researches was of course an important asset to their entire operation, the test subjects were kept pretty much like prisoners, behind a secure barrier in a sort of glass cube, from which the researcher had various ways of sedating them; be it through a short wave of pure S.T.I.N.K. gas or other means. After gassing one of the subjects unconscious - Gina just picked the first one to which she came, she wasn't all that picky - she waited a moment for the worst of it to dissipate, quickly put on one of the lab's safety gas masks and went in to carry the man out and onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dropped him down and quickly stretched her back - carrying humans usually was a bit harder than it looked - Gina turned her head as she heard the soft, but distinct clacking of someone's footsteps drawing closer. And sure enough, Betty soon turned around a corner and waved at her. \"Hard at work, huh?\" she said as she flashed a bright smile. Gina smiled back and nodded, before remembering that she was still wearing the mask. \"Yes...\" she spoke as the ripped it off \"...it's quite alright however, since it appears I am finally making the progress I have been to direly hunting for the past days...\" \"Ah! Is that so? Well, to tell the truth, I'm taking a break from my own work right now...\" Betty admitted, with a sly smirk \"...mind if I stick by and have a look?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not at all. I warn you though... If my new results are as potent as I expect them to be... Well, I just advice you keep your distance.\" Gina warned. Betty cocked an eyebrow. \"This is still just about increasing the smell of feet, right? Nothing I couldn't handle, then. Show me what you got!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gina grinned as she readied herself to unleash hell upon the entire room. \"Very well... Time to show both you and subject number, ah... 27 here the 'fruits' of my labour, so to speak, ahaha...\" she chuckled as she finished to fasten the straps that held the test subject to the table. \"Oh, while we're at it, be a dear and fetch me some of that standard-issue duct tape, would you kindly?\" Gina requested and Betty jumped up with a giggle. \"Hehe, hey you're the boss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina took the tape and swiftly sealed the mouth of the man on the table shut. Sure, it might not have been as fancy as using some old sock to do it, but Gina wanted to make sure that only the stench from her nylon-enhanced feet would take their effect on him right now... This was an important experiment, after all. Just as Gina had gotten ready and placed one of her still shoe-clad feet next to the man's head, the effect of the gas wore off from him and he blinked his eyes as he slowly regained consciousness. \"Oh, hello there, my dear!\" Gina said eagerly as she took note of that. There was little reason to see if she could knock out an already unconscious man, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too used to being awake right now, my friend, I have something very nice to show you now...\" Gina almost whispered and she felt her pulse rising as she reached for her shoes with her hand. This moment never failed to excite her; the image of fear and sheer terror in her victim's eyes as they first had no idea where they had woken up at all but then slowly, the terrible truth caught of with them once more. Gina grabbed one of her shoes tightly and grinned. \"This should be good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swift, fluid movement, Gina pulled it off and held her incredibly heated, nylon-clad foot right in front of the helplessly bound man's face! The look of pure panic in his face was something to behold on itself as he was faced with one of the most dreadful feet he would probably ever have the displeasure of having this close to his face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man could very clearly see that those strange nylons that were on the scientist's foot had trapped an almost unreal amount of moisture and foot sweat behind them, sticking it closely to her shapely sole... Almost as bad as that wet display of gross foot sweat was the brutal, immense heat that was emitted from that foot! Not only did it hit the man in the face as hard as opening an oven after it had been running for 20 minutes or so, but he could also see that foot visibly steaming in the cool air around it... Polluting the entire room with nothing but pure, unfiltered foot stench! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the very worst thing came. The man just realised that his lips had been sealed. Of course, the last thing he wanted to do when presented with such an overwhelmingly scary foot was to actually smell it... But he had to breath right here and there and with no other way to do it, he took a deep breath through his nose! \"*Sniiiiff* Hngh... HnnnMMMgfff!\" An explosion of pure foot aroma flashed through his senses, so sudden and powerful that it felt like somebody had punched him for the fracture of a second and he couldn't fight the urge to cough and lost all the air left in his lungs already... Which was very bad, because it would only mean that he now had to breathe even deeper...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... Oh- *cough cough* this is just...\" Even Gina herself was more than amazed by how these nylons had affected her feet! Now only were they literally wet with sweat right now, much more extreme than they had even been in her life, but the stench was also much, much more intensive than anything she had ever smelled coming from her own feet. Gina knew that some people, like Maria of course, had always been capable to create these olfactory crimes against human senses... But to smell it from her own feet? It was a shock if nothing else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt smelled like a hulking inferno of strong, thick cheese smell, spiced with salty, stingy fragrances of salty sweat and a few sour, bitter and even slightly sweetish notes here and there. It packed such a punch that even from smelling it from some distance away, it seemed as if the human mind couldn't really make out all the horrible aromas found in this deadly brew of footsweat from just one sniff. Gina could even feel her eyes getting a bit stingy and teary, but of course, it was even worse for the other people in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty, who had at first stared at the spectacle with great interest, even leaning in closer a little bit, had flinched back noticeably as the first wave of thick, cheesy footsmell had come wafting right over herself. \"Oh god, is that... Urgh! *Cough* *Gag* This... Are those really your feet?\" Betty spat in disbelief, first waving one hand in front of her face, but then actually taking a step back from the table and turning her head away, as the heady foot aroma from Gina's sweat-stained stench monsters was simply so pungent and unrelenting that she couldn't breath from this distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, it was by far the worst for the man who lay helplessly bound and with taped lips, right beneath those incredible stinkers! Even though he had stared with big eyes at those feet at first - by now, Gina had also taken off her second shoe -, he was now forced to close them shut as not only did they begin to stream tears uncontrollably, but they also came closer! The crazy scientist began to cackle like a maniac as she finally pressed her foot down on his face... And despite how surprisingly soft it felt, the man could not help but try to jump in surprise as he felt her foot being as wet as a soaked-through towel... Not that his bindings had allowed for much jumping space... And it was then when he finally had to breathe in again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man groaned in horror as his empty lungs forced him to draw in a large amount of air, coming straight from the slippery, wet and still shockingly warm soles of that scientist lady... The stench that raced through his nose and lungs was so pure, so thick, that even though he was breathing in, he felt as if he was choking right now! The blast of wicked, cheesy and ripe foot smell was bad enough to leave him dizzy already, but Gina decided to go for the ultimate blow; shifting her foot around just slightly, she slipped the moist, slimy area between her toes right over the man's hapless nose area!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing fully well that he couldn't survive breathing in that foot again, especially not in-between the toes, the man clenched all his muscles and attempted to break free frantically, but it was to no avail. His bindings held him very well and did not budge and his final scream of rage, desperation and sheer terror came out as nothing more than a muffled moan. He had emptied all his resources, and before he could even send a final, swift prayer, the man's eyes fluttered open as he was forced to draw in a painfully long, cruel sniff right through Gina's deadly toes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe violent onslaught of cheesy, salty and sour foot smell was the most powerful thing he had ever experienced, even worse than just having to smell the sole of that foot, and it was more than enough to send his entire body into a state of uncontrollable shivering and slight shaking! Before he could finish another thought, the man breathed in once again and thankfully, that was now enough to really blow his lights out as everything slowly faded away to black in front of his eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... truly amazing!\" Gina uttered as she drew her feet back and looked into the knocked out face of the man beneath her. \"I've had some subjects smelling my feet for, what, twenty minutes or so... But this one took I believe three or four whiffs of my feet and there he is, sleeping like a rock... What do you think, Betty... Betty?\" Gina looked up in surprise and just saw Betty coming back to the table, now with one of the lab's gas masks on her face. Gina couldn't help but chuckle shortly. \"What was it you said... Just smelly feet, you could handle it, correct?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha-ha... I have to admit, I didn't expect... that.\" Betty admitted, shaking her head shortly. \"I mean, we both know how your feet can smell sometimes, but this... this was just unreal.\" \"Yes, and the best part about this entire thing... If you think just much this has improved the smell of one scientists feet... Think what it could do if applied to hundreds, no, thousands of our soldiers and agents!\" Gina was shaking with excitement as she said that and even Betty seemed awe-struck and at a loss for words for once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please help me bringing Subject 27 away... I think he has served as all very well... I will report to Maria personally as soon as I can... Oh, she will be so overjoyed!\" For a moment, Gina felt like a giddy schoolgirl again. All her long, hard work in the labs had finally paid off big time, for her. All that was left to see was just how her discovery would change the course for Stenchlandian conquest over not just the rest of the continent, but perhaps even the entire world!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria was sitting around relatively idle in her office, behind her massive oaken desk. Stacked before her were seemingly hundreds of papers, ready for her to sign. Maria had found out that being the Big Boss of something came with a lot of boring paperwork and she was already making plans to hand these kinds of task down to some subordinate, perhaps Lara...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she sighed and got ready to take the next stack in front of her, Maria began to hear some people arguing from outside of her office. \u201cLook, like I said, I don't care who you are, you cannot see our Leader unless you have an appointment!\u201d the shrill voice of Maria's new secretary rang out. \u201cGet out of my way, girl, I have crucial information, I tell you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria perked up; that had been Gina's voice. For her to come scurrying all the way to her personal office, she either better had really good or really bad news, Maria figured, slowly rising from her seat. \u201cI will call security now if you don't-\u201d The first voice from outside rang. Maria had to chuckle as she saw the handle of the office door suddenly being rattled. \u201cGosh darn it, what is with this bloody door?\u201d Gina cursed and Maria shook her head, walking up to the door. A key was needed to open this door from the outside, at all times; but Gina most likely only found out about that right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecurity! Securityyyyy!\u201d The shrill voice rang and Maria hurried up, walked to the door and pulled it open. Gina almost fell into her and quickly straightened herself up again. \u201cOh, there we are... *Ahem* I bring very good news!\u201d Gina said with sparkles in her eyes. \u201cCome on in...\u201d Maria said, waving her inside and nodding. Poking her head outside the door, she shot a sharp glare to her secretary. \u201cAnd you, be silent. This is one of our best scientists, you hear me? You ever make her wait again, I will use your face as a footrest for an entire week, you understand?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary looked shattered. \u201cI- But you said not to be... Yes, yes, understood!\u201d she quickly corrected herself and Maria scowled one last time before retreating back into her office. \u201cI have to say...\u201d She mumbled to Gina while scratching her chin and giggled shortly. \u201c...being the Leader is not all that bad. People are even more easily scared by me than before. But nevermind this...\u201d Maria shook her head, smiled and turned to Gina, who was now standing in front of her massive desk, running her finger along its smooth surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo! I hear you bring information, is that right?\u201d Maria said, clapping her hands together and staring at Gina with an almost hungry expression. \u201cThat's right! My latest experiments have shown results... The project has been an overwhelming success!\u201d Gina was shaking with excitement as she spoke; gesturing with her hands all the while. \u201cOh? I'm happy to hear that! So, what are the exact results?\u201d Maria inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the entire point was to find something to enhance the already powerful smell of Stenchlandian foot stink, right? With my research and knowledge in nanotechnology and our finely-tuned machines, I was able to design a new type of nylon fabric... It has so far been tested only by me and my assistant down in the labs, Betty, but... We tried them out with various test subjects and using our special method, well... we basically measure how much time passes until a subject gets put to sleep by our feet when directly exposed. *Ahem* Yes, using that, we found an overall increase in effectiveness by around 200 to 300 percent... To put it bluntly, our feet got so smelly that our prisoners got knocked out several times as swiftly as before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Maria exclaimed, balling a fist and raising it into the air. \u201cThat's precisely what I wanted to hear... Good job, Gina, I mean it!\u201d Gina was beaming from ear to ear. \u201cAnd... just one more thing... Is this new fabric... Will it be difficult to produce?\u201d \u201cOh no, not at all. We basically have all the technology to mass-produce it even now; I'll just need to teach a few good women how to re-design and calibrate our already running machines in the industry and I imagine we'll be able to equip an entire battalion with it, within the week, maybe even in a few days!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect! Absolutely perfect...\u201d Maria rubbed her hands together and walked around her desk, patting Gina on the shoulder. \u201c...there will be a worthy reward for this my friend, you can count on it... I will go talk to a few people right away. I trust you will be ready to pass on your knowledge within a few hours? I'll call for a special meeting, most of our important people are in the capital anyway, shouldn't take them too long to reach our headquarters.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Whatever you need me to do!\u201d Gina said eagerly, still beaming. Maria rubbed her hands together and walked away a few steps, looking out from a large window that was facing the skyline of the Stenchlandian capital. \u201cI intend to strike at Equmria with a relatively small force of soldiers... They should have almost no strength left themselves and I want to be as quick and with as little causalities to our side as possible. This new product of yours should be the last piece to the puzzle. I mean...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria turned around and shrugged lightly, while grinning at Gina. \u201c...most people would say we don't even need some sort of secret weapon and that we could already overpower the rest of our enemies with quite small a force... And I'd agree, hahaha. But... It can't hurt either, can it? Better safe than sorry. Yes, we will hold that meeting, the two of us will get all the needed preparations done and when everything is up and running without needing our directions...\u201d Maria walked up to Gina and gave her a little wink \u201c...then we can have a private chat about your reward. And don't worry... You've put me in a very generous mood today!\u201d <br>\r\nMaria then walked out of her office, a grinning Gina on her heels and already making plans on how she would get things rolling. Yes, now would be the time to call a certain few people... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later, Maria was back in her office with a certain somebody standing on the other side of the desk. Vanessa had a sort of sour expression on her face as she stood there, staring at Maria. Maria had made sure that Vanessa's old, random clothes which she had worn during most time of her rebellion had been removed and she had now been equipped with a uniform more suiting of a high-ranking SSS official. Maria had already made a big exception by allowing a traitor to enter such a position - and that only because of Vanessa's incredible skill - , she wouldn't have her run around like some peasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my dear, everything will be thoroughly explained in the meeting I have called for just now, but I think it can't harm to let a few special people know in advance...\u201d Maria began, looking at her fingernails briefly before shifting her gaze back to Vanessa. \u201cYou are aware that we are going to strike at what's left of Equmria very soon, right?\u201d Maria asked. <br>\r\nVanessa briefly glanced down and away and something like pain or shame seemed to flicker across her face for an instant. But just as quickly, her expression hardened again and she stared back at Maria with the cold, hard look of a true soldier. Assaulting a nation that had not too long been on her side didn't come easy to Vanessa, but reminding herself that the biggest and most foul of traitors was still there was all that she needed to cloud her mind with endless desire for vengeance. \u201cYes, yes I am aware of that.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cGood, because we will carry that attack out even sooner than we had first anticipated. Perhaps even this week.\u201d Maria said, allowing herself to smile as she saw Vanessa balling her fists, her hands slightly shaking. \u201cBecause of a new product of one of our very best scientists, we will now be able to strike with an even smaller group... There's no way we'd need a full army now anyway, but the more swiftly and efficiently we can strike, the better. In this mission, I plan to bring the best of the best of our people... And you know what that means.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa couldn't help but smirk for a moment, though she quickly hardened her face again. \u201cYou flatter me, Maria. But yes, I absolutely wish to take part in that mission. After all, there is a certain someone who has yet to pay the full price of betraying us...\u201d \u201cYes, yes, that as well.\u201d Maria said, waving her hand. \u201cMore importantly, there are several SSS officers who haven't really accepted you yet, what with the traitor factor and all, and don't you deny it!\u201d Vanessa scrunched up her face and frowned, but kept silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis mission will be the first step to full world domination, an important step and also not exactly easy or free of risk. Who knows what those stupid Equmrians will do when cornered? Maybe they'll set their entire capital on fire or something like that, but that's exactly why I don't want to send a lot of forces in there. If they do launch some sort of insane, last ditch suicide effort, it will at least only put a minor dent in our already far superior forces!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria took a breath and looked at her hands again. \u201cOf course, I won't simply leave commanding that small, elite force to anybody, so I'll do it myself. That way, people can't claim that I passed away the risk or responsibility to somebody else and also, let's be honest here, I'm simply the best there is anyway.\u201d Maria grinned and shrugged again. Vanessa almost had to chuckle at bit like that. Grand Leader or not, some things never changed with Maria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and having you play your role there as well will also be good for your reputation. Never mind the fact that you are also one of the best fighters I've ever seen and let me be honest with you; I wouldn't take the risk of bringing you if you weren't, in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cVery well... Thank you for this opportunity, Maria. I have just one request...\u201d Vanessa began. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen we've reached Lysander... You leave him to me.\u201d  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Very soon after her private talk with Vanessa, Maria actually held the meeting which she had called for earlier today. Several important officials from various different sectors were present, some lower ranked, but still relatively high classed women from the military and of course also some of Maria's close acquaintances, like Vanessa and Gina. Gina was swiftly assigned to get the mass-production of her new fabric up and running, her and a few others were then sent to her labs so she could share her techniques with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next point of business, and the far more exciting part as far as Maria was concerned, was a swift overview of the upcoming attack on Equmria. It was well-known that Equmria had basically lost almost her entire strength mere days ago so naturally, they were most ripe for the taking right now! Maria had devised a plan which would see having a few small teams being carried far ahead of a slightly bigger division in aircraft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose teams would be deployed onto a field lying next to a forest, east to the capital of Equmria, and all of that in the darkness of the night, preferably some time after midnight. After being dropped, those teams would move towards the city through the midst of the forest bordering it, so when they come out, they would be right at the gates! Maria didn't expect much resistance either way, but with this plan, they should also have the element of surprise of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext part would be the actual infiltration and capture of the city. Since it was \u2013 especially by Stenchlandian standards \u2013 not a really big city, Maria didn't expect much trouble. The teams would preferably seize the town hall or something like that, and get as much ground as possible under their control. At the meantime, the rest of the Stenchlandian attackers should be arriving from the west side of the city as well, so even if the Equmrians did manage some sort of counter-attack by any means, those troops would charge right into their backs and crush them beneath themselves and the earlier arrived elite teams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd afterwards, full domination of the capital. Maria expected the State of Equmria \u2013 already neither especially large or powerful \u2013 to surrender immediately after having her beating heart ripped out of her chest that viciously and violently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that basically concluded the most of Maria's plans. Most of the people surrounding her in the meeting room cheered loudly, standing up and clapping their hands ferociously after hearing them. \u201cStenchlandia forever! Victory is ours!\u201d \u201cWe will take over the world! The world!\u201d \u201cAll across the globe our rule shall be questioned by NONE!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThank you, my ladies, thank you, thank you...\u201d Maria said, smirking lightly and waving them down with one hand. \u201cNow, I believe we all have preparations to make, right?\u201d She concluded, clapping her hands together. \u201cYou are dismissed!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina's words proved to be true. Only a few days later, nylon footwear made out of her newly created material was being mass-produced, packaged and moved away to reach the military and SSS stations alike. Naturally, Maria and her most important women were to first to receive their personal pairs of specially crafted combat-grade nylons. Everything was up and ready by the time Maria had intended, which was most pleasing to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more days passed, and finally, just after midnight \u2013 again, like Maria had intended \u2013 the assault teams were ready. They were waiting as Maria herself marched passed them, Vanessa at her side and Lara following not far behind, and waltzed on to the first of the stationed helicopters which would bring them to their destination. What followed was a relatively quick and short flight; the Equmrian capital was not far from the border and those helicopters were pretty fast, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prepared teams dropped out just after the forest in mid-air and activated their parachutes to glide down gracefully and silently to the ground. The helicopters themselves were not quite as quiet, but Maria was sure that the forest inbetween them and the Equmrian capital would swallow all of the noise. Losing no time, Maria lead her teams charging into the forest and towards their target right away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for them to reach the town's outskirts. Unlike the Stenchlandian capital, the capital of Equmria was not surrounded by a large well or in any way built like a giant fortress. Maria's troops actually had very little trouble getting in there. By the time they got in, the first light of the dawning sun was visible on the horizon, but their surprise attack had been a success anyway; when the first alarm rang, Maria's troops had already been well into the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, things got a bit more hectic. Some defenders did come jumping out of their holes somewhere, somehow, and at times, the Stenchlandian attackers even found themselves slightly surrounded and outnumbered. Thankfully for them, the Equmrian defenders were relatively poorly trained and equipped and had a morale to compare to that, so no matter what they tried, Maria's troops just cut through their lines like nothing and in the end, most of the defending units actually fled before they even got into real combat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Maria's teams had charged through into the very heart of the city, a large square in front of the town hall. What she and Vanessa saw there surprised them a little bit, even then! It was Lysander \u2013 no doubt it was him \u2013 standing atop some makeshift barricades in front of the town hall and shouting orders to the defending units. <br>\r\nAmazingly, these units there did a much better job at fighting back and Maria's assault slowed down just a little. After a bit of strenuous work however, more and more of the defenders fell and as the Stenchlandians got closer and closer to the town hall and the barricades, Lysander finally lost the rest of his courage and willpower, broke, and bolted from his little stand and up into the building! </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright, Vanessa! You saw them too, right?\" Maria yelled as she dashed across the street with a speed that almost peeled the asphalt from the street. \"Yes! They went into that large building! After them, go go!\" Vanessa was running down the street with a speed only rivalled by that of Maria. Nobody else in their army could keep up with her if she really went all out, it has always been like that (only Felicia had ever managed to best Vanessa at that and her, well...); the rest of their women were trailing behind a little, doing a good deal of the fighting against the few remaining Equmrian rebels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe events at the Stenchlandian capital had not gone unnoticed even here, in Equmria. After the future \"plans\" of their leader, Lysander, had somehow gotten public - even though he would naturally have wanted to conceal them - and it became well known that the legendary Vanessa now belonged to the enemy\u2019s side, most of the active rebels had thrown their weapons down and escaped to places even farther away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot entirely all of them, however. Maria and Vanessa had gone into the Equmrian capital fully prepared, as always, bringing a large group of well-trained and disciplined SSS agents with them. Actually sending in the army would have been a bit excessive at this point and more importantly, it was the two girl's great wish to capture their last remaining enemies alive, and that was always easier with numbers a bit smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver the charismatic leader, Lysander had stood with his troops until almost the very end, commanding them directly in the middle of the battle while around them chaos reigned, but when Maria's team smashed through his people like a bulldozer over a dog's hut, even he panicked and turned tail. Neither Maria nor Vanessa really knew what their second target - the boy named Joe - really looked like, but somehow, they knew they'd find him as soon as they get their hands on Lysander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria and Vanessa had reached the building now and behind them, some of the remaining enemies still came closer. \"Keep those rats back, brave comrades of Stenchlandia!\" Maria yelled with her commanding voice, her own troops were not far from the remaining enemy ones. \"Leave their coward of a leader to us!\" Maria turned to Vanessa, mid-sprint \"It ends now, my friend!\" she breathed more quietly before she kicked the door open and bolted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them saw someone running up a flight of stairs and dashed right behind that person. It could have only been Lysander! As Maria reached the top, some guy jumped in front of her. \"Run, Boss! I'll keep them at bay- arrrggh!\" he yelled, but Maria simply drove into him with her shoulder, slamming him against the nearest wall, where he slumped down. \"And stay down!\" Maria barked \"You heard him, Vanessa. Lysander's that way, now he's trapped with no way out! Let's crush him in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was right on Maria's heels as she ran through a short hallway away from the stairs. At its end, the way forked left and right, Maria and Vanessa only looked at each other silently, nodding and then parted their ways. Vanessa took the left side, with Maria heading the other way. It was only a short passage from here and before long, Vanessa could already see the fluttering fabric of Lysander's suit as he rushed behind a corner. Unfortunately for him, he was also one of the many people who simply couldn't keep pace with Vanessa and she got closer and closer to him, almost catching him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the last moment, he launched himself through an open doorway and slammed the door shut right in front of Vanessa. Without even bothering to slow down, she shouldered into the door, slamming the handle down just as Lysander was rattling around with the key from the other side! The door flew open with so much force that both Lysander and Vanessa tumbled down to the ground from the force of the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa jumped back up in record time. \"Now I've finally got you, traitor!\" She hissed, stepping closer. \"Vanessa! No, wait! It doesn't have to end like this!\" Lysander said, walking backwards away from Vanessa with his hands stretched out. \"It didn't have to end like this at some point, yes, but ever since you betrayed me and my cause, this here has been inevitable!\" Vanessa yelled, furious. \"Now you will reap what you sow!\" Vanessa reached for him as she walked all the up to Lysander. His back was to a wall now, but he somehow danced away sideways. \"No! Don't do this! It's not to late for the two of us! With you on our side, we can still turn things around!\" The desperation was thick in Lysander's voice. Vanessa was now marching him into a corner of the room; from there, there would be no way out for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" Vanessa laughed. \"Do you really think I would accept to your glorious... plans, now that I've been through all the trouble of rooting you out?\" She was getting close to him now, again, and once more, Lysander panicked. \"Stay back!\" he suddenly declared shrilly, his hand darting into the inside of his suit jacket and coming back out with a relatively short knife. Lysander waved it through the air frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor fool...\" Vanessa said sadly, shaking her head. \"You've already lost, don't make me beat you bloody... I'm not one of those women who enjoys being cruel, but that doesn't mean I can't be, if given no choice.\" She cracked her knuckles threateningly. \"Please... Please don't do this, Vanessa...\" Lysander sounded close to tears and lowered his knife a little, which caused Vanessa to hesitate. \"You can come with me unharmed. But drop this, first.\" Vanessa pointed at his knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander seemed unsure what to do for a few moments, his eyes darting from his own hands to Vanessa rapidly. Vanessa sighed. \"Look, I won't hurt you if you don't make me. ...even after all you've done. You have my word.\" \"You're... you're...\" Lysander mumbled. \"Speak up!\" Vanessa demanded. Her patience was beginning to run short. \"You're going to deliver me to them, aren't you?\" Lysander whispered. \"Of course.\" Vanessa shrugged. \"What else CAN I do, in this position? You'll live the rest of your life under the sweaty, smelly feet of Stenchlandian women...\" Vanessa saw Lysander's eyes grow large in fear as she said that \"...but at least you'll live. With that knife in your hand... Step forward, if you mean to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo...\" Lysander wailed. \"In fact... I think I would rather die.\" Vanessa blinked. \"Excuse me?\" \"You don't know how it is... Ever since I was a child, I was forced to live together with my mother, who had...\" Lysander bit his teeth together and clenched his eyes shut, as if remembering itself hurt him \"...absolutely horrible feet. I mean, I never really wanted to hold it against her, I knew she didn't want it to be that way, but... It was so horrible. Every day, that... stench, Vanessa! It was there, all day, every day, with no way for me to catch a breath, quite literally, I tell you! Back when I managed to finally escape, I... I swore to myself that I would never have to suffer this kind of agony again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander seemed to relax a little and Vanessa decided to wait. Maybe she could still talk him out safely out of this. \"Do... don't you see? My plan is and has always been put an end to the suffering of everybody who is affected by feet like that!\" Vanessa nodded solemnly. \"That has been my plan as well... Although, part of my plan, really. I always strove for equality, for all. Nobody can or should enslave anyone else in my personal idea of a perfect world...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander's mouth hardened, Vanessa was obviously referring to his own methods now. \"But, Vanessa... You know that these Stenchlandian women are evil! I mean... nobody could know that better than you! You are... You are not like that. I know you, as well, if only a little. You are not one of them, Vanessa!\" Vanessa's expression remained cool. \"Not one of whom? One who would enslave others?\" \"Arrgh...\" Lysander's face distorted in frustration. \"You know what I mean! Those Stenchlandian women must be stopped! Whether we deal with them your way or my way, or however... It makes no difference!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are wrong. It makes all the difference! I feel insulted that you would even compare my goals to your own and call them the same. I don't make slaves, I set them free! And I don't care one bit for what reason either happens.\" Vanessa spoke harshly and Lysander cast his eyes down. Even in his last struggle, he had retained some of his swaying charisma, Vanessa had to admit, but even that was gone now. He looked at her with eyes full of anger and hatred. \"It's over then, right? No way out, no?\" he growled. \"You know it. We have wasted more than enough time. Come with me, now!\" Vanessa took a step forward, reaching out with her open hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I choose to die instead!\" Lysander shouted and suddenly sprang forward, knife in hand. Just from the look on his face, Vanessa had read his move in advance. Even though he moved surprisingly swiftly, but Vanessa danced to the side gracefully and then delivered a spinning kick right to his wrist, knocking the knife far away with a single move! As Lysander backed away against his wall, clutching his hand, Vanessa jumped against him and pinned him to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough now! Surrender already!\" she demanded. \"You don't have to do this... You know that I would make an exception for you personally... Please, Vanessa, my dear-!\" Vanessa turned her head in disgust. Lysander had obviously gone completely delusional now. Vanessa rammed her knee into Lysander's stomach swiftly and forced him to the ground completely as he bent over.</span></div></div>",

And especially if the women of Stenchlandia are going to break you anyway - and they will! - it will only work to your advantage if you receive a bit of... preparation now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... You can't... mean...\" Lysander wheezed through his teeth, still trying to regain his breath as Vanessa pushed his head all the way down to her feet. Having officially joined sides with the SSS, Vanessa had also been given a full uniform fitting her new position, which included a pair of high, shiny black boots, against which she was now holding Lysander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but yes, of course... You may have never gotten close to them yourself, but... my own feet are also quite... well... just look for yourself!\" Having said that, Vanessa pulled one of her feet free from its boot, holding that one down with her other one and instantly held the long, flexible toes of her big, slender foot right in front of Lysander's horrified face, wiggling them dangerously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, it was clear that they were not just moist with sweat, but more like dripping wet. The inside of those boots had allowed Vanessa's feet to build up a huge amount of footsweat, all of which was saved and stored in there, until it reached its perfect, stinky state. Vanessa's foot was so hot and humid that the steaming smell was literally streaming right into Lysander's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear god no, aaaaaargh!\u201d Lysander screamed as the horrible, moist and hot air from Vanessa's long, sweat-dripping foot steamed into his face, but at this point, there was nothing left that he could try to do! With a horrible, squishy noise, Vanessa pushed her slick sole right against the skin of Lysander's struggling face. It felt incredibly smooth and soft even here, but the sheer heat was hard to bear and with all the moist sweat around, it was sliding up and down disgustingly, filling Lysander's field of view with nothing but smelly, sweaty foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the worst of all happened: Lysander actually had to take a whiff through his nose and was instantly hit with the most powerful foot aroma he ever had the displeasure to experience! For someone who had grown up in the shadow of smelly feet all his life, always fearing and trying to avoid them at all cost, someone who had more or less worked himself into a downright phobia of smelly feet, for someone like that to have feet as potent as Vanessa's pressed right into his face at their deadliest state was nothing short of torture! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the incredibly powerful, thick and cheesy reek of Vanessa's sweat-bathed, unwashed feet shot through Lysander's lungs, that aroma hit his brain like a flash of lightning! He instantly began to thrash around, trying to wiggle his way out of Vanessa's reach, but she only responded by grabbing him tightly and forcing him down onto the ground completely. The fierce kick that Lysander had received still affected him, so it was as easy for Vanessa to lie him down and plant her slippery, sweaty footsole across his face as if he was simply a sack of flour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander's hands reached Vanessa's big, long foot feebly, trying to grab it properly, but he had no chance! Vanessa now pushed his mouth shut properly and every shuddering breath that Lysander was forced to take had to go through his poor, tormented nose, blasting his nerves with endless waves of thick, cheesy foot funk! Lysander mumbled something incomprehensible beneath the soft cover of Vanessa's footsole, that only came out as a weak \u201cHmmmppfghh...\u201d, causing Vanessa to make a tsk tsk sound in disapproval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have barely even begun to smell! I know my feet are quite a start for this kind of thing, but if you give up already, just imagine how fun it will be to be at the mercy of stinky feet for hours to no end! Not that you wouldn't deserve it, hehehe...\u201d Vanessa giggled as she caressed Lysander's nose with the tips of her long, moist toes, forcing him to breathe in the strongest smells her already very powerful feet had to offer. \u201cReally, you should be glad that you get to have my feet in your face first...\u201d Vanessa continued merrily, but not without a certain tone of malice in her voice \u201c...because I can tell you're about to pass out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa waited for Lysander to take another breath. This time, she spread her toes widely and then cupped them close all over the front of Lysander's face, completely trapping his nose in the smelly, moist cave of sweaty, cheesy foot. As the sniff came, Vanessa felt the vibrations of Lysander's body straining itself against the brutal stench that blew over him! Vanessa took a deep breath herself and smiled as the rank aroma of her feet was so strong that even she herself almost had to cough in reflex! That was quite a start for that kind of thing, indeed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Lysander was right down there, in the epicentre of it all. \u201cBecause...\u201d Vanessa continued \u201c...if you passed out this quickly on Maria's feet, she would tie you to their soles as a punishment, probably for an entire night. But not with me, oh no. I remain a true and loyal friend, to the end!\u201d Vanessa grinned as she said that, watching as Lysander took another sniff right from in-between her toes, almost knocking himself out with it already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes... I will only hand you over. We have a new agent, you see. I think the two of you may know each other, even?\u201d Vanessa cackled shortly. \u201cHaha... Do you happen to know any woman by the name of Laurie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lysander heard Vanessa utter the name of his mother in that context, he panicked fully! His body thrashed around aimlessly and he took a short series of hazardous sniffs, right at Vanessa's long, pale toes, finally hitting himself with enough of her brutal footstink to truly seal the deal for himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final, horrified groan, Lysander passed out for good, knocked out by the god-like stench of the woman who had thought to be his friend for a long, long time. I guess it's true... Everybody just loves revenge... Vanessa thought with a smile as she put her boot back on and went to tie her prize up. I can only hope the others will have even more fun with him than I did! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow one of the two remaining threats had been caught. The only one who still remained was Joe! </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After having sufficiently tied the now unconscious Lysander up, Vanessa rushed back out of the room, wiping her nose as the fumes from her overworked, sweaty feet had filled up the room good. Vanessa was almost certain that Lysander would still be able to smell it after he woke up, even if that took some time... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right now, there was something else for Vanessa to do; running swiftly to a window in the hallway of the building, she quickly spied outside. By now, the sun had risen enough to fully illuminate the town below; it was morning now, and things were certainly looking sunny for the invading forces as well; Vanessa saw a few Stenchlandia troops waltzing around and tying up a few people here and there, but all real combat seemed to have stopped by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich meant, their invasion must have been a full success! At that thought, Vanessa figured that she should probably be happier about it, being a part of the winning team now and all, but yet, somehow she just felt a little depressed and... empty. Capturing Lysander had been her biggest personal goal and there she had it, but still... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head angrily, Vanessa regained her focus. She was still in the middle of a mission and wouldn't allow herself to let her mind get all cloudy like that! As she was running nimbly though the halls, she almost collided with a very fast moving Maria. \u201cAh, Vanessa, about time you show up! Did you catch your guy?\u201d \u201cLysander, yes, I took him out in that room behind me... Do we have any news about this Joe person, yet?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, yeah, we do...\u201d Maria growled,  looking angry. \u201cWhile you were gone, I cornered and swiftly questioned one man I found hiding in another room and he gave me a description that perfectly fit some puny little dude I smacked out of the way, just as we began infiltrating this building. Thing is, I went back there and found him gone. By now, our forces have the premises completely surrounded, so there's no way he could get outside that way...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria furrowed her brow furiously and clenched her fist. \u201c...I know I should probably be happier about our imminent victory here; but I just hate it so much when a little thing like that prevents a situation from being... completely and utterly perfect, you know?\u201d Vanessa nodded and almost had to smirk. \u201cDon't we all know it...\u201d \u201cYes, so we can't let that disgusting little worm wiggle its way out from under our feet.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Vanessa and Maria were heading down the corridor, they saw someone rushing away and up some stairs coming from below, on the other end of the hall! Looking on without uttering a word, both of them took chase and almost collided with another woman who was already chasing that lone person. \u201cHey, hey, who is that... One of ours, was she?\u201d Vanessa wondered, not having caught a proper glimpse but nevertheless not wasting a second in charging up the stairs herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, no doubt of that, it's our uniform. But... Could that be Lara?\u201d Maria said, slightly in awe at her subordinates amazing speed! Just a few seconds, Vanessa reached the top and saw the SSS woman just running into the first room there. Giving chase and entering herself, Vanessa soon saw that it was in fact that Lara person; one of Maria's bigger fans. Although, right now, Vanessa was more wondering about what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara seemed to be half-crawling into some sort of air duct, reaching inside with her arms first. \u201cWait... Did that guy get in there first?\u201d Vanessa wondered aloud, running up there and grabbing Lara by her legs, giving her a sharp pull. Out came not only the SSS agent, but someone who she had been in fact holding tight with her own hands. <br>\r\n\u201cAhh, thanks Comrade!\u201d Lara said, shooting Vanessa a quick smile before looking back to her captive. \u201cI caught that little bastard as he was trying to get away here... Really darted like an arrow, this one, must be truly scared. Hah Hah... And for good reason!\u201d Lara gave the boy a toothy grin, who just remained in a panicky silence, still huffing and gasping lowly from his little run and eyes darting nervously back and forth between the two women in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Maria herself followed up as well. \u201cLookie what we have here, Boss!\u201d Lara said, holding down the boy with one hand, pointing at him with the other. \u201cI caught ourselves a runner.\u201d \u201cThat's... This is that Joe Character! It must be, the description is dead on!\u201d Maria exclaimed, overjoyed as she got her first good view of the boy's face. \u201cAhh, he's one of our main targets, right?\u201d Lara said with a grin \u201cShall we have a little fun with him before delivering him further?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shall we ever!\u201d Maria said with a broad grin, staring daggers at Joe and walking up to him swiftly. Joe, who was still lying on the ground, tried to crawl away backwards, but Maria simply put one of her booted feet onto his chest, forcing him to the ground. \u201cWhere do you think you're going, you quick little bunny rabbit? I give you one thing;  you ran pretty fast before... Must have somehow out-manoeuvred  me as I was coming for you... Not too shabby! However...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria leaned in a bit closer and Joe wheezed as she increased the level of pressure onto him. \u201c...you won't be running anywhere once we're finished with you now. Haha! Hahaha! Oh, this situation here is really funny, come to think of it... You are this Joe we're searching, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe's eyes darted from Maria to Lara and back, both women staring down at him hungrily, leering. He swiftly shook his head. \u201cHow dare you lie to our beloved Leader!\u201d Lara screamed immediately, giving Joe a relatively light kick with the tip of her boot, directly into his ribs! Joe flinched at the impact and Maria chuckled. \u201cEasy there, Lara. We don't want to risk harming our little captive, not before we hand him over to his rightful owner. Yes, that's right, boy! You know the funny thing about that Joe I mentioned? That Joe has a sister, one sister with... well, let's say relatively strong feet. That Joe had grown disobedient and decided that having to treat his sister and her feet the proper way every now and then was beneath him... Tsk tsk.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria licked her lips and her eyes downright sparkled with gleeful excitement as she continued. \u201cThe funny thing is that this very Joe is about to receive three pairs of much, much worse smelling feet, for all his rebelliousness!\u201d \u201cHaha... Oh yes! Yes!\u201d Lara said, growing quite excited herself. \u201cWait... three?\u201d Vanessa asked, glancing over at the downed Joe with some uncertainty. \u201cYes, of course! We would never deny you this fun, now would we?\u201d Maria said with a grin, sounding almost earnestly friendly. \u201cI... I'm not so sure about this...\u201d Vanessa mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was no question on whose side she was now and she didn't really have qualms about fighting real enemies... But engaging in the torment of an already helpless person? Lysander was different, what he had done to her was unforgivable. But as far as she knew, all this Joe had really done was trying his best to fight for his freedom. Possible that he would have gone along with Lysander's dark plans, should they have worked, but still... Even now, Vanessa couldn't help but feel pity for the poor guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? I think you should be plenty sure. Come over here!\" Maria demanded and Vanessa decided not to risk offending her de facto leader over such a small matter. After all, it wasn't like she could make any difference anymore, anyhow. \"No... Please. Whatever it is you want from me...\" Joe finally said, feebly, but Maria and Lara already got down on the ground next to him, holding him tight with their arms and legs. \"What we want you to do is suffer!\" Lara yelled almost shrilly and Maria chuckled. \"That's right... Best get ready. What we have to offer to you will be unlike anything you've ever smelled before!\" Maria warned, already pulling on her combat boots. Lara did the same as soon as she saw what Maria was doing and in an instant, both of their boots had come off!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even Vanessa had to gasp as she saw the effects of the brand new SSS nylons on these women's feet; especially on Maria. Lara's feet were simply completely covered with a layer of sweat, and shining dangerously in the daylight, but Maria's feet were now literally dripping with sweat! Not an instant later and Joe began to cough and gag violently. \"Oh god! What... Arrghhh! Holy shit... This is... Urgh! This is worse than Sarah's...\" was all that he could utter as a violent cloud of insanely potent foot aroma quickly formed around those deadly feet almost on top of him, trapping him inside it and poisoning him instantly! \"Oh... oh dear!\" Lara made as it reached her, too. Despite what she was used to, this amount of pure stench had her turn her head instantly, one hand fanning at her face as tears were streaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, it even reached Vanessa, who was still standing a bit away, in mere minutes. The smell was like a wall, so thick, hot and solid, as it came rushing over herself! Vanessa had experienced even Maria's footsmell several times before, but this... This was a new level of bad! Vanessa had to gasp lightly as the thick, cheesy stench produced a sharp, prickly afterburn in her nose, the kind you usually got when you smelled a really stinky foot up close... Only now, she was still a bit away. And this boy there... He was right in the middle of it all! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling of sheer horror overcame Vanessa and she felt as if she was in the wrong film as she watched Joe's panicked and helpless face, growing red and wrinkled from the deadly smell, numerous moist, hot nylon toes and soles slowly reaching out to it, ready to embrace it in their deadly, reeking hug. Vanessa felt like something was remotely controlling her; she realised how she was walking closer to them, how the stench got even more unbearable for even herself, felt the ground under her butt as she sat down and the cool feeling of air on her toes as her own boots fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he was. A helpless, pitiful guy, getting his face mercilessly smothered by six of the most stinky feet in the entire land. And one part of that was herself, Vanessa. She didn't even attempt to understand the entire situation anymore, just slowly giving in to the horrible feeling of just not caring about that unfortunate soul. With Vanessa's feet exposed as well, the air around them grew so unbearably stinky with rank, sweaty foot aroma that Vanessa felt a certain, well-known dizziness rising up inside her, and every breath made her feel a little more sick, but still she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all soon became too much for poor Joe, who had faced some certainly stinky feet before, but nothing which could have even remotely prepared him for that inhumane onslaught of pure stench! Moist, heated and slippery nylon fabric tickled his face at all times, his nose was getting clamped by different pairs of toes seemingly constantly and any effort to breathe through his mouth had long gone futile as there was always a moist, sweaty football or rounded, slick heel pushing onto it hard. With every sniff Joe was forced to take through his nose, a sharp, blinding light seemed to rush through his brain as the stench was simply too powerful for him too handle, overloading his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just some more sniffs, his vision became blurry and unclear and everything had begun to spin by now, as well. The only thing that remained clearly was this unspeakable mixture of foot aromas; it was not just one single stench like he had known it from his sister, but now there was a bunch of different fragrances, one more nauseating than the other. It mostly reeked like old, stale, disgusting cheese, the typical, revolting stale sweat aroma was there as well and all sorts of bitter, salty, sour and even sickly sweet side notes. Joe couldn't even try to move as several of the women's limbs were holding him down tight, but right now, his body tensed up and began to shake uncontrollably as his brain finally overloaded with all the wicked foot stench it had been forced to take in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe had no other choice than to sniff again and again and finally, everything went black aptruptly and all his muscles went limp again. Once more, he had been knocked out. It shouldn't remain to be the last time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Vanessa got back up from the now unconscious Joe, ringed by a cheerful Maria and Lara, looking down arrogantly and sneeringly at their victim, she still felt as if something had gone terribly wrong. \"Well, the fun is over for now!\" Maria exclaimed happily, clapping her hands. \"Back to work!\" Lara began to tie up Joe and Vanessa followed Maria outside, wordlessly. Maria went on to secure that the capital was very well taken, which didn't prove to be too hard, as the zealous forces they had brought with them had already done excellent work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria climbed up some short building and beckoned Vanessa and Lara - who had rushed back shortly after having dealt with Joe - to come join her there. Vanessa hardly listened as Maria spoke, almost screamed, really, about how they had heroically crushed the last of resistance and how the rest of Equmria would follow soon after. Vanessa couldn't stop thinking about what had happened, especially to herself. This was the first time where she was truly proven to be one of the bad guys. Being on the bad side without actually doing much, well, that was one thing, Vanessa had pretty much had to discard her honour after their defeat anyway, but this now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving seen that boy suffer beneath not just one, but three pair of horrible feet, taking place in the entire practise, feeling no regret about it... Perhaps having actually gotten her desired revenge after Lysander had allowed that hole in Vanessa to grow even further. Right now, she didn't know if she would be able to continue like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Joe and Lysander - who were both tied up and also both still out cold - had been brought out of the building and loaded into a truck. Maria had decided to bring them back to the capital personally; after all, her leadership was no longer really required out here and she would have probably returned there, anyway. Vanessa tagged along as well, unsure what else to do and Lara was overjoyed to hear that she was allowed to carry out the rest of the official assault on Equmria herself. In truth, it would have taken a miracle now for her to mess it up at that point, but she still saw it as a great chance to prove herself and her skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe and Lysander were now most likely heading towards a life in slavery... However, before their regular slave life will be allowed to begin, one very special \"session\" will be sure to take place once they reach the capital...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There it was, then. Vanessa looked absent-mindedly at the two newly-captured captives, lying tied up together at the floor of the truck. Maria prodded one of them, Joe, in the chest with the tip of her boot. \u201cJust enjoy the comfort of lying around here uselessly, you little worms...\u201d Maria mumbled with a grin, though she might as well have been talking to herself by the looks of it. \u201c...soon enough, you will be put to good use.\u201d Maria looked up from them and flashed a beaming smile to Vanessa, who was sitting opposite to her. \u201cIsn't that right, Vanessa?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa blinked slowly and finally looked up herself. \u201cHmmm... Yeah...\u201d she said slowly, not really having paid much attention. \u201cHaha, ahh come on girl! Don't tell me that little chasing has worn you out already!\u201d Maria said, smiling broadly and waving her fists around in the air. \u201cBut damn, we really got them good, don't you agree? I mean, haha, what else to expect, right? But then again... I had also expected to put down your little rabble a little quicker than I finally did, heh...\u201d Maria continued, hitting Vanessa lightly in the shoulder as she spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, yeah... You have what you have, I guess... Ahem...\u201d Maria calmed down a bit and squint her eyes. \u201cAre you alright, Vanessa? Don't tell me you're coming down with a flu now or something, haha! But, seriously now?\u201d \u201cNo, no, it's alright, I'm just... thinking a lot. About our victory. About what it will mean for the rest of the world-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, there's not a whole lot to think about on that aspect!\u201d Maria interrupted loudly, getting fired up again. \u201cVictory means victory. In this case, total victory! From here on, it'll go much easier... We'll build up our already vastly superior forces with the new Equmrian territory and their resources, offer all our neighbours to be annexed peacefully and for anyone who dares not to agree with our terms completely and absolutely... Well, we'll just crush them all!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had gotten so fired up that she was breathing audibly now, complete with shaking hands and a few droplets of sweat appearing on her forehead. \u201cI mean... hah... Who doesn't dream of world domination... To just control everything... To rule over all, to truly write history as the most powerful person the world has ever seen... Of course, for most of us, we soon realise that those dreams are nothing but... yeah, just dreams, basically. Poof, once you regain your senses and wake up, they're all gone. But for me, now...\u201d Maria smiled a deeply contend smile and stared at her hands, opening and closing them a few times. \u201c...it all seems... possible now. Right within my grasp. Yeah... Oh, sorry, you were saying?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked at Maria with a strange expression. \u201cAnd... I'm thinking about my future place in it all.\u201d She finally finished, letting out a long breath which she had been saving for the past minute or so. \u201cAhh, there you are, always thinking too much when it's time to finally relax a little!\u201d Maria said lightly, patting Vanessa on her shoulder. \u201cDon't get me wrong, I value your strategic thinking and all your thoughtful expertise on tactics and whatnot... But we just won! Let's have some good times, no? You got a real kick from teaching this little bastard here...\u201d Maria kicked Lysander now, but he was either still out cold or pretended not to feel it. \u201c...his rightful place, did you not?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... I... that was-\u201d Vanessa began, but was soon cut off again. \u201cAnd you can have that any time now! Well, alright, I still might put you to use when we later have to eventually deal with other uprisings or rebellious nations unwilling to give in without a fight... Things never go completely smoothly, I know that... But hey, my point being, you can finally kick back and take a little break! Be worshipped like the strong, beautiful woman that you are! I mean, not to make light of your treachery, but I can appreciate a hard, determined worker and I know that you personally had to do quite a lot.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa couldn't help but agree with that, so she nodded and gave a little smile. \u201cYes... And to think it had really been going well for quite a while...\u201d \u201cYeah... even against forces lead by me. I'm just glad you're on the right side, now!\u201d Maria smiled and Vanessa's smile was failing a little. \u201cJust imagine... Sitting back in your favourite chair after a long day of work... Just clapping your hands or ringing a bell or whatever, and then, swift as the wind, your loyal, well-trained footslave or... footslaves, even, they come out and give you a nice treatment that makes all your worries and stress melt right away like butter in an oven... Oh trust me, I know how that feels, but... Do you?\u201d Maria asked, cocking her head and grinning smugly at Vanessa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa couldn't help but chuckle at that situation. \u201cWell, what do you think...\u201d She replied drily, raising one eyebrow. \u201cSee, exactly! Just wait until you had that. It'll make everything seem different. Oh, and anyway!\u201d Maria looked around a little. \u201cI think we're getting close to the capital again!\u201d \u201cDamn, time really flies when you're locked in a conversation!\u201d Vanessa blurted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd anyway...\u201d Maria repeated, taking on a different expression. \u201c...I think we're also about to behold quite a show with these two, once we arrive at the headquarters... I don't think our two special new recruits will be very far gone from there, hehehe... Eager for a reunion with their... loved ones, I'd take it, hahaha!\u201d Vanessa just smiled briefly and looked out herself. And truly, the outskirts of the capital were just passing by outside... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you think they'll be here any time soon, uhh... Laurie was your name, right?\u201d Sarah asked, her arms crossed and walking up and down in the middle of the large room. \u201cYes, that's right... And I think it should be really soon now, girl...\u201d Laurie replied, eyeing the younger woman warily as she continued to run up and down, in stark contrast to her own figure; standing still and tall, just waiting patiently. \u201cAfter all, Maria herself has signalled us a message of their, how did she word it again... Lightning-quick, crushing victory? Something of the like...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, they better bring little Joey over as well...\u201d Sarah said, rubbing her hands together. \u201c...because I do blame myself a little bit, you know... As the older sister, it should have been my job to make sure my bro learned his place swiftly and efficiently... But nah, it looks like I had been too soft on him.\u201d Laurie frowned as she listened to Sarah ramble. Sarah's burning fervour aside, she could actually relate to those feelings, herself. After all, her own son had risen to the position where he had been considered an enemy of the State... Not exactly a good position for the mother, either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut this time I prepared, oh, how I prepared well!\u201d Sarah said proudly and Laurie fought the urge to scrunch up her face as she walked by her. She could kind of tell, herself... Even from a distance, Sarah gave off the smell of not having taken a shower in a day or two. Laurie glanced down at her. While she herself was completely clad in a standard-issue SSS uniform, complete with their combat boots and newly developed \u201ccombat nylons\u201d as well, Sarah on the other hand looked a tiny bit out of place. \u201cYou have been out running, right?\u201d Laurie asked, though it was somewhat obvious, either way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah...\u201d Sarah said, rubbing her hands together. \u201c...and not just today, earlier on... Nah, ever since Maria said they'd move out as soon as those new nylons are ready... I think that was a week ago, or so? Anyway! Ever since then, I went running for at least one hour straight,  three times per day, without ever changing shoes or socks and of course, without washing my feet!\u201d Sarah jumped up and down excitedly while Laurie eyed the girl's running shoes quietly. They definitely looked like they had seen better days... \u201cOnly the best for my beloved bro, after all! Hahaha!\u201d Sarah added cheerfully, smiling brightly and rubbing her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie couldn't help but draw a deep sigh. \u201cI wish I could share your enthusiasm about this entire thing...\u201d She said somewhat sadly. \u201cHmmm, what do you mean? You did prepare for this, didn't you?\u201d Sarah said curiously. \u201cOf course. I've worn these newly-designed combat nylons ever since they were given to me. And I have to say, they have proven to be quite... effective.\u201d Laurie swallowed hard for a moment when she remembered herself taking her boots off two days ago... Thanks to her naturally sweaty and smelly feet, she had been more than used to a little footsmell, but the wretched stench that had filled her room that day; it had been overwhelming even for her! Laurie had then wisely decided not to take off her boots at all up until now, simply keeping them on even during the night. She just hoped she wouldn't accidentally kill anyone when she would finally have to remove them again, today... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shook her head quickly. \u201cNo, I just meant, how happy you seem to be about that whole thing.  You see... I have never quite enjoyed tormenting others with my... feet, as much as some other people seem to do.\u201d \u201cWahaha!\u201d Sarah knew that Laurie was referring to her, but didn't mind that at all. \u201cAnd therein lies your problem, comrade! But don't worry! You probably never had a nice and obedient footslave to pamper to your every need, right?\u201d Larie squint her eyes. \u201cNot really, no.\u201d \u201cYeah, I thought so. Just wait a bit, friend. You'll learn to love it. It's only natural.\u201d Sarah trailed off and stared into the air for a moment, an expression of pure bliss on her face. \u201cI mean, just imagine... From now on, we'll be able to have that any day, every day. I've quite enjoyed the company of my little brother, back when we still lived together and I made him my foot bitch... And I've quite missed him all the while he was gone. Oh... I'm going to take back all the time I have missed with him, and then much, much more!\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Sarah began to drive herself into a little frenzy there, the front door suddenly flew open! All eyes were on it and sure enough, it was Maria who pranced in, tall and proud like always, looking especially pleased with herself, even for her standards. \u201cOh, they're back, they're back!\u201d Sarah squealed in excitement, before she saw Laurie standing straight and giving a salute. Sarah cleared her throat and did the same. Maria simply smirked. \u201cOh yes, we are back...\u201d her smile became wider and wider. \u201c...and we brought you a little present, just as promised!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had a sort of leather leash in her hand, which she gave a sharp yank now. With a small cough, Joe came stumbling in behind her, his arms tied together behind his back and the end of the leash secured around his neck. \u201cWhat do you say, Joe?\u201d Maria asked sweetly and cruelly \u201cReady for a little family reunion?\u201d As soon as Joe saw Sarah standing there, he panicked a little. \u201cNo! No!\u201d He screamed, straining himself against Maria's leash in an attempt to get a bit further away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Vanessa was walking in behind them as well, holding a similar leash but a rather stoic and not very cheerful expression on her face. Following her was Lysander, bound up in a similar way to Joe, only that he seemed only sad and broken, not attempting to flee or get away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of Joe quite amused Sarah. \u201cHaha, oh what's the matter, little brother? Don't you remember me?\u201d She said, walking towards him with a mean smirk on her face. Joe's face contorted into a mask of pure panic and fear and he began shaking slightly. \u201cHaha, it seems to me he remembers you quite well...\u201d Maria said, still grinning and forcefully dragging Joe closer by her neck like a disobedient dog. When she had him close enough, she turned him around, put a knee into his back and forced him to the ground, where he slumped over, hitting the ground with his hip and shoulder as he was unable to break the fall with his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria handed her end of the leash to Sarah silently, who accepted it gratefully. As Joe was wriggling around on the ground, trying to get back up, Sarah walked up to him nonchalantly and gave him a swift kick in the back. With no way to fight back, Joe simply groaned as Sarah then stepped on his back with her left foot, pinning him to the ground securely. <br>\r\nSarah did not use much force for that, not that it would have been necessary. \u201cWell, well, well, brother dearest...\u201d she spoke icily with a sharp, satisfied smile on her face and rubbed her shoe left and right on Joe's back. \u201c...I have to admit you came quite a way after the last time I had you lying down at my feet. Escaping the country, teaming up with an enemy state and all that. Yet now, in the end, you are right back where you started. Right where you belong. Down on the ground, and at my feet.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping her left foot on Joe's back, Sarah now moved her second one right in front of his face. With how worn-out and battered Sarah's running shoes were, quite a bit of her deadly feet's noxious fumes were seeping through even with her shoes still on, and the sharp, spicy scent of her smelly feet soon met with Joe's face, whom Sarah instantly felt flinching and groaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes. You can smell it already, can't you? Thanks to your disobedience and treachery, you will now get to experience the full potential of my feet. But hey, don't worry, in the end, it's still your dear, sweet, loving sister, so don't you forget that...\u201d Sarah grinned and proceeded to take her left foot off from Joe's back, but only so she could comfortably sit down on him. Joe grunted under his sister's weight, but with his arms tied up like they were, he had no way to fight back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Vanessa \u2013 who still held Lysander by the leash in her hand \u2013 watched on quietly until she was approached by Laurie. \u201cI fear that one is not the only traitor who will face his punishment now.\u201d Laurie spoke in a dark tone and upon hearing her, Lysander perked up, his face turning to look at Laurie, his eyes sparkling with fear. His lips were quaking as if he wanted to say something, but no word came forth. Vanessa simply nodded grimly and attempted to hand over the leash to Laurie... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen suddenly, Lysander called upon all the strength he had left and swiftly broke free! \u201cNo! No, no, no!\u201d He cried shrilly, yanking his head to the side sharply and ran off frantically in the direction of the door. With lightning speed, Maria jumped in his way and gave him a rough shove, sending him stumbling back. \u201cGoing somewhere, huh? I think not!\u201d Just as quickly, Lysander choked as he felt the grip of the leash on his neck tightening painfully... Vanessa had appeared behind him, her end of the leash in her fist again, this time clenched hard. \u201cYou will not escape justice this time...\u201d Vanessa spoke angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had finally had it with this man's antics. Winding up with her second arm, she swiftly moved to Lysander's front and gave him a quick, sharp punch in the stomach. Having his hands tied and being slightly choked as well, Lysander had no chance to soften the blow and took it directly, having the wind knocked out of him! \u201cTsk. Well, here you go.\u201d Vanessa said grimly, now handing over the leash firmly to Laurie, who was taking it quickly with Lysander bending over, heaving for breath in the meantime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, this is getting amusing quite quickly, I'm happy to see...\u201d Maria said with a bright smile, crossing her arms in front of her chest, shifting her gaze from Vanessa and Laurie over to Sarah and her brother. Sarah had now positioned both of her feet next to her brother's face and was just about to remove them with her hands. \u201cSo, yes... As I was saying. It had been a long time since we really met, bro. The question is just... Do you really remember the smell of my feet? Do you remember me? Well, time to find out.\u201d And with that, both of Sarah's shoes flew off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the weight of his sister on his back, Joe could not move an inch as very suddenly, both of her rather large, long socked feet came into his view, her nasty toes wiggling in excitement. It was quite obvious from his view that those socks she was wearing had been used for more than just a few runs, obviously worn out and dirtied with repeated use and soaked up sweat, they were right now literally soaked with the deadly stuff. The moist heat being given off from them alone was sharp and heavy enough to make Joe's eyes tear up, without having even drawn a single good breath! But Sarah was growing impatient. \u201cAhhh, that feels nice. Go, sniff my tired, sweaty feet. They're in this state specifically for you, you little twat. You better show them some damn appreciation!\u201d Having said that, Sarah pushed down with one hand on Joe's head, pressing his face directly into the toe areas of her filthy, sweaty sock-feet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing unable to resist, Joe took in a tiny little breath of air as he was still a little gasping for air due to being thrown on the ground and stepped and sat on... And the stench of his sister's feet exploded with an unknown intensity right in his mind! An overwhelmingly thick cheesy scent, richly spiced with various shades of salty, sour and musky, this was an aroma that hit his stomach and brain like a hammer and everything spin and feel fuzzy right from the first moment! It was the smell of his sister's feet, alright... A smell he did well know, but now so much stronger than ever. Joe didn't know for how long he would be able to take this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly cow... Ahhhh! I can already smell it!\u201d Maria cheered, walking closer to Sarah and Joe, a big, fat grin on her face. \u201cGood work there, girl!\u201d \u201cOh, I'm just getting started... Isn't that right, Joey? How about you start smelling for good?\u201d Sarah began rubbing the ball of her foot up and down all over Joe's face, while giving him a cruel little tug with the leash that left him breathless for a moment. \u201c...that is, if you want to breath at all.\u201d Joe didn't know whether he should choke and gag due to being almost strangulated or due to those noxious foot fumes flying freely into his face and the sharp, salty sweat that was steadily being smeared across it right now... This was a pure nightmare! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another, much deeper breath now, Joe actually had a little coughing fit as the overly strong and potent cheese-stench of her sister's sweaty socks and feet invaded his senses and slowly but steadily wrangled his body and spirit dry. \u201cGah... Oh, please, make this stop... I'll do whatever you say, whatever you want, Sarah, but this... I can't- Hmmmmpff!\u201d Having none of that right now, Sarah simply stuck the toes of one foot right into her brother's noisy mouth, shutting him up. \u201cShush now! You will do what I want alright, and  right now, I want you to sniff my foot!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his nose blocked off like this, Joe didn't have much of a choice and soon enough, he had to breathe again and this time, his entire body shook and quivered with disgust and anguish as the intense, unbearable stench of his sister's feet wrecked havoc upon him! Joe's muscled slumped down slowly and he groaned a muffled cry of desperation as his strength left him and all that he could do was keep on smelling and sniffing those hated, ungodly stinky feet of his sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cIt really is time we start this, as well.\u201d Laurie said with a sigh, yanking on Lysander's leash and making him fall down to his knees. \u201c...because I'm beginning to really smell that girl's feet and it's starting to bother me a little bit... This should change things up.\u201d Having said that, Laurie began pulling off one of her high leather boots, it slowly coming off revealed the slick, heated foot beneath, shining wetly behind the layer of the specifically designed SSS combat nylons, their work done very well. Quite instantly, an incredibly powerful stench began wafting off from her now exposed foot and Laurie wasted no time in pressing it swiftly over her son's horrified face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuh... *wheeze* No... Stop it... Agghhhh!\u201d Lysander gasped and coughed, struggling back even now against the inevitable, quite unlike Joe who seemed to have already given in by that point. \u201cOh, I can't bear to look at this. Let me give you a hand, woman.\u201d Vanessa growled lowly. All these situations she had been put in lately were really wearing on her now and she just felt annoyed and irritated by the fact that Lysander still tried to fight back even now. Together, they pushed Lysander down on the ground properly and then, with each of them standing to his left and right, Vanessa pulled off one of her boots as well and they both began smothering his face with their combined forces. <br>\r\nLysander began shivering and gagging as he had Vanessa's huge foot on his face as well... As terrible as having to smell his own mother's foot was, in such an incredibly potent state as well, Vanessa's foot simply outranked it in sheer amounts of stench, even now. And it wasn't like Laurie's foot had left his face by now, either. Both of their feet shared places and took turns in rubbing themselves all across the entirety of it, making sure that one especially fragrant part like the toe area or the ball of the foot was present right beneath Lysander's nostrils at all times.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what... this is a wonderful idea! My feet are aching to get out of their boots anyway, as well... Hey, Sarah, would you share the honour of punishing this lowly traitor with me?\u201d Maria asked, a sly grin on her face. Even in this position, Sarah looked downright ecstatic to grant her superior any request. \u201cOh, of course, naturally, any time! Please...\u201d Sarah jumped off her brother's back swiftly, crouched next to him and turned him on his back, which revealed his eyes already rolling around aimlessly and him being barely conscious at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my... Looks like you did quite the number on him...\u201d Maria breathed, licking her lips as she got closer to Joe and prepared taking off one of her boots. \u201c...maybe there won't be much actual sharing left until he his done for now. But fear not... Once we have officially made Joe your property, your slave, you will have all the time you want to treat him any way you like. So, where were we...\u201d Maria grinned and slowly pulled off one boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven without these special, newly-crafted SSS combat nylons, Maria's feet had always been a pair one should be wary about, as Joe very well knew. But right now, after she had finished that entire last mission, plus the trip back here... Behind those dark, shining nylons, the hot, fresh sweat was literally dripping down on the ground with how soaked in it her feet were, and the stench of them was quite on par. Maria grinned and stretched one foot out in the direction, which blasted his face with a hot, acrid wave of intensified foot aroma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe groaned and began making sounds of dismay, which caused Sarah to act. Sitting next to him, she crouched down and slowly peeled off her sticky, hot, old worn socks, looking at them appraisingly and feeling the unpleasant tickle of their foul scent on her face. Not like the air down here was anywhere near tolerable, now with Maria's enormous, sweat-dripping foot looming in mid-air, as well... \u201cHere, I have an idea... Allow me.\u201d Sarah said and swiftly crouched over Joe, jamming one of her reeking socks right into his partly opened mouth, toe-end first. Joe's eyes bulged and her retched in agony as this happened as now his entire mouth was filling with the overwhelming taste of sweaty, unwashed feet as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt the moist, hot waves of Maria's foot nearby and quickly got out of the way again and not a second too late as Maria grinningly brought her monstrous foot down upon Joe's face mere seconds after. \u201cIt is a good idea...\u201d Maria mused just as she pressed the wet, round ball of her foot in the middle of Joe's face, grabbing his forehead with the strong, large toes of hers and beginning to drag the entire length of her sole up and down on his face, forcing him to closely sniff every part and absolutely covering everything in a slimy layer of her sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah had to fight back a little cough herself as the steamy fumes of Maria's feet engulfed her as well and stabbed at her senses with every breath she took. Even from where she was, it was getting close to unbearable from the sheer strength of the smell... Sarah could hardly imagine the suffering her brother had to go through with those life-threatening things plastered firmly on his face, forced to inhale their exhaust through his nose with every breath... But still, thinking about that made her smile. It was just what he deserved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria let Joe sniff inbetween her huge toes a few times, an act coming close to an actual death sentence as Joe spasmed and buckled weakly under the weight of her foot, his brain overloading under the brutal onslaught and before Maria realised it, we was out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I think it's only fair for me to give you another turn here, Sarah- Oh...\u201d Maria spoke, slightly disappointed as she lifted her foot back up again and saw Joe clearly being knocked out already. \u201cSheesh, ah, I must apologize, I really didn't mean to cut your fun so short here, it's just... I can get a little carried away with these things.\u201d Maria said, blushing slightly, which was uncharacteristic for her. Sarah immediately raised her palms before herself dismissively. \u201cOh, no, no, no, it's quite alright, it's no problem, my leader... I mean... You did promise I could keep him afterwards, right?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely correct!\u201d Now both of them were smiling brightly again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah pulled the sock out of Joe's mouth again but threw it on the ground, not really wanting to wear that again right now. Unsure what to do with the second one, she simply left it spread out over Joe's face, giving him some olfactory pleasure even in his sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I tell you what...\u201d Maria said, closing her eyes and wagging her finger whilst nodding, as Sarah was busy slipping back into her rattled shoes. \u201cIf our second special guest here is still conscious, then let's give him a special treatment he's not like to ever forget! Hey, ladies!\u201d Maria called out to Vanessa and Laurie, who were keeping their feet on Lysander this whole time. \u201cLet me see if our little traitor friend here is still capable of receiving the divine blessing of this nation's very finest feet...\u201d Maria continued with a dark grin and Lysander's tormentors retracted their feet for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Joe, Lysander showed a good bit of resistance under these circumstances. His face was sparkling moist with the sweat from both Vanessa's and Laurie's feet and the smell surrounding it, the very smell he had been forced to endure this whole time was nothing short of abyssal. Yet there he lay, weak and shivering but with his eyes slowly focusing on the woman above him and the fear on his face told them all that he was still very much conscious at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cEnjoyed your treatment, you little worm? I sure hope you did because from now on, this is what you'll get every day... However! What you won't get every day is eight amazing feet on your face at once... Isn't that right, my dears?\u201d Maria thundered in grinning anticipation, rubbing her hands and circling around the lying Lysander. \u201cYou can get on his chest if you want, Sarah, that position really fits you...\u201d Maria commented as she walked behind Lysander, Sarah swiftly did as she was told, sat down on Lysander's chest and already began prying her shoes back off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria silently gestured to Vanessa and Laurie, who wordlessly took place and sat down to Lysander's left and right, respectively. Maria sat down just above his head and there he was, completely outflanked and surrounded from all sides now. The very next second, Maria had her sweaty, cheesy beasts unleashed again as well, and the four women all slowly moved their feet up and closer to him... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the apocalypse, the end of the world. The down-pouring stench from eight feet at once, some of the most potent and stinky feet in the whole land, was enough to even seriously affect Laurie and Sarah... Only Vanessa and Maria steeled themselves not to show any sign of emotion as they all brought their feet down and unleashed a toxic, salty and absolutely stale and cheesy death-stream of toxic, foul foot fumes that washed over the entire room like a tidal wave smashing through a brittle little dam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was not nearly enough space on Lysander's face to accommodate all of those feet, so the girls and women just kept them in motion, rubbing them into his hair, down his neck and chest or just keeping them left and right his head as well, always ready to plant one back onto his face, once it was free again. Lysander did not get a single whiff of air that did not stream directly from the moistened, hot skin of some sweaty female foot, rich with the strongest scents and aromas of reeking foot funk that he had ever been forced to endure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander did possess a fair amount of endurance and resistance, but right now, that was decreasing rapidly, melting away like some ice cubes under a Bunsen burner's flame. The entire surface of his face felt similar now as well, on fire. The sharp, unhealthy sweat was stinging and sticking all over it, his eyes and lungs burned under the inferno of so many different scents and his brain slowly sizzled into a coma-like state here, not nearly fit to stay sharp and awake under such conditions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes through that and Lysander shook and tensed up a final time, let out a weak, muffled groan on agony and sheer defeat and finally slumped down again, clearly out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria gave a content sigh as she saw and felt this and retracted her monstrous feet once more. \u201cWell... This has been incredibly satisfying, I must say. I'm sure Lysander will make a good slave, Laurie.\u201d Laurie, who was getting up again now, a bit shaky on her legs and pale in her face, nodded grimly. \u201cI will... I will make sure of it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah jumped back up again as well, slapping herself in the face lightly and shaking it. \u201cWhew, it sure was fun, but man... I have to say, I'm kinda glad it's over now, hehe...\u201d She shook out her fingers a few times and bounced up and down. \u201c...I almost felt as if I was going to pass out here, as well...\u201d \u201cThere is no shame in that.\u201d Vanessa said simply, rising anew herself. \u201cA smell like this... I dare say, aside from the women gathered here in this room, there are probably none in the entire country who could produce such a thing. Many fine soldiers would probably faint from smelling that, as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, what can I say, it was pretty damn stinky, alright!\u201d Maria said, already prancing about and picking up Joe's leash, handing it back to Sarah who had been following as well. \u201cAnd Vanessa here is right... You did a fine job here today, Sarah.\u201d Sarah's face beamed and lit up like mountain aglow in the rising sunlight as she heard Maria's praise. \u201cThank... Thank you, my leader!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I believe now is the time to settle some more official matters... Vanessa, I will require you here  at my side. Laurie, Sarah, you are dismissed, you can take the day off. Take your slaves with you; I'll have some agents help you carry them if they're still unconscious.\u201d Maria commanded, walking over to a door on the other side of the room, waving for Vanessa to follow her, which she did. \u201cYes! Certainly! Thank you!\u201d Sarah bellowed loudly and Laurie spoke \u201cUnderstood. Thank you.\u201d and gave a dutiful little salute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen both of their new agents were gone, Maria and Vanessa walked into a large, fancy looking office room, the official office of the SSS leader, now belonging to Maria. Maria took a seat on her side of the massive desk there and gestured for Vanessa to take hers on the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, with those pleasantries out of the way... I believe we have some things to settle regarding your future position...\u201d </span></div></div>",

All enemies shattered, their cities occupied, all who opposed them crushed, their dead; silent. With no real other superpower to stand in their way, it took little effort for the Stenchlandian troops and their government to easily subdue anyone who would dare stand in their path. And after the world had seen how Equmria had fared after launching their unsuccessful resistance, most of the other Nations preferred to be annexed peacefully. With lightning speed, the Stenchlandian forces then spread out and stationed themselves everywhere, making sure that peace was well-kept, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several smaller uprisings here and there, but nothing nearly the size of what Vanessa's rebellion had been. And now, not only had already overwhelmingly strong Stenchlandia grown even more powerful, but they also had their former most dangerous enemy at their side, working for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ever ambitious Maria had taken total control of everything shortly after her return to the capital following the last mission, commanding both the Military as well as the Secret Services personally and with frightening efficiency. Her days of field work were done and she spent most of her days behind the desk of some command center, overseeing things, giving out orders and punishing those who she felt like had disappointed her. With all that power in her hands, Maria had grown even more megalomaniacal than she had always been by nature, truly and eagerly striving for world domination and ruling over those beneath her with an iron fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon found the fitting place for Vanessa as well; using her as her personal secretary and advisor on various things, reaching from espionage to military strategies. Vanessa knew quite many things and it would have been a waste not to make use of that, especially since she was the only person who had ever managed to resist the might and cunning of Maria, if only for a short time. But even now, Maria was wary and suspicious about many things, almost a little paranoid. Mostly about people who just maybe had the chance to try any kind of betrayal and especially about Vanessa, since she had pulled that off successfully  before. Because of that, giving her any position with real power was completely out of the question for Maria; Maria also didn't dare letting Vanessa out of her sight for even one day, lest she disappear and hide somewhere for a while before rallying some allies again, as she had done in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose fears of Maria were absolutely needless, since anything like that did not even cross Vanessa's mind in her wildest dreams anymore, nowadays... She had put everything she had into her rebellion and her struggle against Maria and her SSS and after she had been so utterly beaten, with everything she had possessed ripped away from her, even her best comrade, she simply wouldn't have the heart to try anew, even if she had the chance. Besides, after what had happened with Lysander, Vanessa would have never trusted anyone enough to work together with them, at this point... So she simply kept silent and mostly ignored the things going on around her, she did obey Maria and her commands, but she didn't really care for anything right now; if the world wouldn't allow her to save it, then it might as well chafe under the iron shackles of this blasted new government as well, as far as Vanessa was concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slave marked thrived under this new rule and Maria quickly built something of a little slave harem for herself, consisting of almost hundred footslaves, most of them men but some females as well. Maria had thought it to be an especially thoughtful act to offer a special slave to Vanessa as well - it was actually just a girl who looked pretty similiar to how Felicia had been - but Vanessa was so appaled by that idea that she brashly refused the idea to own any slaves whatsoever. However, shooting a refusal in Maria's face was not the wisest idea, especially now in her mad rush for unlimited power, so Maria's answer was as swift as it was cruel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you refuse? Why, I must question whether or not you truly understand what this nation stands for and perhaps even your position...\" Maria had spoken with indignity \" However... it might just be that you need some time to think. Very well. I shall ask you now, and you will answer me in a week. If you speak before that, I will take it as the unfavourable answer. So... Which position do you prefer... This one?\" She swiftly grabbed one of her slaves by the neck and forced his face against Vanessa's boot-clad feet, him shivering with fear. \"Or... that one??\" Without any warning, Maria seized Vanessa by her hair and forced her down on the ground in front of her, pressing her large, stinking foot right in her face. As usual, it was hot, moist with sweat and reeking absolutely ungodly... Vanessa had smelled Maria's foot often before at that point, however... That was simply one kind of smell nobody could really get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Maria went even further than that. Rubbing her ungodly reeking feet in some subordinate's face to keep them in line was not uncommon for her - or other higher-ranking officials nowadays - but with Vanessa, Maria wanted to be as sure as she could only be. That's why she took Vanessa home with her and kept her locked up in her house as her most personal slave, for an entire week. This was the week that would change Vanessa's innermost core for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had made it very clear that after that week, Vanessa would make her choice: Either absolute obedience and loyalty to whatever Maria asked of her or she would make that week last forever. And that week was a living nightmare for Vanessa, it was the worst place for any slave in Stenchlandia: Being at the mercy of Maria's feet. At first, Vanessa had been surprised, yes, even shocked that Maria would go so far, even now, with all that Vanessa had done and was still capable of doing... But then it dawned on her. Maria simply didn't need her anymore. She was really good, yes, but at a time like this, even she could be replaced. And if she didn't gratefully accept whatever was given to her, well, the alternative was clear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor that entire week, Maria spared no expenses to make her feet as unbarable as possible, which was an easy feat for her anyway. She just worked and ran around in her boots and SSS Nylons as usual, only for that week, she never washed her feet even once. Every evening after she returned from home, she had Vanessa sniff both her boots and her nylon-clad feet directly for an hour, she had her rub and massage them for a while later on and during the night, she taped Vanessa's mouth shut and tied one of her boots over her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay after day, the smell of Maria's feet got worse and worse and Vanessa had more than enough time to think about her situation: Either swallow her pride and everything she once stood for good, turn around completely and just do some damn, good old work somewhere... Or be a lowly footslave, having to endure this every day, for the rest of her life. It was really not much of a choice. For the last night, Maria tried something a little different, tying Vanessa up in her bed and placing both of her feet on her face for the entierity of the night, with Vanessa's mouth securely shut, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when then night was over and Maria woke up, she pulled a horrible looking Vanessa from out of her bed, threw her on the ground beneath her and raised one foot threateningly. \"Well now, the week is over. Now you may answer. Do you choose the place right at my side... Or the place under my foot?\" \"I choose the place at your side! I will do as you command, now and always!\" Vanessa cried out, earnestly meaning it. Maria smiled and retracted her foot, reaching out with her hand and pulling Vanessa up. \"It's glad to see you came to your senses. Sometimes you just need to put your foot down, you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Vanessa became as loyal and eager as any follower could ever be, matching even the likes of Lara or Sarah. She knew that looking back at the past now would only serve in her downfall now, so she bit on and worked as hard as she could every day, something which pleased Maria greatly to see. Vanessa also accepted her gift of slaves, and the Felicia-like slave as well. All of Vanessa's former kindness was gone at this point, she treated most of her slaves relatively well - similar how most people would treat an animal, at least - caring quite well for them and only punishing them when she saw it fit, but that Felicia slave was an exception. Her appearance and sheer similarity drove Vanessa angry every time and she gave that poor girl various punishments almost daily, for no particular reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Vanessa had truly become one of them. One of which had once been her greatest enemy. Everything was to become a part of Stenchlandia now, and Vanessa had become a part of it, indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>Glory to Stenchlandia!</b></font></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright... this is it! All or nothing... Make it count!\" Vanessa whispered, looking at the troops around her. Felicia was just by her side as well, as always. She gave a smirk and a wink to Vanessa as she was glancing over to her, taking a deep last breath. \"Alright, move out!\" And with that, they began their move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Vanessa had frantically begun her planning, not more than one hour had passed. Now, the sky was pleasantly dark, everything growing dim and fuzzy as night was just about to set in. Vanessa had a small team make a feint move, pretending to flee in the most obvious direction. As some of the Stenchlandian forces went to pursue, still cautious, another team launched an attack to them from the opposite side... Yet that was just another distraction, turning their attention away from the main bulk of Vanessa's forces. Unfortunately, Vanessa's host still met with some resistance on their way, but their numbers were few and their units not expecting such a sudden, heated rush that they were simply overwhelmed by sheer numbers. It barely cost them any time and after that, Vanessa and her small army basically kept running towards the city. And in no time, the capital did indeed come into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the main city of Stenchlandia couldn't simply be entered like most any other city. Because they did initially have a lot of trouble with just about anybody not sharing their ideals, the officials of Stenchlandia ordered a large concrete wall erected all around the borders of the city, complete with barbed wire on top, not unlike what one'd expect from a military base, or prison. Because of that, several gates were present, usually always well-guarded. They were large enough so that even huge transporters and busses could fit through, but they were few in number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of that, Vanessa had no other choice than to target the nearest of these opening points for her reckless assault. As they reached it, they did find several guards standing there... However, those managed to put up very little resistance against the brute force of an entire army. Before she knew it, Vanessa was through, leading her cheering and shouting troops further into the heart of the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, everything went horribly wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick! Get the highest ranking officer you can find! I have... I have-\" \"Whoa, whoa, slow down.\" Maria said, waving one hand in front of one particularly exhausted looking courier girl, who had just arrived at the arena. \"Ahh, you're the famous Maria, aren't you?\" \"The one and only. So, what is so urgent? Our breaks in the tournament are quite strictly timed, you know...\" \"I'm afraid we have bigger problems than that now, Ma'am!\" Now Maria's interest was piqued. \"Ohh?\" \"I'm afraid I have terrible news, Ma'am! A huge mob of hostiles has just broken through one of our gates... The capital is under attack! We believe those damn Equmrians are to blame... But, we must act now! We got to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, slow down.\" Maria interrupted, crossing her arms and smiling smugly. After the courier kept quiet for a few seconds, Maria continued. \"Tell me... Did they come through the south-eastern gate Number three?\" \"I- Precisely that one! How did you-\" \"Well, it was the one closest to them. Hmmm... Surely they think time's against them now and that every second counts. They're not wrong on that one, actually. However... They most likely think they can just waltz in here just because I am away. Heh... Hehehe!\" Maria began laughing loudly, wildly, even. The courier took one nervous step back. \"Wait, do you mean... You anticipated this?\" \"Hahaha, more like I hoped they would be as desperate as to try something rash! That Vanessa of them... supposedly brilliant strategist, I've heard them call her... I'm almost disappointed, really.\" The courier raised one eyebrow. \"With all due respect... What do you mean? The enemy breached our defences and is charging straight at our heart!\" At that, Maria only chuckled. \"Oh, just wait and see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go, go, GO!\" Vanessa screamed, leading her troops like a true commander. \"If I'm not wrong, their headquarters should be just ahead! Take that one, and they'll all crumble!\" She herself, just like most of her followers were absolutely restless right now, warmed up by their running and eager for the final battle, ready and confident to take on their enemies. However, they hadn't been prepared for what was lying in front of them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere seconds after Vanessa, Felicia and the largest chunk of their host had charged into an open plaza, aiming for the other side, a heavy, iron gate suddenly smashed down on the direct way through, in front of them. \"What the- Never mind! Just go around it!\" Vanessa exclaimed. The only other way out was all the way back, but it would have to do. Or so she thought. The very next instant, several loud, troubling sounds were heard, coming from above. Just as Vanessa and her people raised their heads, a large number - at least two dozen - of S.T.I.N.K. machines came into view, being raised onto the rooftops from hidden spaces inside the buildings. Even worse, they came completely loaded and with masked women ready to operate them! \"Prepare to run out the guns!\" Someone commanded from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! No, no, NO! Where are the masks? We need to-\" Vanessa began, but her panicked screams where quickly drowned under a violent scream of \"On my command... <b><i>FIRE!</i></b>\" A short series of loud cracks... And then a terrible, sharp hissing sound filled the air! Everybody down could just watch in horror as the noxious cloud of the combined force of thousands of sweaty socks and old, used nylons came crushing down on the unfortunate soldiers beneath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Death to the Equmrians! And death to the LTFK!\" The voice from above shrieked just as the toxic vapours reached the ground. Instantly, all hell broke lose. \"<b><i>FALL BAAAAAAAACK!</i></b>\" Vanessa screamed at the top of her lungs, watching in disbelief as her army of ready, disciplined soldiers broke down into a mindless heap of scared, running humans in mere seconds. However, it was too late even for running. The stench came smashing down on them all like an avalanche. The ones that breathed it in directly almost entirely fell to the ground instantly, and even the ones holding their breath and covering their faces with their own clothing didn't last long. Vanessa could feel all hope fading as people left and right to her began clutching their throats and tumbling to the ground every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she realised she had been holding her breath the entire time. Vanessa squint her eyes and took a little air in between her clenched teeth... It didn't matter; she might as well have sniffed feet as smelly as Maria's directly from the toes. The thick, nauseating stench rushed to her nose and before Vanessa could even think about actually running, she found herself down on her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA laboured cough left her mouth, only to be re-filled with more miasma of pure foot-stink. <i>It's over.... No escape... For any of us!</i> That was the last thing Vanessa thought before she slumped down on the ground, all her limbs growing impossibly heavy. She thought she saw several high, feminine figures, clad in gleaming black leather and with gas masks looming over herself before everything went black for good... But it might as well have been a hallucination.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa woke with a start as a splash of cold water hit her in the face. She shook her head to clear her vision and found herself looking up on a group of uniformed women. A gleaming, silver SSS insigna could be seen on each of them and standing right in the middle was the one person Vanessa had been hunting this entire time, yet now she couldn't think of a single thing she dreaded more to see:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria!\" She barked, trying to get up. Vanessa realised too late that both her wrists and ankles had been bound together and came crashing back down on her back after she barely managed to lift herself up a few centimetres. \"Vanessa...\" The intimidating, leather-clad woman in front of her said softly and in a strangely quiet tone, before slowly walking towards her. \"Well, I'll be! I've never seen a single person waking up this swiftly after a direct S.T.I.N.K. hit. Never mind the fact that this one here was hit by multiple, from all directions...\" Someone from the back, whom Vanessa couldn't clearly make out mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, this is the famous Vanessa, alright!\" Maria said, not taking her eyes off her prey as she stalked towards Vanessa in slow steps. Now that everybody else was quiet, the only sounds to be heard were the frantic breathing of the bound Vanessa and a squishy, soaking sound from every step that Maria took. \"Her regeneration does seem pretty amazing, it's just a shame it won't do her much good against these binds.\" Vanessa gave an angry growl and fought against the ropes binding her tightly, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spotted another figure lying on the floor not too far from her. Vanessa squint her eyes. \"Felicia!\" This only caused Maria to laugh loudly. \"Yes, we've got your little friend as well.\" Vanessa cursed silently. If anybody could have gotten out of that deathtrap that brought herself into this, it would have been that crazy girl. If they got even her... Who would come rushing to their rescue now? \"As you see, waking her up didn't quite work so well...\" Maria said with a frown, pointing at several empty buckets. \"But hey!\" Maria clapped her hands and her eyes practically shone as the broadest grin ever began spreading across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This means I can turn all of my attention to you!\" Maria said, rubbing her hands. \"Well, I'm all ears...\" Vanessa added dryly. \"Oh, you'll be more than just <i>ears</i>. Hoo boy, where do I even begin? You know, this little <i>war</i> of yours... I'd like to call it a <i>dishonourable peasant uprising</i> at best... Your rebellion had actually been the first thing to threaten our glorious nation in a long time! It was the first and only of its kind, too! And all this time, you had been a thorn in my side... <i>YOU</i>! The one who started it all, the one who kept leading those rats, the one who always managed to escape her <b><i>righteouss punishment</i></b> all the time! Finally getting you was almost as big a goal to me as was ending this entire conflict!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria, having gotten quite heated there, took a moment to calm down. Then she clapped her hands softly. \"And now you just come here. Right at my feet, just like that. I didn't even need to lift a finger. Do you have any idea how great this is?\" Vanessa growled and kept squirming against her binds. <i>I'll have to think of something, anything... Come on, come on, something!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I always wanted my own footslave. Our nation has quite some of those, but they are expensive and somewhat luxurious so only the wealthy can have one... Heh, although this may change with us catching an entire army of worthless vermin! But I digress...\" Having finally reached her, Maria knelt down to Vanessa, poking her in the face with her finger. \"You! You would make the ultimate prize for me. From this very beginning, I was thinking that would be the ultimate punishment for you! Heck, even more than just punishment. It would give you a place where you belong.\" Maria suddenly jumped back up, clenching her fists and apparently suppressing a very uncharacteristic fit of giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now you're here! All ready and wrapped up for me! Ohhh man, it's Christmas!\" Maria exclaimed, dropping back down beneath the bound Vanessa. \"Yes... I will make you experience every last bit my feet have to offer. And you'll take it day after day, until you finally accept it. You're mine now, Vanessa. Mine.\" Maria then proceeded to drop down onto the tied Vanessa suddenly, getting her feet ready to unleash hell upon her victim! As Vanessa groaned, having to endure to weight of Maria on top of her now, the latter was already fumbling around with the lacing of her boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, and you picked a really nice time for this, as well. You know, what with getting my feet ready to stand against the worst of this country and still emerge as the winner... Now you will get to taste the fruits of my effort! Enjoy... Because you'll get a lot of that in the near future!\" After yelling that, Maria managed to pull one of her thick, gleaming black leather boots off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench that wafted off of Maria's foot instantly was easily the strongest smelling foot aroma that had ever been presented to Vanessa, or pretty much anybody in the room. An incredibly thick, musky smell of well-aged cheese together with an acrid aroma of salty sweat and sour vinegar smashed through the entire room, strong enough that every one of Maria's henchwomen took a step back, covering their faces. \"Ohhh yeah... This is... This is a whole new level!\" Maria said as the choking fumes of her wet, deadly feet began to affect even herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was, of course, much worse off. The huge, glistening wet sole of Maria's foot was directly above her face now, dripping its sweat slowly down everywhere. Up until now, she had managed to hold her breath... But it wouldn't be long now. Vanessa's face reddened in a final, desperate struggle. Maria watched her in light amusement as she fought in vain against her bonds, squirming to each side like a worm, unable to free herself or throw Maria off. Maria gave a small chuckle as she finally had enough of this and simply let her foot drop down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweaty, hot sole of her huge, wet foot hit Vanessa squarely in the face. The plush softness of these feet were absolutely amazing, it almost seemed as if Maria's sole was sucking Vanessa's face in! The wet, heavy impact also caused Vanessa to hiss out the last of her stored air... And to make things worse, Maria now pushed her heel hard against Vanessa's lips, pressing the greasy sole of her foot directly against her nose. With no other way to breathe in, Vanessa was finally forced to sniff these deadly feet directly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa took a deep whiff directly from Maria's sweat-dripping footsole... And instantly, her entire body began to buckle and spasm in disgusted agony as the most intense, cheesy aroma of sweat and unwashed feet ever was blasting through her nostrils at point-blank range! Even Maria found herself slighty shaking up and down as the girl beneath her tried everything in her mind to get out of that situation. Soon enough, another sniff from Vanessa followed, poisoning herself further with the strongest stench Maria's feet had to offer. Suddenly, Vanessa managed to shake her head free for a moment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Agh... Stop this! I can- *Hmmmpffff*\" Vanessa's short plea was cut down by Maria pressing her second foot, which she had just pulled out of her other boot, directly onto her opened mouth, sealing it tightly. \"Shhh, now. I want to hear your suffering.\" Maria whispered licking her lips, as she wiggled her long, slimy toes, which were covering Vanessa's nose entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was forced to take another sniff. And then another. And then another. The endless, overwhelming stench of Maria's sweaty, hot, wet toes seemed to intensify every second and soon, Vanessa's senses were so overtaken by the feet held in her face that she herself couldn't even tell anymore if she was still futily struggling with all her might or if that had already died down. The huge, meaty mass of moist sole in front of her eyes grew into a blurry, dark mass as well and soon enough, every sound became a faint, distant humming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>These feet... I just... Can't... take it!</i> Vanessa thought, having to breathe in once again and finally knocking herself out for good. Maria cheered as she saw Vanessa's body go limp beneath her and took the opportunity to rub her feet into Vanessa's unconscious face one last time, making it shine with her reeking footsweat. \"Damn, that felt good. Oh well... I guess we best get these two up and going. I'm sure there's <i>someone </i> who'd like to see them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Vanessa woke up again, the first thing she realised was that she was bound into an incredibly uncomfortable position. Like so many times before, she could not move at all, no matter how hard she tried. Next, she realised that it was extremely loud. It seemed as if a thousand voices were shouting all at once... However, one of them rang out much louder than the others. \"<i>...finally where they belong...</i> <i>...an end to this sickening impudence!</i> <i>... awaited <b>justice!</b></i>\" Vanessa groaned faintly. This voice... was as familiar as it was unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SMACK!</b> A fiery pain in her cheek suddenly jolted up Vanessa for good. She opened her eyes and sure enough, a triumphant looking Maria was standing proudly in front of her. \"Aaaaaaaand our special guest is awake as well! Say hello to the <i>brilliant</i> and <i>powerful</i> Vanessa! Hahaha!\" Vanessa groaned and took a look around, as far as it was possible. Both her arms and legs were tied to a slender pole, which was basically holding her up, but not in a very pleasant way. She seemed to be on some sort of podium, and beneath was a huge crowd of women. Some of them seemed to be soldiers and SSS agents even, although most of them appeared to be regular citizens. And sure enough, they all seemed to be very pleased to see Vanessa up there, all tied up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, Vanessa soon spotted another person up next to her as well. \"Felicia!\" She exclaimed without thinking. Maria began to laugh for a bit. \"Hahaha, yes, like last time, she's here as well. She also seems almost waken up now... Hey, you. Wake up. Come on.\" Maria proceeded to slap her bound victim across the face a few times. Vanessa couldn't help but flinch with every impact. Finally and with a loud shriek, Felicia awoke. \"Aaaaagh! What... What's going on? Vanessa?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! Well, it seems both of our big shots are with us now! Well, well, well... I say let the show begin!\" Maria cheered, clapping her hands and striding up and down. Felicia fought against her binds desperately, while Vanessa focused on staring at Maria with all of her anger, a small growl leaving her rattling jaw. \"Ah, just a moment, my dear Maria...\" Another voice suddenly mixed itself in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Whoever wishes to interrupt this- Oh! Ohhh! Amber! Please excuse me!\" Maria shot with a surprised jump and promptly saluted as her superior came flying on the stage. Well, almost flying; from wherever she had jumped off, it must have been pretty high. \"Greetings, Maria! Ohhh, there is simply <i>no way</i> I would miss something as fantastic as this! After all, this is what we had all been waiting for! Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber suddenly clenched her raised fist tightly for a few seconds, all the while keeping her eyes shut. Maria looked as if she wanted to say something... but then decided not to interrupt right now. \"<i><b>YES!!!</b></i>\" Amber thundered, taking a big step forward. \"This will be a marvellous example to all! First and foremost to our own fine nation and of course also to other places, like... Equmria, just for instance. This! Is what will happen if you decide to deny the righteousness of our cause. This is what will happen if you try to fight us! This is how you will end up!\" Amber turned around dramatically and pointed at Vanessa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria shot a quick glance behind her shoulder. Surely enough, the cameras were running. Without a doubt, this spectacle here would be sent all across the country, live. Even though her superior had kind of stolen her show, at least she was doing a good job with it. \"Brought before us in the chains you had so selfishly woven for yourselves! Defeated by your own crazy and treacherous ambitions! But you will learn your place yet... You, and all the insignificant little vermin that had been flocking you like the rats they are!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria perked up and strode up to Amber quickly. \"I actually have something planned for just this moment.\" She whispered in Amber's ear. \"Ohhhh... by all means, go ahead with it, then.\" Maria gave a quick nod and cleared her throat. Amber took a step back politely while Maria took the front now. \"Yes! Your little followers! Bring them forth! Show your leader first-hand what she had brought upon you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria gave a grand wave of her arm as a group of Elite SSS agents cleared the path directly beneath the stage. Vanessa's heart almost stopped as she watched a trail of people being pushed into the open. All of them were stripped down to their underwear, and many of them seemed bruised, beaten and absolutely exhausted. It was no big secret who these people were, exactly. Yet Maria chose to tell either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These! These are your loyal followers now! Don't you feel good for them now, Vanessa? Does it feel great to be the one responsible for their fate?\" Maria said, staring at Vanessa with gleaming eyes and a broad, evil grin. Vanessa couldn't even bring herself to glare back angrily at her. She was too aghast from looking at the people beneath. As if on cue, the crowd all around them began to laugh and whistle at them, some hurled insults, others outright spat at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa ground her teeth in desperation, giving her bindings a good tuck. <i>Damnit... I can't do a thing!</i> \"Stop this nonsense, Maria!\" She demanded, summoning all her remaining strength. \"You have won, alright? This here is proving nothing!\" \"Wahahahahaaaaa!\" Maria's laugh was slightly over the top, even for her. \"My, isn't it cute! Even at the very end, Vanessa tries to protect the ones beneath her. How nice! It's only a shame that it won't bring them much... Listen to me, my fine ladies! Makes these vermin suffer!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria gave another sign and Vanessa began to sweat bullets as she watched almost every single one of the women beneath reaching down to take off their shoes. Within seconds, the air became tainted with a horrible, cheesy scent of sweaty, unwashed feet. The imprisoned followers of Vanessa shivered in horror as hundreds, if not thousands of old, sweaty socks and nylons were suddenly flung onto and all over them. Even further up, Vanessa felt her eyes beginning to tear up as the sharp fumes of unwashed feet began to reach her... Being forced to watch her loyal followers suffer like that smashed Vanessa's heart to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria on the other hand, seemed to be almost in a wild ecstasy of joy as she watched the gruesome scene unfold. \"Hahaha, yes, that's it! Smell the very best Stenchlandia has to offer! Does it feel nice? You better learn to like it, since this is all you'll ever smell for the rest of your lives! Haha, oh yes... Aren't you all glad you had such a competent leader?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Vanessa's horror, some of the people beneath did turn to face her. \"It's not your fault, Vanessa. Each of us did all we could, and so did- Hmmmpfff!\" One man began to speak, before an especially well-soaked gym sock hit him squarely in the face, spattering sweat all around. \"We don't blame you, so please... don't blame yourself... agghhh\" Another one began, before they were silenced in a similar fashion. None of them seemed to be angry at her, yet Vanessa couldn't help but feel like each of their words were an icy dagger through her heart. \"Stop it... please, stop it...\" She whimpered, feeling hot tears run down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria noticed that and looked downright surprised for a moment. \"Heh, I guess that worked nicely.\" She said with a wry smirk, patting Vanessa on her moist cheek. \"Alright, let's get this over. Knock them out, but be gentle about it. I won't have any perfectly able footslaves injured for no reason...\" Maria concluded, crossing her arms as she glanced down. Vanessa had to watch as well as the crowd slowly came closer to their prey and before they knew it, each of them had at least one foot planted firmy on their faces. Some were bare, some in nylons or socks, but without a doubt, most of them were well-sweaty and reeking to high heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral SSS members were hard at work carrying the unconscious people away at all times and before they knew it, the place was completely empty again, safe for all the Stenchlandians. \"Marvellous. Well, if that hadn't been a magnificent sight, then I don't know.\" Amber spoke up, stepping forward again. \"I'm sure you will be all happy to hear that the prices for personal footslaves will decrease drastically in the near future. All of those traitors will be for sale. Well... maybe not all of them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber chuckled darkly and strode to Felicia, whose eyes shot left and right in blind panic. \"I think I will claim you as my little pet. I think you should consider yourself lucky, your high position in this little peasant revolt has rewarded you with the smelliest feet of this entire country... For every single day of your remaining, miserable life.\" \"Heh, you mean the second smelliest feet, right?\" Maria shot at Amber with a wink. \"We'll settle that at the next tournament. Well, be that as it may, one thing is for certain and that is that ONE of you will get the worst feet...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber grinned as Maria walked up to Vanessa now. \"...no way I'd ever let somebody else claim you, my sweet little Vanessa...\" She whispered, licking her lips. Vanessa tried to keep a brave face, but could feel it failing as she went. <i>There's nothing to do! Nobody to help us... Oh dear god no... Please, no!</i> But at least she remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia failed to show that much dignity. \"No! No, no, no! Please don't do that! Vanessa! Help me!\" Vanessa met Felicia's desperate, pleading eyes with a cold, empty stare of herself, which caused her to break down completely. Amber only chuckled at that. \"Well, no reason to listen to your wailing. Good night!\" With lightning speed, Amber removed her black leather boot and pressed the opening tightly against Felicia's face. Her mouth shot open, but was promptly held shut by Amber's hand. \"Sniff now...\" She whispered, stroking Felicia's hair. Felicia didn't have much of a choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in a terrified, deep sniff caused by her unsteady hysteria, Felicia filled her lungs to the brim with the incredibly thick, cheesy and sour stench from inside Amber's boot!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amber giggled lightly as she watched Felicia turn her head to the left and right, trying desperately to get away in any way. \"Now, now... Smell it good...\" Amber said, adjusting her grip on Felicia. Felicia was of course forced to take another whiff of the inside of Amber's sweat-stained boots and felt her entire body spasm at the intensity of the stench. \"My, my, if you think this is bad, just wait until I make you smell my feet directly...  In fact... why wait?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber jumped back from Felicia, who instantly slumped forward, coughing and gagging like someone who had almost drowned. Amber kept her one bare foot raised in the air, as not to waste the sweat. Everybody was staring at that magnificent foot, not only was the size absolutely terrifying, but it was so well-shaped and flawlessly smooth that one could simply not help but look. The crazy amounts of sweat present on it were not easily overlooked, either, as was the brutal stench that waved around as she held it, making everybody in the crowd, and even Maria take a small step back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, does anybody got a pair of nice, smelly socks for me?\" Amber demanded, holding out her hand. Sure enough, within seconds, several socks were flying at her and Amber nimbly catched one that was so soaked with sweat that it landed in her hand with a damp, wet pap. \"Ohhh, this will do nicely! Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber turned around and was at Felicia again. \"Now, say ahhhhhhhh!\" She said, waving the sweaty, reeking sock directly in Felicia's face. \"Uuuuughhh... Please... please stop- Hmmmmmpppffff!\" Not wasting any time, Amber simply shoved the nasty, wet sock in Felicia's partly-opened mouth. \"There goes! Tasting good, hmm?\" Amber teased, watching in glee as Felicia's eyes began to roll around and her limbs began to twitch as the twisted aroma of these old, unwashed socks began to spread in her entire mouth. \"Now for the main event...\" Amber said, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took hold of Felicia's shoulders for support and then brought her naked, dripping wet foot up to her head, her slick, hot sole slapping directly over her face. With her mouth full, Felicia had no choice but to sniff instantly... And blast her nose with the strongest footsmell she had ever known! The very first breathe was enough to make a bright light shine in front of her shut eyes and block out every sense for a moment, only this overpowering, cheesy, sour stench of sweaty feet to be felt. As she recovered from the first shock, Felicia tried to scream out in panic. \"Hmmmmpphhh... Mmmmrrrghhh!\" \"Ohhh, listen to her sing! Isn't it lovely?\" Amber laughed, and rewarded Felicia's voice by slowly rubbing her huge foot up and down her face, smearing her warm sweat all over it. Finally, she placed her toes all around Felicia's nose and simply waited patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next sniff was too much for Felicia. With a horrible groan, she sniffed the stench from between Amber's toes and instantly blacked out. Amber put her foot back down, smiled and turned to Maria. \"Well, that certainly had been fun. I almost forgot how fun it is to introduce a new footslave to my feet...\" Maria smiled, nodded and then turned to Vanessa. \"Well, this is the end. After this, you will officially be my slave.\" Vanessa managed an annoyed grunt at least. \"Just get this over with, alright?\" Maria chuckled as she was already getting one foot free. \"Ohh, but I do expect a little more from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next second, Maria's huge, hot foot was slapped in Vanessa's face, instantly covering it with her hot, acrid sweat. Even though Vanessa hadn't breathed in yet, the incredibly foul, cheesy scent of her feet was making its way into her nostrils even now. \"I want you to kiss it. Kiss my foot.\" Maria commanded. Vanessa somehow managed to summon all her defiance. \"Never! Fuck you!\" Maria <i>tsked</i> and instantly shot her foot forward a bit, her ball closely pressed against Vanessa's lips and her toes clenching her nose shut. \"Oh no, that's the wrong answer.\" Maria laughed as she watched Vanessa twist and turn her head around, trying to break free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria continued to smother Vanessa with her bare foot until she turned blue. Finally, as she let go again, Vanessa instinctively took a hasty series of deep, long breaths... Which smashed her with the full strenght of Maria's footsmell! \"Well now, will you kiss my foot, or do I have to do this again? I have a lot of time, you know...\" Vanessa groaned miserably. <i>Why even keep up fighting? There's no way out...</i> Clenching her eyes shut, she leaned forward and gave the sweaty, soft sole of Maria's foot the quickest little kiss. \"Ahh, come on! You can do better than that!\" Maria yelled, slapping Vanessa across the face with her broad, wet sole, leaving a trail of sweat all across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa cursed, before she leaned forward to kiss Maria's foot once more. As if she overpowering stench of her foot wasn't enough, the humiliation alone was driving tears into her eyes again. \"Good. Good... Now lick it.\" Vanessa pulled her head back as far as her space allowed and simply looked at Maria's face with pure desperation. Maria's eyes were cold as stone as she gazed back, before slapping Vanessa across her face once more. \"I said lick it! At least be a good slave, you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa finally broke down completely. All her defiance, her hopes left her as she leaned her head forward, stuck out her tongue and gave a long, hard lick all across Maria's long, hot and absolutely wet footsole. <i>It's truly over now... Look at me... Publicy licking the smelly feet of my enemy... Now life has killed the dreams I dreamed...</i> Vanessa thought as she broke down in heavy sobs, licking Maria's smelly foot up and down. The sharp, sweaty taste of her reeking soles was enough to make Vanessa's stomach turn and if that wasn't enough, she was constantly getting blasted with the extreme stench of her foot as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa couldn't even tell for how long this had been going on, or when it finally ended. It didn't even mind, because the horrid smell and taste of Maria's feet would be the center of her life from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, in a not-so distant land to the east, a man clad in a fine suit was walking up and down his office nervously, when suddenly a man came storming in. \"Sir! We have... I'm afraid we have terrible news, Sir!\" Lysander swallowed heavily and turned around. \"Is it about the attack?\" The other man visibly shrunk under Lysander's demanding gaze. \"I... I am afraid so... Just... just look at this...\" The man handed him a newspaper. It seemed to be some kind of Stenchlandian one, which would usually mean that the contents could be just propaganda in their favour, but in this case...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>REBELLION CRUSHED!!!</b></i> <b>The recent uprising, led by a local girl and possibly with the help of foreign forces has finally come to an end as the enemy was completely overwhelmed within the walls of our fine city! According to local...</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander didn't read further, but instead looked at the photograph directly beneath the text for a moment. It showed a crowd of half-naked people getting flocked by what seemed to be... socks and nylons, while two people, most likely women were tied up on poles on the background. \"These two... Could they be-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that very moment, the door flew open again and Joe stormed in. \"Lysander! I have terrible, terrible news!\" He yelled. \"Yes... I already know...\" Lysander responded weakly. Joe ran up to him, shot a glance at the newspaper and then shook his head. \"I'm afraid it's even worse. Please... I know it won't be pretty, but please look at this.\" Lysander turned to Joe, who handed him a pitch black envelope. Lysander took it with shaking hands and slid it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a single photograph, it was a close shot of Vanessa, it was unmistakably her this time, who was licking a huge, disgusting foot, most likely Maria's. Written on the back was a simple \"You and your country will be next. -Maria\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander scrunched up his face and threw the piece of paper down on the ground. Joe took a moment to collect his thoughts before he began. \"This attack on their capital... I fear all we have done was waking up a sleeping giant. And now they'll be coming directly for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Lysander began, covering his face with one hand and swallowing hard. \"I'm afraid life is going to become a lot harder for us now, Joe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>With the great, zealous war of the combined forces of both Vanessa's rebels and Equmrians people come to a crushing defeat on one side, there was simply nobody left who dared to rise a finger against the absolute rule of the totalitarian Stenchlandian regime. With no one to stand in their way, they swiftly began expanding even faster, enslaving everybody who would stand in their way. A new dark era has descended upon the world.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">The end.</font></span></div></div>",

You had better have a good reason for interrupting my meeting with Agent Maria!\u201d Amber yelled, causing the young cadet to quake in her size ten boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgent Maria,\u201d Funkee stammered, her nose wrinkling at the damp smell of stale feet \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to inter-rupt, inter-, inter\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria almost felt sorry for the young lady, remembering when she\u2019d been the fresh face recruit, running errands all around the massive SSS complex. Looking at her beat up looking flats, and wiggling her sweat incased toes, she remembered how much her feet would smell after days of running back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSPEAK UP CADET, or I\u2019ll force you to speak up with my maldarous toes! We wouldn\u2019t want that, would we!?\u201d Amber yelled, causing passerbys to scurry past the open doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadet Funkee stood at attention, clicking her heels on cue. \u201cNo ma\u2019am, no!\u201d the cadet chimed in response. Maria and Amber both smiled at the response, and the swishing sound of foot sweat which emanated from the girls boots. Maybe this kid has a bright future yet, Maria thought with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cadet handed the TOP SECRET folder to Amber, who snatched with a flourish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably some more updates about the activities of those rabble rousing terrorists, Maria thought. Wiggling her toes in anticipation, she thought, What I\u2019d give to have a chance to wrap my toe jam encrusted toes around their lips\u2026.. I definitely \u201cstamp\u201d out their little resistance! I\u2019d DEFEET the resistance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCadet Funkee, please leave the room. Stay on call, because your services might be needed,\u201d Amber softly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria\u2019s eyebrow arched as Cadet Funkee sloshed her way out of the room, and closed the door behind her. From the tone in Amber\u2019s voice, Maria knew something was amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down at her desk now, Amber motioned for Maria to do the same, with a seriousness that Maria knew Amber only saved for the most serious of occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m about to discuss with you does not leave this room, is that understood Comrade?\u201d Amber said with a deathly serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nodded her agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointing to contents of the folder Amber stated \u201cWe are being invaded for our Stinky chemical weapon supply, by the Americans!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe audacity of those heathen\u2019s! Those men think they can take our weapons!\u201d Maria yelled, her itchy feet waiting for a chance to slap the face of those chauvinist males who sought to take their soverign right to rule their country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber shook her head, stating \u201cIt\u2019s not the men Comrade. They\u2019ve sent women.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria\u2019s O of surprise couldn\u2019t stop the biggest bombshell that was to be dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Comrade\u2026\u2026 they have come prepared to fight fire\u2026. with fire\u2026..,\u201d Amber whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean\u2026.\u201d Maria said fearing the answer\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStinky feet,\u201d Amber replied. \u201cThese women have the stinkiest feet in all of North America.

Do I need to bring anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust those pungent toes you\u2019ve got in those ratty looking boots!\u201d Maria replied causing the girl to blush furiously.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maria made it an active point to avoid this part of the city, as it represented for her the true failure of the toppled male regime. Within months, just watch, Maria thought, this area will be a true haven of respectability! The SSS will see to it that this hovel be torn to the ground, and risen anew, the agent thought as she and Cadet Funkee moved from doorway to doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo formed an impressive and imposing sight, Maria and the Cadet adorned in the traditional special ops SSS dress. Homeless men and women alike cowered in corners, and alleyways as the two slinked pass, inching ever closer to the hideout. They'd already connected with the three women SSS surveillance detail, who'd informed them that the Americans had not made a move since arriving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they'd asked if Maria and Funkee needed back up per Amber's instructions, Maria had playfully laughed them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think \"I\" need back up?\" she replied, slipping her large, and sweat caked foot out of her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she wiggled her green painted giant toenails in the air for the trio to see, Funkee was visibly having a difficult time breathing through her now covered nose. The three on the receiving end of the smelly tendrils of cheesy toe funk had been caught unawares, and were in a dire predicament. Who were they to suggest that a superior officer had horribly smelly feet? They'd all heard the stories of a newly minted cadet who had the unfortunate mishap of having covered her nose when Amber had removed her shoes at a briefing. Her sweat caked face, with flecks of toe jam was a  constant reminder from the lower ranked SSS members to take the funk with pluck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three had stood at attention, noses crinkling in unison, eyes watering at the slimy toe smell wafting from Maria's outstretched foot, replying \"No Ma'am!! No back up needed at all! Understood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had stuffed her foot back into her boot with a flourish, and resounding sweaty, wet plop. Grinning coyly at the trio, she'd said \"That's what I thought. Stay posted here in the SMALL off chance my assistant and I need any help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked away, the trio had breathed the fresh air as if it were the nectar of the gods, causing Maria to chuckle to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been then. Now silence had settled between the two as they made their way to the Americans hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your story, cadet?\" Maria said, breaking  Funkee from her thoughts about the battle to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, miss, what do you mean?\" Funkee meekly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are all of you new recruits so green?\" Maria replied with a hiss, stopping at a nearby corner. She held up a balled fist to stop the cadet, who almost plowed in to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your background, why did you join!?\" Maria said. \"I'd like to know who I'm bringing into a battle that might determine the direction of our country's future! Speak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n::Cue in blurry flashback effect with bad cut-away music::<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunkee began, with a wistful look, \"I remember like it was yesterday. You see, I've always been the meek type. Quiet, shy, reserved. Didn't have many friends in high school, which made it difficult in a place like that. So I had no one to watch my back. Which unfortunately meant..... I was ripe for the picking. Add to that, I've always had the unpleasant misfortune to have a pair of really odorous feet. No friends, smelly feet? It was quite bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For P.E I'd run into the room before the other girls got there, whip off my slimy, and sweaty yellow tinted knee high gym socks, and throw them in the trash. After wiping down my sweaty toes, well...... the smell would linger in the air in enough time for the other girls to come in and smell. They'd laugh, and point with their snooty rich judgmental temperaments. I'd fly out of the room, crying rivulets of tears, while on many an occasion, I left barefoot sweat prints on the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On my 18th birthday, the day occurred as it always had. I'd been bumped in the hallway. Ignored in the cafeteria. Laughed at in Home Ec. And then P.E. On this occasion, one particularly mean girl by the name of Heather, decided to up the ante. As I performed my daily ritual of running into the room early to clean my smelly toes, Heather and her crew were already there. Her father was one of the first minister's to fall during the revolution. I took a special delight in that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Heather steps in my face and yells \"God, your feet reek! Maybe I should do something about that!?\" I looked up, and maybe it was the combination of my birthday, and all of the slights that I'd incurred throughout the day, I responded, \"I think it might be your toe jam sticking out of those ugly feet of yours!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather's mouth opened in an \"O\" of surprise and the next thing I know, I felt a hard slap hit me out of nowhere. As I fell backwards onto the floor, Heather fell on top of me, landing blows wherever she could on my curled up body. The other girls had begun yelling for her to \"Shove those toes down her throat!\" and \"Show her who Toe Jam Toes is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With a burst of engery I didn't think I had, I rolled on top of Heather and slapped her with such a fierceness that the sound resounded across the locker room. Her friends instantly became quiet, maybe even sensing what was about to come. As Heather held her red welt with her widening shocked eyes I got an evil idea in my head. I remember my toes wiggling in anticipation about the crazy idea I'd gotten, and I knew it would seal my fate for the remainder of the school year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I grabbed both of Heather's shapely legs, noticing the sweaty ankles going inside her unsocked gym shoe clad foot. \"Someone's probably got some stinkkkkkyyyy feet, lame-o!\" I yelled as I held both of her feet. I yanked of her shoes quickly, and threw them at her friends, who dodged the smelly bombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I looked at the scared group with as menacing a glare as I could muster, and said \"Watch, and learn.\" I ripped Heather's socks off, and watched her dark blue nailed toes wiggle as she groggily shook of the effects of my slap. I took a whiff of those size 9's and almost fell back. Her friends watched in horror at what I did next, some even moaning in shock. Reaching down, I pulled of both my shoes, and slammed one maldarous piece of footwear over Heather's groggy mouth, hearing her gasping for air\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I then pulled off my own socks, and pulled the slimy, and crusty socks over Heather's own funky feet. She moaned something from the inside of the shoe, but I didn't hear it. I was too busy watching her toes and soles soaking up the foot sweat which she'd made fun of day in and day out. To this day I hear the combined funk has made her pair of feet some of the most disgusting in all the land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was after that, that I realized what I could do. It was after that, that I realized my feet had power. Old habits die hard, so I'm ever the studious bookworm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said the next line Maria shivered in anticipation of the punishment this young woman was set to dish out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My feet will ruin the lives of anyone who gets in my way. My sweat will be the last taste of freedom that these American swine will get to taste, \" Funkee said with a sadistic grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew there was a reason I'd chosen you, \" Maria replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the corner Maria informed Funkee, \"We're here.\"</span></div></div>",

For the umpteenth time she checked her watch nervously, hoping that she hadn't made the wrong decision to launch this mission. Gaining a foothold amongst the Stenchlandian rebels would've been a major foreign relations coup, and all without showing her nation's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven upon learning about the \"questionable\" torture tactics of the renegade SSS and the state police, Emily had been more than ready to lead her team into the thick of things, hoping that she could help the burgeoning rebellion gain the upperhand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr foot as it were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things aren't going to change, no matter how much you look at your watch sir,\" her second in command said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barbara, ever the realist,\" the nervous commander replied. \"It's getting late. She should've been here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll get here when she gets here sir,\" Barbara replied, planting her size 12's up on a nearby abandoned crate, as she sat by her commander. The brown skinned, afro puffed beauty knew her commanders moods, and this wasn't one of the good one's. She made it a point to try to calm the Midwest brunette during tense moments like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Barbara, I know,\" Emily said turning around with a grimace. \"It's just, the more time goes by, the more worried I am that we've been made. And you know what they do to enemies of the state over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara leaned forward with a sly grin in her eye responding, \"Yeah I've read the same reports. But the only way you do that is fight fire with fire. I want to come across one of those SSS gals. Let me have one minute with them, and they'll find out first hand about my \"secret weapons\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily watched as Barbara twirled one of her size 12's  with a smile, grateful that Barbara was on their side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, lets see how the other's are holding up,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara responded with frown, \"That's actually part of the reason I came to see you. I think they're getting restless. They're actually arguing over who has the rankest pair of feet. Friendly joking, but it's getting kind of heated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes Emily responded, \"Again? I thought that had been put to rest with the trip over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. You know we've got to nip this in the bud before, because those SSS girls will have our hides if we can't get some cohesiveness going,\" Barbara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two walked into the middle of the abandoned factory, the hushed but serious sound of arguing could be heard between Sally, Trinny, and Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puh-leeze girl,\" Lisa responded pointing at beat up looking pair of gym shoes. \"My feet stink like high hell. Just ask any of those punk asses that I used as a foot rest in LA.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith arms crossed, Trinny rolled her eyes, tapping her ratty looking ballet flats on the marble floor. The audible sound of foot sweat sloshed around, causing Lisa to gulp just a little at the fact that she might be outdone in the stink department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You finished little girl?\" Trinny replied. \"My stink has cleared entire stadiums. I'm talking Staples Areana. Seriously. Bottom half of the 4th. Lakers are down by 1 to the Celtics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin Trinny pointed at her flats, as Lisa fumed. \"I decided to air out the 'ole puppies, see what kind of havoc I could cause. Even wiggled my toes a bit, and I think some toe jam hit Jennifer Anniston on her cheek. First my section was cleared. Then the basketball floor. Then the stadium. I even left my flats there as a gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa yelled, \"THAT WAS YOU!? I HAD FLOOR TICKETS FOR THAT GAME! IT STUNK TO HIGH HELL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrinny smiled as she responded, \"Yup. Hey, a girl has to air these funkee dogs every once in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding her finger to her cheek in a thoughtful gesture, hoping to infuriate Lisa even more, Trinny added \"Now, I can't remember, did that smell have a vinegary tinge, or cheesy musk? It varies day by day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is pointless,\" Sally said from where she sat on a nearby crate. \"You little girls can keep going back and forth, but you both know my size 13's have this in the bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Trinny and Lisa responded with glares, \"Yeah right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a fact: You both have size 9's therefore less room to hold the needed \"ingredients\" for a fragrant foot funk: toe jam, foot sweat, calluses, and so forth,\" Sally said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, based on my massize sized feet, and the ability to store more pungent pockets of funk, I win by default,\" Sally finished with Chesire like grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa and Trinny both began a tirade, speaking one another, and only stopped with a loud whistle from Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We settle this here and now,\" Emily began sizing up each of the three ladies. \"Sit down next to one another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confused women did as told, warily watching each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of the three as Barbara watched Emily yelled \"Take off your shoes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach soldier reached down to their footwear, removing them with little effort. Trinny simply used one wide size 9 to remove the other flat, while Lisa and Sally pried their gym shoes with their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaced in front of her were the most glorious, and maldarous set of toes which America had to offer. The girls feet stuck to the floor with the accumulated sweat on the soles, leaving funky footprints in their wake. Trinny's toe nails were painted a dark black, which formed a contrast to the yellow toe jam stuck between her toes, while Sally's we're painted dark green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's toes were not painted, but the aged sweat on her feet had given her soles a yellow tinge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot funk wafting from the soldiers was a hard pill to swallow for Barbara and Emily. Barbara outright covered her nose while Emily fought through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I propose a smelly foot contest, judged by our second in command, Barbara,\". Emily began. \"After this you all focus on the enemy outside, rather than in here. Understand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chorus of \"yes sir\" came from the foul footed beauties, and a shocked, but laughing Barbara walked forward the unwashed feet of the soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A place where men and women were treated like equals. Until 2009, when the stock market crashed in the midst of financial speculation and corporate distrust. The economy followed in the same footsteps soon after. The government, seen as corrupt and sloppy by many, failed to appease the Stenchlandian citizens, including a majority of women who lost their jobs after the Big Crash of '09.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in the 1st of August of 2012, the National Feminist Liberation League seized control over the Stenchlandian State. After stripping the male gender from their former rights and enslaving all men over 16, the Council of Representatives of the newly-renamed Feminist Republic of Stenchlandia passed the infamous Bill 66, which allowed women to take any male (non)citizens as their lifelong footslaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur story begins a few years later, splitting into three possible points of view:<br>\r\n- From a 13 years old foot slave (Joe), relating your dutiful service to the feet of the female relatives - your sister Sarah, aged 17, light brown hair, quite hot and with stinky feet, and your 35 years old mother, Jessica, her daughter's older version but with yet smellier feet;<br>\r\n- From the eyes of a recently-graduated young woman named Anna who, refusing to adhere to the authoritarian principles of Stenchlandia, brings the State's unwanted and unforgivably foul attention upon herself;<br>\r\n- Or even from an adult SSS (Stenchlandian State Security) agent, responsible for enforcing the laws dictated by the Council of Representatives, most prominently the enslavement of the Male gender. Which, by the way, also includes interrogating male and female people alike with your personal biological weapon - your sweaty boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">Basic Rules</font><br>\r\n- Use a decent grammar / spelling / punctuation; otherwise, readers will have a bad time encrypting what you have written;<br>\r\n- No excessive violence (as in, extreme pain or blood is forbidden);<br>\r\n- No male-on-male stuff;<br>\r\n- No toilet or ass stuff, nor anything of a sexual nature;<br>\r\n- Shrinking or Growth is not the main part of this story.
