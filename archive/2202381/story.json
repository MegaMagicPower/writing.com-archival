            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today was a typical morning at the Harper residence. You had just woken up and were still in your pajamas as you headed to the living room. You used to share a bed with your mom due to her being paranoid about your condition, but you were allowed to sleep in your own room last year a couple months after you got sick. You weren\u2019t sure why this was, but after a few years of waking up squished under your mom, you weren\u2019t going to question it. You saw that your mom hadn\u2019t woken up yet, so you headed into the living room to watch TV. You hopped on the couch and crossed your legs and turned the channel to watch cartoons, but your show was interrupted as a familiar looking butt came into view and quickly crashed into you with a loud *SQUELCH*!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey there, Jackie\u201d, said an equally familiar voice. You had forgotten that your bully of an older cousin, Kat, was staying the week at your house. You always dreaded her visits, and the times you spent at your aunt\u2019s house because of her, spending more time squished under her rear end or used in one of her mean pranks than you care to remember.<br>\r\nYou let out muffled groans as she ground her bubble butt into your malleable form. \u201cDidn\u2019t see you there, little cousin. \u2018Preciate you giving me something nice and comfy to sit on while I watch wrestling, though\u201d, Kat said, laughing as she put her full weight on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled as much as you could to squirm out from underneath her, but any progress you made was put to a stop as she bounced her butt. You soon heard a yawning from the hallway. Though it was muffled beneath your cousin\u2019s butt cheeks, you knew that your mother had just woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Aunt Trish\u201d, Kat said as she waved over to your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*yawn* Good morning, Kat\u201d, she groaned as she stretched. \u201cIs Jack up yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t think so. Little guy\u2019s probably sleeping in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to get your mother\u2019s attention, crying out as loud as you could and wriggling hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKat, honey, what\u2019s that noise?\u201d, Trish asked as she walked into the living room. Your muffled shouting and your struggles were made more clear as she got closer to your cousin and she soon realized where you were. \u201cKat! Stop sitting on your cousin!\u201d, Trish yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Oops!\u201d, Kat said, feigning ignorance as she lifted her rump off of you, revealing your squished up body, molded into a crater the shape of her butt. \u201cSorry about that, Jackie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for your body to retain it\u2019s human shape, and you quickly shot an angry look at Kat. \u201cJack, don\u2019t give your cousin that look\u201d, your mother said. \u201cShe said she was sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, knowing Kat\u2019s acting would get your mom to believe anything she said. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kat\u201d, you said with a hint of resentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to be more careful, Katrina\u201d, your mom said as she bent down and gave you a kiss on the forehead. \u201cGood morning sweetie\u201d, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, momma.\u201d You tried to grab the remote to change the channel, but it was quickly snatched out of your hand while the channel flipped to My Little Pony. \"Hey! I was gonna watch something!\", you cried as you reached for the remote, but it was quickly pulled out of your reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well <i>you</i> got to watch TV already, so it's <i>my</i> turn!\" It was your little sister, Selena. Your mother had always wanted a daughter, and she had an extra room that wasn't being used, so Miss Barbara convinced her to adopt this specific little girl due to her having the same condition as yourself. Not only did that make you feel less special, but that meant you now had to share your mother, your home, and everything you owned. (Well, not everything, but it certainly felt that way.) It may have been selfish, but you were only ever used to sharing with your best friend, Andrew. Now you were forced to let some creepy girl who you had next to nothing in common with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even get to watch it!\", you whined. \"I was stuck under Kat's big butt, now gimme!\" You reached for the remote from Selena while your cousin laughed at the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOOOOMMMMMYYY! JACK'S BEING GREEDY WITH THE TV!\", Selena cried, kicking at you while you tried to grab at the remote. You almost grabbed it back before your mother took it, glaring angrily at the three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackson Scott Harper!\", she scolded. \"What have I told you about fighting with your sister?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but Momma! She took-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you have a problem, you come talk to me! You do NOT try to confront her!\" She then turned her attention to Selena, who had stuck her tongue out at you, but her grin quickly disappeared. \"Selena, I've told you not to antagonize your brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But My Little Pony's on, Mommy\", she whined. \"And Jack already got to watch his-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell him you want to watch something else, then come to me if he's being ugly about it\", your mother sighed before turning her attention to Kat. \"Why didn't you intervene? You saw them fighting and you just sat there and did nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I wasn't sure what to do\", Kat lied, having enjoyed the two of you squabbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother shook her head and knelt down to both yours and Selena's level. \"Both of you apologize and hug it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pouted before looking up at your sister. \"Sorry for being greedy, Selena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sorry for being impatient, Jack...\" Selena gave you a hug, and you went to hug her back, only to be surprised by a sudden \"mew\", and jumped back in shock. It was your sister's pet cat, Ian. You were never allowed to have pets due to your condition, so it frustrated you when your mother allowed your little sister to keep this chubby black and red kitty. She said that he was the family's pet, but Selena seems to be the only one he likes. Too many times you've found yourself gurgling away in his tummy.<br>\r\nOn top of that, he was able to turn anyone he bit squishy like yourself, and he seemed to target Andrew most of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister quickly turned around and her face lit up. \"Ian!\" She quickly grabbed Ian and picked him up, giving her precious kitty a big hug. Ian purred in your sister's arms as she went to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that you had made up with Selena, your mother followed to make breakfast for you, your sister, and your cousin. After eating, the four of you started getting ready for the day ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you be doing today?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as you got dressed, you ran out to the bus stop, where Andrew was already waiting for you. \"Yoooooo!\", he shouted as he waved over to you.<br>\r\n\"Hi Andrew\", you greeted as you pulled your rolling backpack along.<br>\r\nAndrew handed over a toy robot. \"Thanks for letting me borrow your Hot Rod\", the boy said.<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" You got your toy from him, only to discover a piece was missing. \"Uh, Andrew?\", You asked. \"What happened to his titanmaster?\"<br>\r\n\"The what?\"<br>\r\n\"Firedrive? His titanmaster? The little robot that turns into his head?\"<br>\r\nAndrew laughed nervously and rubbed his neck. \"Oh, uh... I was kinda... hoping you wouldn't notice...\"<br>\r\nYou let out a disappointed sigh. \"Stevie?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah...\" The one thing you were more worried about than Andrew's little brother getting ahold of you was him getting his little hands on your toys. Any time he touched one, at least a piece of it was going in his mouth. That was a reason why Andrew locked his own toys in a chest and sometimes asked to borrow your own. \"I'm really sorry, Jack.\"<br>\r\n\"*sigh* It's fine.Extras are pretty cheap...\" You unzipped your backpack and put your toy away. \"Just be more careful with them next time, okay?\"<br>\r\nAndrew gave you a hug, squeezing you tightly as you were squished in his grip. \"Thanks for being so cool with it! I promise i'll- oops!\" Your friend led go as he felt your body start to flatten into his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the indention Andrew had made to fill back in. \"Least I didn't get totally squished this time. Hehe.\"<br>\r\nYou waved over as your mother drove off with Kat and Selena. On reason you preferred the bus was that your mom embarrassed you in front of other kids, as her overprotective nature would often earn you a day or two worth of teasing. On top of that, she always made you stay close by your sister, at least until you got inside. She'd always whine or try to call your mom if you tried to pull her along with you or left her alone, so you always had to follow her around when she talked to her friends. You enjoyed the safety of her car, but you didn't think it was worth getting picked on by the other kids.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you've been taking the bus a lot lately. Is that because of your new sister?\", Andrew asked.<br>\r\nYou pouted as you groaned. \"Yeah\", you answered. \"She's such a whiny butthead. I tried to get along with her like my mom wanted, but she's become such a brat. Then there's that dumb cat of hers...\"<br>\r\n\"That's kinda mean\", Andrew said. You cringed a bit as you could hear some disappointment in his voice. \"I mean, she was an orphan before your mom adopted her. I mean, yeah, she's kind of annoying sometimes, but she's probably just acting how she thinks little sisters are supposed to act.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah... But you gotta admit, that cat is a real pain.\"<br>\r\nAndrew cringed a bit. \"Yeah... i really don't wanna get bit again...\" Andrew had been bitten by your sister's cat once before and was made squishy just like you. He thought it was cool at first, but soon realized just how bad you have it thanks to his little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school bus soon arrived to pick you and Andrew up. He followed close behind you, keeping other kids from trying to snatch you up or pinch parts of you off. It wasn't too long ago, when Andrew was sick at home, that one girl yanked you from your seat and spent the trip on the way to school munching on you. She got to skip breakfast, but you missed half the school day moving along her digestive system and had to explain to the principal why you had been found naked in the girl's bathroom. You found an empty seat, but it was half-occupied by another kid. \"Hey gummy kid, you can share a seat with me\", the boy said, licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, n-no thanks.\" You went back further, only to find more students in half-empty seats taunting you. Finally, you got to the back of the bus.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I got this\", Andrew said.<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what he meant, but you sat down in the lone bus seat, trusting your friend. You would soon find that your trust was misplaced, as he quickly jumped on top of you, squishing you beneath his butt! *SQUELCH!* \"See? I told you i got it\", he said as he wriggled his rump on top of you. \"No one's getting their hands on my buddy now.\"<br>\r\nYou could hear the muffled giggling of the other kids, mixed in with some disappointed groans. You weren't exactly happy with being sat on for the second time today, but at least with Andrew you knew you would be getting to school safely. \"It could be worse...\", you thought, letting out a silent groan as the bus drove off to the school. It wouldn't be long before you reached it, but you would have to wait a little longer before Andrew stood up, as he chose to wait until everyone else had left.<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, buddy\", Andrew said as he stood up, leaving you as just a butt print on the seat. He helped peel you off and watched as you reformed. \"It sucks that we're the last stop for this bus.\"<br>\r\n\"You're telling me\", you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew followed you out of the bus and you headed to the cafeteria to wait for the first bell to ring, passing briefly by the high school section and the weird staircase. You always saw smoke coming from those stairs and these kids in black going in and out. It always scared you to walk by there. You and Andrew called it the smoking staircase. As you neared the cafeteria, you stopped dead in your tracks your attention was immediately caught by someone. Time seemed to stand still as you caught sight of a new student, a young blonde girl just about your age. Your eyes went wide and your cheeks flush as you were certain that you had found the most beautiful girl in the world. Your stupor was soon put to a halt as Andrew snapped his fingers in front of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hellooooo! What's the matter with you?\", Andrew called.<br>\r\n\"H-what?!\" You shook your head as you came back to your senses. \"S-sorry. I just...\"<br>\r\n\"Were you looking at the new girl?\", Andrew blurted out, causing some of the kids around to laugh.<br>\r\n\"Andrewww!\", you whispered, trying to shush him up.<br>\r\n\"What? Do you like her or something?\", he asked as he looked over to her. \"She is really pretty. I can see why you'd like her. I mean, I think I do. I don't like girls much...\"<br>\r\n\"Can you please keep it down?!\", you asked. \"I don't want her to think I'm... uh, where'd she go?\" You looked around but the girl seemed to have vanished.<br>\r\n\"She's probably being shown to her class room.\" You soon heard the bell ring to signal the start of school. \"Looks like we need to head to class, too, buddy.\"<br>\r\nYou sighed and began to make your way to Miss Carioca's class. You considered her to be a fairly nice teacher. You always did pretty well on her assignments and never really had a problem with her.<br>\r\nClass was the last thing on your mind at the moment, though. For some reason, you couldn't stop thinking about that girl. There just was something about her. You felt like you had to see her again. The only problem was you had no idea who's class she was in. \"Uh, hey, Andrew? Could you do me a favor?\"<br>\r\n\"What's up?\"<br>\r\n\"Can you... Could you take my backpack to class? I have to use the bathroom, and you know how Miss Carioca is with going before class.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if we get our stuff in before we go, we get an extra five minutes before we're tardy\", Andrew said as he took your backpack. \"I got it for ya, but be careful. I can't leave class until she counts everyone's name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Andrew\", you said as you ran off. You didn't want to tell him the real reason for wanting to leave, but you didn't want him blurting it out to everyone. It wouldn't be long before the second bell rang and class started, and you only had five minutes after that. Everyone was too busy trying to get to class to bother with you, so you were pretty safe for now... or so you thought. As you turned the corner, you immediately made contact with a teenager, smacking right into their denim-clad butt before falling back and onto your own squishy butt. Almost as soon as you fell, your vision was blocked by the descending rump of the teen as it reduced you to a pancake! You mentally screamed for Andrew's help, but he couldn't hear you from your place stuck beneath the plump behind of the high-schooler. Even as they got up, you were still stuck, feeling every wobble and jiggle of the booty as they walked. Fortune would soon smile upon you as the teenager you were stuck to suddenly stopped and peeled you off. You mentally gulped as you were brought face to face with them and recognized them. It was your cousin, Kris, smirking as he looked down at you with the usual sleepy look in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I felt something squishy cushion my fall\", Kris said as he licked his lips. \"You know, I didn't eat breakfast this morning. And a pancake does sound tasty right about now...\"<br>\r\nYou panicked as he began to raise you up near his open mouth, but your fears quickly subsided when he began laughing. \"I'm only joking, Jackie!\", he snickered. \"I would never mess with my little cousin at school.\"<br>\r\nHe set you on the floor and crouched down as he watched you reform. \"It really is amazing how your body's able to restore itself... but we both really need to be getting to class.\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, sure, Kris...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved back to you and headed over to his own class room... which made you realize that you were now in the high school section of the school, on the third floor! Regardless of which class room you were heading to, you only had a short amount of time to get there! Without thinking of where you were, you ran as fast as you could to the nearest staircase, hoping like hell that you could beat the clock...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sighed in relief as you made it to your classroom. The door was still open, which was a good sign, though you were worried when you saw Andrew standing in the doorway with a worried look on his face. \"Jack...\", he said grimly as you walked over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\", you asked him, a feeling of dread beginning to fill your mind. \"I made it on time, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew slowly shook his head. \"You were too late. We both got detention for the rest of the year...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\", you stammered. \"But this is the first time I was late! And it wasn't even by that mu-\" You were interrupted as Andrew started snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Gotcha, Jack!\", he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scowled a bit and lightly punched him on the arm, which he just laughed off. \"Don't do that!\", you whined. \"I was freaking out the whole time over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\", Andrew said. \"Ms. Carioca's running late, so you're fine. What took you so long to get back? Did you get to see that girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as you shook your head. \"No... Kris fell on top of me and I spend the whole time stuck to his butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww... well, there's always next time.\" Andrew patted your back as the two of you walked inside. You were more than a little disappointed that you weren't able to see Marilyn. You wanted badly to talk to her. But every time you tried, something bad happened to you. Either a teacher would fall on top of you, a door would slam into you, or you'd run into a bully. There was one brown-haired boy in particular you'd often come across when you tried to follow her, and he'd always figure out the meanest ways to torment you. He once squished you into a little ball and stuck you up his nose, leaving you up there covered in his snot for the rest of the day until he sneezed you into a tissue. You were lucky to not have run into him today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both soon found your assigned seats (unfortunately, on opposite ends of the room) and sat until your teacher arrived. Once she walked through the door, you were immediately made aware of her presence by the jingling of her jewelry. Miss Julia Carioca was a tall Brazilian woman with an accent as thick as her figure. She had wide hips and a butt that jiggled like a plate of gelatin with each step, made all the more noticeable by tight dress she's currently wearing. Her breasts, while not huge, were still quite impressive, easily bigger than your mother's. She had a bit of pudge on her belly, which wasn't well hidden, but everyone still agreed she was one of the prettiest teachers in the school. Her wavy, shoulder-length hair was jet black with blonde highlights. Her skin was dark, only a few shades off from you and your mother.<br>\r\nWhile she was very sweet, there was one problem you had with her. She isn't aware of your condition, or rather, she doesn't believe you have a condition. Miss Carioca is under the impression that you're playing a game, and assumes that you're just being silly when you're telling her about any incidents. Even if she's sat on you herself, she just assumes you've followed her whenever you finally peel off and reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, childran\", Miss Carioca greeted. \"Sorry I late today. But is going to be easy day, no worry.\" As the teacher took role call, you prayed that she was right. You've already had a pretty bad start, ending up getting squashed by three people already. Hopefully this would be an uneventful day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shortly after Miss Carioca called the last of the students names, her phone started ringing. She took a look at it and sighed. \"Oh crud... sorry, childran, I haff to take this. I don't take too long\", she assured her students as she exited the room. As soon as she left, the other kids got up and started talking to their friends. You were about to do the same, but you were quickly pushed back down in your seat. When you looked up, you gulped in fear as you saw a well-dressed girl standing before you with an evil grin on her face, though the two girls that she was usually with with didn't seem to be present. It was Elise Courthouse, one of your worst enemies. She came from a very rich family and saw everyone as being beneath her, and saw you as little more than a toy to amuse herself with. Elise had been responsible for much of your misfortunes in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello little Squish Boy\", she said smugly, knowing full well you had no way to defend yourself. You looked over to Andrew hoping he would be able to help you, but instead you found him distracted by Elise's two friends, nervously talking to them as they pretended to swoon over him. You gulped just before the rich little brat grabbed your head and squished you down into the seat before she picked up your half-flattened body and squished up your flailing legs.<br>\r\n\"You know, I thought I was going to be bored today since you were late coming in\", Elise said to you as she squished and stretched your body, ignoring your muffled cries for help. \"Lucky the teacher's phone went off so we could play. I think Miss Carioca deserves a nice comfy seat, don't you, Squish Boy?\", she giggled. Completely unnoticed by the rest of the class, Elise walked you up to Miss Carioca's chair and continued molding you until you were nothing but a black and brown ball with a pair of eyes before she pressed you face-first into the seat, your black hair perfectly camouflaging you against the black leather cushioning. Once she was certain that you weren't going anywhere, she smirked down at you before signaling to her friends, who soon left Andrew alone. He sighed in relief, as he was really nervous around girls, but he unfortunately didn't have time to check on you before the teacher returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry childran\", Miss Carioca said as she walked over to her desk. \"That take longer than I thought. Since we have test yesterday, we just watch a video.\" As the class cheered, you were unable to see the danger before you. A bright red skirt struggled to contain Miss Carioca's bronze squishy moons as they slowly descended. As she lowered herself, her skirt slid up and she sat her full weight on top of you, the chair making a creaking sound. You could feel any air inside you being forced out as the Brazilian teacher's plump booty crushed the life out of you. You wanted to scream, but any noise you made was muffled by the leather of the chair. As she wore a thong beneath her dress, your poor body was being pressed right up against her bare flesh. \"Andrew, will you turn the lights off?\", she asked as she shifted her booty on top of you. The boy nodded and went up to flip the switch, failing to notice that his squishy friend was missing. Miss Carioca turned the lights off as she turned her laptop on, checking her emails as the rest of the children watched the video and completely unaware that she was sitting on one of her students. Try as you might, your pathetic struggles were in vain, as the teacher's weight was just too great to cause her to notice anything. Whether you liked it or not, you were just going to have to wait until either she noticed you, or until class was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She straitened up when she heard the noise coming in and you were greeted to the sight of the principal. She was a sharp looking woman with her black hair in a tight bun but her features were soft which you could only assume meant she was young. Principal Malory was someone that everyone liked, she just seemed nice but strict as if she was being fair even when she really wasn't. Her hips were wide with a large booty that filled out most chairs and modest sized boobs. Her green eyes were peircing as she smiled through blood red lips \"Jack Harper just the... Student I wanted to see.\" She plopped down into her chair and you could hear it groan under her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So jack do you know why I called you in today.\" She still had that smile, like a cat that caught the canary You shook you head nervously and for some reason your negative response seemed to please her. \"Well Jack, you see, someone has told me you've been skipping classes and someone even caught you exiting the girls room. I'm afraid that this behavior is unacceptable, I'll have to contact your mother.\" She started reaching for her phone and your eyes bulged out of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!! that's not my fault, please don't call my mom, I'll do anything.\" You saw her pause when you said that and set her phone down. She leaned back a bit and you heard the creek as the chair strained under her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, if you feel so strongly about it... hmm, I suppose I could administer a punishment without calling your mom.\" She lingered there for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please!

You'll have to come back a few times though.\" She leaned forward again with a playful look, accentuating her speech with big lip movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, anything but telling my mom, please.\" You practically begged her, which you realize is a mistake as she reaches across her desk to lift you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did give you the option, consider all of your misconduct forgiven. Oh and if YOU decide to tell your mother I'll be sure it gets added back to the record.

She was tall and slightly plump with green dye hair wearing a ton of goth jewelry, a ripped rocker shirt that revealed her massive cleavage spilling out, with black ripped jeans and boots to match. You promptly noticed her hand movement covering the vape pen she held in possession behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Sorry, I think I took a wrong turn...\" You stuttered, saying, slowly walking back to the door, hearing the sound of it closing behind. You spun around racing to twist the doorknob open. Each twist the knob spun, but sadly, the door wouldn't open, and soon girl had you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, twerp!\" the girl responded, gripping your T-shirt collar as she pulled you gummy body promptly with it. The girl settled you against the wall with one hand as she bent over to intimidate you, showing off an even grander view of her jugs. \"You're about to go rat us out to the principle, weren't you!\" she yelled with such anger that reminded the way your mom would have done the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I..\" you ended as another voice muttered from the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Melissa! Easy up, he's just a kid.\" A young teenage boy replied, exiting the shadowy end.

You suddenly were shoved to the ground as a thin tiny girl rested her butt on your back. \"Nice one guys, you almost let the little runt getaway,\" the girl spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Tammy! The little fucker wasn't going get far anyways,\" Melissa stated, feeling up her boyfriend's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, you both said the next one was mine to deal with anyways,\" she smiled, looking back, which brought chills to run throughout your body. She had bubblegum pink color pigtails, bearing a gothic black blouse and skirt with striped pantyhose underneath with stylish shoes, it all spelled terrible news for you. You tried to worm your way out from underneath her ass but suddenly applied more pressure, \"Quit your squirming shortie! I haven't even started yet,\" she giggled, saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" you screamed, not wanting to use your last resort, but with no other option, you squished a remaining part of your body, sliding out the form below the girl and running down the stairs naked from the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell's wrong with this kid?\" the small girl asked, stunned by your surprising escape. But the other two began to chase after you as you made your way down the dark halls with broken lights, making it harder to see where you were stepping as they teenagers reach up to you. You heard on a scream as one slipped, pulling them all down and crashing on top of you in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where he go?\" Melissa demanded, looking around. Brady wiped him clean of the dirt as Tammy rubbed her sore butt. \"The jerk must have gotten away?\" Tammy suggested to them. Melissa's face grew red, \"Nice one Tammy! I knew you weren't cut out to be goth. We better find that kid,\" as she ordered, grabbing Brady's hand storming off.

Barbara grinned like a cat as she bunched you up and tossed you over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Trish, and don't worry about the boys Andrew was upstairs playing in his room.\" She strategically forgot to mention where you had gone but your mom didn't seem to notice as Barbara followed her out to the beach. You weren't that stuck but for some reason it was really hard to talk like this, it was even a bright sunny day perfect for the beach. You fluttered out as Barbara unraveled your body again and laid you down on the sand while Trish pinned your corners down with their various bags so that the 'towel' didn't blow away. You finally worked out just how big Barbra had managed to pull you and it was startaling, somehow you had been made long enough that they could lay down comfortably, a bit longer than either of them were tall and wide enough for at least three. You figured you would have felt a lot more pulled out than you did but for some reason that sensation was dulled while the sensation of the things touching you was amplified. They hadn't even stepped on you yet but the grains of sand on your back were rough and uncomfortable. Trish was about to step onto you, the sandy foot hovered just over one of your eyes when barbara stopped her. You almost wondered what she was thinking so you listened in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, don't just get your sandy feet anywhere! we gotta choose the spot where our feet go and wipe the sand off then we can walk onto the towel.\" She walked down to your bottom half so your eyes followed her trying to look at what she was doing. \"Right here, then we can start tanning.\" You saw her step down but weren't prepared, even more than usual The pain shot through you she was clearly wiping her foot on your crotch, the rough sand wiped off as she dragged her foot off and repeted the same with her other foot until she was standing with non sandy feet on a different spot of your body. You mutely begged for mercy as you saw her grin at your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course, I wouldn't want sand all over me.\" Trish said making you realize you were in for more just before it happened the roughness Barbara had displayed may as well have been a genital massage to the devastating stomping and grinding Trish did to get rid of her foot sand. You felt like you almost made a noise with how hard you tried to scream but at the last second the jiggly flesh of Barbra's ass covered your mouth muting your cry as Trish casually walked onto your body now. \"Uh Barb you're sitting in the middle of the towel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbra giggled and scooched over but the damage was done, your cries were defiantly only mental now. \"Alright no problem, Let's just tan till the girls join us.\" She shrugged and rolled over, the large breasts of the Morrison woman covered your Right eye as she decided to get her back first. Trish soon covered your left eyes vision in the same manner. With things winding down you felt the sand under you and your towel form giving to the powerful bodies of the tanning women and for some reason Trish continued to rub her hands over the empty space between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another ten minutes before either of them spoke again. \"Hey Barbra...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You, Kat, and Selena cheered as your mother told you that you were all heading to your favorite water park, Splash Zone. It felt like forever since the last time he had gone (even though it had only been a couple of weeks). You and your family lived in a pretty warm area, so it was able to be open for five months a year. Unfortunately, your mother wasn't comfortable with letting either of her children go off on their own due to your shared condition. As annoyed as you were, you couldn't fault her. Even with her watching you, you would spend hours squashed under some inattentive lady's butt after she sat in the raft you were lying in, or you'd go down the slide just as a man was coming up for air and you'd have to spend most of the day going through his digestive system. You were always fortunate enough that your mother always found you and you were able to get back home safely. However, you've noticed that she hasn't always been there for you lately. Not just because she was preoccupied with your sister, but sometimes you'd go home with Miss Barbara or your Aunt Vivian unexpectedly, sometimes for several days, and without any explanation other than your mom having something important to do. You always thought it was weird, but she always got you (and your sister) something you both wanted after she came back, so it didn't bother you that much. After changing into your favorite pair of red and white swim trunks, you raced to the van to find Selena holding Ian and whining. She was wearing a light blue one piece swimsuit (her favorite color), and her white sandals, while your mother was wearing a red and black one piece swimsuit (that probably wasn't as tight a few years ago), while Kat stood with an annoyed expression on her face, wearing a dark blue two-piece swimsuit and an oversized football jersey over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started packing snacks and drinks for yourself in the cooler, knowing your sister was going to be whining for a while. Soon, Selena had finally stopped arguing and the four of you finally packed into your mother's car and finally made it to Splash Zone! When you arrived, you saw the Morrisons waiting for you and your family. Andrew was wearing a pair of black and green Fortnite swim trunks, and Stevie was wearing a pair of plain green ones. You blushed as you saw that Miss Barbara was wearing a stunning blue bikini with little devils on both of her breasts. Ash, meanwhile was wearing a purple pair of swim trunks with a skull on the side. \"Hey there, Trish\", Barbara said as she went to give Trish a hug. Your mother seemed worried for some reason, but you didn't have time to process that as your attention was grabbed by something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie! 'Lena!\" You yelped as someone quickly grabbed you from off of the ground and pressed you into their breast, along with your sister. Trying to look up from the boob flesh, you immediately recognized the slurred voice of your Aunt Vivian. \"It's soooo good to see you little boogers again\", she said, laughing through her nose a bit. You let out grunted as you tried to get out of her grip, while your sister moaned, both of you turning bright red as your faces were smushed into your aunt's boobs before she finally set you down. She was wearing a yellow and black striped bikini with a g-string that showed off her perfectly tanned booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Viv\", your mom said as she went in to give her sister a hug before stopping. \"Your breath... Vivian, have you been drinking?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a couple\", your aunt answered. \"It ain't like I drove here, anyway. Krissy got his learner's permit, so i'm having him drive me around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't mind, Aunt Patricia\", you heard a voice call out. You turned over and blushed before looking down. It was your cousin, Kris, though you felt embarrassed to look at him. He was wearing a  metallic orange tight-fitting speedo, though it seemed to be some kind of special order one, as it covered even less of his body than a normal one. His bulge was very prominent, and the back barely covered his plump butt, not to mention how much it showed off his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kris!\", your mom said, blushing a bit before turning to her sister. \"You seriously let him wear that here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you talking about, sis?\", Vivian asked. \"Come on, it's trendy. Besides, he's not showing as much skin as I am. Park doesn't seem to mind, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little embarrassed, while Selena was gawking at both Vivian and Kris. \"Alright, kiddos\", Barbara called out. \"Let's head inside.\" As you walked inside the water park, you though about where you wanted to go. As much as you appreciated the protection that your friends and family gave you, you kind of wanted to try to do something on your own. You've always wanted to go on the giant water slide, but your mother forbade it after all of the other incidents you've had. Then again, it might be nice to go with Andrew. He at least wouldn't treat you like a baby like your mother sometimes did. You also felt like you wanted to hang out with Ash and Kris. You weren't sure of what they might want to do, but it'd be better than having to stay with the older ladies.</span></div></div>",

Nodding your head you quickly follow his direction pointed. Exiting the large crowd your little heart started racing. Spotting your crush from school, Mary, here of all people! Waiting right near where you headed towards how lucky could you be. She was wearing a pinkish tan one-piece swimsuit today. Her long golden hair that you admired was soaking wet down her back like the rest of her body. You gulp feeling nervous. Was this your chance to be alone with her finally. You delayed walking closer for a moment. Your mom did say to stay away from this girl or else you be in big trouble, though. Before you even had the chance to sneak past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is this your first time on the water slide, little boy?\" a boy next to Mary asked you turning around. He obviously thought you were too young for the ride by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I've been here lots of times, but I'm usually riding with my mom or neighbor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy in front of you laughed. \"Betcha real scared without your mommy around, huh?\" the boy pointed and laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gary, stop it!\" Mary said punching her brother's arm, \"Stop picking on... oh!\". Mary became distracted. \"Hey, Jack right?\" she said waving to you. You couldn't felt so scared to even say a simple hello and waved back. \"He's the one with the weird condition I told you about,\" Mary whispered into her brother's ear. Gary's eyes widen up looking at you. \"Sorry about him! Don't listen to my brother it's his first time too. \" Mary spoke to you nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Mary, it's your first time, too,\" Gary said rubbing his sore arm. A staff member pushed you three along. Making you realize that you're stuck with the two of them now. \"Hey, kid. If you're really not scared, prove it!\" Gary stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's gonna make you do something stupid. Ignore him!\" Mary told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quite Mar! When it's your turn, go out face-first like a human cannonball.\" Gary said chuckling. The staff member informed the boy it was his turn. \"I'll be waiting!\" He jumped in belly first with his hands out in front, like a superhero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, you wouldn't let him get to you, but this was your moment to shine in front of the girl of your dreams. Without waiting for the worker, you dived head first into the slide. Mary held her head and sighed. \"Ugh. Boys.\" Because you were so light, you were moving along a lot slower than everyone else. You couldn't even see Gary anymore. You were pretty disappointed that you weren't going to catch up to him. You then heard the scream's of Mary as she slid down behind you. If you didn't hurry this along, you were going to get steamrolled by her! Which was exactly what your mother warned you of avoiding. You shifted your weight forward to speed yourself up. As you neared the end, you saw Gary. Apparently, he saw you, too as he waved and... what is he doing now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to hit the bullseye, squirt!\" He turned around and pulled his pants down, revealing his bare butt. His evil plan was going to succeed! There wasn't much you could do to avoid it...</span></div></div>",

If there were a chance for you to avoid getting squashed, you would take it. You pushed yourself off of Marilynn's thighs and sped up ahead of her. Opening your eyes, you saw that you had a large amount of distance between you now. \"I'm safe!\", You thought. Upon reaching the bottom landing in the pool below with a big splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up to leave when Gary pushes you down onto your butt from behind. You looked up to see him clenching his fists. \"I'm not done with you yet, shrimpy.\" He slowly picks you up grabbing you by your scrawny arms. *gulp* Fear ran through your mind, preventing you from moving. You kicked him in the stomach, but they were like tickles to him. You whimpered as he quickly squished you up into a ball and tossed your loose trunks away, having some sort of evil scheme in mind for you. \"I SAID MOVE IT, GARY!!!\", You heard the Mary scream from the slide tunnel. Gary was holding onto your ball shape tightly, preventing you from escaping or looking around, but you assumed that she was almost nearing the bottom. Your situation just got ten times worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lowered you a little bit to see up, having previously been too focused on bullying you to care for his sister approaching. \"Huh? Oh, shoo-! *KRAK* Mary landed feet-first right into her brother, kicking him right in the mouth and causing him to drop you. You didn't have any time to celebrate as Mary started to descend... right on top of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SQUELCH!* Marilynn landed butt-first on top of you, pancaking you under her weight. You felt her stand up. Observing your swim trunks float away in obscure, as she was carrying you with her. You hoped that you would be able to slide off of her rear when she was entirely out of the water. Unfortunately, as you saw her walking away and the cold air began hitting your flattened body, you could tell it wasn't going to be that easy. \"Are you alright, Gary?\" Mary asked her brother, who was crying in pain and holding his bloody mouth. \"You... *sniff*... you knocked my toof out!\" he pronounced with a lisp. Mary put her hands on her hips. \"Hmph! That's what you get for blocking the exit!\" Gary continued to sob. \"I'm telling... *sniff* I'm telling momma you kicked me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gary, I didn't mean to do it! If you would've gotten out of the way... look, I'm sorry for kicking you\", Mary said to her twin, helping him up. \"Let's just go get your mouth taken care of.\" As she walked, you felt both sides of your face shift up and down, wobbling slightly with her buttcheeks with every step. Although you had a deep crush on the girl and you wanted to be close to her, this wasn\u2019t what you had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou prayed that someone would be able to spot you and assist you out, but there was a significant problem with that. The color of your body was the same tint as Mary's one piece. The pinkish tan of your body just about merged into her swimsuit perfectly. Because of the way she had landed on you, you appeared just like eyes on her cheeks. Unless someone stared directly at her butt where you were, no one was going to see you. The twins walked over to the infirmary and got Gary cleaned up and the new gap in his teeth filled with gauze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap we have forgotten about that kid from my school\", Marilynn pointed her attention, having slipped her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I guess I should apologize to that kid for picking on him if I see him again, huh?\" Gary said talking semi better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" Mary said upset, slapping her brother's arm for his misbehavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what ride do you want to get on next?\", Gary asked his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... I don't know. How 'bout we go look around a little more?\" Mary spoke cheerfully.  As the twins continued to explore the water park, you attempted to wiggle your flattened form off of Mary's butt, your face shifting with her every step.</span></div></div>",

I think I sat in something\", Marilynn said as she scratched the area around you more. You suddenly felt her nails dig into your body. \"What the-? What is this? Gum?\" Mary stated scratching the outer part of your flattened body and peeled you off. \"Is this... *gasp* omigosh!\" You suddenly heard bust out laughing from Gary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHA! You squashed that little wimpy kid with your butt! That's just... that's... HAHAHA!\" Gary fell over and continued to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gary! This isn't funny. I try my best ignoring him. But I might have hurt him bad! We need to take him to the first aid tent and...\" Mary tripped over Gary on the ground dropping you. He stopped his laughing, and she grew startled seeing your body start to reform fast. After a few seconds, you regained your three dimensions and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hi?\" You panicked covering your naked self. Your swim luckily brushed next your leg to be placed on again. \"Thank goodness you're okay!\" she replied hugging you. Your face grew red as a strange feeling was happening in your pants. Mary quickly pushed you back. \"Wait, why are you okay? How come others always squish you?\" she returned to her usual self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that's... that's just how I was born. I've always gotten squished by all kinds of stuff.\" you told her, growing happy to be having a conversation with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary started laughing. \"That's hilarious! You're just like silly put- OW!\" He was interrupted by Mary smacking him in the head. \"Stop being such a jerk, Gary! We can't let him walk around here by himself. What if he gets smooshed by a bad person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned. You hated being treated like you were helpless, especially by the girl who\u2019s a year younger than you.

Sorry, squishy kid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarilynn shot her brother a glare and returned to a cheerful smile. \"So, do you want us to come with you for a little bit? At least 'til we find your momma?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grew excited knowing Mary was going to help you. Even better you'll be spending time with her. Except knowing her brother Gary, he'd probably try some nasty trick again. Then lie to Mary when she was not looking. \"Jack! Hello! Do you want my help?\" Mary asked you again.</span></div></div>",

She masked it entirely by her walking. You felt her casually scratch her butt at times. Stretching her swimsuit out a bit when it was trying to wedgie from where her butt had first landed before. But you stayed put. You settled on giving up your attempts for the moment. Mary clearly wasn't noticing. You needed to conserve your energy for when she stopped moving for a better chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary's Stomach suddenly growled loudly, followed by Gary's copying the whale song of hunger. She looked at her twin brother and giggled at their in sync hunger sounds. Brushing her wet hair out of her face and grinned pointing across to a hot dog stand \"We should get a hot dog, then we can look for what to do next!\" she proclaimed and began heading quickly in the direction of food. Gary close behind as he unzipped his shorts pockets to get the money out he was holding for both of them as Mary didn't have pockets on her swimsuit. He glanced over his sister's swimsuit wishing there was some way she could carry all the coins for a bit, failing to notice the eyes and different coloring blend in around her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped as your face shifted with Mary's eager steps that while they queued up for their food that you might get her attention without her moving. However, luck really didn't seem to be with you today. Mary kept hopping on the spot keeping herself from thinking about how hungry she was. Once more masking your feeble attempts at attention on her bouncing butt. Gary handed her some of the money. Both of them paying for their hot dogs, she ordered one with just ketchup on hers. Gary, of course, went for stinky onions, relish and hot sauce. Mary pouted at the thought of sitting next to him on the car journey home as they walked over to the food tables. Your eyes went wide as you approached the bench, letting out a silent cry for help as you were squished beneath her once more. She sat down hearing a faint squelch as she did, taking it to be her suit being still damp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, felt her full weight pressing down on you as the warm wood of the bench compressed you under her more. The world's sounds were muffled to near silence as they ate. You couldn't hear their casual banter or suggestions on where to go next, seeing lots of the rides from this location. It was often used by visitors on a good resting spot to plan the rest of the day. By the time Mary and Gary had filled their stomachs, you became half pressed into the fabric. The gaps between the fibers and your gummy body merged from the prolonged sitting had compressed you more. You realized this when she wasn't walking right now. Attempting to wriggle for attention only to find to your horror that with the further flattening and heat from the bench. Compressed into her swimsuit, you couldn't move at all. Now you were literally stuck until someone noticed the pattern of your body and rescued you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were helpless to Mary whim. She ran over every slide that they walked by, feeling the slide grind against you as she skidded down screaming with laughter happily. You were powerless as she dove off diving boards and cannonballed ass first into pools, slapping you painfully as you hit the water before she did. You were even unable to stop her from sitting down and telling her mother about their day, and why her brother had lost a tooth. Her mother listened while sunbathing still in the warm sunbathing area. The ground was painfully hot for you, but you cushioned Mary from feeling it too strongly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though you heard the words you had been dreading \"ok Kids, go get changed. Its time we headed home\" their mother said as she stood up, stretching and checking to make sure she didn't have tan lines before slipping her bikini top back on. Both Mary and Gary pouted, they didn't want the day to end. But they knew there was no point arguing. They both headed into the changing rooms. You could hear young girls giggling and mother's chatting around you as Mary walked in. This was not a place you wanted to reform! Although it had to be better than staying stuck right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary peeled off her swimsuit and threw it onto the bench as she opened up the locker her things were in, she grabbed her towel and dried herself off. Laying out her clothes she grabbed her swimsuit and rolled it up, then twisted it tightly to squeeze out the extra water. She shook it open again once it stopped dripping and glanced at it before going to roll it up in her towel to put in her bag...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only to get his swim trunks to snag onto something in the slide. He noticed and began to panic if he can get free in time very suddenly. Unfortunately for him, this was not the case for Mary racing up behind him. The rushing force somehow arranges her suit to sway slightly to the side. He looked back right then. Bearing his face to collide right into Mary's tight, pink pucker. \"EEEEP\" she squeals at the sudden intrusion into her very tight ass. The rapid water splashes in her face. She couldn't tell what's happening or causing this. Jack's shoulders and torso mold up like the rest of him. Soon his whole upper body was accompanied in her backdoor rapidly.  Mary bent her head backward, while her eyes roll back in delight at the new feeling. The push she connects you with freed your trunks from the snag allowing the rest of you to slip easily in with the lower half of her new butt plug sticking out and kicking away. Mary was quivering as she resumed the slide down. Jack realized what had happened and began to struggle as his life depends on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later after the bliss, Mary came off the slide into the pool below. Hitting the bottom of her butt first forces the rest off jack inside her very quickly bring her to a massive orgasm. Inside her tight (definitely virgin) ass, jack got smooshed by the pink tube around stretching him out a little more and pulling him deeper as he feels her cum. Very shakily, Mary stood up. \"Woo Sis, you alright?\" Gary asked her running up. \"I'm fine!\" Mary stated upset, clutching her gut. Still, in slight pleasure, she has neglected the tiny twitching bulge displayed in her lower underbelly inducing her with the best sensation in her life. At the moment Jack is about two feet and half long and as thick as someone's forearm.  \"What happened to Jack.. Aaahh!\" she screamed falling back in the water. He desperately wriggles to get young Mary's attention, but all this does is illicit a moan and cause her to inadvertently suck up what little was left of him outside all the way into her. \"Come on Mary lets go see our mom. You're looking red face.\" Gary said helping his sister up. As Mary stands, she felt the odd feeling in her butt and she descided...</span></div></div>",

As disgusting as it was, you found that your body was able to absorb even excrement and use it as nutrition. You tried not to think about exactly how you found this out, but it meant that your body wouldn't fail to keep itself together if you were trapped up someone's butt. As you your unaware captor continued walking, you felt a warm smelly wind breeze past you, as Gary released a rather loud fart. \"Ewwww! Gary, you're so gross!\", Mary whined, gagging as she held her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I gotta use it\", the bully laughed, fanning the smell away before he headed over to the bathroom. From within your fleshy prison, you were getting the worst of it. It was bad enough smelling the boy's fart from right next to him, but you were unfortunate enough to experience the full force of Gary's putrid flatulence. Your eyes were watering from the odor, but you were mentally jumping for joy knowing that you wouldn't be trapped in this almost literal Hellhole for long. The boy walked into the stall and pulled his shorts down before plopping his pale cheeks on the toilet, shivering a bit from the sudden cold of the metal seat. Gary let out yet another sickening fart, this time being enough to push you along. You silently let out a sigh of relief as you felt the cold water below while the brother of your dream girl squeezed you out of his smelly butt. For a while, you were scared that you might be stuck in here forever. After a couple of minutes of grunting and a few putrid poots, you were finally freed from Gary's disgusting bottom, now coiled up in the toilet bowel like a cartoon pile of poo. Gary didn't even bother to flush or wipe his butt before leaving the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were relieved that you weren't getting flushed, giving yourself time to reform. Once you had returned to a human shape, you groaned as you crawled out of the toilet bowel. Having lost your swim trunks prior to being shot up the bully's butt, you peeked your head out of the stall to make sure there was no one around. Sure enough, you were alone. You decided it'd be a good time to clean yourself off. You walked over to the sink and got some soap and water in your hands and proceeded to rub yourself down. As you washed the smell off of you, you got a look in the mirror and saw a stall opening... revealing Gary, with an evil grin on his face! You were frozen in fear as he ran at you, managing to grab your lips and squish them shut. \"Hey there, Squishy!\", Gary laughed, before manhandling your flailing limbs and squishing you down. \"I thought it was weird that you disappeared after hitting my butt\", Gary laughed as he continued to mold you. \"Good thing no one else saw. Boy am I gonna have some fun with you.\" You panicked as you struggled with all your might to fight against the bully, but he simply hummed to himself as he pressed down and molded your malleable body until you were reduced to a small brown ball with a pair of blinking eyes. He laughed as he held you up to his face. \"Man this is cool. Not every day I run across a wimp I can squish like playdoh.\" The boy then tossed you up into the air, laughing as he saw your panicked expression in your eyes before catching you. \"Regular nerds are no fun to pick on. You punch them a couple times and their noses break and you're having to clean the blood off. <b><i>You</i></b>, on the other hand, I bet I can wail on all I want and you'll just get right back up. But that's boring. I can do stuff to you that I can't do to other losers. If you can survive all the stuff that my sister says you can... man, I gotta have some time to think.\" Gary caught you one final time, giggling as he saw your eyes spin around before he brought you around to behind him. As he pulled the back of his trunks down, you started to whimper in fear. \"Looks like you're heading home with me, Squishy!\" Gary laughed as he pressed you between his two fleshy moons, shifting your body so that you looked outward. He then pressed a finger on you and forced you right back up his disgusting butt. \"Haha! Right where wimps like you belong! Enjoy the ride, Squishy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally wept as Gary yanked his trunks back up, ensuring that you wouldn't be leaving his rump for the remainder of the bully's stay at the park. While Gary and Mary had fun on the rides and the water slides, you were trapped in the smelly tube with no way of escaping. The day dragged on painfully long before the twins returned home. \"I wonder what happened to that boy\", Mary pondered. \"He was kind of cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say you're better off without that wimpy kid\", Gary laughed. \"He's kind of a BUTThead.\" Gary laughed at his own joke, mocking your predicament, though his sister questioned what he thought was so funny. It wouldn't be long before they arrived at their house. The twins washed up before eating dinner, and it would be a bit longer before it was light out. Once his mother and sister were asleep, Gary sneaked back to the bathroom and reached between his cheeks. He grunted a bit before finally pulling out your squished up form. He practically coated you in soap before running some warm water over you, digging his thumbs into your malleable body to make sure he washed all of his waste off of you and getting out all of his \"butt germs\". He then took you back to his room and set you on the ground to allow you to reform. You were confused as to why he was doing this, but you weren't going to question a chance to escape from this bully. After returning to your human shape, you opened your mouth to scream out for help before Gary grabbed your lips and squished them shut. \"Nah-ah-ah! One word out of you and you're staying in my butt forever!\" Your eyes widened and you gulped, not wanting to anger him. You'd have to play along with whatever he had planned for you... at least for now. \"Now that I've got you here...\"</span></div></div>",

While you were still struggling, Gary shifted to the side once more and let go of a baritone fart, your eyes watering from it.</span></div></div>",

He peeled you off his chair and pulled down his pants, showing off his pale butt once more. Before you could cry out for help, he quickly stuffed you inside his butt, the familiar scent of rotten eggs assaulting your nose. Gary then went to brush his teeth, all the while feeling you squirm inside his butt. Before he exited the bathroom, he let go of another fart, feeling your squirms iincrease and grinning. Gary then went back to his room, and laid down in his bed on his back. \"Goodnight, Squishy!\" he then said, letting go of a little toot. \"You better make me feel your squirms at school tomorrow!\"He said commandingly,before dozing off. Meanwhile, you were sobbing quietly to yourself, wondering what you had done to deserve this. You didn't get to think for long though, since you heard another grumble from above. Gary released another fart on you, which caused you to cough and gag before you fell unconcious, inside of this bratty boy's butt.</span></div></div>",

You soon realized that your fears were well-founded as Gary pressed your head down and pulled down his pajamas, revealing his hardened member! You whimpered as you looked up at him, while he simply responded with a smirk. \"Hehe, guess you figured out where you're going, huh, Squishy?\" You tried to open your mouth to scream once again, only for the bully to squish your head into a wad. Your vision was limited as he pressed you into the head of his cock, your gooey body squishing in with little resistance. Gary bit his lip as he forced more of you down his shaft, occasionally moaning in between his snickering. As much as you tried, there was no way you were going to overpower him. He was simply too strong, and you were just too weak. You uselessly struggled as more of your body was squished down Gary's shaft, and it wasn't long before you reached the end of your journey. Finally, you were compressed tightly in a soft, warm, and sticky area; one that smelled awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary panted as he fell back onto his bed and looked down at his groin. He snickered as he poked his sac, which had become quite swollen. \"Haha! Hope you like your new home, you little weenie!\" As Gary laughed outside, you silently gasped, realizing where you were. You were currently residing in the bully's balls! This was potentially worse than being up his butt. At least you could expect to get out at some point. In here, you had no clue when or if you would be escaping. It didn't take long for you to begin melting due to the heat, slowly turning you into a much more gooey consistency and seeming to mix you with some other weird goo that was in here. Gary poked your fleshy prison once again. \"I'm gonna play some Fortnite now. You better get comfy, little nut-buddy!\", he laughed. Gary pulled his shorts back up and plopped down on his chair before turning his system on, making sure to get his headset on so as to not wake his mother or sister up. You felt yourself getting rattled as Gary fell on top of the chair, and you could feel his thighs compressing you slightly within your prison. You tried fruitlessly to squeeze yourself out of the bully's sac, only to discover that you were incapable. It seemed that the only way you were getting out is if the boy let you out. For the whole night, you could hear him obnoxiously yelling through the microphone. It was tough to make out whether he was doing well or not, but you could tell from the sound of his voice now that you had played against him before. And you knew that it was going to be a long time until he gave you a little bit of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he finally did go to sleep, you had melted into a sticky, goopy consistency, and had taken on a much lighter shade, sort of a light pink color. Even though he was asleep, you wouldn't be getting the same comfort, as his loud snoring had kept you up for the whole night. Morning would soon come, and he slowly rose as he awoke. \"*YAAAWWWWNNN* That was an awesome dream...\", he said. \"I can't believe I-\" Gary soon looked down as he heard a gurgling sound coming from his groin and he held his mouth as he tried to keep from laughing. \"Oh man... I thought that was just a dream... haha!\" The boy poked his now-only-slightly swollen sac, bringing a gurgle from you in response. \"I really did eat you with my weiner! That's hilarious!\" Gary kept playing with his balls for a bit, enjoying the feeling of dominance he had over you. \"Hmmm... but... I guess I can't keep you in there\", he said. \"I kinda wanna do other stuff with you... hmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Gary's solution?</span></div></div>",

Then proceed to walk, your prison sloshing about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear the muffled sound of a door opening and some rustling as your prison suddenly dropped. Only to become ten times as tight. You had no idea Gary had a curious side... And with the whole weekend to himself aside from his squishy toy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did a little spin in the mirror as he looked himself over in Mary's bright pink panties.

I'm a person, not some kind of toy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attempts to yell at the bully only resulted in a light gurgling heard from his crotch, which did nothing but make him laugh. \"I bet you're crying for your mommy in there, huh?\", Gary snickered as he poked at his sac. \"Nah. You're just thanking me for giving you a nice new home.\" The bully continued laughing as he grabbed his groin and shook you around. \"Nice and cozy in my nuts.\" Every shake caused you to slosh around, making you dizzy as he continued mocking you. As he'd get dressed, you felt your prison compress as he pulled up a pair of underwear and some shorts as he got ready for school. \"Man, I wish I would've found you sooner\", he muttered as he cupped his groin. He soon joined his sister in waiting for the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary looked over to her brother and raised an eyebrow. \"Why are you so happy?\", she asked. \"You usually hate school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's uh... taco day!\", Gary replied. \"Man, I can't wait to gross out some nerd after I get a belly full of those...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww!\", Mary whined. \"You are so gross!\"<br>\r\nMary... you wished you could see her. Being mocked by her bully of a brother while you were trapped inside of him was bad enough, but it felt awful to be so close to your dream girl but unable to talk to her or see her. Being imprisoned in the balls of literally anyone else was preferable. To hear Mary's voice so often and being unable to see her made you want to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were broken out of your self-pity as you were suddenly sloshed around as Mary and Gary boarded the bus. Once he found his seat, you were splashed about as he plopped on top of his seat. He didn't talk to you, just looking down at his groin while he smiled smugly, knowing his that his prisoner was suffering in humiliation with each passing second. It felt awesome to have this much power over someone.</span></div></div>",

Trying to fight out of Gary's balls was hopeless. You were far too weak, and melted and mixed with his cum. The only way you would be getting out is if he decided to play with you. You weren't looking forward to getting stuffed up his butt again or being squished up, but anything would be better than being stuck in another boy's nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unfortunate, then, that as he finished scratching himself, Gary looked down at his groin and smirked as he made a decision: you weren't going to be getting out. Sure, he would miss seeing all of the fun stuff he could do with you, but he knew you wouldn't be going anywhere, and you would be absolutely miserable the entire time. After getting to school, he went about his day as normal, though he made sure to make your stay in his balls even worse for you any chance he got. As he sat in his desk, he put his weight on the toes of one of his feet and kept moving it up and down. While no one noticed him, you felt every vibration as it violently sloshed you around. At gym, he made sure to stay lower to the ground when doing jumping jacks, bouncing your prison around and making you incredibly dizzy. You could hear some noises outside of another kid's whining while Gary laughed. He must have been bullying another boy into giving him his lunch, as you heard him stuffing his face soon after and letting out a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he would get on the bus and head home, where you were once again squished inside of his sac as he scratched himself. Shortly after the twins had gotten home, Gary's mom had him take a bath. As he sat in the tub, he looked down and snickered as he jabbed his finger into his balls, further compressing you in your fleshy prison. \"Hey, Nut Buddy\", he said in a mocking voice. \"How'd you like your first day riding along with me? I bet it was... nuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as he laughed at his own dumb joke. You hoped he decided to let you out soon. Just these past two days had been hell. Any more and you were sure you'd lose your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuck his tongue out and cupped his sac in his hand. \"Y-y-you bet, Gary\", he said in a whiny, scared-sounding voice while moving his balls up and down. He was likely (poorly) imitating you. \"You sure are a nice guy giving a wimpy little nerd like me somewhere nice and safe to hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please just let me out...\", you mentally pleaded. \"I can't take any more of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know\", Gary smugly chuckled. \"You know, since I'm such a great guy, I think I'll let you stay in your little hidey hole... FOREVER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>WHAT?!</b>\" He had to be joking. There was no way Gary intended to keep you inside of him for the rest of your life. \"No! You can't be serious! You can't keep me here forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, do ya really mean it?\", Gary asked, once again mockingly imitating you as he shook his sac.<br>\r\n\"Yep! You get to have your cozy little safe house for the rest of my life!\" Gary poked his balls once more and continued laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to cry your eyes out. This wasn't fair. You just wanted to go home and play with Andrew, and hug your mom. Even arguing with your dumb little sister and getting chewed up by her dumb cat sounded good right now. You wished with all your might that this horrible dream would end and you could return to your life and never think about talking to Mary and staying away from her bully of a brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, he was completely serious. The days would soon turn into weeks, which turned into months, which turned into years, and Gary was true to his word, refusing to consider the idea of letting his prisoner free. Every day, he would mock and torment you every chance he got, jabbing at you with his finger and jumping up and down, sloshing you around your tiny prison and making you sick to your non-existent stomach. You hoped that he would at least forget about you, but he made it part of his routine to talk to his little inmate. Even as he grew to a teenager, he still made it a point to remind you of where you were and how much of a wuss you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears later, he would start high school, and he would eventually take sex education classes and learn that the testicles were meant for creating sperm and semen, and how to release it. While the class was watching a movie, you felt a jab from outside of his shorts. \"Hehe, guess I know what not to do now, huh, Nut Buddy?\", he snickered. \"Wouldn't wanna take you away from your home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently sobbed. Finding out that there was a chance he could finally release you and he was refusing to take it broke you. All this time you had hoped that he would one day do something to accidentally squeeze you out of your prison, but now that was shattered. Gary was free to live his life and grow up, while you were trapped inside of him as his little prisoner for life. You would never get to talk to the girl of your dreams again. You had even forgotten what her voice sounded like. And your family's voices for that matter. The only voice you were allowed to hear was from Gary, and it was only to remind you of how pathetic you were. You may not have been able to die, but it was safe to say that your life as a person was effectively over.</span></div></div>",

However you quickly saw the tanned young man coming up quickly behind you, face first, glaring at you like before. \"Get moving Shrimp!\" he shouted at you.

Get your ass out of my face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLars chuckled as he stood up out of the water before he turned and looked around. \"Uhhh... where'd that kid go?\" He looked down and saw that his friend's gut was slightly swollen. \"Did you... did you eat him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down and poked his gut, hearing your wimpers from the other end.

You're very quickly regretting going off on your own. \"I'm gonna tell Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nu-uhhh!\", Selena said in a sing-song tone. \"Cus you're gonna get in trouble for running off if you do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Natalie grabbed your cheeks and stretched them out. \"Haha! You were right, 'Lena!\", she laughed. \"He's just as squishy and stretchy as you said he was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to swat them away again, only for Selena to press up against you, squishing your face between their arms as she whispered something in Natalie's ear. Because your ears were covered, you couldn't hear what she was saying, but whatever it was, it brought a creepy smile on her friend's face as she began to whisper into your sister's ear. Once they had finished, they separated and you were returned to your head slowly re-inflated. Selena then gave you a hug. \"I'm sorry for picking on you <i>big brother</i>\", she said in an almost mocking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we won't mess with you anymore\", Natalie said, with a snicker that made you more than a little suspicious. Because the three of you were nearing the front, however, you doubted that they'd do anything to you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... just leave me alone once we're off the ride.\" You were ready to be rid of these two bratty girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you made your way to the front, you were greeted by the same employee that had broken up the crowd, who rolled her eyes as she saw the three of you approach, while Natalie stuck her tongue out at her. They seemed to know each other. Natalie went first on her stomach, briefly looking back before she went down. As you walked near the opening of the slide, you heard the familiar cackle of your sister before you were pushed over into the water, falling flat on your belly right after Natalie, with Selena jumping in right afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelped as you hit the cold water, and blushed as you saw Natalie's feet and her big round bum staring right at you, but your attention was quickly grabbed by your sister's feet hitting yours. As the three of you gained speed, you quickly realized what was about to happen, but you were powerless to stop it as Selena lifted her legs just as you all hit the water! Natalie dove in, and you were pushed face-first into her rump, with Selena being forced forward, squashing you between both of the girl's butts! Because you and Natalie were underwater, no one saw what had happened, nor did they hear it. The girls laughed at their prank as they got up. \"That was hilarious!\", Nat giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\", Selena snickered. \"I wonder which one of us my brother got stuck to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! How about whoever he's stuck to gets to keep him for the day!\", Nat suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno... my mommy might get upset if he doesn't show up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena's hesitation was quickly broken as Natalie gave her puppy dog eyes. \"Pleeease... It'd be really nice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena blushed and smiled. \"A-alright... Let's check and see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the girls inspected themselves to see which one of their rear ends you were plastered against.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You could hardly recall what essentially just happened a few moments ago with the immediate headache you had going while drifting in the pool water. The only visions emerging were of ones with your sister and her dumb friend's huge bottom slamming together that influenced you to become an uncharacterized squishy blob formation of their accomplishment. You couldn't imagine the amount of harm that would have ensued if not for a life-saving pool jet knocking your body loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, you could barely recognize Nat and Selena if not by the aid of their swimsuits standing close by the shallow end of the pool's exit from the Splash Zone ride as park attendees passerby. The two seem rather persistent in their movement, getting you caught within their action waves, sinking you more in-depth below the water. The two busy examining themselves and each other countless times from front to back periodically with the same intention of presumably finding you. Yet Natalie showing more active in her efforts but found zero evidence that you ever stuck to either one. You were rather thankful the two didn't explore under the water. They would have quickly discovered your location right beneath their two feet if not confusing your presence to the soft squishy padding the pool safety tiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lena...your stupid brother ruined our plan! He isn't attached to either one of us,\" Nat whined with a pout after rechecking her butt, splashing the water around in her fuss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, it's ok, Nattie. We can find my dumb bro later and try again! Let's go down some of the other slides, and perhaps you can squish me instead?\" Selena implied with a joyful smile drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat yielded her smug grin to Selena's intriguing idea, \"You would let me do that! You're the bestie friend ever,\" she proclaimed as the two grabbed hands and hurried off for more mischief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were thrilled to evade one problem only to realize you came across another being connected to pool flooring. It was a few good minutes until the assistance of different people's enjoyment played a vital role in generating enough liberating force. You gradually floated to the top were you sat another long while. Generally, by now, some women or kid you conceived might have taken an interest in whatever it is your globule body signified drifting in the pool, but they all disregarded it. That warranted you an out of sight position gliding towards the pool drain's edge, where you only had to wait in anticipation for your body to reform shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour of striving to remain patient, you began to grow extremely fed up over how long it was taking your body. Only your eyes, nose, and a few nubs that were your arms and legs had recovered when you could be utilizing a better time having fun in the park. You suddenly felt a jolt happen. You assumed it for your body's chance to restore. Except that's when misfortune reared its ugly head on you with witnessing the previous girl operating the ride strolling past. You didn't notice at first, but she seemed young for someone to be working here. Her hair was brunette colored with blond highlights slightly wet from work in a messy ponytail, bearing a tightly fitted lifeguard one piece over her petite body with matching visor. Your fears came as she wandered closer towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo, stop! Put me down,\" you sought to yell as her hand immediately plucked you out of the pool, hindering your progress back to square one with a few good tender squeezings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck, what is this thing?\" she mentioned with a judgment of grotesque. However, it shifted quickly energetic after directly scenting your sweet strawberry aroma and squishable fondness. \"Another gummy doll? How many kids forgot they bring these,\" she smiled, witnessing your mushy half restored caricature face slimed amidst her fingers. She proceeded to glance around to detect if anyone was searching for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood boil with anger, it was one thing for your body not to regrow like normal, but at the moment this girl ruined all that hard-working progress. You stared back again at the girl, understanding suddenly why Selena's friend Natalie knew her now. They were nearly identical, down to a comparable smile, making you realize she must be her older sister Sarah, she always complains about being related too. Addressing the subject of smiles, Sarah had an opposite one that you see Nat typically give. She was much lewder similar to Selena's, presenting a prime example rubbernecking a busty older woman strolling as her hands clutch you collectively in a whimsical behavior, making you even more irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, guess I squished the little putty thing even further.\" Sarah giggled, \"Well, since no one seems to be searching for this one...I suppose no one will care if I keep it for myself! After all, the lost and found has several left behind already\". Sarah gleefully exclaimed, opening the top of her swimwear that was practically glued on to her body from hours of sweating and deposited the little toy within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened with disbelief as you plunged deep inside the suite and gummed between Sarah's tiny breasts. The blended scent of sunscreen and horrendous body odor instantly overwhelmed your nostrils, making you beg for a mouth to cry for help right now. You could virtually feel Sarah's hands through how surprisingly weak the fibers were as she commenced working on fleshing out your appearance to apply her small breast and better disguise you to the public while trapped within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There that..uh better,\" Sarah smirked with a blush, marking how the toy accidentally appeared to have made her breast size develop a little. She gave a swift jump test and observed the bounce that resulted in the doll's correlation showing it was entirely secure. \"Hopefully, no one will suspect anything. They seem rather real,\" Sarah reflects with embarrassment, walking to the break room and brushing up her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sarah!\" a familiar voice greeted out across the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jewel..,\" Sarah asked with confusion, viewing around until she recognized her latest best friend/coworker and responded with a wave. Sarah knew Jewel had recently moved into Silent Cove with her mother, and you believed younger brother. She had beautiful Dark chocolate skin, unusual green hair, and even more bizarre was her natural fragrance of mint. Sarah held a keen eye for body physic, and shortly after their quick friendship blossomed, she learned Jewel had a very athletic one with D-sized breasts and plump booty. The only thing left up to mystery for Sarah was to learn more about her history upon moving to the town. The two soon united and accompanied each other. Sarah started up the conversation about the hot day. But she could see Jewel's eye's leering at her chest the same way she gave many other women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Jewel exclaimed with shock and light flush over her nose bridge, \"You didn't just grow overnight, did you! I bet you're stuffing again?\" she added, forcing herself on Sarah's newly bust squeezing and bouncing them together to discover logic over the abrupt improvement. \"Wait..\" Sarah mustered, before giving out a muffled moan of enjoyment. \"Jewel, where on the job, remember!\" she huffed out in dubious pleasure, understanding well the roles playing out should be revered. Jewel released Sarah's new grown boobs. \"*Ahem*\" she cleared her throat, trying to play off her recent behavior, \"well...I wanted to get a bite to eat with you before closing?\" she clarifies as they strolled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were a hellhole. Sarah's b.O turned up to a higher degree, becoming a literal rainfall on you with how profusely she sweated coating you in her rank redolence. But worse, you landed you in an awful tangled position. Your cursed body developed into the unexpected perfect mold complexion of Sarah's newly fashioned breasts from the past performance that occurred somehow. If you didn't act fast, you probably be a permanent resident, which brought up your second dilemma, as you thankfully were a few good shakes free from salvation. Though you're not too fond of sinking any lower, the updraft scent was twice as wicked. You wished your mother to be here right now and save you. Something in your gut told you that your malleable body is going to be utilized into something better fastened to handle down there for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the park's announcement came as Sarah completely forgot about the toy and went to pick up Natalie. You could hear your mother crying your name out from your disappearance, only to be so close to a safe return. You cried, also hearing Sarah and Nat get on a bike being brought home with them and listen to Natalie's stories about her day. You were bouncing like crazy from Sarah's terrible riding, nearly shaking loose. When the two arrived home, you heard their mother, who Sarah greeted as Scarlett and went to her room. Where you then...</span></div></div>",

Sarah seemed not to notice but she had rushed to her room to change, the swimsuit peeled off ripping you from the sweaty flesh as you fell to the ground. You were now free to try and reform, but you didn't even get part of the way there when the brown haired girl spotted you again. Her eyes sparkled as she ripped you free from the material of the swimsuit, crushing and molding you between her hands and noticed your body soaking in the sweat that touched you. Not wanting to take a shower having worked in water all day this gave her an idea that was awful for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boobs were mostly dry due to you having been stuck with them most of the time so even knowing how bad her B.O. had been you weren't really prepared when she pressed your body into her rank pits. The sour taste was scrubbed into you as she made sure all the sweat was gone and then you barely tasted anything as she used you to swab the rest of her body but saving the 'best' for last. She ran her hands over you one more time admiring how little you actually felt like you were wet as well as the exciting feeling she got when she rubbed you against her skin. This time she twisted you sharply and yanked you out farther before lifting a leg over your stretched body. The still smelly cavern of her ass loomed over you as she slowly brought you to it. The booty and slit over road the bitter taste of her other sweat with a musky flavor and smell. Your body was pulled slowly back rubbing your face over her asshole and then pulled back until your face was over her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah started slowly, this toy was exciting her and she had started thinking naughty things to do with it as she ramped up rubbing herself with it. She almost moaned when she heard her door opening and tripped over herself landing booty down on her bed compressing you between the cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her mom \"Sarah? dinner is ready... what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah flustered quickly came up with something. \"I'm uh, trying out these new panties, they have a weird way of putting them on.\" She hastily punched and pulled until you were connected around her hips as well as covering her privets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother frowned a little. \"They look a little... small. but if they are comfortable why not wear them!\" She brightened up and left Sarah 'alone' in the room.</span></div></div>",

She had thought that you felt good before but now that you were hugging her hips she wondered if that wasn't what the little toy she found was actually for. Shrugging it off she tossed on some normal cloths to go down and finish dinner with her family. You realized that where she stopped your nose was buried directly on her anus and you tried to wiggle around to at least move away but it didn't exactly help at all, in fact the girl seemed to enjoy the little bit that you managed to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rushed down to the kitchen you were compressed flossing ever so slightly pulling in a fresh layer of sweat off and into your mouth. There wasn't a bit that was missed and when she sat down you got squeezed between the cheeks again as she wiggled into her chair seeming to enjoy the way you felt against her. \"So mom what's for dinner?\" Her voice was slightly muffled to you since she wasn't quite as plush as some other booties you had been under you were able to make out the conversation. Unfortunately it wasn't looking very good for you and you almost wished you didn't get the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spicy Taco Night! I got a new spice blend from my old friend so I wanted to try it.\" That sounded bad but your captor seemed excited and you could only whimper as the sounds of eating filled the air above you. The farting started only after about ten minutes, a hot blast directly into your face causing you to vibrate slightly from the ripping air. Sarah seemed to take notice of the reaction and shifted uncomfortably as a slight wetness spread over your 'front'. You gagged on the rancid air and your own inability to protect yourself from it. This was getting worse by the minute as another blast soon followed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel her standing up from the table again hopefully done with her fart inducing dinner. Where the heck was she going now.</span></div></div>",

It was an unnatural act of wearing a kid's gummy toy as makeshift panties. But something strange about the great texture felt comforting. Each turn set the pair pressing against her body. It tempted her to don them for several days. \"Thanks for the delicious dinner, mom. If you don't mind, I need to, uh study! So please don't disturb me,\" Sarah replied, clearing the table before proceeding to kiss her mother's cheek good night, and sprinting off back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were beginning to feel nauseous from this girl's consistent movement,  being chewed up and spat out inside her butt cheeks grew exhausting. You were confident the girl had no clue what she was doing also. So you decided another attempt at escaping was only your most suitable option. But upon your immediate, swift action, you felt the girl stop in her tracks. You instantly ceased likewise as her cheeks tightly dragged you deeper, clutching around your stretched body. You consider it as a sign she noticed but met her response with another atrocious fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Sarah halted in her step, unleashing an unobstructed moan as a long-winded fart echoed through the household due to her last meal. She quickly covered her mouth, her face red with sweaty embarrassment and slight indulgence. Sarah wanted to avoid seizing the attention of her mother for any further delay. She grabbed her crotch in efforts of fixing the panties out from the sudden displacement, soon realizing how soaking wet in heat she grew. Sarah couldn't wait any faster. Flying into her room, she locked it shut behind. She immensely relegated wearing a set of pants that required a belt. The moment she unbuckled the darn thing from her gut to enjoy her fashionable doll, she ruptured a pressurized fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally could breathe once again from the girl's disgusting moist round cheeks unsqueezing themselves. But, the precious minute didn't last long. You heard the intense rumbling sound approaching from your only viewpoint of her anus, as yet another roaring and a prolonged blast from her backside escaped. Your face nearly swept clean off as your ears began to ring. At the same course, portions of your panty body vibrated endlessly among her butt cheeks from the incredible hurricane force the vicious bass fart induced. The splattery remnants of revolting waste accompanying it set a decent firm skidmark blazing deep into your face's surface. When it was all over, the heavy miasma stench lingered your air space like a toxic plague. You tried to cough, but without a mouth, the smell slowly borrowed its way into your nostrils and surfacing to your body, things possible couldn't get any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah seemed amazed at how the toy admittedly knew how to bring joy to all ages. The unfortunate thing was soaking wet and sticking right to her body. The back portion was flossing up her ass so deep with feeble unpleasant wetness due to her fart. The outside surface held comparatively reliable as the inside absorbing her sweat, storing it within. Sarah didn't need to persuade herself any further. She planed to keep the little toy as panties for a long, long time and knew there was only one task left to commemorate the occasion. Sarah kicked off the pants of toppling forward on her bed to prepare herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sweltering hot while wrapped around the girl's body. You almost started crying from the torment, begging to be back home with your mom. But then you felt the front part of your body rubbing against her privates repeatedly. The girl's hand moved your front frame in action to deliver her stimulation. The rest of you began to pull in as well. You screamed, struggling to stop her in rebellion, only enhancing her pleasure. Soon she was playfully tugging on arm strings. The rest of your pliable body was overflowing in her juices and scent. Your face rubbed against her dirty anus as shortly choked down a load of her frontal fluids that dribbled its way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah repeatedly moaned as she used the toy's form as her vibrator for the night. Her legs were trembling as she massaged it against her pussy. The interior substance drove along her vulva so sensitively like a thousand small pleasure ridges hitting her clit in every tiny spot she wanted to the labia, making it one of if not the best experiences she had of all time. Sarah pulled on the waistband string repeatedly to drive the excitement extra. She was so close to finishing she pushed the hammock frame deep as her fingers could allow it, tearing the waist string apart as she screamed cumming like a geyser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly were destroyed by the girl's rough horseplay. Your entire body was sore all over, mopping up the rest of her fluids as in appear to pour endlessly. You probably absorbed more than two containers full when it finally settled. You only hoped maybe now she let you go after your destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sat within a pool of her sweat and cum, quickly removing the panties underneath by hauling at the remains without standing. She noticed the reason behind the breakage and sought to fix the mistake with haste. Using the doll's arms and legs, Sarah fastened a clean double knot before proceeding to squish them flat and repeated the deed twice extra of additional benefit. She then replicated the similar method on the other side to match, and with it testing the elasticity with a forbidding smile knowing doll was utterly secured as panties for good. Sarah couldn't resist but slip the crud doll back up to wear, as it immediately gripped to her body shape. She quickly cleaned up her nightly entertainment adoring with her doll's new purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelled now stuck to being this girl's panties for who know? You couldn't believe the extent of craftsmanship this girl had just put into reforming you back into panties. You're arm and legs were ceased entirely with no response from either of them. You tried to wiggle free but again, heard the pleasured moan of your persecutor as she massaged your body into her vag. The noise of her insufferable humming drove you mad, as you traveled with her body. You were helpless as she was...</span></div></div>",

I'm not sure that's a very good idea, Jack\", your mother said. \"Maybe it would be best if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted as Barbara pulled her aside. \"Come on, Trish\", she chuckled. \"If Andrew's able to look after Stevie, he's more than capable of keeping an eye on Jack.

He must have been bitten by Ian before coming over. \"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew soon noticed you and smiled. \"J-Jack! H-hey there!

The younger boy grinned as he led the two of you around the park like a couple of pets. \"So my sister's dumb cat bit you, huh?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... when I was taking out the garbage this morning...\", Andrew grumbled. \"My brother's been trying to stuff me down his throat all day... and Ash accidentally sat on me for the car ride over...\"<br>\r\nYou felt bad for Andrew. You had enough trouble on your own, but you managed to get out of your predicaments on your own. Andrew seemed to have a bit more trouble whenever Ian bit him. \"It sucks that we have to do whatever my little brother says... Sorry I got you into this mess, Jack...\" Your friend grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Stevie continued innocently marching along, you leaned over and whispered in Andrew's ear as you continued following him. \"Maybe we can lose him\", you suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack! That's messed up!\", Andrew loudly whispered. \"He might be a pain in the butt, but he's still my little brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! I mean get our moms or one of the older kids to watch him!\", you insisted. Even if you usually ended up in his belly, squished under his butt, or stuffed down his underwear, you would never consider being mean enough to ditch Stevie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I get you...\" Andrew looked around and saw that his little brother was still walking a couple of feet ahead of the two of you. \"We gotta find a good opportunity, though... if he finds out we're trying to get rid of him, we're going in his gut for sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the little boy continued walking, he suddenly stopped. It seems he's made his decision.</span></div></div>",

A few steps in, your run is broken as a firm voice pierces the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow just hold on there young man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a large hand grasp your shoulder and yank you back. You find yourself face to face with your annoyed mom as she dangles you above the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack Harper!\u201d she scolds as you struggle to break free from her grip. \u201cYou know better than to run off by yourself in a place like this. How many times have you had an accident here? You know the rules: you can ride the slides if me or Aunt Viv or Barbara is with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, Mom,\u201d you protest. \u201cDo I have to go with one of you? Can\u2019t I at least go with Andrew? He can look after me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear,\u201d your mom says. \u201cAndrew just isn\u2019t old enough to watch after you properly. I just don\u2019t trust another kid to make sure nothing happens to you. I would feel a lot better if your sister and you were with an adult.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around to see if at least she would come with you and Andrew on the slides, but he had already taken off. Kat and Kris had left too, but your mom didn\u2019t trust them either. And with Kat constantly pranking you and setting you up for catastrophe, she was right. But you weren\u2019t exactly thrilled to spend your day with your little sister and your mom and her friends either. Selena would surely whine and cry until she got her way, usually at your expense. And all of these women present challenges of their own for you. Barbara is inattentive at best, and at worst has a twisted side. You\u2019ve never been able to prove it, but you\u2019ve always suspected that she looks to squish you for her own amusement. Your Aunt Vivian, while sweet, is dumb as a bag of rocks. On top of that, she likes to drink, further impacting her already questionable judgement. And your mom is in full overprotective mode; if she even lets you on anything bigger than the kiddie slides, she will likely insist on carrying you in her arms (which doesn\u2019t exactly prevent you from being squished most times). While she is smarter than her sister, she does have her ditzy moments. She is good at protecting you from outside forces, but tends to let her guard down when it comes to herself. In spite of - and sometimes because of - her fiercely protective nature, she has squashed you as much as anyone else. You sigh as you are confined to a day with one of these ladies.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your sister prances around happily on the ground, as you sit annoyed in your mother\u2019s arms. She must have sensed your frustration because she offers up a suggestion to the group:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d she addresses Barbara and Vivian, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys take Selena around, and I\u2019ll keep an eye on Jack. This way we can all get to ride more slides, and Jack and I can have some mom-son time.\u201d The others agree, and walk off, leaving you to spend the day with your mom. You wish you could have gone with one of the others, as they would be more open to letting you try some of the bigger rides that are off-limits to you when your mom is around. Trish notices you pouting, and tries her best to cheer you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack, sweetie,\u201d she says as she sets you down, \u201cDon\u2019t think we can\u2019t have fun just because I\u2019m your mother. Come on, let\u2019s go get in line. I promise we\u2019ll have a great time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day starts off as expected, with your mom taking you on the smallest slides meant for the youngest kids. You sometimes run into Barbara, Viv and Selena, who\u2019s having a great time, but is still young enough not to know the difference. Before too long, you convince your mom to let you move up a size, and try some of the bigger rides. She reluctantly agrees, but insists on sharing a raft with you. When these rides go off without a hitch, you ask to try the next step up, and, feeling a bit more at ease, agrees again. Your pleading seems to work today, as you have managed to guilt-trip your mother to not sound like a party pooper. She actually managed to be a fun mom today. Not only that, but you have managed to avoid any hazards, aside from being slightly bent out of shape upon hitting the water. Today was shaping up to be a pretty awesome day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you decide to make your move. You point towards the towering slide overlooking Splash Zone and implore your mother to let you go. \u201cI don\u2019t know, honey,\u201d she says with a tinge of trepidation in her voice. \u201cThat one has always scared me when it comes to you. I just don\u2019t feel right letting you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Mom,\u201d you beg, putting everything in to getting a \u201cyes\u201d out of her. \u201cEverything\u2019s been fine today. You know I\u2019ll be in the pool when I come down. And you can go right after me. Please? Please\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d she concedes, finally giving into your puppy eyes and assurances. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to be right behind you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou each grab a raft and get in line. At the top, you are overcome with emotions at finally being able to do something normal kids can do. As you set into place, the attendant warns you to hang on, as riders tend to lose their rafts on the way down. With a slight shove, you are sent on your way. The water rushes up to meet you as you rocket through the tunnel at full speed. The incline gives, and you brace for a sheer vertical drop upon impact. Sure enough you feel your raft slip as you hit the water below. The raft floats to the end of the pool as you hit with a splash. That was awesome! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you bob to the surface, you see your mother waving to you at the top before she sits down into the tunnel. Suddenly a current from the impact hits you and knocks you back towards the slide. You attempt to free yourself but are caught by the water jets along the end of the slide. You hear a rumbling sound above, and look up to see a massive figure barreling down the slide directly towards you. You struggle vainly to swim away, but the jets are too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, look out!\u201d you call up to her. \u201cMom! MOOOOM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SPLASH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish touches down at the bottom of the pool. As she stands up, she notices that her raft had become stuck to her rear end, and pulls it off as she steps out of the pool and looks around for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew, that sure was fun, and I turned out to be worried about nothing. You were right, Jack, nothing will happen to you, as long as I\u2019m here with you...Jack? Honey? Jack? Honey? Now where did that boy go?\u201d Your mother figures you must have run off on her. While she was worried about you going off on your own, she figured that with the size of this place, she will find you later. Your going down the big slide on your own somewhat assured her you can take care of yourself, and she can have some time to herself taking her raft down the slides. Unfortunately she didn\u2019t notice that she had also lost her own raft going down the slide, and that it had tumbled off by yours. The \u201craft\u201d she had landed on, and was currently clutching in her powerful grip as she got back in line to use again, was in fact her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few hours, you did what you set out to do, and rode every slide in the park. What you didn\u2019t count on was that you would have to do it squashed under the weight of your mom. The afternoon was a blur of being slammed down at the start of the ride, the air being compressed out of your lungs as your mother sits on you, dashing any hopes you have of reforming, carrying her down a path of hot plastic, and cushioning her fall as she once again flattens you on the landing. This goes on for much of the day until....</span></div></div>",

Then the overly active woman took your hand and was already starting to drag you along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You totally made the right choice Jack, like we are gonna ride like every ride.\" She wasn't going to give you a choice either, she simply made a B-line for the first slide she saw. The cool thing was, Vivan might be dumb but she could at least follow the rules while she was sober, this lead to a fairly good time for you since she didn't insist on following you down faster than you could get out of her way and the first whole hour was just you and her having fun going down slides with absolutely nothing bad happening. The train came to a stop however when you were passing the sort of food and lounge area. They had not only a food stall but a drink bar as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to pull her towards the next slide but clearly she was the one with the power and she was already at the bar by the time you decided to try diplomacy. \"Uhh Aunt Vivan do you really think you should be drinking while we're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked confused at you \" I mean like, why not? Here I'll get you something too uhh milkshake?\" She laughed at the face you made \"Don't worry, it's fine\" She accepted the drinks and handed you a milkshake which probably made up for the pitstop so you could forgive her. The weird part about it was the 'tables' they were hot tubs or something sunk into the ground. Vivan sank into one and sighed contentedly. you choose to not get in and finish your milkshake. The moment you set it down though Vivan looked at you with a pouty face. \"Jaaack why don't you wanna get in the pool with your favorite aunt\" that sounded very drunk, but she only had one uhh glass of whatever and it wasn't even empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's a good-\" you stopped as you were yanked into the water, which unlike most of it was far above your normal temperature. She basically had you in a head lock pinning your mouth just under her armpit and the rest of your face in her side boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry so much, like, you're invincible or whatever\" She said seemingly not realizing or not caring that you were rapidly melting from the heat of the water. your protests kinda tickled her so she let go and sipped the last of her drink. you had to act fast! one hand on the edge you could almost pull yourself out but just as you did Vivan managed to find the bubble controls and a jet of water pushed you back into the pool. you tried to call to vivan as the pool was small and you were easily within reach but you melted enough that even making noise was hard and instead of watching you the ditzy blond was waving over her sholder to get another drink from the bartender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou were a liquid now and the bubbles made sure to churn you around much faster than you could figure out where you were, but you settled to being aware that you had spread out through almost the whole little pool by now. you could definitely FEEL Vivan's body sort of displacing you. Why hadn't she noticed yet! Trying to move your body was an effort in futility, although it kind of felt like you were pushing on her Vivan didn't seem to notice your efforts at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivan might have noticed the disappearance had she not been drinking, and because she was drinking someone else noticed her, unfortunately it wasn't someone that knew you were supposed to be with her and it was instead some of her friends. A short slightly chubby red head with a booty more than a match for even Barbara's and girl with black hair that probably couldn't see her feet with how big her boobs were. These were the bodies that displaced you to sit with Vivan and you doubled your efforts to get Vivan's attention, feeling as though you were somehow getting closer dispite still feeling sort of dispersed. it felt really weird having people sit in a 'puddle' of you and you'd rather get it over as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time something started happening it was too late because...</span></div></div>",

I'll watch Jack, maybe we can catch up with Andrew, you go Tan\" Well that was a decently sound argument, and if it worked out you'd get to hang out with Andrew anyway so you nodded in agreement. This seemed to placate Trish for the moment and she walked off with your aunt, Barbara gave a sweet smile but for some reason when she talked it sent chills down your spine. \"Follow me Jack, we're going to have [b]fun[/b] today\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDispite any uncomfortable feeling being alone with Barbara gave you the view from behind was still a sight to behold. Barbara as per the usual wore a bikini that left nothing to the imagination, a couple of tiny straps branching out from between her cheeks was the only thing that told anyone she was wearing anything at all. It was almost hypnotic the way it swayed back and forth, you could almost say she had a tail with the way she was wagging her hips. When the rushing water sound caught your attention you realized that you had gotten all the way to a water slide without even noticing! The lifeguard blew a whistle and everyone stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Barbara which uh, what slide is this.\" you asked nervously as you realized how high up you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over her shoulder, \"It's the Monsoon, didn't you say you wanted to go on all the slides?\" she asked not really expecting an answer, you were already near the front of the line after all. You had indeed boasted that you would ride every slide, but the monsoon was the most popular slide and had a height requirement didn't it? How was she going to get you past the lifeguard, they obviously didn't see you yet since you weren't the front person but you'd never meet that requirement for the thrill ride. Another whistle and it was Barbara's turn in front of you, but as she went to step into the water she lifted one of her feet higher and started leaning back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were almost sure that she hadn't been going to slip but by the time you realized she was falling back her booty was already making contact with your face. The force of such a fall was far more than enough to squash you flat, pressing your face into the shape of her impressive behind. Your back was in contact with the soft mat they had for people to stand on while they waited for their turn. Thankfully Barbara lifted herself up immediately apologizing to everyone for being clumsy, although not acknowledging you directly, less fortunately when she lifted up...</span></div></div>",

Hopefully she would manage to brush you off before she got on the ride, but that idea went out the window when her hands came back and the 'dusting' motion actually pressed you a little farther in. After making sure Barbara was okay she was allowed to step into the water again, sitting down you now felt the fast moving water rushing over you but held in place by the pressure of her sitting the water couldn't drag you down. When she pushed off the sensation of riding the slide replaced the crushing and besides not being in the right shape and having a face full of ass it could even be described as fun! the twists and turns would have had you squeeling with joy if you could have gone down alone. But of course nothing could ever be that easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the second to last turn Barbara was moving too fast and just barely scraped her booty on a side of the slide,one of the gaps where the slides connect, and while she probably didn't feel it that crack sure did catch onto you. You were ripped free of the jiggly globes, being pulled out as your hair was still stuck to the Bikini you were pulled down the slide until you were probably just as thin as the Bikini. That's when it happened, somehow your body had enough pull at the same time or maybe the knots were loose but somehow you ripped the thing right from her booty and freed from the anchor that held it your body slingshot back launching the thong like article over the side and into the distance, somehow coming loose from your hair as it flew in the opposite direction. All of this took seconds to pass, so fast that you almost didn't know what happened, but after about five seconds of rushing water you were wiggled loose and your now string like body flew down the slide and into the wave pool below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to reform quickly but there was Barbara standing in the water with a small smirk on her face, almost like she knew exactly what had happened reaching out to grab hold of your string body. \"Oh darn, I thought I lost my sling bikini bottoms, hmm but these aren't the same color and it's only one string..\" She sounded like she was mocking you, you tried to wiggle at her and realized that dispite your stringy form you didn't have your mouth covered just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Barbara! I'm not your bikini it got flung off somewhere!\" She put a surprised look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaaack! I had no idea! but how am I going to go look for it without a 'temporary' replacement.\" She implied still keeping up her surprise with a hint of something predatory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't catch on, responding immediately. \"I'll help i can-\" She took those words and immediately ran her finger up your length silencing you so she could take you out of context.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks that's so generous, I'll let you out as soon as I find my bottoms m'kay\" It took her seconds to split you and tie you up into the same shape as her previous sling bikini. The water muffled any smell or taste that might be down there and you couldn't even protest as she slid into you and got out of the pool. The cheeks you had so admired only a few minutes before now ground you between them as Barbara mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"let's see, now that I've got bottoms I should go..\"</span></div></div>",

The movement of her large cheeks rubbed you from either side as she walked calmly towards the lost and found, you felt the heat beating into you but thankfully you had sunscreen on so you weren't melting. The slight amount of sweat that build up was instantly whisked away as your body greedily soaked up the body fluids. You felt a distinct change in temperature as she entered the help building and sauntered over to the lost and found desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, I'm afraid I might have lost a bikini bottom, could I take a look in here?\" There was a board teen sitting across from her that wasn't really paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changing rooms over there, take whatever nobody ever comes for the stuff.\" She pushed a box across the desk from under it and Barbara took it and went around to the back. This must have been the fastest you've ever been freed from Barbara sitting on the bench now with her grinning down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't so bad now was it, let's take a look at the options.\" She started rummaging through the box and pulled out a few different designs of bikini bottom. \"Let me know how they compare, especially to my originals I'm not going to wear something without feedback.\" You gulped as you lay there trying to gently reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.\" Your eyes drifted down to her bare booty, and the bit of pain and smell you had just gone through seemed to escape your mind as she slipped a red 'traditional' that was a bit too small. Clearly it was meant to cover her but it just couldn't contain all the ass and was sinking rapidly into her crack. \"I-It's a little small,\" You offered as she looked over her sholder for feedback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't agree more, it looks okay but I do NOT want something so tight on without enough stretch.\" She tossed the red pair back in the bin instead pulling up a piece of string attacked to a tiny patch of fabric in the shape of a heart that covered her 'exposed' part. She did a little spin for this one. \"What about this one Jack? Too much?\" Your mouth opened and closed a couple of times as she teased her fingers on the tiny little strings trying to adjust it. \"No you're right, it's too irritating, nothing to the imagination but it's just going to be annoying me all day.\" She tossed it back in as well. You were now reformed mostly but your arms and legs were still tangled up you weren't really out of the danger zone. She pulled the last one she had chosen out and slipped the very similar to her original white bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Those ones are pretty close to the ones you lost.\" You said as Barbara scanned over you again and spanked herself watching your head bob up and down with the jiggle you didn't even realize you were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara put a finger on her lips as she slipped out of them. \"Just one pair left to compare, Just want to make sure.\" She said and you were wondering what she meant before she steamrolled you again and pulled you right back between her cheeks. She admired how she looked in the mirror. \"Hmm, you don't match but ooh do you feel much better than the other ones.\" She practically purred as you screamed into her butt. \"That said...\"</span></div></div>",

You were relieved at first until you realized that she had tossed you onto the lost and found box, unfortunately you couldn't exactly complain right at that moment as you were still too squished from her flattening you out. She started carrying you out, her boobs keeping you from calling out to her as she carried the box under her chest. You were going to complain to her once you reformed and walked out of there but for now you just sighed at her moment of dizziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a look at the teen who didn't even glance at you as she started putting the box back under her desk, but right before you were out of sight you heard a voice calling out. \"Wait, I need that lost and found.\" The voice called and you heard the teen grumble before plopping you right back over the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, take the whole thing for all I care.\" She said dismissively about the property she was supposed to be looking after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now looking directly up at the woman that called out, a strawberry blond with decent sized chest, although you couldn't see her lower half as you were forced to look up. She accidentally trapped you in the same manner as Barbara had and rushed off to the changing rooms. You readied yourself to call out to her when she got to the dressing room but as soon as she did the box was dumped over leaving you smashed at the bottom of the pile. You wondered why she wouldn't just dig through the box but soon started hearing a strange sound and her cursing at herself. *SNAP* \"Damit, come on Judy it's not that hard\" *SNAP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pile was getting lower and lower and finally you were revealed to the world again and you could see as all of the non bottoms were shuffled off of you, you saw a small line of bottoms next to you and then looked at the blond again and your eyes widened. If Barbara had a Juicy butt this woman was World class and she wasn't wearing any bottoms, so maybe she was trying them like Barbara had been. You tried looking around and noticed on the other bench a far larger pile of bottoms. The difference was that they all seemed to have one or two of their straps ripped apart or even right down the back exploded out. She had a frustrated look on her face now as she grabbed one of the pairs from your side and pulled it up her legs, started struggling half way up her thighs and by the time it was half way on her ass the straps gave out and *SNAP* She growled and tossed them aside grabbing the last pair besides you they must have been at least a size above what Barbara had originally made you and they had the same result as all the others. You were so stunned by how quickly she was mowing through them you forgot to scream before her hand closed around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to get her attention but it was too late, you were being brought up her legs extra swiftly. You didn't even manage to cry out as you impacted the cheeks and she started having trouble. \"Come on, last pair You can do it!\" She cheered you on or maybe herself as she painfully yanked your 'straps' up and up until finally they were around her hips and your face was sinking farther. She pinched the top of your head and pulled you in tight as you slid past picking up all of her earthy sweat along the way. You weren't centimetres away from her anus and she pulled you even closer until you were basically kissing it. Your body was trying to pull back from the pressure but only just barely sunk into her doughy flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy blinked at the ultra small (to her) bottoms hadn't snapped and swung her booty towards the mirror to admire it slapping her ass sending the flesh jiggling and causing every ripple to pull you just a bit tighter. She started leaning forward finally getting you to react as you had been holding back to not cry out from the pain but as she touched her toes and your body was yanked even tighter you tried to scream. Unfortunately it was right into her butt hole so rather than sound all that happened was a very mild pleasant buzz as she straitened back up noting that you did not snap like all the other pairs. \"Well now, That's a relief\"</span></div></div>",

She didn't even run and you were questioning just how good a job Barbara's knots were doing since they had been flattened out into an amalgam by Judy's rough treatment. You wished your arms were just detachable at this point but by the time she stopped moving it was obvious you wouldn't escape unless someone were to rescue you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand Judy was quite happy with her new bikini bottom, not only did it not break but it didn't leave her feeling uncomfortable like many others she had tried in the past. \"Heyy~ Sorry I'm late, those itty bitty bottoms they gave me just could not hold up.

She reached the ladder and began to climb each rung on the ladder seemed to get you closer to coming loose and falling off the woman.

Down below you see Selena climb into her friend\u2019s mom\u2019s minivan. A few minutes later, you see Kat walk out, ready to join her friends downtown. You breathe a sigh of relief as the two people who had the best chance of ruining your day are out of your hair for a good length of time. As you sit on your bed, you begin to ponder how you will spend today. Andrew and his family are out of town, so it looks like it will be up to you to create your own fun. You decide to spend the day catching up on your gaming. Without Selena fighting over the TV, Kat tormenting you, or Andrew holding you back, you might be able to finish off some of your games today. You reach out for the door, ready to step into the hallway, feeling great. You have the house to yourself, except for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*WHOMP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door snaps open, smashing into you full-force, before swinging back and squashing you against the wall. You then hear the voice of the person responsible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my little angel?\u201d, your mother cheerfully sings as she steps into your room. \u201cJack? Ja-ack? Where did you go?\u201d After searching your room for a few minutes, she finally notices your feet sticking out from under the door. She pulls it back to find you flattened against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are, you silly little guy,\u201d she giggles as she reaches to peel you off the wall. \u201cWere you going to jump out and scare your Mommy? Good thing I\u2019m too smart for that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to reform, Trish continues while carrying you over to your bed. \u201cJack, sweetie, I know it\u2019s been tough adjusting to your sister, and having Kat stay with us hasn\u2019t been easy either. But now that we have the house to ourselves, I was thinking we could have a day of mother-son bonding, just the two of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are torn as to what to say. On the one hand, it would be nice to not have to share your mom with anyone else for a day. On the other hand, your mom is a walking contradiction for whom you are sometimes grateful she has to divide her attention between multiple kids and a cat. When other people are around or you are out in public, she is a mama bear. But when it\u2019s just you and her, she is an oblivious elephant. The incident with the door just now is a prime example (your mother has never learned to open doors gently  - even as an infant, you would find yourself pinned to the wall, sometimes for hours at a time): she often assumes that when it\u2019s just you and her, you are safe, leading her to lose track of where you are. And in her exuberance and absent-mindedness, she can become just as much of a hazard as anyone else. When this happens, she never seems to figure out what went wrong, and assumes that you are either playing a game, or lecturing you that you have to be more careful. And while she sometimes tries to get involved with the things you like (with results ranging from comical to disastrous), other times she comes up with a set of activities or projects involving heavy physical activity, and often end with her clumsiness putting the \u201cbonding\u201d in \u201cmother-son bonding.\u201d Nevertheless, you look up and see the anticipation in your mother\u2019s eyes, and you know the wrong answer would break her heart. Besides, you may not get another chance to spend time with her again for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Mom,\u201d you say. \u201cLet\u2019s spend the day together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself squished again as your mom gives you a big hug. \u201cOh, Jack,\u201d she says, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have so much fun today!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, your mom will be too busy working today, so that you can have that nice, relaxing time to yourself that you originally planned on. You do your best to feign disappointment as you react to her news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright, Momma,\u201d you reply, doing your best to hold back any sign of elation in your voice. \u201cWe can always do that another time.

You try to protest, but are momentarily unable to speak as a result of the cheek-pinching your mom gave you moments ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, sweetheart,\u201d Trish says in response to your moaning. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you wanted to do today. But time will go by so fast when we do it together. And who knows, maybe we will have some fun.

That one with the big ol' pinchers\", Andrew replied excitedly. The two of you loved looking for cool looking bugs. Your backyard wasn't the best place to look for them, since most of it was taken up by the clothesline and the shed where your mother worked on her hobbies (not to mention your sister's toys that she left out). Even with the swimming pool, Andrew's backyard was a lot bigger, and there were also a lot of bushes for bugs to hide in. Andrew headed inside his house and got a couple of plastic cases to hold any bugs the two of you found.<br>\r\n\"Let's split up! We can find more that way!\", your friend suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... the last time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Jack!\", Andrew pouted. \"That big spider only got you because you didn't call for help.\" 'The spider' incident happened last year when the two of you were looking for bugs. You had split up and had cornered a huge spider, easily the size of your palm and were about to catch it. It suddenly jumped on your face and slowly ate you bit by bit. You were so frightened and disgusted by what was happening that you froze in terror until the spider somehow managed to stuff all of you into it's tiny maw. Andrew found the spider (which had grown huge by that point) and kept it in a large aquarium until you were pooped out... though because no one noticed you, the spider chowed down on it's squishy meal again when you reformed until you were finally discovered a couple of days later. You wound up learning the ins and outs of an arachnid's digestive system in a rather humiliating manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it!\", you whined. \"It's real easy for you to tell me to just call for help, but you've never had a big scary bug munching on you before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew sighed, knowing you weren't going to stop arguing until you got him to understand. \"Well, look. Stevie and his friends are supposed to be coming over later today, and they'll prolly want to come back here. So we don't have a lot of time to look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed nervously. Stevie on his own was bad enough. You didn't want to know how bad his friends would be if they got their hands on you. \"Yeah... I guess you're right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, great! You take those bushes over in the corner of the fence, and I'll look in the ones by the house. Lemme know if you find anything, okay?\", Andrew said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" The two of you then parted ways to try and find some creepy crawlies within the amount of time you had to look.

Ian pouted before he reared back, wriggling his rump before pouncing again! You yelped as you avoided him once more, but he was starting to get angry, hissing as he slowly began to creep up to you until you had backed into the corner of the fence. \"A-Andrew!\", you called out to your friend. \"Help me!\" Satisfied that you had nowhere to run, Ian wriggled his rear once more before pouncing. You closed your eyes in fear, expecting to get sliced to ribbons. However, you were surprised to find that nothing had happened. You opened your eyes and looked up to find that Andrew had grabbed Ian off the ground, the kitty hissing and squirming around in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Jack!\", Andrew assured you as he wrestled with the chubby black cat. \"I got hi- OWW!\" He was interrupted as Ian sunk his teeth into his arm, quickly dropping the kitty as soon as he was bitten. \"Owwww...\" As Andrew rubbed his arm, you gasped, realizing what had happened. This happened not to long ago, and Andrew was turned squishy like you for a while. Ian grinned and pounced at Andrew, though you quickly grabbed him and ran toward his house. Ian was hot on your trail, but you managed to reach the sliding glass door in time and shut it right behind you, causing the kitty to slam into it and squish his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you panted as you sat on the couch. \"Th-that was a close one...\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...\", Andrew groaned, pressing into his head and causing an indention to form. \"Not this again! I hope my brother doesn't find us...\" The boy shuddered as he remembered the last time he had been bitten by Ian. It didn't take long for Stevie to find him and have some \"fun\" with his big brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can go over to my house\", you suggested. \"My momma won't let anything happen to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

As the two of you continued watching cartoons and occasionally checking to see if your sister's cat was still outside. Finally, you saw Selena picking him up and carrying him home, thinking you had a chance to get home without ending up in Ian's furry tummy... but you would soon find out that might not have been so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACK!\", you heard a painfully familiar voice called out. You looked over and saw Andrew's little brother, Stevie, running over to the both of you. This was <b>really</b> bad. The younger boy gave you enough trouble, but Andrew was usually able to keep his brother from playing with you. After being bitten by Ian, he wasn't in any condition to help you, and was in danger himself. The four year-old scuttled over to the two of you and you both instantly grew worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi Stevie\", you answered nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy and cousin Ash went to the store and she said I can play wif you and Bubba\", he said. \"I wanna play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stevie, w-we can't play now\", Andrew said, trying not to sound scared and hoping his little brother didn't find out he was squishy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah\", you stammered. \"It's t-too hot out side and I, uh, I might melt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh\", Stevie whined. \"I 'ust saw you finding buggys.

I wanna- Huh?\" Stevie looked down and saw both yours and Andrew's hands squishing in his grip. An almost creepy grin formed on his face as he looked up at both you and his now-vulnerable big brother. \"You all squish, Bubba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew yelped as the two of you pulled your hands out of the younger boy's grip. \"L-leave us alone, Stevie! We just wanna watch TV!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wanna play!\", Stevie demanded as he stomped his foot in a way that would seem adorable to anyone else. \"You both squish, so I the boss, and I say we play!\" It seemed there wasn't going to be any reasoning with the little boy. He only saw the two of you as toys, or possibly snacks, and no amount of bargaining was going to keep him from his playtime. You both screamed as you jumped in opposite directions just as he hopped on top of the couch, both of you jumping down and running out of the living room. \"I gonna catch you!\", he laughed as he got down and started running toward the two of you. You and Andrew ran in and out of just about every room in the house, but he'd follow you into each one. It was a big house, but you were still in an enclosed area. He was likely to catch at least one of you eventually...</span></div></div>",

Your little brother didn't respect your boundaries when you were at your normal state as it was, but when you were squish-ified, you weren't even a person to him anymore, treating you as if you were just another one of his toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-get away from me!\", you cried back as you rounded the corner, seeming to lose him before you ran into your room and hid under your bed. From your hiding spot, you saw the chubby toddler's feet walk across your floor as he searched for you. He dug into your dirty laundry and opened your closet, but found no trace of his now-squishy big brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where aaaare you, bubba?\", Stevie called out in a singsong voice, as if he'd get a response from you. \"Bubba, I wanna play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to keep quiet as you watched Stevie dig through your toys, wanting to yell at him to keep his hands off, but knowing that the slightest sound would alert him to your location. It was embarrassing to think that you were afraid of your little brother who was only half your age, but getting bullied by him would be even more humiliating. Stevie continued digging though your toys, seeming to want to draw you out, but stopped after a little bit after it looked like he was giving up on searching for you. From your position, you couldn't see if your brother was out of the room, but you saw his feet walk past you and heard the door close. \"Phew!\", you sighed in relief. \"He's gone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you saw the cute face of the four year old peak down underneath the bed, grinning as he knew he outsmarted you. \"Aha! Got you, bubba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelped as he reached his hand under your bed to pull his toy out to play with. You tried to scoot back as far as you could, but you were unsuccessful in evading capture as he grabbed ahold of your hand. \"S-Stevie! Lemme go!\", you cried as you struggled in vain to escape your little brother's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nopenopenope!\", Stevie giggled as he pulled you out from under your bed. \"Now you gonna squish!\" You tried to pull your hand out, only for him to grab your other hand, now truly dooming you. He giggled as he grabbed both of your hands and turned around before pulling you up to eye-level with his butt before dropping back down, flattening your body with a *SQUELCH*! You let out a muffled groan as your brother sat on top of you, laughing after having easily overpowering his big brother. \"Wimpy wimpy, bubba!\", he sung as he as he wriggled his rump on top of his seat cushion, causing you to let out a muffled scream. This was too humiliating to stand. Sure, Jack knew how it felt to get squashed by Stevie, but he mocked you even more when he played. Big brothers were supposed to be stronger and not get bullied by their little brothers. To him, that meant that you weren't his big brother anymore. Just another toy. He soon stood up and laughed as he saw you reduced to nothing but a butt print with your arms to the side before he peeled you off the floor. He then began to squish and compress you down, rolling you into a little ball. Your eyes blinked as you looked out at him as he held you in front of his face, panicking as you saw him lick his lips. \"Ahhhh...\" His mouth opened wide and you wanted to scream as he dropped you in, letting you fall on his wet pink tongue before snapping his jaws shut. You mentally whimpered, knowing what was coming next. He quickly moved your balled up body to one side with his tongue, his teeth crushing your body, quickly relieving the pressure as he opened his teeth again before smashing his teeth together once again. \"Mmmm~\", he moaned as he held his cheeks while continuing to chew you up, his saliva soaking into your body. \"Nana pudding~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as he kept chewing you up as if you were just a piece of gum. He would soon walk out of your room and into the hallway. Unfortunately, you knew that your monster of a little brother had other plans for his big brother bubble gum...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both you and Andrew managed to squeeze underneath Ash's door, which was always kept locked. As you both squeezed your malleable bodies underneath and into the room of Andrew's cousin, you could hear Stevie dropping to the floor and throwing a fit. Normally, kids weren't allowed in Ash's room. You were only in here once when Ash ate you one Halloween, but you never actually saw the inside. Almost immediately upon entering, you could see why he didn't want anyone inside. Your nose was almost immediately hit with something awful smelling. You weren't sure where it was coming from, but something smelled like a skunk sprayed somewhere. \"Ugh... I can see why he doesn't let us in here\", Andrew retched as he held his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around the room, picking up this weird sculpture thing you found. \"Huh... I wonder what this is?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like... a spoon?\", Andrew grabbed it and looked at it. \"Weird... it's made of glass... and it's got holes in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's supposed to be for soup or something... and the holes are to drink the broth?\" The two of you were interrupted as you heard the door unlock. \"Uh oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\", Andrew whispered. \"If my cousin catches us in here, he's gonna kill us! We gotta hide!\" Unfortunately, under the bed simply wasn't an option. Ash's bed had drawers stuck to the bed frame. Unless you squeezed into the drawers, he was definitely gonna catch you. You were actually on good terms with Ash, but that was definitely gonna change if he caught you messing with his stuff when you knew it was off limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... the sheets!\", you whispered, not seeing anywhere else coming to your mind. As you heard the doorknob open, you both gasped and crawled onto his bed and covered yourself with his sheets just as the teenager walked in. He was wearing a purple button up shirt, orange cap, and a black apron as well as a pair of black skinny jeans. It seemed he had just gotten back from his part time job at the local pizza parlor, Mama Camilla's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned in annoyance as he took his cap and apron off and locked the door behind him. \"Stupid ass customers... I hate this fuckin' job sometimes...\" The two of you lied there and waited as Ash reached into his drawer and pulled out a box, hearing a grinding noise not long afterward before he looked around. Your vision was partially impaired by the sheets, so you couldn't entirely see what he was doing. \"What the... those little brats have better not been in my room!\" You and Andrew silently gulped in unison as you slowly crawled back. Ash was clearly in a bad mood. If he caught you, you were definitely going to get punished. Fortunately, Ash seemed to calm down a bit. \"Oh, here it is.\" He reached over and grabbed the weird glass spoon and put something inside. \"That's right... Kris was here the other day...\" As he began to undress, you felt a bit worried. While you had never told anyone before, you had a bit of a crush on Ash. You had it in your head that when you got older, you'd be able to tell him how you felt, but knowing that he was hanging out with your cousin made you worried that he might snatch him away before you were able to tell him. As he tossed his shirt down, you heard the flick of a lighter and the weird smell began to get stronger. He seemed to stand there, coughing a bit for a bit before he set the weird spoon down. Your face then turned bright red as you saw him squeeze out of his skinny jeans, revealing that he had been going commando for his work shift as his plump pale buttcheeks jiggled as they were freed from their constricting denim prison. You were so entranced by the fleshy moons that you didn't notice them beginning to descend on top of you. Andrew attempted to leave and pushed the covers off, only for the two of you to be squashed beneath both of Ash's ass cheeks with a *SQUELCH*! You and Andrew squirmed a bit as your upper halves were flattened beneath his cousin's rump, but he oddly didn't seem to notice as he went back to his glass spoon. You had no way of knowing that he was smoking (his way of dealing with stress form work), and was too high to notice that he was sitting on his little cousin and his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

She had gone for a jog with your mother probably, if the now sweat soaked sports bra and tight booty shorts were any indication. You looked back, Andrew didn't even acknowledge his mother entering the room, he was still watching T.V. You tried to refocus on it but your eyes were drawn back towards Barbara, the way the sweat was making her body shine was really eye catching for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black clothing really popped out against her bronzed skin, the smell from far away was even slightly sweet, you just hoped she didn't catch you staring as she made her way over. The reason she didn't however was more because she was chugging a bottle of water while she walked than it was she didn't pay you any mind. She was standing right in front of you by the time she was finished, turning around before she let her head down to look. The huge rear end was now engulfing your vision, and probably andrew's too since you sat close to each other on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom get-\" Andrew had started but as you had realized too late as well the toned sweaty ass was heading right for you! Andrew being taller got impacted first and in your effort to move you merely got an arm out before her full weight depressed both you and Andrew into a butt print in the couch. There was an audible squelch as she leaned back lifting and then setting down again with another squelch to get comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I'm much sweatier than I thought if the couch is making that sound as soon as I sit down.\" She shifted her weight more onto you and then more onto Andrew, receiving a softer squishing noise. You tried to yell at her when her weight lifted off of you but only recived a mouth full of wet, salty fabric before the weight was shifted back onto you. You could hear the channel being changed and once more the weight shifted and shifted back rewarding Barbara with more of the soft squashing sound and you and Andrew with being rubbed down into smears on the tight shorts. She obviously found the sound funny giggling a little more as the noise sounded again and her constant shifting hand even sucked your arm back under her massive rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could barely make vibrations on her rear for around ten minutes until both you and Andrew were so flat and smeared that you were no longer making any noise when she shifted her weight. That was when she settled down and the sound of the door opening and someone else dropping onto the couch like a sack of potatos could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way that you could get her attention now that you had been abused so thoroughly but it was definatly you mom, Barbara always pushed her to exaustion when they did a jog. They exchanged some words but clearly Trish was in no mood to talk right then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll shower first and then you can, don't fall asleep on the couch again.\" She said as she was starting to lift up, you tried to move but in the end you found that...</span></div></div>",

I'll shower over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, hun. See you two later.\" Barbara watched as Trish took your flattened form home before she headed to the shower. As your mother walked you to your house next door, you couldn't help but wonder if you had forgotten something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Andrew's POV]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mom stood up, you panicked as you remained plastered to her spandex-clad booty. Sure, she had sat on you before when you didn't turn the tv down when she asked or didn't get off of your games, but you were never squashed face-first into her sweaty buttcheek. This was the first time that something like this had happened to you, and you were beginning to see why Jack hated it so much. You felt every jiggle and vibration of your mother's buttcheek with each step until she made it to the bathroom. when she undressed, you could feel the fabric slowly being ripped from her sticky bronze flesh as it slid off of her booty and down her thighs. Once she had slid her shorts off, she kicked them to the center of the tile floor and squeezed out of her sports bra. It was going to be really tough for you to look at your mom without being reminded of this when you got out of here. As you heard the shower being started, you took the chance to try and peel yourself off of your mother's shorts. With a good amount of wriggling and vibrating, you had managed to release the grip that the fabric had on you, though you were still flat as a pancake. Perhaps it was because you didn't have as much experience with this as Jack did. Still, at least you weren't still stuck to your mom's booty shorts. You tried to move your body around somehow, managing to clear four tiles by flopping around, with your face slapping against the floor before you decided to try and focus on returning to a human shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you didn't get very far before the water had stopped and she finished her shower. She didn't even dry off before she stepped out, having left her towel on the bathroom sink. You briefly felt the water drip off of her body as she stepped over you, seemingly not noticing you on the floor, at least for the moment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If you weren't face-down on the floor, you would have panicked as your mother slipped on the tile floor. You were unable to see the pair of bronze, fleshy meteors descend before Barbara's ass crashed into you with a loud *SLAPPP*! What little air was left in you was forced out as your pancaked body was flattened even further, the impact causing your newly gooey body to splatter beneath her huge butt! You were knocked silly by the sudden slap of assflesh and your mom's weight crashing into you. Your mom soon stood up, bringing you up along with her. \"Owww...\", Barbara groaned as she rubbed her ass. \"Really should've dried off first.\" As your mom ran her hands repeatedly over her cheeks, it became clear to you that she didn't feel any difference between you and her flesh! She then turned around and bent over to grab a towel, giving you a clear view of your body through the mirror. If your mouth hadn't been completely obliterated, you would have screamed. You were almost completely indistinguishable from the rest of your mother's assflesh, only maybe a couple of shades more pale, and the only indication that you were plastered to your mom's big booty was a pair of worried-looking eyes on each of her cheeks! You tried to make some sort of movement or sound to alert her. You wished you had asked Jack how he got out of situations like this. Information like that would be really helpful right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Barbara dried her body off, you could feel the movement of her flesh each time she moved her legs to dry them off. Then came the part you feared as she stretched the towel against her booty. Your mom repeatedly pulled on the sides of the towel from one end to the other, rubbing down her booty like she was polishing a prized trophy. You wanted to scream as your skin was scrubbed back and forth, managing to close your eyes before the fibers of the towel scrubbed into them as well. The pain was intense, like getting an Indian burn, but across your whole body, and even harder. As your mom moved onto other parts of her body, her cheeks continued jiggling for a moment as you opened your eyes, and you panicked even more at what you saw. The difference in skin tone was now completely gone! Except for your eyes, there was no way to tell where your body began and your mother's booty ended! As your mother finished drying off. She then went to get dressed for the night and pulled a blue thong up her thighs and up her asscrack, yanking on the sides a bit and letting them slap against her hips. She then pulled up a tight pair of white tiger print leggings and threw on an old Black Sirens shirt. It seemed that she wasn't planning on going anywhere for the rest of the night. As your mother made dinner for you, Stevie, and Ash (though only your mom, brother, and cousin would be eating tonight), you hoped that Jack would tell his mom what happened to you. With every second you spend being compressed by your mom's leggings, it was beginning to make you angry. You had come through for him so many times, and the one time you needed his help, he was nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, dinner was ready and your mom called for you, she was mildly surprised when only Ash and Stevie came in. \"Where's Andrew?\", Barbara asked. \"If he doesn't make it to the table, he's not getting a single bite of lasagna.\" You wanted to cry as you heard that. Lasagna was your favorite, and you always ate more than anyone else whenever your mom made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he went to the arcade with Miss Harper\", Ash suggested. \"She took Jack and Selena, maybe he tagged along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... that does sound like him. I'll just leave him some for when he gets back.\" As your mother served everyone the lasagna, you silently wept at missing out on your favorite meal. Your self-pity was interrupted as Barbara plopped her big ol' booty onto her chair, making an audible slap as you your mother pressed her full weight on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaaaaack...\", you mentally whined as you were squished into the hard wooden chair. \"Why haven't you told your mom what happened to me? Or my mom?\" You were more than a little upset that the boy that was supposed to be your best friend forgot about you, but you remembered that you sometimes forgot about helping him whenever you were presented with something you liked. \"He'll remember... I know he will...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally groaned each time your mother wriggled her rump into her seat as your family ate your favorite meal without you. You could almost smell the delicious aroma, although as you tried to sniff the air, you were reminded of where you were and smelled only your mother's ass. You were thankful that she had just showered, but it still wasn't all that pleasant. As your family finished eating, you heard a familiar little belch, belonging to your little brother. \"That was yummy 'sanya mommy!\", Stevie giggled as he rubbed his stuffed tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was delish\", said Ash as he wiped his mouth. \"Thanks, Aunt Barbara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well someone was hungry\", Barbara chuckled. \"You two cleaned up the entire platter. I guess Andrew's just gonna miss out. That's what he gets for leaving without saying anything.\" You mentally whined knowing that your family didn't seem to care that you wouldn't be eating. This was getting worse with every minute. You heard the clanging of dishes and silverware, signalling that everyone had finished with their dinner. \"Would you mind doing the dishes for me, Ash?\", Barbara asked as she walked away. With each step, you could feel every wobble of your mom's plump booty, the rapid motion almost making you dizzy. You were there as your mom gave your little brother a bath and put him to bed before she locked the door and turned off the lights for the night, seeming to assume you were staying at Miss Harper's house. She then took a seat on the couch and watched TV as you could faintly hear what she was watching, some program you've never heard of called Spectrum Bay Wrestling Alliance. The soft leather of the couch was more comfortable than the hard wooden chair at the dinner table, but it still didn't feel good being squashed under your mother's weight. Not long after she sat down, you could hear the phone ringing. Any hopes you had of it being Jack or Miss Harper were quickly crushed. \"Hey, Camilla, what's up? ...yeah, I'm watching... of course I see you, it's impossible not to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were both physically and emotionally crushed. You couldn't believe that Jack had forgotten you like this. He was supposed to be your best friend, and you helped him out of some of his toughest predicaments, and now that you were the one getting squashed, he didn't seem to care. If he really was your friend, he would have told someone by now... or maybe something happened to him today. No... your mom would have gotten a call from Miss Harper. She called her every time something bad happened to Jack and she always comforted her. You didn't want to believe that your best friend would leave you like this, but you couldn't think of any other reason why no one had called your mom about you yet. What if Jack forgot about you entirely? You didn't want to spend the rest of your life as your mom's big butt. You wanted to play your video games and your toys, and watch cartoons, and maybe kiss a girl or a boy someday. You couldn't do that as a butt. What's worse is you hadn't even experienced any of your mom's trips to the bathroom. You didn't want to think about that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you, too, sis. Say hi to April for me.\" Your mother hung up the phone and shut the TV off before standing up and yawning. She made her way to her bedroom and tossed her t-shirt off and squeezed out of her leggings, finally giving you some air. Barbara pulled the sheets off and took a seat on the mattress, causing the frame to creak slightly as she shut the lights off and slipped under the covers. It wouldn't take long for her to fall asleep once the lights were out. As she slept, she soon rolled over onto her side. You realized that you were now given the chance to escape! You tried as hard as you could to wriggle and squirm, doing whatever you could to escape the bronze fleshy globes... before you were trapped there forever.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>[scat warning]</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wriggled and vibrated all night trying to free yourself from Barbara's pores. Finally, after hours of constant and tiring movement, you finally felt some progress... only for your mom to roll over onto her back, squishing you back into her big booty, and undoing all of your hard work. You silently sobbed as she continued to sleep on top of you, squishing you into the mattress as if to rub your cruel fate in your face. You would have to figure out a way to free yourself some other time. During the night, your mom began to heat up, causing sweat to begin to gather in her butt crack, and it was starting to smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning would soon come, and you already wanted to wake up from this nightmare. Barbara soon began to stir and sat up on the side of her bed, stretching her arms. As she pressed her weight down and squashed you into the mattress, you heard a gurgle coming from her belly. \"Oh no... please don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*FFFFFRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTT!!!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara sighed as she let out a rather loud, and smelly fart. \"Damn. Feels like I held that in forever. Hope I didn't wake the boys up with that one\", she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, didn't find it funny at all. Your eyes welled up as you were forced to smell the awful gas that your mom had been holding in. It was disgusting! It smelled like something left out some meat for too long and something was growing on it... and the taste! You hoped that you wouldn't be able to taste anything, but your mom's sweat combined with her fart was the worst thing to ever assault your taste buds. If you ever got free, you were never going to laugh at another fart joke again. Unfortunately, it was only going to get worse form here...<br>\r\nYour mom soon stood up, unaware that she had just ripped ass on her son, and walked to the bathroom. \"Wait... NO! Please, mom, stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went completely unnoticed as she walked straight to the toilet and plopped her big booty down, the cold porcelain giving her flesh (and, by extension, yours) goosebumps as she sat. Barbara grunted as she let out another fart, this time much wetter than the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally gagged as your eyes welled up while being forced to taste another rancid fart. However, nothing prepared you for what came next. Your pupils shrank as you tasted something awful. It was much worse than the couple of poots you had experienced. As your mom held onto her stomach, more of it was forced out with a wet-sounding <b>*FRRRLLLLLPPPPP!*</b> You wanted to cry as you had to taste and smell all of Barbara's waste as she squeezed it out of her system. The stinking brown sludge coiled at the bottom as it was pushed out of your mouth, which you now realized doubled as your mother's asshole. \"Jack...\" you silently sobbed. \"Why didn't you do something... You're supposed to help me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mom finished relieving herself, she grabbed some toilet tissue and cleaned herself. You were at least thankful that she was insistent on getting the expensive stuff as your mouth and nose were scrubbed up and down. Once she was finished, she would head to the shower to freshen herself up. The water ran down your mom's body as she lathered herself up. While she got herself cleaned up, you came to the conclusion that Jack might have forgotten about you. If that was the case, then you were going to be stuck as Barbara's big booty for quite a while. You wanted to cry as you thought about the life that potentially awaited you. Getting squeezed into tight-fitting pants, jiggling with each step and crushed under your mom's weight whenever she sat down. And that wasn't even to mention the numerous trips to the bathroom that awaited you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of a life was that to live?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Barbara exhaled a contented sigh as she stood under the showerhead. She took a moment to stand there and let the hot water wash over her face and cascade down her voluptuous form. Unbeknownst to her was the fact that her eldest son was with her. Oblivious of his dire plight, Barbara continued to clean her body as if nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been lost in thought since your mother scarred you potentially for life with her latest bowel movement. The experience had nearly broken you mentally. The terrible taste still lingered on your nonexistent tastebuds. It was beyond understanding how you could still taste and smell without having either a tongue or nose. You yet tried to call out to the woman that had birthed you into the world, but you could manage no more than subtle movements of your tightly pucker lips. This action only resulted in a brief, silent puff of gas to slip out. The realization as to what your lips were was enough to bring tears to your eyes\u2014dejected at the thought of living out the rest of your life as your mother's round, sculpted butt. You did not notice that she had begun washing again. Not until it came time to clean you, that is. She vigorously scrubbed your rotund form down, the soap stung your eye, and you took it as the warm waters rinsed away the bubbly suds and grime that had gathered on you. The oppressive stench before gradually changed into a mild funk as the sweat a stink washed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Barbara stopped her scrubbing and grabbed a handful of the flesh on one of her buttocks, inadvertently squishing part of what passed as your face when she gave a buttcheek a few firms squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God!\" She exclaimed. \"I-is my ass getting fat?\" She rhetorically asked. A few more squeezes confirmed her suspicions. \"Ew, that is fat! I guess all those backed goods finally caught up to me.\" Barabara caressed her left cheek, and momentarily blotted out some of her transformed son's vision as the palm of her hand passed of his left eye. I'm hitting the gym today for sure! This thing is big enough without my sweet tooth binges.\" That said, the alluring mother of two resumed her morning ritual. \"Although, Trish always did look great with all that badonkadonk she carries around. Lord knows that girl has enough ass to spare.\" Barbara finished with a laugh. She grabbed a container off of the shower's corner shelf toward the front of the bath\u2014a bottle of all in one shampoo. \"A little bigger is fine, I guess, but still. If I'm going to have a big butt, then I got to tighten it up, at least. Can't let it get all doughy!\" Said Barbera as she squirted a generous amount into her golden hair and hummed a happy melody to herself as she worked it into a thick lather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother's words were a ray of sunlight that broke through the gloom of your existential crisis. What she mistook as mere small fat deposits from her snaking habits, was instead the sudden accumulation of superfluous tissue gained from you filling out her rear. It made perfect sense that her naturally plump rump would increase in size after you had melded with it. All of your mass had to go somewhere after all, and it appeared to be in the form of additional girth on your maternal figure's shapely buttocks. Even so, the increase in bulk was nothing to suggest that a whole boy locked within her rear, let alone her son. Your exposed eyes were still the best chance you had at being found, which was unfortunate. Nevertheless, you welcomed the news, regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour salvation depended on if and when your mother noticed that you were missing. That was one thing for which you were grateful. You could not count the times that Jack had been splattered on his mother's body only for Ms. Harper to continue unawares. As much as you did like Jack's mom, you must admit that she was a bit stupid at times. Something your mother was not, usually. You found it a little frightening just how calculating and quick on the uptake your parent was. You had seen her tactfully talk herself out of troublesome situations many times, and witnessed her masterfully convincing those that vehemently disagreed with her to come around to her side, probably without them even realizing it. She also had Ms. Harper, her best friend, wrapped around her dedicate finger. More than once, you suspected that she even orchestrated when Jack wound up stuck on her person. You knew of his condition, and just how vulnerable he was, but still. Sometimes, Jack could not avoid becoming your mother's skin art, no matter how hard he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of that mattered now, of course. You currently found yourself in the same situation as your friend did many times before. Only you lacked the experience he did. You would even wager that you may have ended worse off than he ever had at present. Jack may have ended up stuck to your mother's sizable booty numerous times before, but you can not recall him ever becoming her butt itself as you had. That was what you were now. The large, thick, and shapely buttocks of one Barbara Morrison, albeit newly sentient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still are not sure how it happened, but you suspected that something occurred overnight while your mother slept. She utterly destroyed you physically after she slipped and fell on you last night. You were mostly goo. The vigorous rubbing you had endured when she dried off after last night's shower ensured that your sticky, viscous form was distributed evenly across her rear end to the point that you covered every bit of her buttcheeks, including the cleft between them. You were guessing at this point, but after that, you think that maybe you had soaked into your mother's skin, not unlike some ointment, permeating deep into her flesh, into every pore, gland, and follicle you touched. In other words, your mother's cheeks sucked you up and locked you within them like water in two sponges. Then something happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure what. Somehow your flesh became hers and vise versa. Lines of separation were blurred. So intertwined were you both that your mouth had become synonymous with your mother's pink, little anus. The only thing of your former self that seemed to survive whatever conversion that had taken place were your two eyes situated on the shelf of both cheeks. Despite that, by what you managed to glimpse in the mirror last night, your eyes could pass as really detailed tattoos on your mom's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only hope rests with your mother, either by noticing your eyes or connecting the dots between your absence and the sudden slight weight gained in her bottom. Or better still, the off chance that your best friend finally remembers you and tells someone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You didn't have many experiences being squishy, so it was tough for you to get out of trouble whenever something happened to you. Luckily for you, your mom didn't move around in her sleep tonight, so you were free to squirm and wriggle as much as you wanted. Finally, after what felt like forever, you managed to peel off a little bit of your body off from one of her butt cheeks. Knowing that you were able to free yourself gave you the motivation you needed to vibrate your flattened body even more. It took a long time. All night in fact. But when the sun began to rise, you had managed to completely peel off of your mom's big butt. Now, the only thing you had to do was try and reform. You closed your eyes and concentrated, trying your best to return to a three dimensional shape. \"How does Jack get used to this?\", you thought as you struggled to reform. The sun was shining through the window as you had formed yourself into a rough ball shape when your mom began to stir from her slumber. As she shifted her weight to the other side of the bed, you panicked as you rolled toward her, fearing that you might be squashed under her butt again! Luckily, she sat up before you rolled to the other end, your eyes slapping into her butt cheek. You mentally groaned that you had your face in your mom's booty again, but you at least you weren't being squashed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom yawned and looked behind her to see what had just touched her rear. \"...the hell?\", Barbara groaned as she reached down. You involuntarily squeaked as your mother grabbed your blob-like form, roughly squeezing you as she brought you up to her face. \"I thought I told those boys to keep their toys out of my... wait a minute...\" You blushed as you saw your mom in her underwear, before realizing you had an opportunity to get her to notice you! You suddenly began to wriggle and squirm as much as you could, hoping to show her that you were a living being. Barbara's eyes widened as the weird flesh-colored blob began to move before she noticed a pair of eyes on it. \"This isn't a toy... what the hell is this?\" She took a closer look and saw that the skin tone and the color of it's eyes looked familiar. \"... Andrew?!\" Yes! She recognizes you! You try to make some kind of nodding motion in response, but you got the idea that she figured out it was you. \"Oh my poor baby... what happened to you?\" She planted a kiss on your approximation of a forehead before rubbing you. \"I guess Selena's cat must have bitten you... wait a minute, what were you doing in my bed?\" Barbara looked down at you with a look of disappointment in her face as you blushed. \"We'll... talk about this once you reform.\" Your mom set you down on her bed as she stood up and began to get dressed squeezing into a pair of skinny jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to yell at her that it was her fault you were a shapeless blob and that you spent the whole night basically as a part of her big butt. You weren't some kind of pervert. \"You picked a reeeal bad time to get turned into a squishie\", Barbara said as she slipped into a tube top. \"Your Aunt Camilla's coming over today and that is <b>not</b> the state you wanna be in when she meets you.\" You always heard your mom talking to someone named Camilla, but you never met her before. In fact, you were more familiar with Jack's extended family than your own. You knew your cousin, Ash, and... that's it. Even if you were super vulnerable, you were looking forward to meeting one of your aunts for the first time. \"Once you reform, just call out for me. I'll look out for you as best as I can, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly heard the door open and an unfamiliar voice call out. \"Oh Barbiiie~! You better not be sleepin' in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom groaned and rolled her eyes. \"Of course she's here early... I'll be there in a minute, sis, just hold on.\" She soon left the room and shut the door behind her. You focused on reforming, but it was taking longer than you thought. You couldn't hear anyone else, so you figured that Miss Harper must have taken Stevie to preschool and Ash was at school. You were more than a little upset that Miss Harper or Jack didn't call to check on you, but everything seemed to have worked out anyway. More than an hour had passed since your mom left you on the bed, and you hadn't made much progress. You hoped that you weren't stuck like this. Suddenly, your thoughts were interrupted as the bedroom door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Barb, I'mma leave my bags in here, kay?\" You looked over and saw an unfamiliar woman walk into your mom's room. She was much shorter than your mom, maybe coming up to her chest. Her skin was also a lot darker, and she had red hair that flared out at the sides, looking like the base of her neck was aflame, and her eyes were a deep purple color. While she was a lot shorter, she was just as curvy as your mom. Her breasts were maybe a cup size smaller, but her hips were just as wide as hers, and she had a little bit of pudge on her belly. She was wearing a skintight black dress, a pair of black high heeled boots, a black headband, and a gold necklace with what looked like an emerald at the center. If you had to guess, this must be your Aunt Camilla. Her hips shifted as she walked inside and placed her bags by the closet... before she turned her attention over to you. \"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\", you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do we got here?\", Aunt Camilla asked aloud as she walked over to you. You mentally panicked as she grabbed ahold of you, her nails digging into your malleable flesh as she squeezed. She held you close to her nose and sniffed. \"Smells like banana puddin'...\" She looked down at you and smirked. \"Barbie told me there were squishie folks here... guess she thought she could have you for herself.\" Your aunt tossed you up and down a bit, disorienting you as you spun in the air. \"Well I don't think she'll mind sharing with her favorite big sis...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to squeak as loud as you could to get your mom's attention before your aunt did something bad to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

After pondering for a few moments, she tossed you a bit behind her and hopped up before she bumped you back with her generous booty, which wobbled as you were flung back with a light *<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">SLAP</font>*. You landed on your mom's bed, your eyes spinning both from being tossed up and being smacked by Camilla's rump. As you slowly regained your senses, your aunt seemed to hover for a moment, almost as if she had wings, before you realized she was right above you! You were just about able to make out a devilish smirk on her face before she SLAMMED down on top of you! Your poor malleable body was easily squashed flat beneath her plump booty, the soft coffee-colored flesh drowning out her cackling as she ground her rump down into the mattress. \"An' here I thought this little town was gonna be boring\", your impish aunt laughed. \"I ain't gonna be bored with you around, that's f' sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently begged for Aunt Camilla to show some mercy, and that she'd realize you were her nephew and not a toy. Your pleas sadly went unanswered as your aunt continued grinding her ass into you like a big doughy eraser trying to rub out your existence. Finally, Camilla hopped off of your mom's bed, leaving an imprint of her wide behind. When she looked down, she was briefly confused before she got a peak at the mirror on the wall and snickered as she saw your battered form, reduced to a smear on her right buttcheek. \"Tryin' to hide from me, huh?\" She dug her nail into her dark doughy flesh, causing you a bit of discomfort (though not nearly as much as the torment that preceded it) and managed to peel you off. As she pulled her dress down, she held you in front of her face and waved you back and forth before she began to stretch and knead you like a ball of taffy. \"I can't wait t' find more of ya... but let's have some more fun with you, first.\" You sobbed silently as your aunt began to mold you into a different shape. This wasn't how you wanted to meet your mom's family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around 30 seconds of stretching, folding, and pinching, Camilla held you out in front of her face and grinned. \"I'd say this is a big improvement for ya\", she said as she stretched you a bit. \"Ain't you the lucky one? You get to be my new-\"</span></div></div>",

Well actually if you could have paid attention you didn't think she was wearing any before, almost like she was planning on something happening no wait... she was peeling something off, a tiny thin strip of purple that had been buried into her buns, the poor thing looked like it was going to snap when she rolled it's strings around her ass. You got a whiff as she used the hand holding you as a sling point to launch them into the dirty hamper. They smelled like she was wearing them for a few days, and as she dropped you towards the floor and put the first food through one of the openings she had molded around you, you were desperate to cry for help, especially when you realized that the holes were barely big enough for you to get passed her knees until she started struggling to pull you up. Apparently she had over estimated how stretchy you were or possibly just how easy it would be regarding the squishy properties. There was a struggle but your body clearly wasn't going to win it as you inched slowly towards the dark skinned cheeks and even slowly as you started sinking between them as she managed to get you all the way up. This was a totally different kind of disorienting pain than being sat on, it was more like someone was constantly pulling on you than the squashing feeling. And the doughy cheeks also sank a little as you became more tightly wrapped around them at least until you sunk completely between the cheeks. That was when the squashing pain would come back, grinding on you from both sides even with her just standing still. The rank smell waffted out and it seemed like as soon as you were properly in place she blasted a fart right in your face. Why was your aunt so mean!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"welcome ta' your new home for a while puddin', I'll jus' call ya that till yer broken in.\" She said satisfied with her work and pulling her dress back down over you, her new light skintone panties. She started walking again which true to form had her cheeks grinding you and wobbling even the slight movements causing tremors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Barbie, you ready cause I'm all geared up fer-\"</span></div></div>",

She picked the towel from the sink and started drying her body slowly without forgetting any part, from her head to her toes. For Andrew, having all the the weight of her mother on him was pure torture. He couldn't imagine how Jack was able to support accidents like this every day of his life. This was also preventing him from reforming. The only positive thing was that Barbara had just showered so her feet didn't smell. \"If you can say there is something positive about being in this situation\" think Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing drying herself Barbara led her eyes down. \"That's it! She saw me.\" thought Andrew. Sadly, Barbara hadn't recognized him because most of his face was under her right feet with only one eye visible, the one Andrew was watching everything with, and the rest of his body was completely deformed with all the characteristics of his human body erased due to the long time spent under Barbara butt. The only thing Barbara was watching was a dirty brown bath mat. \"I should put this in the hamper\" thought Barbara. Without a second glance she picked the 'bath mat' and threw it inside the hamper with all the dirty clothes. It turned out that, with the new additions, the hamper was completely full so Barbara decided to just take everything to the basement and start the washing machine. She picked the hamper, went down, passing through the living room where a lucky Jack was talking with Trish and entered the basement. Quickly she put all the dirty clothes, and Andrew, inside the washing machine, closed the lid, started the machine and left, singing to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew Pov: Poor Andrew didn't stand a chance. After he thought her mother had recognized him he noticed how wrong he was when he saw himself flying through the air and landing inside the hamper with the rest of her clothes. An unpleasant smell was there to welcome him. A few seconds left, her mother was picking the hamper leading her way to the basement. He was waiting for her to look down and recognize him. Sadly, this opportunity never came and a few moments later he found himself crush inside the washing machine with all of the clothes, mostly bras and panties. When Barbara started the machine Andrew saw how his world started to spin. Without any sense of direction and his body still crush he started to fell dizzy until he finally passed out. With him unconscious  his squishy body started to stretch and compress rhythmically, hitting the walls of the inside of the machine. What happens now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: When the cycle ends Andrew's body has become attached to one of the cups of Barbara's bra and he is not visible. It's also a bad thing that Barbara has run out of bras and he may be used soon after he is dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Trish opens the lid and discovers a squishy material. Knowing it's not Jack and not recognizing Andrew she thinks nothing strange of it and decides to use it to make a thong for herself.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, you wouldn't remain surrounded by it for long, as Miss Harper would open the washer and begin emptying it out. She must have just gotten out of the shower, as she was wearing only a bathrobe and had a towel wrapped around her hair. You remembered Jack saying something about the washer at his house being messed up because of all of the cat hair. Maybe his mom would notice you as she was taking the clothes out. \"Thanks again for letting me use your washer, Barb\", Trish called out to your mom. \"What do you want me to do with these clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\", Barbara responded. \"Just set them in the basket, I'll get to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish hummed as she dug through the clothes until you felt her hand wrap around you and squeeze. She yelped and pulled her hand back, letting you drop back down to the bottom of the washer. \"What on earth?\" She looked down at the odd thing she touched. The constant motion combined with the compression of the clothes around you caused your body to be squished into a formless, peach-colored blob. Trish reached in to pick you up and held you, occasionally squishing you in her hands. Unknown to you, Miss Harper had been experimenting with excess mass gathered from Jack, Selena, and herself, using it to make all sorts of objects. \"Hmm... Jack just headed outside, and Selena's playing with her little friend... I guess I must have misplaced this batch.\" Trish set you down and loaded her clothes in the washer. As she started the cycle and picked you up, you were very worried about what was going to happen. Miss Harper had no way of knowing that the fleshy blob she held in her hand was you, and you didn't know if Jack had told your mom about you being bitten by his little sister's dumb cat. You wished that you could find some way to keep him from biting you. It's bad enough being bitten by him, but it stings even more when he outsmarts your attempts to outrun him. Cats shouldn't be this smart or mean. Soon, Miss Harper began to squish and mold you into an unfamiliar shape. You silently grunted and yelped as your best friend's mom pressed and stretched you, thinning you out into several stringy parts. She soon held you out in front of her and you mentally gasped as you realized the shape you were in. Trish had molded you into a pair of panties, specifically a thong!<br>\r\nYou barely had time to process your situation before you were lowered and pulled up Miss Harper's thighs. She wasn't quite as curvy as your mom, but she certainly wasn't thin. Her thick thighs felt soft, almost like gelatin, as you were slid up, slowly stretching your sides until you reached her butt. As you were molded with your face in the back, the sides of where your head used to be were pressed tight as you were wedged up between her cheeks. You tried to wriggle your malleable body, but you weren't able to budge. You simply weren't used to being in this state. Trish pulled up your \"straps\" and let them snap, causing her own squishy flesh to ripple. As she walked up the stairs, you could feel her plush butt cheeks squishing your face further and grinding on either side of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is Trish heading?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The jiggling rear had managed to take you both with it, making it look more like multi colored booty shorts than a strange splotch as you would normally be. Your mom probably would have noticed something was wrong if she wasn't already practically collapsed on the couch, but maybe this was still in your favor! Barbara couldn't reasonably wear her cloths into the shower with her so you should have ample time to regain your shape. Of course before she got into the shower she sat back down to take her socks off, undoing any progress you and Andrew might have made towards escaping. When she finally did take her shorts off she casually tossed them onto the floor, leaving you facing upwards, the only problem now was the deliberate flattening you had endured and how long it would take to regain your shape. There was about ten minutes for you to struggle with it and in that time all you managed to do was regain some dimension and it seemed that the same was true for Andrew. The shadow of Barbara loomed over you, clad in only a towel she blinked a couple of times before settling into a semi shocked expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh my! Jack, and well you can't be selena so... did that little cat get to you again Andrew? Mommy is so sorry! I wouldn't sit on you on purpose, here let me help.\" For once Barbara seemed interested in saving you from your situation, you could thank Andrew for that probably but either way getting ripped from the spandex prison was uncomfortable to say the least. Barbara carried the two of you over to her night stand and set you down before going back into the bathroom and getting dressed. \"now you two just focus on reforming, I'm sure My big ol' booty did a number on you so it might take a while but you'll be back in no time. I'm sending trish in to shower, I'm sure she's much more careful than me so you'll have nothing to worry about.\" And with that she set some cloths on the bed and walked out, swiftly replaced by your mother hazily wandering into the bathroom. The sound of running water started up again and you doubled your effort, this time by the time the water turned off you were sure you and Andrew had managed to reform mouths. You made an effort to look anywhere but towards the cloths as Trish walked out to get changed, still sounding exhausted she mumbled the cloths as she put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"panties... Bra... Shirt.. Pants..\" she paused, not seeing any socks set out for her by Barbara until she spotted a Brown sock and a light tan one. You didn't realize why she had paused until it was too late, her hands had already closed around you're mouth. \"Left foot\" she was only half paying attention, clearly almost asleep as she pried your mouth apart to slip her foot inside, the taste of lotion across your tongue until you were about half way up her calf where she let go and you snapped around it. \"Right foot\" she repeated the same with Andrew who was making much more of an effort to resist than you, not that your mom noticed any difference as she wiggled her toes inside of you both. \"I'll tell her to make matching ones, *yawn* next time\" She lingered on every step as she made her way back into the living room, the heavy weight dropping and then lifting off again. She stood in front of the shoes, you could already smell the lingering foot stink when she called out. \"Jack, Selena, we're going home now, get your kitty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't wait to slip her feet back into the worn running shoes, the smell and taste of old sweat seeped in slowly as the confinement brought new sweat from her feet you could swear there was a hint of something sweet too but quickly quashed that idea as your mind trying to make the situation better. Trish seemingly didn't realize you didn't get in the car when Selena did, she'd probably need some sleep before she realized what happened, hopefully that wouldn't be too much time...</span></div></div>",

Your mom's super sweaty butt had given you a bad few minutes but this weird way you had been squashed was totally different. Since she was clean the taste and smell was by far not as bad, but the feeling of her weight pressing onto you every step pressed some old sweat out of the sneakers. The weird thing is that her sweat was much more pleasant than your mom's had been, maybe it was because she was a pretty girl you weren't related to? You tried to get her attention but you were even less adept at struggling when squashed than Jack was, you could swear he reformed faster than you but never had a metric to measure against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thought was interrupted as the foot stomped down onto concrete again, you weren't sure that being walked on was something you'd get used to and even the slow walk Trish had was almost dizzying. She lead Selena inside and kicked off her shoes, which was much nicer but much colder as well. You watched Selena drop her dumb cat back on the floor once the door was closed and you could swear he was looking at you, and snickering like some kinda cartoon cat. There was someone else in the house too you realized now, it was Jack's Aunt and Cousins. \"ugg finally, See you on monday Big sis\" Vivan basically bolted out of the door passed Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... uhh, I'm sorry Kat, Kris make yourselves at home I'm just gonna take a little nap.\" You had hoped that she was going to take you off if she was going to sleep but that didn't seem to be the case, she just flopped into bed and covered herself with a blaket. You could feel the heat radiating out, not quite enough to melt you but enough that Trish was sweating up a storm. You couldn't figure out how much time was passing so the only thing you could really focus on now that it was dark was the taste of the foot dominating your world. And as soon as you turned your attention towards it the flavor magnified, something about Trish made her sweat taste like salted butterscotches, you only got the salt when you tried to not focus on it but now that you were it was delicious! You might even say you could happily lick her feet for hours, but then it would be embarrassing to admit you thought that. Maybe you just hadn't given it a chance before and all girls feet tasted good like that... no you shouldn't test that out, just enjoy it while it lasts and get out of the situation later...</span></div></div>",

The light squeeze of her toes moving inside you as she swung her feet over the side of the bet was not nearly as bad as you would have thought, and the carpeted floor was a relatively soft landing. As long as you could focus on how sweet the taste was though it was easy to block out the thumping of Trish's foot falls, you realized she was rushing somewhere, looking up at her sweat pants to try and see her face as she moved you towards an even more worn pair of flats than her sneakers. You thought her face looked so nice, even as doing this, and you knew that if she knew you were down here she wouldn't make you stay if you didn't want. There was just something about seeing someone so much larger than you that was attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flats weren't as hot as the sneaker or the blanket, which meant that she wasn't sweating as much, a fact that disappointed you somewhat, although in the back of your mind you knew that wanting to lick up foot sweat was a strange idea. She was going somewhere, but leaving the kids to be watched by Kris. The footsteps were lighter than before, making the impact much less with every step, you imagined as if she were watching out for you somehow. She wasn't talking, but it's not like she would explain where she was going to her socks. You noticed however that she had brought the sneakers with her as well as a bag of some sort, you remember seeing a bag like that before, your mom had a gym bag just like it but red... oh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car stopped in front of a Gym you had seen many times before when your mom brought you with her. The ladies changing room however was a different sight, even from your ground level view there were a few women changing and the sweaty smell pierced through even the sweet that Trish put out. Was she trying to get in better shape so that she could keep up with your mom? You didn't get to know what her plan was though as you were shoved into the sneakers once more, only this time it was before the workout and not after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she would start with cardio, as she started up the heavy footsteps of running felt like she was stomping the life out of you, but then the sickly sweet taste hit your tongue again and suddenly you could almost completly ignore it, as though it were a gentle massage. You were starting to think maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be stuck like this for a little while. Of course she moved on to different things, but none of them were quite as an intense experience as the cardio, even the yoga where you were lifted off the ground for some time couldn't compare. This was starting to make little sense, Jack always complained about getting stuck to someone working out, but you wouldn't mind doing this at least once a week! Thankfully when the workout ended she didn't change, only put the flats back on instead leaving all her tasty sweat to soak into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night was spent under a blanket with Trish sitting on you while she watched some T.V. and you drifted to sleep gently.</span></div></div>",

It was good you supposed though because now you could reform, only... you watched Jack reforming growing and getting his shape back but the same just wasn't happening or else it was happening so slowly you weren't sure. You shivered with the implication of that, as nice as Trish's foot felt it was scary thinking you might be stuck like this. There was only one thing that saved you because Jack was looking around confused that you hand't reformed yet. \"Jack! H-help I'm not reforming.\" He looked shocked for a moment but at least you could still talk in your sock like form. Jack hesitated for a moment but then picked you up and ran to his room, he tossed you onto the bed and got dressed really quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"d-don't worry Andrew, I'll get some help and m-maybe Ian needs to bite you again. I-i'll get my mom so Selena doesn't mess it up or so I don't get eaten.\" He didn't sound confident but he did run out of the room to go find his mom. You could breath easy as long as Kris didn't come back to Jacks room or... the door opened again but this time it wasn't Jack, Kris, or even Trish. The person that entered blowing a suspiciously pink bubble that let out a giggling noise when it popped was Kat. She licked it back into her mouth and wandered farther into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jaaaack~ I heard you come in here, don't you want to play with your cosin~\" She was looking to bully jack again clearly, and her gum was probably Selena but she loved that kinda stuff. You were not really in any position to judge the weird girl though, you just spent the last couple of days happily licking your best friend's mother's foot. You couldn't let her pick on Jack though, especially while he was trying to help you. You almost spoke up too but before you could Kat plopped herself down right on top of you, She must have felt like she was sitting on something though because she pulled you out almost immediately. \"Hmm, this looks like one of my socks, but what is it doing here?\" You looked down and sure enough she had knee socks that were slightly off white with a bit of yellow matching your hair at the top. You hesitated, would she wear you if you didn't say anything? Maybe her feet would be as good as Trish's, she was attractive like Trish was, and a bit closer to your age. You hung limp in her hand while she walked out of the room, if you did nothing she was going to pack you with her things! but if you alerted her to your situation she would definitely take advantage of you, the memory of the sweet taste flooded your mind making you blush a bit, it was obvious which you should do. Even with hiding from her you'd end up on her feet eventually, it would be better if she knew where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resolved this right before she was about to drop you into her suitcase. \"Wait! I'm not a sock, It's me Jack's friend Andrew.\" She swallowed her gum in shock, clearly not expecting the sock to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugg, great now I need new gum. So what's your story sock boy, you know where Jack is?\" She looked harder at you and finally noticed your eyes that were barely visible. \"If you tell me I promise not to wear you~.\" She peeled one of her other socks off revealing that her foot was quite slick with residual sweat. The smell was just like what you imagined before you had tasted Trish's sweat, but Jack was doing more important things and if he got caught by her then you'd still be stuck either way, the choice was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I'd never give Jack up to you, not even if you used me as a sock for a whole month!\" You blurted out some nonsense before you could even think about it, but Kat got a big grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll test that theory.\" She pulled your mouth apart before you could respond and brought it down to her waiting foot, the digits wiggled as they passed your lips and as soon as the monster made it's way inside you realized your horrible mistake. The sweet flavor you tasted with Trish was entirely absent, the salty flavor invaded your taste buds along with a dirty taste of unwashed feet. By the time she had stretched you up to the length of her other sock your eyes were already watering. \"Oh wow, actually, wow, that feels great.\" She stomped her foot down causing you to groan giving her foot a mini massage. \"ohh and unlike Jack you actually look like my game socks, I was gonna slip him into my shoe for softball practice today but I think I like this better.\" You regretted everything, and you surely didn't want to be this tomboy's sock anymore, especially if she was going to play sports!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up placed on the cool floor as Trish walked around fixing breakfast the lingering sweetness made the experience quite pleasant and you wondered how long you would get to stay like this because you were starting to enjoy it a lot. Unfortunately just as you thought that you saw your mother enter the room seemingly unannounced, or well you could see her socked feet, she must be wearing her boots instead of her sandals today. You could see Selena's too but they were much closer to you and Selena let off a sweet smell too, in fact the sweetness was about all you could smell since Trish's foot so dominated all of your senses. You could hardly pay attention to the conversation but it must have been urgent as Trish rushed back to her room with your mom in tow. Jack was removed first, and then you followed easily plucked off by your own mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about this boys, I'll make it up to you I swear.\" You wanted to disagree with her but the function of talking hadn't quite returned, you would have told her you didn't mind. You saw Jack being set down on the bed to reform but Your mom apparently had things to do today because she was carrying you out of the room and sliding her feet back into her high boots. You watched Ms. Harper follow her and they were talking about something but you cast your gaze back to her room where Selena was sneaking in... what was she up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And Stevie is taken care of for today He went to visit with his aunt April for today. I'll see you later trish.\" And with that you watched the bare footed goddess disappear behind the front door. Barbara tossing you into the passenger seat of her car and starting it up before she started talking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrew, sweety, I've got some things planned today but I want to let you know once you're back to normal we'll do whatever you want okay?\" You couldn't quite talk yet but you had a while to think while Barbara was out running errands. You wanted to be back to normal of course but every time you tried to think about what you wanted to be doing that sweet taste lingered in your mind, if you could only have a few more days with Ms. Trish like that... Your mom did say whatever you wanted right? Maybe before you reformed you could get her to take you back, after she got back in the car from the first errand you felt like you could talk at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mom?\" Barbara glanced down at you and hesitated turning the car back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Andrew? Did you figure out what you wanted to do?\" She inquired but clearly still noting that you weren't yet out of the shape of the sock and you were talking out of the foot hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeh kinda... I was uh, wondering if I could stay like this for a while?\" You braced not knowing what she would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As... a sock?\" She looked confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well- I, it's just it felt kinda nice while Ms. Harper was working out and, it uh...\" Barbara's smile took on a bit of impishness that you didn't really pick up on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want to stay a sock for a bit longer because you liked it. I suppose if that's what you really want, I could do that for you.\" She said with a slight chuckle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just glad she wasn't calling you a weirdo for wanting to be on her friend's feet and she was even willing to let it happen! \"Yes! I can't stop thinking about it!\" There was a moment of waiting and you saw the car door open again a little while Barbara reached down to fiddle with something. She had pulled off her boot and was shaking it out as if there had been a pebble in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't deny such a heartfelt request. You'll be put right to use,\" You were a little confused but then before you could respond again her hand clenched around you cutting off your ability to talk. You could see she was peeling off her sock and tossed it right where you had been laying. You realized she had misunderstood what you wanted, but you couldn't correct her as her fingers pulled your mouth apart and lowered you towards the pedicured digits of her foot. The sweetness of Trish's feet was rivaled here by how sour Barbara's feet smelled from having been inside that boot. \"I don't want to hear any complaining either, you're the one that asked for this so expect a punishment if you're whining to me after.\" That was the last thing she said to you before she slid your body over her foot, your tongue instantly soaking in all the salty sweat that clung to her foot and she purred as she wiggled her toes inside you. You were a little short for a boot sock though so she had to yank up a little and stretch you around her calf. You were already immediately regretting ever thinking a foot tasted good, but it was nothing to what happened when you were put back inside the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure increased and so did the heat, each droplet of sweat produced all up her leg and down on her foot was like licking pure salt. When she started walking though, you were now experiencing more of what it was like because the nasty flavor didn't prevent you from feeling every foot fall. You had to clarify this with your mom somehow, if she doesn't decide to punish you for it but what could she do that was worse than this!</span></div></div>",

You hated your position but you just couldn't be mad at her while she was happily humming and barely making things more uncomfortable than they would otherwise be. Every once in a while while she was in the car you felt her toes scrunch and 'feel' you more. You still weren't happy with your position and you almost wanted to sigh when the cool air hit you as you were removed from the boot. The sensory deprivation from the inner boot made it hard to see but after your eyes cleared you could see a Mirror and Barbara was stripping out of her walking around cloths. As she stood up the texture of the carpet felt nicer than the inner boot for about two seconds before it felt scratchy. You could see a few different cloths spread out everywhere, that was kind of strange since she was usually a bit more put together. The other sock was pitch black, same color as the one she had taken off inside the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was only in her underwear now and the cool air had stopped flowing her sweat so now only the mild uncomfortable feeling of being stretched over her foot. She leaned over to talk to you again. \"Just so you know, I'm trying to figure out where you fit best in my wardrobe, you just don't go with some outfits so I need to figure out where you fit in... oh and I set the time limit finally while I was thinking, I'll let you have you're fun until your partner\" She wiggled her other foot \" Wears out, since I'll wear you and that sock together, which ever sock that turns out to be.\" She also set a sock that looked VERY much like your current form, save for not having a faint outline of your eyes in addition to the yellow ring. She wiggled on some sweat pants and a sports bra, turning towards the side facing you to check herself out, she hummed thought fully. \"Daym you do look JUST like my normal gym socks, I wouldn't have to change anything to make you match... and you did say Trish worked out in you once already and you had a good time buuut...\" She stripped again and slipped on a sexy dress. \" These ones match my night on the town cloths, pretty much all of them but a few, but I'd have to dye you.\" She looked conflicted and you also thought that both of those were terrible options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first option would be full of sweat and a lot of time underfoot getting stomped, even the light movements had been hellish you couldn't imagine how bad it would be once she actually started working out, On the other hand despite going under her feet less often, that meant you wouldn't be able to get out of being a sock as soon, in addition she would dye you black! how would you get rid of that if you could get out of this situation. Still you could hardly do anything about it besides try and yell over her foot, mildly managing to vibrate since there was no weight on you. Barbara looked back down at the movement taking it as a sign you were agreeing with the option she had been thinking of right at that moment which was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She casually used you to peel off the other sock and replaced it with the one that matched you, you could feel the light wetness as your body touched the other sock she had been wearing. There was a minor feeling of absorbing some of it but your mouth was already full of foot so it was hard to tell if you had tasted it or not. \"You're totally right, You wouldn't want to be locked away for maybe one or two times a week you wanted an eventful time. Gym sock it is. Good thing that was my last stop today!\" It seemed as though you weren't going to even get a tiny break but then your realized that instead of the boots, the shoe you were going to be shoved was instead the worn sneakers sitting to the other side of them. Soon enough she was back in her gym cloths and you got to see the inside of the shoe. it was probably white at one point, but it was a dirty brown now and it smelled even worse than her foot had coming out of the boot despite it having been resting all day in the air conditioning. You slid over the insole and found that your intuition wasn't wrong, you were definitely absorbing the sweat from all around and not just the foot in your mouth as the old insole practically squelched it's contents into you. The stale nature of it doing nothing to dull the taste you got perhaps even making it worse. You felt yourself try and gag, but all that did was slightly nudge Barbara's foot to which she giggled. \"Calm down, I haven't even started yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just to make it ever so slightly worse Barbara decided to Jog all the way to the gym. You mentally gulped as she walked past the car her feet already unleashing a fresh layer of sweat for you to drink, every step making the insole under you less wet as you absorbed it's old contents. There was a slight pause as she stretched, you could see heat wafting up from the concrete. The first step was on your foot of course slamming down into the pavement to push off, your world rushed around as her legs started pumping and then you were smashed by the next step, like she was stomping as hard as she could on the lower end of your body and then rolling up to your stomach where she pushed off with the ball of her foot. You didn't know what was worse but you were leaning towards the pounding because even after she stopped panting inside the gym there was a lingering pain that radiated as long as she was standing on you. at some point you had started whimpering with each step but she seemed to like that or didn't realize it was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara meanwhile was catching her breath and grinning, she hadn't thought this would work out so well when she got up this morning. Not only did her now squishy son Want to be a sock, he was giving her every reason to think about letting him keep his dream job, he even started licking or something half way through her jog over and he was still doing it whenever she shifted her weight onto him. She briefly considered taking care of or swapping out her other sock to prolong this little game but waved it away. If he hadn't gotten it out of his system by the time she wore out this other sock then he could tell her when time was up, what she could do to make it a bit better for him is simply pretend he wasn't there. Sure she had been talking to him but Trish hadn't even known about him and he had seemed to like that too. She sighed happily as she pressed down on him again feeling his little licks drinking in her sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the gym trip was just what you'd expect, but you couldn't stop whimpering from the initial cardio and she seemed like she had noticed and was now going out of her way to make it happen. But the actual stomping had taken a break as she dropped off her bag in the locker room, the woman locker room wasn't something you were interested in right at that moment but you were on the lookout for Ms. Trish and Jack who might recognize you, but sadly you didn't see them in fact you didn't know any of the women that surrounded Barbara. The one coming up to her also didn't seem familiar but she seemed to know your mother. Since she was standing still you could even focus on their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if my eyes don't deceive. Is that Black Siren Storm I see\" The woman was.. athletic looking, wide hips, sporting a six pack and some sizable breasts for someone so athletic but the biggest stand out for her body shape is her thighs look like they could squish a regular person if she just squeezed them too hard. Her hair was black, and her entire body looked exceptionally toned with a light tan but it was clear she was typically very fair skinned. She almost looked like a buff Vampire if she had dressed in darker cloths your eyes of course were drawn down to your eye level where her shoes and socks were. The socks were nearly the same as you, but they were TAN with a little yellow band at the top, and her shoes were practically a perfect match for the ones Barbara was wearing. You didn't know what to make of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't been called that for a good long while, and as I recall you were only a newbie while the Black Sirens were big, Vampthigher.\" The two women stared at each other glaring but then they both cracked, laughing a bunch before calming themselves down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you come to this gym, Brandy don't you have your own place?\" That was your mother again, so this lady's name was Brandy and she was your mom's friend from wrestling it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't, well once a month or so but I couldn't help but come say high you just looked so happy I wanted to know what you were celebrating. You haven't even started your workout and you're drenched.\" She observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara beamed though, \"Oh it's just this new sock is [b]special[/b] it just feels so great and I can't wait to start.\" The other woman raised an eyebrow at the singular and looked down at you, here eyes were an almost glowing green and you could swear she was looking you in the eyes with a sour glare that quickly turned into a happy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always did find the best stuff Barbie, I can hardly get my crummy socks to last more than a week sometimes.\" They laughed over the terrifying fate that she had implied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well I'm not about to give this up. come on let's work out.\" She put emphasis by giving you a light stomp causing another series of whimpering licks to wash over her foot. You hadn't even been her sock for half a day and you felt like she was going to break you. The two woman chatted while you couldn't follow thier conversation anymore because of the beating you were taking. At no point though did you stop absorbing her sweat, apparently able to take an infinite amount <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou were surprised but happy as you were peeled off of the foot at the end of the workout, still in the womans locker room. You were suddenly brought to the other drenched foot and scrubbed against it taking all the sweat off and then up into her armpits with a more sour taste and into her cleavage. You whimpered lightly but Barbara didn't seem to hear it, although Brandy was looking at her like she had gone mad. She must have seen the look before laughing and tossing you to the muscular woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel it and take a sniff.\" She squeezed you but no moisture escaped only a light whining sound and then she brought you up to her face \"Pudding?\" Barbara grabbed you back and stuffed you back on her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you it was a great sock.\" She said simply plopping you back into the worn sneakers wiggling her toes making you whimper. Brandy's eyes were locked on you though. \"See you next month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandy nodded \"Yeh, I'll give you a call.\" And with that they parted ways, leaving you to suffer on the jog back arguably worse than the jog there now that it was after noon. You weren't able to control your whimpering at all, but the sound didn't seem to reach Barbara when she pulled you off again and stuffed you into the dirty gym shoes. She didn't even say anything to you just leaving you to stew in her dirty shoes until tommorrow's workout.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't get better and she never did give you the chance to talk at all having you either covering her foot or balled up and stuffed into the gym shoes. You just could not get used to the stomping and Barbara did not have a safe day for you either, even when she didn't do a trip to the gym she had a morning jog that was nearly as bad. She hadn't said anything to you since that first day, and it seemed like as far as she was concerned you were just her workout sock. At this point you could tell a few weeks had passed, the taste of her foot had stopped fading from your mouth although fresh waves of sweat intensified the flavor it never went away anymore. The only thing that gave you hope that you weren't actually forgotten was the other sock, the regular one that Barbara had arbitrarily decided was your twin and that she would release you when it fell apart. She had worn it with you every single time and it was starting to look like you felt, dirty and falling apart. The sock didn't actually have a hole in it but you could tell that it was getting thin whenever you caught glimpses of it. You even saw Ms. Trish sometimes although her realizing you were a sock that your own mother was wearing didn't seem like it would happen especially since she had cooked up some summer camp story to tell everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday though was a rare occurrence, rather than directly onto the foot you and your 'twin' were laid out on the bed as Barbara talked on the phone. You didn't bother paying attention, instead for the first time in nearly a month you were going to try and speak. \"M--o, Mom...\" You weakly cried out prompting her to look in your direction briefly. She hung up the phone and smiled at you setting herself down not too far away, clad in her workout cloths you had trouble picturing her in other cloths anymore. She looked coyly at you, you didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I thought I heard something but there's nobody here but me.\" She pulled your twin up and looked at it and frowned. \"This should last another couple of workouts.\" You were going to miss your opportunity if you couldn't speak up now, but you felt so stiff it was hard to talk, still you mustered your strength as she pulled the nearly destroyed sock onto her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-o More\" You managed to get out before she scooped you up again silencing you effectively. She seemed to think she was still playing a game or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's that sound again, oh well, I'm sure Andrew will be back from his summer camp and day now. I wouldn't mind extending it for a while though. I'll just have to ask him when he gets back.\" She said to 'herself' that was as easy a warning you were going to get to be a good sock until she was done with you. There was a short time you got to look at yourself in the mirror and gulped a bit, it was very faint but a slightly dirty outline of Barbara's foot had started appearing which was made clearer as she pulled you back over her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym was not crowded that day but you realized who Barbara was on the phone with before, the woman from your first day as socks Brandy was here. That didn't mean much to anyone else but you realized that Barbara's competitive streak meant that you were going to be extra beat up by the end of this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't wrong either, the first drops of sweat started rolling as she slammed into you with a full hour of jogging, it was just like the first day every slap against the track brought a fresh wave of pain slightly more intense than her typical workout. The rest of the workout was hardly kind to you and you nearly managed to pass out by the time it was over. You were once more out of the shoe in the womans locker room when you heard it, the cloth ripping sound as Barbara removed her other foot from the shoe and the whole bottom of the other sock tore off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's bad luck Barbie, you got an extra pair right?\" Brandy was removing her own socks while she said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" She looked down at you and peeled you off along with the remains of the sock from her other foot. \"I've got a back up but I don't want to wear a fresh sock on sweaty feet. I'll just go without one on the way home and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, You can just shower here, I've got extra pairs\" Brandy offered her more like insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" She hesitated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll shower with you... if you let me use your locker too, I don't exactly come here enough to have my own.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara sighed and agreed, tossing you into the locker followed by the rest of her sweaty cloths, the destroyed sock and then the massive gym bag of Brandy's. The sweat was squeezed out and drained into you a slightly different salty musky taste than the foot taste, you were excited the other sock had broken so you were going to be free! You could finally tell Barbara you didn't like being a sock! but just as you had that thought the locker opened and...</span></div></div>",

You didn't understand at first what was going on but as she started putting her after workout cloths on you realized that she was taking you! You didn't like your mom's feet but at least she was going to let you go and knew you were a person, you tried to flop away but the workout had left you absolutely devastated. You couldn't even muster a squeak as her hand daintily lifted you off the bench and onto her foot, the muscular woman at least had the decency to clean her foot properly after her workout so there wasn't any sweat for you to get. You could see your mother walking up now, not even considering that her friend would be robbing her. You groaned as the cold tile hit you and Brandy's weight settled onto you, just like Barbara she drummed her toes as the pleasurable sensation of your pained moans washed over her after workout feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women exchanged pleasantries again as you were slipped into the new pair of worn out sneakers, you had almost forgotten what it was like the first time you had been stuffed into Barbara's because Brandy's were practically drowning in her left over sweat, they were memory foam or something so as soon as her weight settled in all of the workout sweat flooded into you. Of course your body greedily absorbed it which caused you to be able to taste it, If Trish's feet were sweet and Barbra's were sour, the black haired goddess who's foot you adorned now had a spicy taste. It was hard to describe but it was still stale sweat and it was gross. You looked pleadingly at Barbra to notice you but she didn't even glance down so she couldn't notice your eyes if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two woman parted ways again and you mentally cried that you were now trapped for even longer if Barbara didn't notice soon and even longer than that if she thought you might like the 'variety' of feet. You tried to look pleadingly at the goddess that now made the entirety of your world, maybe she would treat you more like a normal sock and you'd have some time to rest so you could talk. Unfortunately that wasn't going to be any time soon since you involuntarily massaged her foot from just the slightest pressure. The other issue was that she was somehow sweatier than Barbara even the short walk had gotten her feet all hot which forced more sweat to poor into you, how did this woman keep her feet dry normally!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got out of her car you whimpered, she was walking towards a building with her name on it, Brandy and Zoe's Female Wrestling and Dance studio.

Out of reflex, you try to jump back but only end up clumsily flopping onto your back. Before you can scream out to Andrew just in case you notice that the source of your feeling was just a caterpillar slowly shuffling it's way up the length of your arm. With a laugh and a sigh of relief, you stood back up and held your arm up to get a better look at the cute little bug. One of the reasons you liked collecting bugs was simply because they were one of the few animals that wouldn't squish you or gobble you up, with a few exceptions. A shiver rand through your gooey form as you remembered the spider again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can meanies like that spider pick on guys like you and me,\" you asked the caterpillar. \"Is it just because they are mean or is it that nice to eat a poor little guy\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how mean it was you couldn't help but picture the bug squirming around in your own stomach. Everyone always had an advantage over you even nice people still ended up squishing or gulping you down sometimes. It would be nice to have the power for once.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you were considering eating the caterpillar, it seemed that the worm had the same idea. Lost in thought, you failed to notice as the caterpillar started slowly munching away at your hand as it crawled up! By the time you realized that your new friend was eating you, it had already devoured you up to your arm, and had gotten quite plump! \"E-e-euagh!\", you yelped. You turned white as you froze both in terror and in disgust as you felt more of your body get packed into the caterpillar's tiny tummy, experiencing the gross, sticky insides of the bug. Despite promising to call out for help, the only sound you could make was a slight *squeak* as the caterpillar gobbled you up to your shoulder. You tried lifting your remaining arm to brush it away, but it just gave way underneath your weight. Your body sometimes acted weird when you were feeling extreme emotions, and it seemed extreme fear caused your gooey form to go limp. \"C-c-c'mon, little guy...\", you timidly squeaked. \"I-I wasn't really gonna eat you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug didn't seem to care, continuing to gobble up it's massive meal, managing to get up to your head. You tried crawling your way, but your legs just wouldn't function like you wanted. You tried one last time to cry out for help, but by this point it was too late. You had already been eaten up to your mouth, and now it was going to town on the rest of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour had passed, and Andrew had collected a good amount of bugs to show his friend. \"Hey, Jack! I think i got all I'm gonna catch today. Don't wanna crowd them, ya know?\" Andrew looked around his backyard for his friend, only finding some discarded clothes. \"Ugh! Stevie must've left his stuff out here again\", the boy groaned as he grabbed the clothes and took them over to his house, but stopped as he noticed a rather large caterpillar, roughly the size of a football, crawling up a tree, struggling to make it up with it's weight. \"Wooooah! Jack, where are you?!\", Andrew called out for his friend, \"Get a load of this! There's this huuuge fat caterpillar here! It must've eaten a whole bush!... Jack?\" He looked down at the clothes and then back at the caterpillar, racking his brain trying to figure out what must have happened to you. \"Hmmm... Guess he must've gone home\", he said, shrugging as he headed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely unknown to him, you hadn't even made it out of his backyard. You were currently gurgling and churning within the belly of a brightly colored caterpillar, having filled it up nearly to bursting. They normally had to eat for several days before they could enter their metamorphosis, but you were so filling a meal that it could do it now. Having been reduced to little more than a sentient sludge, you could only gurgle and mentally cry at the cruel hand that fate had dealt you. Maybe you would think twice before considering eating something so small and helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel your body squash and stretch like an accordion as the caterpillar crawled up the tree, your liquid-y form sloshing around as the bug's body wobbled. Finally, the caterpillar reached the top of the tree and you felt your surroundings begin to compress around you and harden. It must have started to make it's chrysalis. You mentally panicked, but there was nothing you could do as the caterpillar's body began to rapidly harden. Once the chrysalis had formed, you felt an extreme burning sensation as everything around you began to melt. You had read about this in science class. When the caterpillar begins it's metamorphosis, it doesn't just grow legs and wings: It digests itself! You mentally cried out in pain as you felt the enzymes try to break you down and mix you with the goopy caterpillar. You had survived many unfortunate incidents, but even you couldn't be sure if you'd make it out of this...</span></div></div>",

As the caterpillar's body began to restructure itself, you could feel parts of your own body being forced into different places. It was uncomfortable feeling your body shifting around without your control, and even moreso when you didn't know what was going on. For several long days, your body was shifted and contorted as you tried desperately to escape the chrysalis. You felt parts of your body harden and a tingling feeling along your back. Your body was clearly changing, and you did not like it one bit. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, you mustered the strength to burst out of your prison, tearing through the membrane and letting out a gasp, getting your first breath of fresh air in over a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you noticed that you were considerably smaller, maybe only a couple of inches. You panicked and looked all over your body. Some sort of flesh-colored hard, exoskeleton had formed over your body aside from your head and chest, giving you an almost armored appearance (though you were still quite fragile). You still retained only a single pair of arms and legs and a full head of black hair. The biggest change was going on in your back, which now sported a pair of (comparatively) large black butterfly wings with yellow stripes and blue spots. You flexed your back and found that you could flap them back and forth. You began hyperventilating as you sat down and tried to take this in. \"I... I'm... What am I?!\", you cried out to no one in particular. \"Am I some kind of bug? Am I a fairy?!\" Your eyes began to water as you realized that your short life, as you knew it anyway, was over. \"I can't believe it...\", you sulked to yourself. \"I got ate by a caterpillar and turned into a fairy. What am I gonna do? What's momma gonna say when she sees me like this?\" You thought about how your mother would react. She would be even more overprotective than ever before, refusing to let you out of her sight for a second. You wouldn't even get to play with Andrew anymore or go to school, denying you a chance to talk to the girl you had a crush on. Even worse than that, Selena would probably take over your room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat there feeling sorry for yourself, you failed to notice a shadow looming over you. Before you got the chance to see, you were suddenly enveloped inside of a white butterfly net and flung back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's caught the newly-formed fairy boy?</span></div></div>",

A real life fairy!\" The wind was squeezed out of you as she tightened her grip and spun around with you as she laughed. \"I got a fairy~ I got a fairy~ <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/music1.png\" alt=\"*Music1*\" title=\"Music1\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\", she sung as you were made dizzy by Selena's dancing. Even as she stopped to run into her own backyard, your world continued to spin. The little girl ran toward her pet kitty, Ian, who was lying in the sun napping. \"Look, Ian!\", Selena squealed as she presented you to her cat. \"I found my very own fairy!\" The chubby black kitty yawned before rolling over on his belly and sniffing you. You panicked and squirmed in your sister's grip as you saw Ian begin to lick his lips and opened his mouth wide before you were yanked away, his jaws closing with a *SNAP*! \"Ian, no! Bad kitty!\", Selena snapped, with Ian giving a disappointed \"mew\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairies aren't for eating, silly kitty\", she said as she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took this chance to try and get her attention. \"Selena! I'm not a fairy!\", you called out. \"It's me, Jack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena's eyes widened as she heard your high pitched voice squeak out to her. \"You can talk!\", she exclaimed. \"Ohmigosh! I gotta show Mommy!\" It seemed that she either couldn't understand you or she was so excited that she wasn't paying attention to what you were actually saying as she quickly ran inside the house, with her precious pet kitty following close behind her. \"Maybe mommy can help find the rest of the fairies... the fairy kingdom... and I can bring Natalie and we can both be fairy princesses... I can be a double princess!\" Selena continued daydreaming out loud while a glimmer of hope began to shine though your fear. If your mom found you, she might be able to figure out a way to help you return to normal, or at the very least, you'd be safer with her than with your little sister and her chubby kitty cat. Selena ran into the living room where your mother was on the phone with Barbara, calling to see if she had heard anything about you. It had been several days since you had seemingly vanished without a trace, and she was incredibly worried. You usually resurfaced after a day or two if anything happened, but it had been almost two weeks since you had been eaten by the caterpillar. Trish was worried that her little boy might never return to her. As she continued with her call, Selena walked in screaming. \"MOOOMMMYYY!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish jumped up and screamed in shock at the sudden outburst of her daughter. \"S-sorry, Barb, I'll have to call you back!\" She hung up the phone and ran over to Selena, thinking that something bad had happened. \"What is it, sweetie?\", she asked as she knelt down. \"What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found a fairy, mommy!\", Selena exclaimed, barely able to contain her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish sighed in relief. She was already worrying her head off over losing her son. Knowing that her daughter was at least still perfectly fine. \"Oh is that right?\", she asked with a smile on her face. She didn't actually believe that Selena had actually found a fairy, but she didn't want to make her loose her sense of wonder so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yepyep!\" Your sister nodded excitedly. \"I found it in Miss Barbara's backyard! Look at it, Mommy!\" She held you up to your mother's face, giving her a good look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish looked down at the little thing her daughter was holding. If you were going to get rescued from your sister, this was probably your only chance.</span></div></div>",

A fairy!\u201d You hang on for dear life as Selena jumps up and down in excitement, practically shoving the \u201cfairy\u201d into her mother\u2019s face, nearly ramming you into her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish gives a sigh, not particularly in the mood to play games, but willing to humor her daughter for the moment. \u201cOkay, honey, calm down\u201d, she replies, bending down expecting to see a butterfly or a doll in Selena\u2019s hand, and prepared to play along. \u201cOh my,\u201d she says feigning a gasp of surprise. \u201cYou certainly did find a lovely little...JACK?!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes light up, overcome with relief that your mom recognized you. You wave your arms frantically in recognition. \u201cHi, Mom!\u201d you shout, though at your new size, your voice comes out as a tiny squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Jack\u201d, your mom sobs, her Mount Rushmore-sized face welling up with tears, \u201cI thought I lost you forever. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Mom, it was awful,\u201d you begin. I was eaten by a caterpillar, then I got these wings, and then I...*urk!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour story - and your air supply - is suddenly cut off as your mother\u2019s fist closes around your body. You are suddenly lifted upwards just in time to see an enormous pair of lips zoom in to repeatedly crash into your face. For Trish, this is a touching reunion with her child. But for you, it is a hellish torture of loud, wet, dizzying smooches and being stuck in a grip with the force of five anacondas. Finally, she clutched you to her chest in what she would call a tender hug, but you might call a suffocating death press. \u201cOh, my baby,\u201d she whispers gently, completely oblivious to the fact that her hug is anything but, \u201cMomma\u2019s here. It\u2019s alright now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Selena still hadn\u2019t lost her one-track mind. She begins looking around for her newly-acquired prize. \u201cMommy,\u201d she asks, \u201cHave you seen where my fairy went?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Selena looks up at her mom clutching tightly to an unknown object, Trish shifts her hand so that the top of your head is now visible through her fingers. \u201cHe\u2019s right here, honey,\u201d she replies, not registering exactly what her daughter had asked. She finally releases her grip, and you lay in her hand, flattened, dripping with sweat, and gasping for air. After a few minutes, you begin to reform, and decide to show off your new appendages. With a little effort, you get your wings working, and levitate up to your mom\u2019s face, catching her by surprise. \u201cLook, Mom!\u201d you cry excitedly. \u201cLook what I can do!\u201d You circle around the air a few times, before once again coming to rest in her hand. \u201cI guess this experience gave me something good, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Jack, how wonderful!\u201d Trish exclaims. \u201cMy little boy can fly!\u201d She claps her hands in excitement...forgetting that she was holding you in her palm. She looks down at the tiny pancake in her hand that is her son. \u201cOh, silly Mommy,\u201d she chuckles. \u201cDid she hurt her little Jackie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! She did!\u201d you yell once you reform. \u201cRemember that I\u2019m only....mmf!\u201d You once again find yourself pressed into the vice between your mother\u2019s hand and her bosom as she lovingly but cluelessly squeezes you into oblivion. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetheart,\u201d she comforts you. \u201cThere\u2019s no better fix for an owie than a mother\u2019s hug.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another prolonged period of being mashed into your mom\u2019s crushing embrace, she finally pries you loose. \u201cThere now,\u201d she smiles down at you. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel better now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d you protest. \u201cYou have to stop doing that. It\u2019s hot in there, and...mmf!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, you poor thing,\u201d your mom says as she presses you into her flesh prison for a third time. \u201cYou need a big, long cuddle.\u201d Just as you are about to pass out from the heat and lack of oxygen, she opens her hand, again leaving you crumpled and panting. \u201cHow\u2019s my little angel now?\u201d she asks. All better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...I mean YES! Yes, all better now! No need to hug me again!\u201d Thankfully, Trish understands your pleas, and you avoid being squashed by your mom for the fifth time in the last five minutes. Trish finally starts to calm down. \u201cHoney, you\u2019ve been through a lot,\u201d she warmly points out. \u201cLet\u2019s get you settled back home.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy,\u201d Selena whines, \u201cWhat about my fairy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now, honey,\u201d Trish answers as she walks down the hall. \u201cWe\u2019ll look for him later.\u201d She turns her full attention to you. \u201cNow, Jack, let\u2019s...\u201d</span></div></div>",

You didn't want to spend the rest of your life as another one of your dumb little sister's pets!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, your cries would fall on deaf ears, almost literally. Although you had no way of knowing, your high-pitched voice was almost inaudible, only coming out as a slight squeaking noise. Your mom looked down at you and smiled. \"It's certainly a cute little fairy\", she said, playing along with her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to cry just then. Even being thrust right in her face and screaming as loud as you could, your mother simply didn't recognize you as her son. It looked like your sister was going to get to keep her fairy after all. You didn't have time to sulk as you were jerked away quickly as Selena ran over to her room. She quickly opened the door and you were greeted with several sickening shades of pink and magenta. Her floor had several fashion dolls and plush toys scattered about along with a few of Ian's cat toys... and your Arcee figure that you thought you lost. Beside her own bed was a small expensive bed that your mom had bought for Ian to sleep in, along with the box it came in which was where he actually slept. On top of her toy box was a large purple and white barbie castle and a bag of weird-looking candy. \"Welcome to your new home, Mister Fairy\", Selena giggled as she held you out to look at her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's disgusting!\", you whined. \"Let me go, you little brat! Take me back to mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that Ian?\", Selena asked as she crouched down to her kitty. \"He loves it!\" The kitty stared up at his owner and let out a \"mew\" before sticking his tongue out, attempting to lick you! You briefly panicked before your sister pulled you back. \"Ian! What did I tell you about my fairy?\" Ian held his head down and let out a disappointed \"mew..\" in response. \"Fairies aren't for eating, silly kitty. You're gonna have to be nice to Mister Fairy, or no fishy treats for you, mister.\" Ian mewed as he squeezed his fat butt into his expensive box and went to sleep as your sister set you down beside her barbie castle. Being stuck with Selena may not be favorable, but at least it looked like she would protect you. You see how much she pampers her other pet. Maybe this wouldn't be as bad as you thought... \"Okay, Mister Fairy\", she said. \"This is gonna be your new castle. Now fly up and look around!\" You looked up at the plastic castle that was to be your new home and began to walk in before your sister put her hand in front of the door. \"No, don't walk. I wanna see you fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?\", you called up as you tugged on your wings. \"I barely got these things. I don't even know if they work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena looked more angry as you stood there. \" I know you can understand me! I wanna see you fly, now FLY!\", she commanded, stomping on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were more worried as she glared down at you. \"I-I can't! I don't know how!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <b>said</b> I wanna see you <b>fly!</b>\", she screamed, stomping her feet. \"If you don't do what I say, then I'm gonna have to punish you!\" This wasn't good at all. Selena's temper tantrums were always bad news for you when you were normal size. Now, you were the size of a butterfly. Without even a second thought, your little sister could crush you like... well, a bug. You decided to try your best to get your wings working to save yourself from her wrath, but they simply weren't moving. \"Hmph! I guess you don't leave me any choice\", she said as she wrapped her fingers around you. \"This is what happens to fairies that don't listen to their princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panicked and screamed out for help to save you from your gigantic little sister, but it was no use.<br>\r\nWhat punishment does Selena have in store for you?</span></div></div>",

You trembled in fear of your gigantic little sister, afraid of what punishment she had in store for you. Suddenly, an evil grin creeped across her face. \"Oh Iannn...~\", she said as she looked down at her precious pet kitty as he lied in the box beside her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped as the cat looked up at his owner. \"Y-you wouldn't!\", you cried. \"L-lemme go! I'll try to fly again! Just don't feed me to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan briefly opened his eyes wide as he saw his fairy snack struggling in his owner's hand and licked his chops. You screamed and flailed around as Ian wriggled his big furry butt as he squeezed out of his expensive box before flopping on the floor. \"Mew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena giggled wickedly as she dangled you over her pet. \"You should've listened to me when you had the chance!\", she cackled. \"Fairies that don't listen to their princess become lunch for her mighty manticore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew\" Although Ian was by no means mighty, he was still a clever kitty, and was able to gobble you up when you were full size. Currently at the size of a butterfly, you were completely at his mercy. The cat squeezed out of the box as Selena lowered you down to her precious pet's face, opening his mouth wide to await his snack. You flailed around as you looked down at the hungry maw, desperate to avoid falling into the fang-filled pit. Your sister then let go, allowing you to fall to your doom. You screamed and panicked as you flailed in the air, and managed to change your trajectory and bounce off of his nose and to the side of him as he snapped his jaws shut!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I made it!\" Your celebration was shortlived as Ian growled angrily at you and raised his paw. You yelped as you jumped to the left, managing to dodge as he slammed his paw into the ground! You weren't safe just yet. Knowing you were in danger if you stayed still, you ran as fast as you could, slipping out from underneath the door and away from the massive hungry cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go catch him, kitty!\", Selena called out as she opened the door. \"Go get the fairy!\" Ian growled as he ran out, refusing to let his meal get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly looked back and saw the giant black cat chasing you down. \"L-let me go, you big fat furball!\", you yell as you move your tiny legs. \"I know you can hear me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MREOWR!\" Ian continued sprinting after his prey until he had chased you into the living room. There was a flap that was meant to let him come in and out, but he had grown too fat to freely get out of it without some struggling. If he allowed you to leave now, then he might never get to see what a fairy tasted like. Not intending to let you leave, he suddenly pounced forward, trying to close the distance between himself and his fairy snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he make it?</span></div></div>",

I'm dying to start Jedi Fallen Order,\" you complained, unsettled for the fact you're currently losing a match of Splatoon again, then Andrew's tardiness.  You threw the controller to the floor, continuing to chat with your best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm bringing it with my Xbox one! My mom told me we're almost there. She all dressed up and excited to be going out with your mom for the night. Honestly, it's scaring me a little.\" Andrew talked, whispering the last bit about his mother, so she didn't hear the comment, \"Oh, by the way! If your mom and my mom are going out, does that mean we're going to be home alone?\" Andrew said, excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish!\" you answered, staring out the window into the dark street, after moving the curtains. \"Selena went begging to my mom for her friend's older sister to babysit us for the entire night sleepover,\" you stated, sitting down with disappointment not seeing Barbara's car arrive still. \"Lucky for us, they haven't shown up either. So hopefully, you'll get here before that happens,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, will you come here please,\" Trish asked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to go! I'll see you soon,\" you replied, hanging up the call, and went towards the kitchen. \"Yeah... MOM!\" you responded, surprised before speechless after witnessing your mother, Trish. She had her hair tied in a low twisted bun, wearing a Red Satin V Neckline slit side dress with silver heels, exposing an ample view from front to back, and more importantly, she was wearing makeup that you frequently never seen. \"Mom, What the hell are you wearing!\" you yelled out, covering your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, language young man,\" Trish pouted, before returning to fix in her earings in a mirror. \"I know its a bit much, but Barbara fancied me to wear it out tonight. Anyways, I'm leaving the babysitter a hundred dollars on the fridge with me and Barbara number on a note pad. I don't want to find out that anything unfortunate happens while I'm out till tomorrow morning,\" Trish stated, still arranging herself when the doorbell rang. \"Can you get that sweetie,\" Trish smiled, in a rush thinking Barbara arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed to the door, ready to start the new game with your bud, \"Finally! We can set it...up..\" losing your train of thought, as at the door was your dream girl standing there in bright pink frilly pajamas with a sleeping bag and backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you! That weird boy with a funny condition? Jack, right? I thought this was Selena's house,\" she claimed, looking past you to see if your sister was inside. \"Sorry, I'll go tell my mom that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" you blurt out, \"She's here! That's my little sister!\" You responded nervously. \"SELENA!\" you cried out, hearing the tumbling of running footsteps at the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary, you're here!\" Selena came crashing downward, almost splattering herself in the process. She was wearing a very long paw patrol shirt that concealed over her panties, leaving only a small bit of her legs and matching socks to view. \"I'm so glad you made it, Nat hasn't arrived but come upstairs,\" Selena took Mary by the arm as they ran up to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped, unbelieving that your dream girl was spending the night in your household, as for how Selena and Mary knew each other that a mystery. You proceed to close the door when a foot stops it from shutting, \"Hey, what the big idea!\" a boyish tone voice spoke, pushing the door back open, almost squishing you, \"I'm Mary's brother Gary! My mom told made me I had to come with my butthead sister,\" he announced, nose dripping with snot, and smelly unwashed clothes, \"Aw, cool you got a switch. Let's have a turn,\" he threw his belongings on the couch, turning on the console anew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't say much to the snotty boy while closing the door, but you perceived he was going to ruin your planned out night with Andrew. Before you took two steps away, the doorbell went off a second time, letting out an earing sigh, proceeding to open it once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" a teen girl smiled as she stood there staring at you. She was tall with a white complexion and green eyes, brunette hair with blond highlights, she had on a pair of black leggings and white designer T-shirt. \"My name Sarah, little guy, what's yours?\" she expressed friendly, bending over to your eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My names...\" *SQUELCHH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move your butt, Sarah!\" Natalie whined loudly, shoving her older sister posterior forwarded, knocking her over in the process to get inside faster to see Selena, and drowning out your audible demise. Unaware that she force a hand in squishing you by Sarah, not that she cares, wearing a lite blue top with pink shorts. \"Selena! I'm here,\" Nat sung, to call her friend, as her sister rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena came running faster than before, similar to a trained dog, as the two girls hugged each other. \"Sarah! I'm so glad your babysitting too,\" Selena came over to embrace her. As the two girls went back upstairs, you heard the clicking of your mom's heels approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, sorry, I'm in a bit of a hurry! I left some money to order pizza's and my number on the fridge with my friends. If you could drop some of my family laundries in the washer, you'd be an angel! Also, please make sure to keep close on Jack and Selena. I know you've dealt with Selena, but Jack can be just a hand full,\" Trish rambled on with giggles in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah dropped all train of thought after Trish said, \"Hi,\" she was mesmerizingly lost by the sheer beauty Trish doll herself up for the night. A guilty pleasure to Sarah, as she had a massive thing for attractive older women if her rosy cheeks didn't already give that away. Trish finished speaking her endless list of rules, asking if Sarah had any questions, but she was a bubbling mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara walked up to the door inviting open door, wear a similar outfit to Trish, only draped in color of dark blue, seeming twice as sexual then Trish. \"Knock! Knock! is my date ready,\" Barbara commented, propelling Sarah's face to grow redder by the second ready to faint. \"Be good, sweetie,\" Barbara kissed Andrew goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you stop that girl seem embarrassed by what you said?\" Trish responded, walking with Barbara down the path, shouting goodbyes to her kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that was an embarrassment, Trish?\" Barbara laughed to her clueless friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew saw the boy that wasn't you playing the Nintendo switch, \"Excess me, miss?\" Andrew asked the babysitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me Sarah to make it easier,\" she blushed, pretending to scratch her head as she shut the door. She was worried to all hell since she only babysat her sister and not five other kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, have you seen Jack?\" Andrew politely asked, watch Sarah freak already losing a child. \"I think that'shim stuck to your shirt?\" Andrew added on peeling you free from the girl's breasts. Sarah was shocked and pretty amazed watching you pop back to normal, she kind of wanted to know what it might feel like when happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Andrew, I have a tv in my room,\" you affirm, leaving Gary and Sarah downstairs to their business. passing your sister's room, you heard the giggling of the girls, before shutting your door, as Andrew practically stomped on a few of your transformers to set up his Xbox. \"So, you won't believe these! but that girl I like is right in the other room,\" you told Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that kid downstairs is her brother?\" Andrew questioned, to which you replied by a nod of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So go talk to her! Ask to play truth or dare?\" Andrew laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack listed to girls laughing louder, \"No way! I'm too scared. Let's start playing Fallen order as we plan too,\" Jack said, sitting down next to Andrew. As the night began to get fun later on suddenly...</span></div></div>",

You were born with a squishy, goo-like body. While this makes you practically immortal, it also means you are extremely weak, constantly getting squashed and flattened by almost everything. You seem to be able to take an awful lot of punishment. Getting smooshed doesn't really hurt you. In fact, you could be melted into a puddle and still be fine. You still hate it nonetheless. You're kind of a geek, often studying on the internet and playing video games. You seem to have stopped aging.<br>\r\nAlthough you are unusual compared to other people, you're just one of many abnormalities in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew Morrison - 8. Your annoying best friend and next door neighbor. While he\u2019s mostly really nice to you, he\u2019s been known to occasionally mess with you (though he usually knows when to stop). You often play together, catching bugs or with your toys or video games. Even though you can trust him to look out for you, his other friends aren\u2019t always as nice. He sometimes pressures you into doing things you aren\u2019t comfortable with.<br>\r\nHe's sometimes a bit impulsive, often failing to consider the consequences before he acts.<br>\r\nAndrew is often the target of Ian, who's bite causes him to become just as squishy as Jack. He doesn't have nearly as much experience in this state, and has trouble reforming if he gets squished. This is especially troublesome when he's around his mom or his little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish Harper - 41. Your mother. You have a weird relationship with her. Even though you love your mother and view her presence as a sanctuary from the misfortunes that could befall you, you still finds her overprotective nature and motherly ignorance when it comes to games and stuff more than a little annoying. Even so, you tend to freak out if you aren\u2019t able to find her, despite how much she embarrasses you. She\u2019s a bit shorter than average women, and she\u2019s quite curvy, and she has blonde hair, green eyes, and the same dark skin color as you (though it doesn\u2019t have the same pink tint to it), and sometimes smells of butterscotch.<br>\r\nUnknown to you, Trish has the same condition as yourself and is just as vulnerable as you are when she isn\u2019t taking her medication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena Harper - 6. Your little sister. Your mother adopted her several months ago, and to say you don't get along with her is an understatement. You haven't been able to stand a minute of her living with you, but you try your best to be nice to her since it upsets your mother when you leave her out. Since she's younger, she often gets her way when deciding on movies to watch or restaurants to visit, which wouldn't bother you if she didn't rub it in your face. It doesn't help that she points out the fact that she's taller than you.<br>\r\nAlthough your mother has been trying to break her of her habits, she's quite masochistic, often forcing herself down people's throats, though most of the kids in your school and your family think she's too creepy, preferring to munch on you instead. Because of this, she's had trouble making friends at school, but having her kitty with her seems to be helping her. She has the same condition that you and your mother have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan- Selena's precious, spoiled pet kitty is an enigma, and a dangerous living weapon. He loves getting pampered by his \"mama\" and dressed in cute outfits, and rarely ever leaves her side. What makes this kitty different than most is not only because of his malleable body, but his ability to turn others into squishies by biting into them! Once his saliva enters the bloodstream, whoever is bitten remains vulnerable for 24 hours. You swear you've heard him talk, but no one believes you.<br>\r\nHe has a habit of getting into your room and knocking your displays over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina \"Kat\" Harper - 13. Your tomboyish older cousin who lives in a rural area on the other side of town. She\u2019s been staying the weekend with you and your mom and you haven\u2019t been able to stand one second. She finds your condition hilarious and has been bullying you for as long as you can remember. You\u2019ve spent a lot of her visits squished under her butt or being involved in some kind of awful prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristopher \"Kris\" Harper - 15. Your feminine cousin and Kat's older brother. Kris is almost the polar opposite of his sister. While she's always been more boyish and mean, Kris has always been somewhat nice to you and is more girlish in appearance. Although he's more kind than Kat, that doesn't mean you're exactly safe around him, as he does mess with you from time to time. He's always had a fascination with science and chemistry and is usually holed up in his room or the basement, so he rarely if ever visits, though you usually see him at school.<br>\r\nHe's aware that your mother shares your condition, but he keeps that info to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian Harper - 35. Your absent-minded aunt. Even though she's your mom's younger sister, she's always been closer with Barbara for as long as you remember. She's somehow even less mature than both of your cousins; happily enjoying the privileges that come with adulthood, while sometimes flat out refusing to take on the responsibilities that come with it. The only reason Kat and Kris have lived long and healthy enough as they have is because your mother and grandmother have been helping raise them. She still loves her children, she just isn't mature or smart enough to properly care for them.<br>\r\nThis unfortunately extends to you, as you rarely come back from one of your visits over there without getting smushed by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara Morrison - 40. Andrew's mother and an old friend of your mother. You\u2019ve always had a secret crush on her since forever, even if she does squish you every now and then, and only occasionally apologizes. She\u2019s always had a gift for avoiding everyone\u2019s anger and disdain, and even you can\u2019t bring yourself to get mad at her, no matter what she does to you. Even your mother goes along with her without hesitating. She has a much more athletic build than your mother and is about a head taller than she is.<br>\r\nBarbara\u2019s gift for manipulating everyone\u2019s emotions is due to a secret part of her that she\u2019s been hiding from everyone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan \"Stevie\" Morrison - 4. Andrew's bratty little brother. Where most people would see a cute, pudgy, innocent little boy, you see sadistic monster. It\u2019s not that Stevie is mean. He\u2019s actually really nice (unless someone tells him no). He just doesn\u2019t see you as a person: just a squishy, yummy toy that can talk. The worst part is he\u2019s smart for his age. He knows just how to hide you so he can keep from getting into trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley \"Ash\" Parker - 15. Andrew's cousin. You had a pretty horrible encounter with him one Halloween, but he made things right soon after. He seems pretty cool to you, but you still aren't sure of what to think of him, though you feel like you might have something of a crush. He often babysits his cousins and normally tags along with them and Barbara when they go out. He's moderately popular at school, and he's friends with your cousin, Kris.<br>\r\nAs his own parents are seemingly never around, he's been living with his aunt and cousins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarilynn \u201cMary\u201d Evans - 8. A kind little girl who is destined to become your soulmate. Although she doesn't share the same interests as you, her cute appearance and kind nature make you look past that, convincing you to come around to try out things she might like. In the future, you will both mean the world to each other and eventually start a family.<br>\r\nThere are multiple ways to meet her, and fate has a way of bringing you two together... even if it is through unfortunate circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKentwolf created a followup story following up on these characters five years later here: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1975029-A-Squishy-Teen\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1975029-A-Squishy-Teen</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you like this story, you should check out their stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=============================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>No one sentence chapters.</b></font> If it's a bridge chapter, that's understandable, but try to limit them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack can't die, so don't do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Use proper spelling and punctuation. Make it is readable</b>. (apparently this part needs attention)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust about anything else goes. (read below)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo copying other people's work. I can't in good faith have plagiarized work here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are several short stories I wrote about Jack. When adding chapters, you can choose to incorporate them into the interactive if you'd like, unless they're \"Bad End\" stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a there's a sudden development that doesn't make any damn sense, or if a chapter is nothing but a sentence long, I will delete the chapter without hesitation. HOWEVER if it's clear that some effort is put into it, I'll simply email you before going over and fixing grammatical or continuity errors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGas/Toilet stuff is alright so long as it's not too heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[edit 11/16/19]: There might be instances in which other characters are turned squishy, in which case you're free to switch the POV to them for a bit. When you do so, be sure to label the chapter with the squishie we're following.<br>\r\n[edit 11/26/19]: Anyone that happens to get bitten by Ian will temporarily become a squishie like Jack or Trish and have the same properties. This could last anywhere between one day and one week. Whoever is bitten should be extra careful: If they don't reform to their original state whenever the effects of the bite wear off, they will remain in whatever form they are currently in for good. Should they get flattened, their new default form will simply be a soft fleshy pancake (thought they'll be able to stretch as long as their original form was tall). If they are eaten, then they will remain as a sentient layer of fat for the rest of their existence. If they are melted, then they will remain a liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n================================================================<br>\r\nI'm open to suggestions for chapters if you aren't confident in your own writing ability.</td>",
