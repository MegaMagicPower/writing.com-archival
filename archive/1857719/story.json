You could roll back over and hide yourself away under the sheets. It\u2019s not as though you were expecting anyone. Besides, if anyone were to ask why you didn\u2019t answer, well, you were sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThen again, it could be something terribly important. Maybe it\u2019s an officer here to inform you that one of your family members has been injured in an accident. Perhaps your mother veered into oncoming traffic and had to be rushed to the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs your mind twists and turns, forming an endless stream of possibilities, the doorbell calls out once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlright,\u201d you mumble, shifting under your covers. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta make a choice here.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The house is unusually quiet for a Saturday morning. \u201cEveryone must be gone,\u201d you remark to yourself. Usually you\u2019d hear the sound of your sister playing loud pop music, or your mother watching one of her aerobics videos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen you open the front door you see a small brown package sitting on the porch. \u201cGreat,\u201d you say, \u201cI got out of bed for a box.\u201d Turning it over, you notice that it\u2019s addressed to you. \u201cNo return address... Definitely wasn\u2019t expecting anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOn the way back to your room, you turn the package over a few more times in your hands, inspecting it to make sure it\u2019s not some sort of bomb. Curiosity slowly builds as you try to imagine what it is, or who it\u2019s from. There are no hints on the box itself, no markings other than the ones from postage. It couldn\u2019t hurt to just open it, right? I mean, what are the odds that someone actually wants to bomb you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBack in your room, you set the box down on your desk and warily remove the packing tape from the top. As you peer inside you find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tSitting at the bottom of the box is a small device that looks like some kind of remote control. You pick it up and examine it, saying, \u201cWhat? Is the cable guy sending me stuff now?\u201d There are rows of unmarked buttons and a dial with several strange symbols at every interval. To be honest, it looks pretty common, besides the fact that you have no idea what it\u2019s for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou turn the dial over and over, trying to make sense of the symbols. There are four that look like a circle with three curved lines above, below, and to each side of it. Another one looks like an oddly shaped \u201cL\u201d with a plus beside it. Opposite that one is another oddly shaped \u201cL\u201d with a minus beside it. There are a few others, but they\u2019re so bizarre that it\u2019s hard to describe them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFrom downstairs you can hear the front door open and close, followed by the muffled sound of two women arguing. It\u2019s your mother and your sister, probably back from the store, or wherever they\u2019d run off to. Your sister, Ashley, is probably throwing a fit over not getting her way. It\u2019s nothing new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe thought of asking your mom to look at the device pops into your head. Then again, she can get paranoid over things like strange packages, or strange remote controls. Maybe you could try it out on the television, see if it turns anything on.</span></div></div>",

Nothing happens as you press the smaller buttons near the top, but as soon as you hit a big black button right under the dial, a flash of light blinds you. Your hand quickly covers your eyes, massaging the eyelids in an attempt to help them  readjust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your sight returns, you can only stare dumbfounded at the television. Instead of your 36 inch plasma screen, there now sits a miniature that looks as though it belongs in a doll house. You can\u2019t believe it. Thoughts whirl inside your head, unable to form an explanation for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic? Witchcraft? Science fiction?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case, it really happened. You turn the dial to the circle with the lines above it, point the remote at the screen once more and hit the button. This time there is no flash of light, and you watch as the television slowly expands. The longer you hold the button, the bigger it gets, until it reaches half of its original size. Your mouth drops open in awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis remote has the power to change size. Is it just the T.V.? You turn it toward your desk, press the button, and watch as it slowly expands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you begin to wonder whether or not it would work on humans. If so, the possibilities would be endless. You\u2019re suddenly compelled to use the device on someone. Anyone. Who do you want to use it on, though?</span></div></div>",

Her attitude is very \u201cbratty,\u201d very self-centered. She wants to grow up quickly and she is often jealous of other women who are more endowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty Harris<br>\r\nAge: 16<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u20184\u201c<br>\r\nBreast Size: 34C<br>\r\nHair Color: Black<br>\r\nRelation: Alex\u2019s close friend and love interest. <br>\r\nThey\u2019ve been on two dates and want to continue seeing each other, but don\u2019t want to rush into it too quickly.

Try to add some \"weight\" to any additions. Also, try to keep continuity up as you add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRacy, sexual material is allowed, but nothing scatological.
