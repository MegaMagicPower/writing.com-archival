Some wisps seem almost lazy, drifting around you in circulous patterns that entrance you for centuries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how long you've been like this, you only live now, each new moment a surprise. All you have known is the comforting grey mist which blankets your existence. Time never meant anything for you, not in this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with each passing moment, you sense something off. You feel a prickle in your senses, and you tear your eyes away from the hypnotic mist. Before your very sight, you see the mist that has for so long hidden you, begin to fade. From it, a bright light abruptly flashes, and you avert your eyes from the blinding light. <br>\r\nThe light vanishes as quickly as it came, and your eyes takes in the new sight. You feel emotion for the first time-fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you stood a powerful creature. With the horns of a Ram on top of wolf's head, he was the very image of fear. His human chest bulged with power that dared anyone to challenge him. His cloven feet steadied his mighty torso, and a lions tail swished to and fro, almost playfully. Dark fur covered him from head to toe, but instead of masking him it instead magnified the power of this beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood proudly, his tail swishing as he studied you. An easily impressive figure, and if you knew how to cower, you would have. The intruders constant staring made you uncomfortable. <br>\r\n\"<b>Do not fear me spirt, I will not harm you</b>.\" The intruders voice boomed against the grey emptiness. His statement didn't exactly calm you however. <br>\r\nThe intruder strode up to you, and you noticed he wore amulet around his neck. You had no time to get details however, as he knelt before you. He waved his clawed hand over you, and the feeling of security and reassurance swept through you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I am Dargalore, the God of the Unborn and those who are chosen to be Reborn again. I rule all who harbor here in my realm</b>\" His massive jaws had no problem saying words clearly and smoothly. \"<b>Too long have have I kept you from your destiny. I, who was afraid of the impact you would have on the world, hid you away like a child's toy</b>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDargalore placed his fist upon his heart. \"<b>But no more. The land is ready for you and the events you will bring. I am sure of it. No one should have to stay so long in the mist as you have, and for that, my sorrow</b>.\" Dargalore lowered his head to you, his sadness apparent upon his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDargalore stood and opened his hand, and a staff appeared in a twinkling of light. It was of a deep red wood, and a gem was embedded at the top, it's light pulsating gently. \"<b>To atone for my guilt, I will allow you to choose your fate, at least in part, rather than have nature run its course</b>.\" He swung his staff and aimed it directly at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I, Dargalore, who commands the Unborn and Reincarnated, commands this unborn spirit to choose its own way</b>!\" <br>\r\nHis eyes pierced yours. \"<b>What is your gender? <br>\r\nAre you a child of the Light or a child of the Dark</b>? \" <br>\r\nHe awaits your answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see the gem from his staff begin to glow brighter and brighter until it covers you completely in its comforting glow. It was too bright to see anything, even Dargalore vanishes from your view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a sort of tickling at first, and you pay it no mind. You don't notice at first that it changes to a prickling then to a pinching. It becomes so painful, the feeling is akin to being burned alive. As your new body forms it becomes a new place to feel pain. Your fingers and toes form last, and your spirt takes its final place behind your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agony is only just bearable. You hear Dargalore's unmistakable deep grumbling voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I have sent others before you to pave the way. Find them, and they will help you. There will be times when you will feel there is no hope for you. Call upon me and I will come. We will meet again</b>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA final wave of agony, greater than those before, smashes into your small frame. Your sight turns dark, all you can see is an emptiness of the darkest kind. Not the grey mist that comforted you for so long, nor the blinding light Dargalore brought. You feel the memories of what you experienced in this realm slip away. For the first time in your life, you sleep. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was late at night, and it was the only time the kitchen was quiet. The breakfast shift would wake soon, but for now, all was calm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had so far been a hard winter, with its raging storms and blizzards constantly harassing the manor. But there was more than enough grain stored away, and that was all that mattered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished another row and began another. Her project was almost finished. She had scoured the manor for the softest material, for this one project. The young woman was so occupied with her work, she didn't hear the footfalls of another person as they walked toward her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darla, what are you doing here? You need rest, not running yourself ragged.\" the person exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla lips tugged into a small smile. She knew that voice anywhere. She stopped her knitting and smoothed a hand over her swollen belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies Mrs. Gavin, but I could not sleep, the babe is a strong kicker.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be a boy then, I have had my share of boys.\" Mrs. Gavin replied. \"And they were all mighty kickers.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Gavin was a portly woman which was to be expected as she was head cook. She and her husband had had a whole litter of strapping boys, but not a single girl. She tried to come off stern, but she was a kind and considerate soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla laughed, the tinkling noise that always brought joy to the manor's staff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you not say that it would be a girl not a day past?\" Darla smiled. \"You just need to accept the fact you won't know the gender till its born. You know for some babes gender flows like water from a pitcher. Only the will of Dargalore can decide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ach, you and those Gods of yours. Don't know how you can stand thinking Gods control what happens to you. Madness.\" Mrs. Gavin chided gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla tried to get up, and succeeded with Mrs.Gavin's help. \"Up you get now dear, let me walk you to your chamber.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked down the quiet halls of the manor, Mrs. Gavin tried again as she had before to reach the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you just say who the babe's father is, you could get some land or coin. You could be better off than the simple maid you are now Darla. You know our Lord would make it fair for you, he takes care of his own. Even if it was a stable lad, you could still get coin for your babe's future. \" Mrs. Gavin implored her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Darla only shook her head. They had arrived at her room, and Darla eased open her door. She turned back, and caught the cook's eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what you said before about religion, I just want you to know that everyone needs something to believe in.\" Darla's eyes held a conviction that Mrs. Gavin had never seen before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a stunned head cook outside her room, Darla gently closed the door and went to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the fateful moonlit sky on the night you were born, tragedy struck at the manor. Most women have given birth without a hitch, but complications arose that the healers could not help. Try as the healer did, your mother could not be saved. When those in the manor heard the news, all was silent except for the tears of all who loved the gentle maid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir tears faded, as they realized that her child lived through the night. You, lived through the night. And they once again knew that new life came from old.<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho raises you in the absense of your mother?</span></div></div>",

Snap out of it! We need those potatoes done before the noon meal, not breakfast tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jerk your head up from your work to see Mrs. Gavin scowling down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\na word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hard of hearing as well!?\" Mrs. Gavin's voice rose. \"Naught but a child of ten summers and you think you can ignore me eh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething heavy is flung on you and before you can react, you fall from your stool. You yelp in shock. You glance up quickly, and a potato peel falls off your nose. You look at yourself, and you realize you are covered in potato peels, they bury you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole kitchen staff chuckles and laughs at the performance as they work. Mrs. Gavin stands over you holding the big empty bowl you had been filling with peels the last hour. She breaks into a smile . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will teach you to ignore the old head cook.\" She offers her hand to help you up. You break into a smile and laugh. You accept the hand and she brushes you off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off you go now, I reckon you have worked hard enough for one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushes you toward the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your thumb out of your mouth Em.\" A servant girl reminds you. You reluctantly pull it out and wipe your hand against your shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, let me show you.\" She says to you, and she pulls you into her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wash the walls like this,\" she guides your hand across the wall. \"Then you just dip.\" She tipped the cloth into the soapy bucket. Some got on your hand, and you giggle happily. \"Then back to the wall, back and forth and back and forth,\" the servant girl whispered in your ear. It tickled, so you tried to squirm away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant set you on your feet gently and she herself stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Gavin said no supper till you clean the wall.\" She ruffled your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try not to draw on the wall anymore Em.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch her as she turns down hall and out of sight. You turn back to the wall. You think that the mud on the walls look pretty, and you don't understand why Cooky didn't like them. You shrug and dip the cloth back into the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n////////////////////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tug on the stable masters breeches. He is busy with another person, but soon that person walks away and his attention is on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now little one, what brings you out here to the stables? \" he knelt down to be even with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not little, I am 11! That is plenty big, Almost an adult even! \"You grumble, crossing your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I suppose, what can I help you with?\" The man laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to ride, I am sure I'd be really good at it, I swear!\" You insist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" The man stands and eyes you. \"Very well, be here with the other boys at sunrise tomorrow, right where I am standing now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will sir I swear!\" You spin on the spot and run out of the stable, so he wouldn't change his mind. You hear his booming laughter behind you as you race away, excitement sitting in your gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n////////////////////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the water forlornly. The moon is out, but even that doesn't cheer you. You come to this part of the woods because it calms you, but tonight it couldn't ease your sadness as it usually did. You pull the grass around you and toss each blade one by one into the water. So intent is your mood, you don't notice you aren't alone until someone sits right beside you. You jump in fright, but relax when you realize it's your friend Ava. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emery, what is wrong, you know we aren't allowed in the forest?\" She asks softly. You sigh. \"How did you find me?\" You ask her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lays her hand over yours. \"I am your friend, what kind of question is that?\" You stare at her hand, laying over yours, just another reminder of how different you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at your hand, then look at mine,\" you compare, lining up your forearm with hers. Hers could reflect the moon, with its smooth color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is your skin so white, like milk, while mine is just a few shades lighter than the bark from a tree?\" You let your hand drop into your lap. \"No one else looks like me. Why am I different from you?\" You stare out onto the lake. These thoughts had been eating at you for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this why you have been ignoring everyone? \" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince, for she hit it right on the mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody cares about the color of your skin Emery, it's pretty and unique, just like you. Why would skin matter anyway? It's what matters here,\" she tapped you on the head, \"and here\" tapping you on your heart. \"Ask anyone, they will tell you.\" She said. She drew her knees to her chest and wrapped her arms around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not only that Ava. Who were my mom and dad? If they were still alive, would I be a different person? Someone different than I am today?\" you quietly toss more grass into the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva was quiet for a long time. They stared at the water, watching the night pass on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to answer that Emery.\" She said softly. \"My mama said your ma was beautiful, caring, and a great friend to her. I don't think it matters if you would be different or not. What matters is if they would be proud of you now.\" Ava wrapped an arm around your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are proud of you Emery, your their kid, everyone is proud of their kid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n////////////////////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dash over the marked line in the sand. \"I win!!\" You yell loudly, pumping your arm in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva and James puff behind you, finally catching up. \"No fair!\" Ava complained. \"You get to wear those leggings while my ma dressed me like this!\" She motioned to her ensemble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dress stuck to her neck and legs, sticky from sweating in the summer sun. Her dress had been fresh and pretty when they started out to collect the eggs, but everyone knew the infamous trio would get in some sort of trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh at your friends sweaty faces. You love to run, and this race didn't even steal your breath. When you ran, it was like time stopped, and you didn't have to deal with anyone, just your feet and the dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames on the other hand, had his hands on his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why,\" he gasped, \"are you,\" he took another breath, \"so fast?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin widely. You raise a hand and throw out your chest. \"I never tell a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames glanced at Ava. She knowingly nodded. \"Get em!\" James roared, and they both pounced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no! I have the eggs!\" You scream, trying to stop them. You hit the ground, a mass of wiggling bodies trying to get free. You feel the eggs as they crush against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all stagger up, laughing at each others yolk covered clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva seemed to realize the severity of the situation first. Her face fell. \"The eggs!\" She gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sobered as well as James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Gavin is going to kill us!\" James wailed. He dropped to the dirt and began picking up the broken shells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's pointless James,\" you hiss, \"we can't put the eggs back together!\" James let the shells fall from his hands. He was in full panic mode now. You think quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Do you still have those paper rocks from school today James?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea yea, here!\" He pulled out several from his bag. You pick up the basket and place the paper rocks into it. They look like real eggs to you, and you think they will pass. They were just paper, flour and water, but you couldn't tell the difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at yourself, then your two friends. \"Your less dirty Ava, you have to do it,\" you decide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva frowned. \"Why me, that's not fair. I already got in trouble this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smirked. \"What's the matter Ava, you to chicken?\" He strutted around crowing. \"Bawk bawk bawk!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle at your friends silliness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your more chicken then I will ever be!\" Ava shot back as she took the basket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just drop it and walk away. Don't say a word and act normal, don't look anyone on the eye,\" you advise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make sense! I talk a lot! \" Ava fretted, patting down her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it.\" James muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighttt, but I am not going to like it..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The tension felt so thick you could slice it with a knife. Everyone knew why they were there, and nobody wanted to be the one to jinx it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you hear the door to the stable being open, and you hold your breath as the stable master enters. He stands before the group, with a slight frown on his face. His hand reached up and ruffled his own hair, as he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright lads! Hop to! I need this stable cleaned before any lessons can be done!\u201d he shouted, startling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance about quickly to make sure you weren\u2019t the only one. Thankfully, no one seemed to notice. The group split off into ten different directions, leaving you standing in the middle, all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d the stable master raises an eyebrow, \u201cGet to it, no dawdling now.\u201d He points you toward a rake, and you double-time to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne stall after the other, you rake the hay out while other boys wheelbarrow it away. Pretty soon, your arms are tired because you aren\u2019t used to this type of labor. You usually hang about in the kitchen or laundry room, doing odd jobs that needed to be done. Sweat runs down your back and you\u2019re grateful that you put on old clothes this morning, for surely Mrs. Gavin would have had a fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet a move on boys, I haven\u2019t got all day!\u201d The master shouted. \u201cMuster up now, in the front!\u201d<br>\r\nYou rush, putting your tool away and sprinting to the front. The master nods as he glances around at the group\u2019s collective work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould be better, could be better, but not bad boys, not bad at all.\u201d He turns back to the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, down to business. Horses aren\u2019t toys to play with. They are real animals that, not handled properly, could seriously injure you. A hoof to the head could kill you. Stay out of way of their feet. I don\u2019t need to hear the lord complaining about dead boys and broken toes. If a horse looks feisty, don\u2019t go up to it and start petting its head, horses can bite. Lastly, do NOT ever try to ride a horse without my permission. Is that understood?\u201d<br>\r\nEveryone nodded vigorously and their strangled yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, there are ponies outside waiting for you. In the first ring. There are enough for the 9 of ya, get on with yourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one needed a second word of command, everyone rushed out the stable door, knocking in to one another and crawling over the fallen ones in an excited manner. You stay behind, knowing that there was no way you could get first pick, being the youngest in the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other boys already had a good year experience behind you, and you didn't even know how to get on a horse, let alone ride one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stable master sees you alone and motions you too him. You walk over, cautious in case it was a scolding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know how to ride?\" He asked you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou Shake your head. \"No sir.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, follow me then.\" He abruptly turned and went deeper into the stable. Even while cleaning it, you didn't know it was so big. He brings you through a hallway and a door, and you gasp in surprise. <br>\r\nIt was an indoor corral, big enough for 3 large horses to excersise in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut off to the side was a strange contraption. A barrel hung in midair suspended by many ropes, and had a saddle strapped to it. The ropes were attached to pulleys on the rafters of the roof and it all had a dangerous feeling to it. A giant pile of hay and straw bags sat below it.<br>\r\nThe stable master jumped into the hay and motions to you again. <br>\r\nYou warily jump in as well, and the master tugged on a rope that brought the barrel down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on now, try to hang on.\" He advised. \"Aim for the hay if you do get to falling.\" He winked at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to get on, trying one leg after another. You jump and lay sideways on it, only to slide down. <br>\r\nFinally, the master must of got impatient, for you feel yourself slung on the barely. You redden in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you don't have time to think about the moment, because the master tugs on another rope, and you are pulled high into the air. Higher and higher you go, until you are closer to the rafters then the floor. Your throat closes up so you cannot scream, no matter how much you want to. You grip the saddle tighter and squeeze it with your thighs. Your knuckles slowly turn white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you doing up there?\" The stable master's voice floats up to you. You try to look down but the whole barrel wobbles with that simple movement alone. You stay stock still, cursing whatever notion you had that wanted to learn to ride to begin with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well I'll be back by supper time, try to hang on now, it's a long way down.\" You hear the door slam as he leaves. <br>\r\nYou panic. Supper time? It was sunup!! There was no way you could stay hanging on all morning! Aim for the hay? How was that even possible!? You chance to see the bottom and almost slip as the whole barrel jumped and dipped. You let out a squeak, and throw your length forward, instead of holding the horn alone. But instead of stabilizing you it only made the twisting and jumping worse. You sit upright quickly and grab the horn. The barrel righted itself instantly.. You let out a deep breath. If you stay in the right position, it wouldn't rock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed on and you slowly took in your surroundings. The room was very large and you realize it must connect with the barn. There was only one window and light shone through with a fury. You pass the time by watching particles hit the sunlight and float away. But that only entertains you for a while, and the passing of time becoming a burden for you. You slowly start to bounce, moving the barrel up and down. Being on it so long, you have faith it won't just flip. You sway from side to side as well, making it more entertaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours pass like this, and you become more daring. You make the barrel go crazy, laughing as you hold on and try to right it. Finnaly, you stand in the stirrups and raise your hands in the air. A boom of the stable door breaks the silence of your fun, and your arms windmill as you try to keep balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Announcements<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms windmill as you desperately try to keep balance. Luckily, you regain it at the last possible moment, and you throw yourself forward on the saddle once more. You came close to falling. So close. You lean over to see what caused the noise. You see the stable master gawking up at you, his jaw ready to hit the floor. Finally! You were getting hungry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you hear the creak of the ropes as he lowers the barrel, and you, to the ground. You are lowered slowly to the hay and you ease off the barrel. Getting off was sure easier than getting on, that was for sure. Your legs feel ready to fall off, you never felt this sore before. You heave and squirm out of the hay, your legs protesting mightily at yet another abuse. You stand before the master; sure you will get a reprimanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I go sir?\u201d you ask nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, get along with ya, be back with the other boys tomorrow,\u201d he grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let yourself out, sneaking a look back at the master. The man had a hand on the barrel, but he stared out at nothing. The door closed, and your view gets cut off. You walk through the quiet stables. Everyone was at supper, so only the rustling of the horses could be heard throughout the stable. You pass by each stall, admiring one qualities of each horse as you pass. You stop at one, looking at the massive beast that has caught your eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was midnight black, and its mammoth head turned to look at you straight in the eye. Its hooves were covered by shaggy hair, and its mane was well groomed and parted in a three way braid. It very well towered over you, dwarfing you in comparison. The massive horse leaned its head out of the stall, its muscles rippling in quiet power. It thoughtfully regarded you as it munched on hay, almost begging you to pet it with its dark brown eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinding the Stable Master\u2019s words however, you keep your hands to yourself, no matter how tempted you were. The horse nodded, like it understood and pulled its head back in. You feel a hand on your shoulder and you jump with surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot iratating my pregnant war horse are you?\u201d the stable master asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no sir, not at all, I didn\u2019t even lay a hand upon her.\u201d You quickly reply. You noticed the rather swollen stomached of the large horse. Her tail flicks at both of you now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, it will be a mammoth of a horse; the sire was larger than its mother. It will be a fine animal.\u201d He said proudly. \u201cNow go on to supper with you, I am sure the Lord has a special announcement tonight. No more dawdling, you hear?\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod your agreement and scurry away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night as you serve the last of the hungry manor guests, you sneak back into the banquet hall. You were supposed to be in the kitchen as Mrs. Gavin directed, but the thought of missing out on an important announcement was too much to stomach. Why should you be left out anyways? Just because you weren\u2019t an adult didn\u2019t mean you couldn\u2019t listen to important news. But just in case, you brought a pitcher of wine with you in case there was an empty cup. A perfect excuse. You sink back into a shadowed alcove and watch the happenings. The hall was bright and full of the laughter and talk of many. Tonight everyone seemed very cheerful. It must be good news tonight then. Across the room, you spot Ava filling a cup of someone. You smirk, knowing she did the same as you to hear the announcement. If you got got, the punishment would be the same, no supper tomorrow. You look around for James, and spot him with his father, the blacksmith. Being an apprentice, he could come to important feasts and happenings without sneaking. You scowl at him, though he can\u2019t see it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take in the glory of the hall. You never in your life had seen another place look so fine. It had high ceilings with lighted chandeliers. Paintings and tapestries of Gods and Goddesses lined the walls leading up to the daisis. Animal pelts lined to floor here and there, to showcase your Lord\u2019s wealth. At the head table, a magnificent shield and sword were mounted on the wall. It was your favorite part of the room. One day, you would hold the weight of the shield and sword both. There was a great tale tied to the sword and its shield, every servant in the palace knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great hero Adrian the Mighty bore that shield and sword. She was the chosen one of the Sun Goddess Eos. Eos gave her blessing to Adrian to rid the land of the disgusting barbaric slave traders that had inhabited the land in her time. Despite the uncertainty of the times, Adrian rallied enough people for an army. They defeated the traders with Adrian at the head, with her blessed sword and shield. It is said that the sword was forged from the sun itself, and to be cut down by it you were seared with the heat of a thousand suns. Clearing the land of the threat after dozens of battles, Adrian retired her sword and dedicated herself to building the manor as a safe haven for all. Now her descendants handled the manor and protected the people. It was rumored that one day, a worthy hero would once again claim the sword and shield and protect the people once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome, welcome, now that we are all properly fed and watered, I have an important announcement.\u201d<br>\r\nYou snap out of your thoughts and sink further into the shadows. The Lord was grinning as he raised his cup. He was a fit but graying man. His years of prime were slowing slipping away from him, but he was a good Lord to his people and was loved by all who met him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow settle down you\u2019ll want to be hearing this. It has come to my attention that this year is going to be particularly fruitful for us.\u201d He waited until the cheering and laughter calmed down. \u201cThe orchards are finally producing and the fields growing better than they have in years. Which I kindly thank our master Reulf for his imaginative irrigation ideas.\u201d The manor hooted as Master Reulf\u2019s face turned a very red color. Several catcalls were shouted out in jest. But still he stood, acknowledge his Lords praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis year our horses will be sold at the fair, so more money than we know what to do with will be coming in, thanks to Master Segmum.\u201d Everyone cheered as the muscular Stable Master rose to take his praise, as he rocked back on his heels, grinning widely at the attention before sitting. You noted his name before the Lord started up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeople come for miles around just to be a guest here, and for that lovely hospitality I must thank our endearing Mistress Gavin.\u201d You whistle loudly for your cook. Mrs. Gavin stood, waving away the applause and cheers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd for keeping us safe we must thank Mistress Kai for her constant vigilance to protect us.\u201d A woman you have never seen before rose and smiled politely. She wore a simple black shirt and trousers. There were bracers on her arms. Her hair was braided tightly behind her back. You stare curiously at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut down to business. I propose a contest, between every living person in the manor. A test of skills, you could say. There will be serious prizes for the winners. Running, archery, hunting, horse racing, sewing, baking, and much much more. I will hang a list outside shortly. Why no celebrate? Anyone may join, and I mean everyone. We will start the completion the first day of fall, so you all have a month to prepare. The masters and I will be the judges so there are no disputes. Everyone will have an equal chance.\u201d Excited whispers and talk erupted as everyone raised their goblet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo the manor,\u201d the Lord toasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo the manor,\u201d they all replied in unison. The emotion in the room was high, filled with the pride of knowing they were cared for, as people, as family. They were a family, and everyone wanted what was best for the manor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lord sat and the feasting continued. Since nothing more of interest would happen this night, you slip back into the kitchen before any would notice you were gone. You bump into Ava as she does the same. <br>\r\n\u201cSerious prizes,\u201d you muse to your friend, washing the dishes. You itched to know what that was about. You couldn\u2019t really think of anything you were good at though. \u201cRunning!\u201d you shout, startling your friend drying beside you. \u201cAva, I can run! I am sure to win that prize.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva put her hands on her hips. \u201cThat\u2019s just great Emery. Now help me figure what I am going to do!\u201d You smile. Running!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMEANWHILE<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM\u2019lord, you asked for me?\u201d Kai, the weapons master, entered the dark shrine. The Lord was kneeling at the altar, the big statue of Eos standing above him. Kai stood respectfully as she waited, for her Lord was obviously praying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the Lord spoke. \u201cI pray to Eos every day to keep the sun shining on our fields, and she has blessed us for many years,\u201d the Lord stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai nodded simply. \u201cThat she has my Lord.\u201d She followed another god personally, but she still gave offerings to Eos, as the goddess did bring light into her world.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cTell me of the reports of creatures in the forest Kai. What are they?\u201d<br>\r\n Kai kneeled beside her Lord. \u201cNot they, it, M\u2019Lord. It is incredibly fast and we can\u2019t get a good look at it. It is not a creature of Eos. I sent a scout out; he has been missing for three days.\u201d She painfully swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho was the scout?\u201d her Lord asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to hold back tears as she choked out the answer. \u201cDamokels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The lord turned sharply to her. \u201cNo Kai, I am so sorry.\u201d His eyes saddened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was the best, he wanted to go and I could not deny him.\u201d Kai said bitterly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up hope yet, your husband is very resourceful.\u201d He wrapped an arm around the distraught woman. \u201cToo fast for an arrow?\u201d he mused. <br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t get it within our sights to shoot it.\u201d Kai whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll warn the masters. Only the masters and guard need to know of this. Damokels is strong. Don\u2019t give up faith. Nothing can keep him from you for long Kai.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
