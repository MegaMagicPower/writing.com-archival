I never expected it to rain to day, nor would someone coming my way in a hurry. I stayed in my normal hiding spot before a young female white wolf came racing down the alleyway, by the looks of the young wolf, she was bleeding quite bad and SOMEONE was after her. Fear crossed her eyes as she realized this was a \"dead\" end, all I could do was sigh before more foot steps came closer. I dropped from my sniper area, behind the wolf, startling her making her turn and growl. To her as I was now, a cloaked man that seemed to have a harmful intention, but I didn't give the her any chance to act, as I swept kicked her off her feet, grabbing her as I hid in the darkness, actually behind cover I use for battle. \"Wha-\" was all she could get out before I placed my hand over her muzzle shutting her up. A group of dragons entered the big space looking around, sniffing the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's definitely here. Find her and kill her. Leave no trace for that army b1tch!\" One of them said as I let go of her muzzle, only to put my hands on the grip of my customized pistols. I got out of my space, jumping much like a werewolf, on top of my main sniping area, shooting like crazy at the group, just to get their attention and to hit some while I was at it, but because I was doing this I couldn't kill them, unless I got that lucky. They weren't much bigger than me, mainly since I seem to be older than I am. They were only about maybe 6 foot 9 at the least, so if it came down to it I could or would have to use close-range. \"Son of a--! You getting in our way human!? We'll take you down for shooting at us!\" They all said finishing each others sentence, this quickly made-up plan I made while just going with the flow is going perfectly! That's what I would've thought until they brought out AK-47s and chain blades (Swords that are like chainsaws).  <i>This won't end well...</i> I thought to myself throwing my guns into the air, before taking out my magic-crafted sword I used in the Great Battle. It was a pretty long sword that was actually crafted from the strongest metal, I think it was called, Dragon's Steel Obsidian. It isn't heavy to me no matter what I hit or am against so far, because it lightens up to me, it's 'master'. I swear this blade has a heart and mind of it's own. As I prepared to launch myself into the gunners, I had to remember to make sure the wolf escapes. I felt my feet help push me off the bar and straight toward the black dragon of the group. I sliced the air cutting his gun 's front in half, but as I landed I saw in the corner of my eye another attempt to make a swing at me, and I used my momentum to swing myself around his body. Only the other gunner point his gun in my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PERSONA!\" I yelled as I felt my body bring out a part of me, my persona, who happened to be Jack Frost at the time. \"Bufu!\" I yelled along with Jack Frost, making the rain which dropped on his gun freeze, not what I truly wanted but it'd due for now. I cut his gun in the middle, getting rid of the long-ranged problems. I saw on the side of the group, the wolf making her move, and running away very fast, might I add. Great, now this could be much easier battle, I hope. My hope drained from my body as I saw the sword of the other dragon, I totally forgot about dropping toward me, only to be blocked by own sword and a leg of another dragon, hitting me in the back. Normally I'd be ready to fight and skilled, but 4 really fast dragons, a lot faster than me it seems now, with 2 very dangerous swords, is going to be a problem...a very, very dangerous problem. I jumped away from the group only to realize that the kick they gave me, had some poison! \"Great...\" was all I could say as more foot steps could be heard not too far away.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-Wolf POV-<br>\r\n<b><i>Earlier.... </i></b><br>\r\n<i>Someone....anyone...please....help me!!</i> I thought hoping it would reach someone, anyone. I had guys that always were pretending, to be on sis's good side, behind me. They wanted me dead, they wanted my sister to be sad, and to spread a lie that it was the human nearby, somewhere in town, that killed me. I knew that they hated my sister and humans, but I didn't want to believe they would love to do this. I saw an opening as to hopefully lose them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huff, Huff, Huff...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran down the long alleyway, only to find it was a dead end. I wanted to cry as I looked back, I was trapped, then I heard a light thump of someone landing behind me. I looked behind to see a man with a dark cloak, he was pretty intimidating but also had this nice compfy feeling to him, but he was human! He acted so fast I couldn't act as he tripped me and caught me. I thought he might try to actually kill me at first until he hid me behind cover, that also hid my scent. I wanted to know something so I opened my maw to speak but only got out a \"Wha-\" as he covered my muzzle with his hand, I wanted to protest but then I heard the dragons come and I got freaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's definitely here. Find her and kill her. Leave no trace for that army b1tch!\" I knew who they were talking about, I looked at the human seeing him grab the hilt of the gun and take it out as he jumped up. I heard gun shots, and I covered my ears thinking this was gonna end horribly. It was a little bit later, I decided to get up, enough to see what's going on. I saw him taking on the dragons, but they were also distracted by the human, I took my chance to run. I was near the exit, when I saw how much trouble he put himself in. I didn't want to believe he was doing this for me...but I wasn't gonna let him take them by himself, he needed help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis!!\" I yelled to my sister as I got out of the alleyway seeing them at the other end of the alleyway on the other side of the road, I came from. She started crying with joy and rushed over to me and hugged me. Before she said anything she felt my side where I got grazed by a knife and bullet by the dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Who did this!?!? THEY WILL PAY!\" She yelled, alerting her comrades who always stuck by her side. I would've let them say something but I remembered my hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis! You gotta help the human! He's in trouble! He'll die if he doesn't get help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human? Why-\" The kitsune, I've known as Uncle Ky, spoke up and was taken back as he looked toward the end of the alleyway. \"Cain is in trouble!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! The human saved me from Cain!!\" I said tears flowing down my face, even though it's raining they still noticed it. The group looked back at one another, before nodding heading down the alleyway to the human. <i>Please...please live.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>MEANWHILE THEY WERE HEADING THERE</b></i><br>\r\n-Sion POV-<br>\r\n\"At this rate they won't need reinforcements...\" I said weakly as the poison quickly keep going through my body even quicker than before. It may have seemed like a few minutes, but this battle is ending up terribly. They already cut me twice with both the sword and their claws, because my guns are at the top of the buildings, and they all attacked well. If it weren't for a certain problem, I have, I would have no problems kicking major ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are very skilled but very slow, human. You will regret attacking me and making that wolf b1tch escape!\" The leader of the group said charging at me. I thrusted my sword into the ground and lifted my self into the air, as he tried to claw me. Using my quick action as best as possible, I spun my self as so I could land with my foot into his face, with my strength and the air which helped powered my kick. I slammed my foot in his face like a soccer kick making him hit into the wall behind him, but it didn't help that he was only suppose to be a distraction so I wouldn't notice the other dragon behind me, he grabbed me as I landed. Now, I was in major trouble. That was until a blur of white jumped out the alleyway, kicking the dragon holding me in the face. Making his world go black as he fell unconscious, the 2 others tried to react and attack but I ran, sliding across the floor, having them hit the floor with enough stopping power to knock them unconscious. The last one just took the chain blade and ran to the white wolf who entered and helped me, since she was distracted enough. The others that came into view, had no chance to take out their weapons, but I was able to grab my sword as I ran over to in front of the wolf, guarding her, only to have the my sword in between the dagger like things making it what it is, cutting my right side deep. I had given the wolf and comrades a chance to act. I didn't get to be part of the action as my world slowly faded out. The wounds becoming more and more harder to hang on to staying 'awake'.</span></div></div>",

A warrior since the age of seven. Very hard trust issues except with the other heroes, a savior, and cold yet kind hearted. He looks a lot like Dauragon (from The Bouncer, but with silver hair and quite young). <br>\r\n<i><b>FANFICTION INFO:</b></i> A persona user, able to do attacks like Dante in DMC3 and hand-to-hand combat like Sion Barzahd in The Bouncer. Plus excellent aim with guns.

Known to many as a Valkyrie Guardian, but isn't that much true, his wife is the well known valkyrie, whom he promised to wed should they live. Acts as if Sion and Haru is his little brother &amp; sister or children (pups) by blood, very protective and loving of his friends. Looks like Cornell from Castlevania Legacy of Darkness (but with longer hair) when human but as a wolf he looks much like Cornell does in Castlevania Judgement (but with a long tail and real fluffy paws and claws). A mage and weapon freelancer. Better with Close-Ranged weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Miru Yamaguchi</b> - A Valkyrie and mate of Kiro, 18 years old. Took place in the Great Battle 2 years ago as \"protector - monster slayer\". A warrior of birth, saved many times from the other heroes, but is much like a mother to all of them. Tends to be loving to many people, beyond just protective of her friends, and a skilled genius. A master in swordplay and magic. Looks like Lenneth, her mom, but doesn't have the armor, her hair is sky blue, purple eyes, and light blue tint of wings. Great Close and Long Ranged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Haru Suzuki</b> - A famous kitsune singer and archer mage, 17 years old. Took place in the Great Battle 2 years ago, the same year she lost her family, as the \"Offensive Long-Ranged Strike Leader\". Sees the other heroes as her new family. Easily attached to kind and new people with a trusting feeling. Very friendly, kind, loving, fun, happy-go-lucky, and protective. Looks a lot like Haru from Shin Megami Tensei Devil Survivor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>THE GREAT BATTLE INFO:</b></i></u><br>\r\nA world where monsters and humans live barely in harmony, ended up being targeted by a force from another planet, to be it's source for anything they wanted, in order to defend against the upcoming swarm of enemies, 4 heroes not bounded by race or looks but by their will and destines which intertwined, were sent to stop the aggressive alien force by any means. As time got closer and closer, to the time that determined who lives, who has \"control\" of the world, and what happens next, the group learned of the aliens and how most of them wish not to do this, but that the leader ordered them to unwillingly, the only ones willingly where the ones at the gate guarding the leader. The group made a plan to invade the place where the leader is with others, but had to guard the two entrences to the area so the alien leader can't use his powers to make more enemies and keep up the spell so that the monsters re-made can't get in or be made in the area of the leader. On one side where Miru guarded were just monsters the leader was making, and on Sion's side were humans, monsters, aliens, demons, and anything else helping the leader willingly and unwillingly. Haru and Kiro went inside knowing the dangers and attempted to kill the leader each guarding the other as they also took the offensive. They had only 2 hours from the moment they started the battle, until the leader won over everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year later...everyone was seperated...and this is their story...</td>",
