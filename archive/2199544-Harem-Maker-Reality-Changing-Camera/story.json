No one can say for sure when it first came into existence, though. One prevailing theory was that it had been here all along, since the beginning of time, but that the intense desires of many anime fans to have their own personal harem had focused its power into something rather deviant. Others say it was actually the other way around, with the first person to use the RCC creating the very first harem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a photo was taken, a bright flash always followed, and the image spit out by the camera would reflect the new reality. Naturally, as a harem creator, those transformed would have some type of feelings for the user of the camera, regardless of whether they had any before the picture was taken. Even a completely stranger would develop a new relationship with the user based on what transformation they had, which itself was determined by how the camera read into the user's desires. No barrier was too great for the RCC as it transformed men into women with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera itself was sometimes a fickle being, assuming it always knew what the user wanted. Oftentimes, they would be unaware of the changes that had happened after taking a photo, and simply lived the rest of their lives much happier with a potential new love interest. For the subset of people that understood the results, it became more complicated. Some made sure to use and abuse the camera's power until the day they died or accidentally transformed themselves and lost their awareness. Certainly, some immediately used the camera on themselves on purpose, changing their form to something more pleasing, but this often lead to a desparate desire for a master, a new user to take control of the camera so that they could belong to their very own harem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with anything somewhat sentient and supernatural, however, the RCC had its own twisted sense of humor. If it felt particularly nasty towards a certain user, it could turn subjects into a trope they found rather undesirable- or worse yet, it could manipulate its way into the hands of a new user, and transform the old user! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe RCC had gone for some time without a user, and as such, was ready to make itself known to the multiverse once more. The place that this camera eventually ended up turned out to be...</span></div></div>",
