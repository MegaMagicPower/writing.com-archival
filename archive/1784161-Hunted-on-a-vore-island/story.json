It was almost upon her when she managed to slide into a small cave. she spun around quickly and her a large crash as the dinosaur smashed into the wall of the cave: it could not fit through the entrance after her. It stuck it's snout through the hole, but could not reach her. After a moment it gave up and walked away, certainly to try and find another entrance. Samantha had been on the island for 3 years and that T-rex had been chasing her the whole time, never letting up. She had taken to calling it \"the Hunter\" and had no illusions about having escaped it now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have liked to stay in the cave, but she had made that mistake before and had been nearly eaten by it's owner, a huge snake. She decided it would probably be a good idea to keep moving. There were two passages ahead of her: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne passage led back outside. The entrance was covered in vines, so the Hunter probably had not noticed it. The risk of it lying in wait for her that way was low, but it would certainly find her trail eventually: it always did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other passage led deeper into the cave. The ground was wet and it was dark, but not so much that she would be completely blind. The entrance to this passage was small enough that the Hunter would not be able to fit, even if it found it's way through the other entrance. On the downside, there could be something just as dangerous lurking deeper in the cave, and she was starting to get hungry and would have to leave the cave eventually to find food.</span></div></div>",

For now...<br>\r\nAs she walked away from the cave, her stomach began to growl. She would need to find food fast. She was a great hunter though, and had already picked out the sounds of several potential meals not far from her location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraight ahead, she could hear birds chirping. She quite liked birds because they moved around a lot after being swallowed, a feeling she enjoyed intensely. They were understandably hard to catch however, even with her enhanced speed. <br>\r\nTo her left, she had seen some small rodents crawling around. They weren't particularly appetizing, but they would do and wouldn't be to difficult to catch. <br>\r\nLastly, off to her right, she had heard the splashing and small voices of what sounded like some miniature mermaids. She had only managed to catch a few of them during her time on the island as they were rare and very quick, but she knew from experience that they were delicious. <br>\r\nShe would have to choose quickly, because the Hunter would surely be back after her again soon, and then there would be no time for food.</span></div></div>",

Better yet, the jungle had grown up around the pond quite a bit, so she could probably get pretty close without being seen. She slowly and quitely crept toward the mermaids, being careful to stay out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she managed to get as close as she could. From here, the mermaids would definetly see her if she got any closer, so she had have to pounce from here. She took a short moment of preperation, and then jumped out into the pond!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pleased and impressed with herself, Sam walked away from the pond with all three of the mermaids. She eyed her prizes, three miniature mermaids that were each between 8 inches and a foot long. Pretty big, but they were slippery and would go down easy. The walk from the cave to the pond had taken a while, and it had taken even longer to creep up close enough to the pond to strike, as a result, she was so hungry that she couldn't help but stuff one of the mermaids into her mouth straight away. Her throat expanded beyond would any normal person could do, and she quickly gulped the mermaid down, struggling all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at the other two mermaids, which had already started to panic, she realized that she probably would not be able to eat both of them. She was still hungry after the first one but they were pretty big, and she figured the second would probably be more than enough. She mulled this over while she put another mermaid in her mouth, taking her time with this one. She put just it's upper half in her mouth, leaving the fish half hanging out while she teased the unfortunate creature. She licked over it's face and bare breasts a lot, completely covering it in saliva. She wasn't trying to be mean, she just loved the taste of mermaid and she wanted to enjoy this one after downing the first so quickly. After a few moments, she finally swallowed the mermaid, sending it down to her stomach with the other one. She could still feel them wiggling in her stomach for several moments afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the last mermaid, and decided she had been right about not being able to eat it as well. She would love to save it for later, but the things didn't last long out of water and did not taste good at all once they were dried out. If she were to keep it, she would probably have to stay near the water to keep it refreshed, especially since she would probably need sleep before she was ready to eat again. Speaking of which, she really needed to put some distance between her and the Hunter if she didn't want it to find her while she was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should she do?</span></div></div>",

It wouldn't be THAT much trouble and it would save her from having to hunt again later, which would be a definite plus if the Hunter managed to catch up to her because she wouldn't have time to do alot of hunting then. She kept a tight grip on the last mermaid as she began running down stream, doing her best not leave a too-obvious trail for the Hunter to follow. She was good at moving about quickly, but her bloated belly was slowing her down a little, and her still-struggling meal made her want to sit down and rest even though she knew she couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours, it was starting to get dark. She still had an hour, maybe two before she would be forced to stop, and that was a lot of time to put some distance behind her. On the other hand, she had found a very nice camping spot for the night. It was a small cave right by the stream she had been following, it was small enough to where it only took a quick look to see that no dangerous animals were inside, but there was a corner in the back she could hide in where no predator would be able to see her unless they actually walked all the way to the back of cave. She couldn't ask for a better camping spot, but it would be good to put some more distance behind her before she stopped for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was making up her mind, she stopped to dip the mermaid in the water as it was starting to look faint. She noted that it had not said a single word, even before she captured it. She knew some mermaids could speak, but due to this one's silence, she assumed it was not one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of thought, she decided to...</span></div></div>",

The first thing she did was dig a small hole and fill it with water from the stream and put the mermaid in it. She covered the opening with sticks to use as bars and weighed them down with some rocks that were in the cave. Oddly, the mermaid just seemed happy to actually be in the water rather than just having a dip. After making sure it couldn't escape, Sam laid down and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awoke, the first thing she noticed was that her belly was now almost completely flat. The sun was starting to come up and she needed to get moving quickly. She checked the trap and found the mermaid still sleeping. She wasn't very hungry, but she could definately eat and the mermaid was slowing her down and restricting her movement to the stream...</span></div></div>",

She removed the sticks keeping it barred in and quickly grabbed it, waking it up. She stuffed the thing in her mouth before it was even awake enough to try and escape. She held it in her mouth for several minutes, tasting it's delicious breasts, before she finally gulped down. As soon as the mermaid landed in her stomach, she started to get moving. It wouldn't do to stay for much longer, she had certainly lost distance ahead of the Hunter over the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as she was exiting the cave, she heard something moving.

But that didn't matter now, all that mattered was that she had to escape. The Hunter was dangerously close behind her and she was only barely keeping away from it's snapping jaws. She runs as fast as she can, and starts to gain some distance from the Hunter. Unfortunately, it was not enough to give her some thinking time when she suddenly came upon the edge of a cliff. She barely stopped in time to avoid running right over the edge, but she almost thought that might not have been a bad plan given her other option. The Hunter now came upon her slowly, knowing it's prey was caught. She was trying to decide whether or not to jump over the cliff when the decision was made for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pounding of the Hunter's footsteps caused the edge of the cliff to weaken, and eventually collapse with Sam still on it. She slid, dangerously fast, down the face of the cliff and came to a rest at the bottom. As she stood up and checked herself, she was shocked to discover that she was mostly alright, just a few scratches and bruises. She looked up to the top of the cliff to see the Hunter, obviously furious about having lost it's prey given the roar it let out, and then it stalked away, looking for a way to climb down the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam felt the back of her head, where the pain was still throbbing. She realized she must have been thrown against a tree when she was thrown from the snake's mouth. It wasn't a problem, as her abilities allowed her to heal quickly, especially if she could find somewhere to rest. It was still early morning, but it had only been a few moments since she ate that last mermaid, so food wouldn't be a problem. She had no idea how long it would take for the Hunter to get down the cliff. Maybe long enough for her to rest, or maybe not.</span></div></div>",

She stays and talks to the Tree, and she thoroughly enjoys it, despite the fact that she must often stop and think about what he just said to make sense of his rhyming words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple hours though, she suddenly regrets her decision when she hears the rhythmic stomping that signals the approach of the Hunter. It spots her, and immedietetly begins charging. \"Ahh! It's here!\" Sam yelled, having already explained about the Hunter to the Elder Tree. She was just starting to panic when all of a sudden the Hunter tripped, and was quickly covered in vines from the surrounding trees!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elder Tree slowly set Sam down, and then looked over at the Hunter and said:<br>\r\n\"Guardian, what be your purpose here? I have promised this girl she has nothing to fear.\"<br>\r\nThe Hunter made no reply except to gnash at the vines holding it in place. The Elder Tree saw his attempt at communication were useless and looked at Sam.<br>\r\n\"Our roots will not hold him long, but when he's freed, you should be gone.\" <br>\r\nSam took that as her que to run, yelling a quick thank you over her shoulder as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours of running, Sam finally stopped to look back. She saw no sign of the Hunter, and she was pretty sure it would lose her trail at least a couple times whenever it got close to catching up. She has once again managed to buy herself more time of respite, but she couldn't help but wonder about her new friend. She doubted the Hunter would take the time to harm the Tree once it got free, but she couldn't but wonder if she would ever see the Tree again. The island was huge, and even after three years there were huge areas of it that she hadn't even seen. It was unlikely she would be able to find her way back to the Tree again. \"But you never know,\" she thought. \"Where in the future you will go..\" Then she let out a groan as she realized that whe was starting to rhyme now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted by her stomach growling. The last mermaid had been pretty much completely digested now and she was starting to get hungry again. On the other hand, it was starting to get late and she should probably look for somewhere safe to sleep.</span></div></div>",

She squeezes her eyes shut, knowing the Hunter would be on her any second... But to her surprise, nothing happens. After a few seconds she finally builds up enough courage to stand, her legs shaking. Her heart is pounding as she tries to figure out what happened to the Hunter, but when she turns around she quickly figures it out, as she is staring right down it's throat. It had only been waiting for her to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one instant, it grabs her and closes it's mouth around her upper body, being careful not to cut her with it's teeth. It's tongue rubs all over her face, and then moves to her breasts, both to savor her taste and coat her in saliva to make her easier to swallow. As it finished with her upper body, it pulled her farther into it's mouth. Her head was now just outside the beast's throat and the only thing still outside it's mouth was her feet. It's tongue continued it's job of tasting her as it slowly moved over belly, which was still squirming slightly with the mermaid inside. It took a particular liking to her pussy, forcing her legs apart so it get it's tongue in between them and forcefull rub against her cleanly shaven pussy, delighting with the flavors it found there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually however, the Hunter grew bored with this and finally started to swallow. After spending so much time in it's mouth, Sam was almost relieved to be getting it over with. Her head was quickly sucked into it's throat and was soon followed by the rest of her body. She slowly slid down it's throat, one huge swallow at a time, until she was finally deposited in it's stomach. The walls immedietely contracted around her, squeezing her, as the stomach began to fill with acid. She could feel it burning her, and after only a few more minutes of this, she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hunter burped slightly and then laid down for a rest. When it awoke, Sam had been completely digested. It stood up, took a good stretch, let out a massive roar that could be heard across the island, and then, it's job of keeping humans off the island complete, it turned back into the statue it always had been.</span></div></div>",
