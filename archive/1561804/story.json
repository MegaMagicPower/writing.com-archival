But as you are thinking this you see a sort of a portal appear in front of you. \"This doesn't seem like something that should happen out of the blue,\" you say. You slowly walk towards the portal, as it starts to close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're find yourself flying through space as planets whiz by very quickly. You see yourself cloaked in a pinkish-purple light, probably what's keeping you alive at this speed in space. After a while you slowly lose consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you hear a voice from above that says, \"Whew, You're up, I thought you were injured.\" You look up and see the face of a giant...</span></div></div>",

You clumsily get onto your feet and look down, and notice that you're standing on his left paw. He continues talking, \"Hmm... A tiny human, I wonder where you came from.\" You stare at him, with a slightly scared expression on your face. Apparently he noticed this and said, \"Oh sorry, I'm not gonna hurt you. I guess I should introduce myself. I'm Luke Aura, and you are?\" You swallow, trying to piece together what has happened in a matter of seconds. You were walking home, went through a mysterious portal, and now you're in the hands of a giant Lucario. When you hear him ask a question, you answer him, \"Oh, my name's Jim, sorry. I'm a little confused as to what happened...\" Luke smiles a little bit and places you on a nearby table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look at him, he looks just like a Lucario from Pokemon, just you know, giant. He walks over to a dresser drawer and pulls out a button up shirt. \"I guess he can't wear regular shirts cause of that spike,\" you think. He walks back over to you and picks you up and puts you in front of his muzzle and says, \"I gotta go to work, and I can't really leave you alone here.\" Before you can say anything, he places you in the front pocket of the shirt. You slowly fall asleep from the beat of his heart, and the rhythm of his steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you feel yourself being lifted up. When you look around, you find yourself in the same light as before. When you look away, you now see a giant Mewtwo. You seem to be floating in mid-air in front of it. You hear the voice of Luke from behind say, \"Did he make it okay?\" The Mewtwo responds, \"As far as I can tell, yes. He'll just drift in and out of sleep every now and then for about a day or two.\" Luke lets out a sigh of relief and says, \"Whew, Thanks buddy.\" \"Don't mention it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke lets out a paw, and you slowly float into it. He places you back into the pocket. He walks to a school to do his job as a teacher. When he gets to his classroom, you find out that he teaches 5th graders.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You must have slept the entire day, because the next thing you know, you hear the bell that means that school is over. You hear Luke say to the class, \"Oh right, before you all go, I would like you to meet a friend of mine.\" You wonder who he's talking about, maybe the Mewtwo from earlier? Well, your question is answered when you see Luke's paw coming into the pocket to pick you out. You look around the class and see pokemon, human, and pokemorph children of various varieties. You hear Luke continue talking, \"This is my friend, Jim.\" One of the children said, \"Do we squish it?\" Another child tried to answer him and said, \"No, stupid, you eat them.\" This doesn't exactly fill you with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke sighs, and tells them, \"You're both wrong, tiny humans are to take care of, sort of like a pet.\" You can tell that he didn't really want to say pet, but it was the only word that he could think of. He walks over, places you on the desk and sits down. The children start to exit the classroom with their things. After the entire class exits, two of them come back in, a Pichu, and an Eevee. The Pichu comes up to Luke and asks, \"Mr. A, can we play with the tiny human, please?\" Luke looks at them with a smile, and says, \"You're gonna have to ask him about that.\" The two look at each other, confused until the Eevee realizes what he's talking about. He puts his front paws on the desk, his nose almost right in front of you and asks, \"Can we play with you, Mr. Jim?\" You're a little flattered that he said Mr, and maybe that's what persuaded you to say, \"Yeah, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke picks you up and hands you to them, and due to Eevee's lack of paws/hands Pichu held on to you. They walk over to the corner of the room and toss you in the air a few times, very careful as to not hurt you. After you calm down from that, they get a piece of paper and fold it into a paper airplane. Pichu places you in the plane and throws it to Luke. The plane lands right in front of Luke and he looks up. He smiles and picks you up. \"Be careful, you three. We don't want Jim getting hurt.\" The door opens and a Raichu and and Umbreon walk in. The Raichu is the first one to say something. \"Pichu, what's been taking you so long?\" You can hear a sort of femininity in it's voice. The Pichu replies to her, \"we were just playing with Mr. A's new friend.\" The Raichu looks around and says, \"Where is this friend of his?\" Luke chuckles and says, \"Right there on my desk, Miss Chu.\" She looks down and sees you on the desk, \"A tiny human? This one must've been expensive.\" You are shocked by her words, apparently you're not the first human to come here. Luke looked at her and said, \"Actually, Jim was a gift, if I have to say that. But anyway, Miss Chu, I'm sorry for keeping your son here. And you too Mr. Volve.\" The Umbreon that walked in with the Raichu gave a grunt and walked out with the Eevee. The Pichu pats you on the head and walks out with the Raichu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario puts his papers in his desk and picks you up. \"In case you're wondering, yes people buy tiny humans. But they can only buy them from my buddy, Matt, who was the Mewtwo that you met earlier. Tiny humans are expensive because he wants to make sure that people will take care of them.\" That pretty much answers the question that you had for him. He places you in his shirt pocket again and walks home.</span></div></div>",
