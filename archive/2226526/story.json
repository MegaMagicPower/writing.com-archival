Shido turned and inmediately fell on his back when he saw the gargantuan figure of Kurumi. \"Wow easy there, I don't want my itsy bitsy Shido hurt, come here let me pick you up.\" Kurumi said with a smirk, pinching Shido bottom half between her thumb and forefinger in a gentle manner, but sill with enough strength to prevent Shido from falling or escaping, she carried Shido to eye level, taking him closer to the eye with a clock in it studying Shido intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShido trembling from the unexpected situation started to speak \"Wha what happened?, why you shrunk me where are we? !let me go!\" Shido shout with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh little Shido, I didn't shrunk you but saw you when happened, you suddenly fell unconscious and started to get smaller until you reached the one inch limit, then I took you here to the closer roof top to ensure nobody see's us, and let you sleep until you woke up\" Kurumi said squeezing Shido playfully with the fingers she was holding him, she also licked her lips with a predatory eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Em yeah? then why were you there? and if you didn't shrunk me, then who?\" Shido aked not entirely conviced about what Kurumi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is that so, you don't belive me hm, well the reason I was there is because, I know many things in the future and in the past remember.\" She said pointing at the eye with the clock with her other hand. \"And about who did it Im not sure but I think that you lost some spiritual powers from the other spirits, but this time instead of actually losing their abilities you lost your size.\" Kurumi said a little annoyed because Shido didn't believe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really let me try.\" Shido said summoning Sandalphon the sword of Thoka, but instead of summoning the normal sword Shido had a micro version which fit in his hands, after confirm that he still had the spirits powers at least a mini version of them, he dispelled the sword again. \"You are right I still have their powers, I'm sorry for not believing in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think a simple apology is enough\" she said sticking her tongue out at Shido.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right I'm terrible sorry I will make it up to you as soon I'm back to my size\" Shido said with regret, and bowing her head towards Kurumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw I can't be mad at you my little Shido\" Kurumi said petting Shido carelessly.\"However its very tempting to keep you as my sweet pet instead\" Kurumi said looking at Shido with predatory eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha please don't joke like that and take me to home please I need to talk to Kotori to see what we can do about this\" Shido sai nervously hoping that Kurumi was actually joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Shido dont worry I will help you but I will punish you for not believing me so I will put you in my...\"</span></div></div>",

However she decided to enjoy her time with shido, taking her time to go to Shido home visiting stores and arcades in the way enjoying avery step she took with Shido in her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Shideo this consisted on get smashed repeatedly under Kurumi toes, bouncing around inside boot, and getting squeezed playfully whenever kurumi stopped walking to play at an arcade machine or checking out an a store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Kurumi decide to go to Shido's home, when she was near his home Kurumi started to walk carefully and stealthy not wanting to start a fight with any of the spirits who lived next Shido's home, she entered Shido's home through the window of Shido's room, there Kurumi sat in the bed and relaxed a little since avoided any conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment Kotori entered Shido's room demanding an explanation to Shido since he had not answered her call\u00b4s, but stopped mid word when she noticed that in place of his brother was Kurumi a dangerous spirit to her eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing in my house? and why the satellite locator of the Fraxinus say's that Shido is in here?\" Kotori said getting ready to fight and summoning her astral dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey slow down im here because im helping Shido.\" Said Kurumi taking some step behind, \"Well and also Im punishing him\" this last's word's she whispered only for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and why I should belive you?\" Kotori asked in guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain, he shrunk somehow and I found him and Im keeping an eye on him since\" Kurumi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotori wasn't convinced about Kurumi good will however this coincided with the data of the Fraxinus, one of the major reasons why she wanted to contact him earlier. \"If is that so the where is he?\" Kotori asked hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that it's easy I store him in my boot for safekeeping\" Kurumi answered leaving out the punishment part. \"Here let me show you\" Kurumi said sitting back on Shido's bed and squeezing Shido with her toes, trying to get a good grab on him, finally trapping him under her second toe in a vice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumi then took her foot along with Shido out of her boot, and unstuck him from her toes, and showed him to Kotori who gasped in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the, Shido its really you?\" Kotori asked. <i>Mhm this is weird normally the spirits just gather their powers back, and Shido is left as a normal person without powers but this time the spirits gathered their powers back and instead of leave Shido like normal person he stayed with powers too, and shrunken instead.</i> Kotori thought for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm more or less fine, all thing's considered.\" Shido said staying on Kurumi's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you took him back to me then, you could easily take him and nobody would know?\" Kotori asked to Kurumi distrustful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"For fun actually I wanted to know what you and the other spirits are gonna do with little Shido here.\" Kurumi responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"is that so? Well, if that's the case, I'll take him to the Fraxinus so they can analyze him before anything else.\" Kotori said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"I won't let go of him so easily, I just wanted to let you and the other spirits know that Shido is fine and is with me\" Kurumi said and with this she entered her Shadow and disappeared taking Shido with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"Because I have a fun idea I got it when felt Shido squirming in my boot, lets invite the other spirits for this. The game is this we gonna leave all our shoes in front of Shido, and we will not look giving Shido a minute or so to hide in one of our shoes, the lucky girl with Shido in her shoe can take a date with him, the next day we gonna do the same removing the shoes of the girl who already had a date, we will continue until every Spirit had her date with Shido, then we start all over again at least until he gets back to normal.\" Kurumi explained with a mischievous smile towards Shido who was terrified at Kurumi's suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well isn't a bad idea actually, he maybe recovers his height with the dates alone since the connection between we the spirits and he get stronger with dates anyway, and sounds like a fair method to let all have a date with him so I will accept your game idea then.\" Kotori said sucking her lollipop.</span></div></div>",

He won\u2019t survive the fall so be careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, i\u2019m just trying to be careful, I promise he won\u2019t fall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold him with two hands, if you really want that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you hearing, this was... odd? You were waking up, shifting your body as you were left so confused about the manner. Who were these girls? What were they talking about, and... where were you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to wake up and look, but seeing nothing in front of you. Something was blocking your sight, and you have no idea what it was. It was tight, not only on your head by over your body as well. Did you wrap yourself in your blanket again? Well, maybe not since even your arms were tied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou of course shift around, moving around and trying to break free, only to realise it was tighter than you thought. Eyes wide as you were filled with a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething these two girls realised. \u201cOh he\u2019s up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStruggling, get to the room quick.\u201d The other voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Miss, i\u2019ll cary him.\u201d She joked playing it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nW-Wait... are you getting kidnapped! Eyes wide as you realise the danger you were in. You struggle and try to break free, but it was not like you could really do anything about it. You were just too small, too weak to do anything against your captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax will you, we are almost there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost where, to your torture chambers! What are these two planning! Why... are you happy that it sounds like it\u2019s two cute girls kidnapping you? No wait, you are just going crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a door open as suddenly it was closed within seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour prison broke free, and... you got a sight that was welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was beautiful, with a slim body and bright orange hair. She wore a school outfit on, a school sweater as well as a skirt. The smile she was sending you though, it calmed you down. You were in love in a literal second, something you thought would never happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there.\u201d She smiled down, a big wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey.\u201d You say to her, when suddenly you heard footsteps coming over. You look, to see... her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same beauty but... no this girl had some differences. Her smile wasn\u2019t there and her eyes weren\u2019t as friendly, but... there was something captivating about her, that just draws you in?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re small.\u201d She said down, not much inflection in her voice. \u201cI\u2019m sure you haven\u2019t realised it yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m what?\u201d You question as you look around. You were small, you were actually small. you were on the happy one\u2019s hand right now, which is big enough to be a bed for you! Comparing you to the rest of the room, you had to be a couple of inches tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, small in the room of two giant and beautiful twins. This... this has to still be a dream right, cause it\u2019s just too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m small?\u201d You question to them. \u201cHow did this happen? W-Where did you girls find me?\u201d You question to her just wanting to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I found you lying by yourself. I thought you were a bug and she tried to step on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did.\u201d The not so peppy one answered, as that left you worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found you though, and brought you here. Wow, you are so small. Are you human?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, yeah I am. Just small, i\u2019m not like a fairy or a pixie like that.\u201d You say to her calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, are you a-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know.\u201d her sister said in a calm manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh he doesn\u2019t, well that\u2019s weird.\u201d Her sister said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...\u201d You say with a curious eye.\u201dYou girls brought me here, well I need to tell you my name at the very least. \u201cIt is (Your Name)\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my name is Kaguya Yamai!\u201d She said with a smile, \u201cAnd this is my sister Yuzuru.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey Yuzuru.\u201d You say to her simply just trying to be kind to her. She looked at you, and wore a smile on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaguya, can I talk to you in private?\u201d her sister said.

Both sisters leaving the room as you were by yourself. A confused look as you worried. What were they talking about, obviously they were talking about you. A-Are they planning on kicking you out? You hope not, you have no idea where you were, and these girls were pretty.
