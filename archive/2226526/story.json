Shido turned and inmediately fell on his back when he saw the gargantuan figure of Kurumi. \"Wow easy there, I don't want my itsy bitsy Shido hurt, come here let me pick you up.\" Kurumi said with a smirk, pinching Shido bottom half between her thumb and forefinger in a gentle manner, but sill with enough strength to prevent Shido from falling or escaping, she carried Shido to eye level, taking him closer to the eye with a clock in it studying Shido intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShido trembling from the unexpected situation started to speak \"Wha what happened?, why you shrunk me where are we? !let me go!\" Shido shout with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh little Shido, I didn't shrunk you but saw you when happened, you suddenly fell unconscious and started to get smaller until you reached the one inch limit, then I took you here to the closer roof top to ensure nobody see's us, and let you sleep until you woke up\" Kurumi said squeezing Shido playfully with the fingers she was holding him, she also licked her lips with a predatory eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Em yeah? then why were you there? and if you didn't shrunk me, then who?\" Shido aked not entirely conviced about what Kurumi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is that so, you don't belive me hm, well the reason I was there is because, I know many things in the future and in the past remember.\" She said pointing at the eye with the clock with her other hand. \"And about who did it Im not sure but I think that you lost some spiritual powers from the other spirits, but this time instead of actually losing their abilities you lost your size.\" Kurumi said a little annoyed because Shido didn't believe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really let me try.\" Shido said summoning Sandalphon the sword of Thoka, but instead of summoning the normal sword Shido had a micro version which fit in his hands, after confirm that he still had the spirits powers at least a mini version of them, he dispelled the sword again. \"You are right I still have their powers, I'm sorry for not believing in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think a simple apology is enough\" she said sticking her tongue out at Shido.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right I'm terrible sorry I will make it up to you as soon I'm back to my size\" Shido said with regret, and bowing her head towards Kurumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw I can't be mad at you my little Shido\" Kurumi said petting Shido carelessly.\"However its very tempting to keep you as my sweet pet instead\" Kurumi said looking at Shido with predatory eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha please don't joke like that and take me to home please I need to talk to Kotori to see what we can do about this\" Shido sai nervously hoping that Kurumi was actually joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Shido dont worry I will help you but I will punish you for not believing me so I will put you in my...\"</span></div></div>",

However she decided to enjoy her time with shido, taking her time to go to Shido home visiting stores and arcades in the way enjoying avery step she took with Shido in her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Shideo this consisted on get smashed repeatedly under Kurumi toes, bouncing around inside boot, and getting squeezed playfully whenever kurumi stopped walking to play at an arcade machine or checking out an a store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Kurumi decide to go to Shido's home, when she was near his home Kurumi started to walk carefully and stealthy not wanting to start a fight with any of the spirits who lived next Shido's home, she entered Shido's home through the window of Shido's room, there Kurumi sat in the bed and relaxed a little since avoided any conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment Kotori entered Shido's room demanding an explanation to Shido since he had not answered her call\u00b4s, but stopped mid word when she noticed that in place of his brother was Kurumi a dangerous spirit to her eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing in my house? and why the satellite locator of the Fraxinus say's that Shido is in here?\" Kotori said getting ready to fight and summoning her astral dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey slow down im here because im helping Shido.\" Said Kurumi taking some step behind, \"Well and also Im punishing him\" this last's word's she whispered only for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and why I should belive you?\" Kotori asked in guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain, he shrunk somehow and I found him and Im keeping an eye on him since\" Kurumi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotori wasn't convinced about Kurumi good will however this coincided with the data of the Fraxinus, one of the major reasons why she wanted to contact him earlier. \"If is that so the where is he?\" Kotori asked hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that it's easy I store him in my boot for safekeeping\" Kurumi answered leaving out the punishment part. \"Here let me show you\" Kurumi said sitting back on Shido's bed and squeezing Shido with her toes, trying to get a good grab on him, finally trapping him under her second toe in a vice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumi then took her foot along with Shido out of her boot, and unstuck him from her toes, and showed him to Kotori who gasped in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the, Shido its really you?\" Kotori asked. <i>Mhm this is weird normally the spirits just gather their powers back, and Shido is left as a normal person without powers but this time the spirits gathered their powers back and instead of leave Shido like normal person he stayed with powers too, and shrunken instead.</i> Kotori thought for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm more or less fine, all thing's considered.\" Shido said staying on Kurumi's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you took him back to me then, you could easily take him and nobody would know?\" Kotori asked to Kurumi distrustful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"For fun actually I wanted to know what you and the other spirits are gonna do with little Shido here.\" Kurumi responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"is that so? Well, if that's the case, I'll take him to the Fraxinus so they can analyze him before anything else.\" Kotori said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"I won't let go of him so easily, I just wanted to let you and the other spirits know that Shido is fine and is with me\" Kurumi said and with this she entered her Shadow and disappeared taking Shido with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"Because I have a fun idea I got it when felt Shido squirming in my boot, lets invite the other spirits for this. The game is this we gonna leave all our shoes in front of Shido, and we will not look giving Shido a minute or so to hide in one of our shoes, the lucky girl with Shido in her shoe can take a date with him, the next day we gonna do the same removing the shoes of the girl who already had a date, we will continue until every Spirit had her date with Shido, then we start all over again at least until he gets back to normal.\" Kurumi explained with a mischievous smile towards Shido who was terrified at Kurumi's suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well isn't a bad idea actually, he maybe recovers his height with the dates alone since the connection between we the spirits and he get stronger with dates anyway, and sounds like a fair method to let all have a date with him so I will accept your game idea then.\" Kotori said sucking her lollipop.</span></div></div>",
