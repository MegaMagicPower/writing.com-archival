I mean, Hagrid told you everything and helped you to buy all your things for school, but other than him you really don't have any friends... Or enemies for that matter. You never thought you would miss Dudley's company, but right now a friend or an enemy would be better than nothing! As this thought crossed your mind, the compartment door slid open to reveal a grubby looking red headed boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you mind if i join you? All the other compartments are full\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all!\" You reply, happy to finally have some company, and hopefully a new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red headed boy sat down opposite you and introduced himself as Ron Weasley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Harry... Harry Potter\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes grew wide at the sound of your name. Hagrid wasn't lying when he said that there wasn't a witch or wizard alive who didn't know who you were! He sat in stunned silence, as if he wasn't quite sure of what to say. Then he blurted out what must have been the first thing on his mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you have the... The.... The scar??\" He said, and blushed instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned and pulled back your fringe, revealing the lightning bolt scar upon your forehead. He smiled back and said it was wicked. It was then that you knew you had made your first friend in the wizarding while aside of Hagrid. Suddenly, the door slid open and a girl poked her head inside your compartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, have either of you seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost one\" She asked you both in a very snotty and arogant kind of way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl seemed to breathe confidence as you both looked up at her dumbfounded, shaking your haids no. She noticed that Ron has his wand out and was performing magic, and a sly smile crossed her smug face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, doing magic are you? Go on then, let's see it\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Ron's face flushed a red that was a similar shade to his hair as he cleared his throat and lifted his wand... Needless to say, his spell was unsuccessful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that wasn't very good now was it... I have tried different spells that actually work... Watch this!\" She said, as she pointed her wand at your broken glasses. \"Occulus Reparo\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant the sticky tape that held your glasses together flew off and your glasses were fixed. Suprised at the spell, you look up at this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you! You're Harry Potter\", she said excitedly, after finally recognising who you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Hermoine Granger\" She said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you react...</span></div></div>",

The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Each house has it's own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rule-breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours. Now form a line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk into the Great Hall you see the extremely large and long room was lit by thousands and thousands of candles which were floating in mid-air over four long tables, where the rest of the year groups were sitting. At the top of the hall sat the teachers at another long tables, which was where Professor McGonagall was leading the queue of yourself and the other first year students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hundreds of eyes of other students at you, you get quite nervous and decide to stare at the roof which strangely looked just like the night sky, then you overheard a whisper which no doubt came from Hermione telling other students that the ceiling is bewitched to look like the sky outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Magic, Hogwarts, Muggles, Wizards, it was just so much to take in. He vowed to make the most of this new life which he was given. \"At this point, anything's better than the Dursleys.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry glanced at his timetable for the day. There was Transfiguration with professor Mcgonagall, Potions with Professor Snape and Quidditch with with professor Hooch. \"Come on Harry. You can do this. One step at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings did not start smoothly. By the time Harry and Ron had found the Transfiguration classroom, they were already 20 minutes late. Hermoine rolled her eyes as they stumbled into the class. The late students felt immense relief as Professor Mcgonagall was nowhere in sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon let out a massive sigh. \"Amazing. Can you imagine the look on Mcgonagall's face if we were late?\" To their dismay, a house cat which was sitting on the front desk leaped off and it was the professor which completed the jump, strolling up to Ron and Harry immediately after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon was in awe. \"That was bloody brilliant!\"<br>\r\n\"Why thank you for that assessment Mr. Weasley\" was her response. \"Unfortunately for you I do not take kindly to such tardiness in my class. You will have to be disciplined.\"  <br>\r\nHarry and Ron looked at each other worriedly as the professor pulled out her wand and pointed it towards the late-comers . \"Reducio!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing the boys knew was that they were looking up at the humongous professor, and everything else for that matter. <br>\r\n\"Yes boys, I've shrunk you down. Now come with me.\" The professor picked the boys up by their collars and marched out of the classroom. Hermoine was overwhelmed with disgust by professor Mcgonagall's method of punishment. Malfoy was filled with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor. Where are you taking us?\"<br>\r\n\"Quiet Mr Weasley.\"<br>\r\n\"Hold a moment. That's the Slytherin common room!\"<br>\r\n\"I said to be silent Mr. Weasely. 20 points from Gryffindor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor dropped the boys to the floor. \"For the next hour or so, you will be at the mercy of these senior girls. Maybe this experience will teach you to be on time.\"<br>\r\n\"But professor!\"<br>\r\nThe professor was already gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and Ron looked at each other in panic. They did not want to imagine being at the mercy of senior Slytherin girls for an hour. <br>\r\nAs they turned around, Ron's eyes rolled back and he fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well Zelia, looks like Professor Mcgonagall dragged two more Gryffindor newbies for us to torture.\" <br>\r\nHarry gulped.<br>\r\n\"Seems about right Lucinda. Bring the fainted one to me. He can suffer in my shoe while you can have that one cowering next to him all to yourself.\"<br>\r\nThe towering student Lucinda marched toward Harry. The poor young wizard was frozen in place as if hypnotized from the immense size and beauty of the young dark-haired woman approaching him. She gracefully walked toward the two helpless tiny boys on the carpet and picked them up in her palms with ease. She placed Harry down on the table but gave Ron to Zelia. <br>\r\n\"Here he is Zelia. Enjoy.\"<br>\r\nHarry could only watch as it unfolded. Zelia grabbed Ron violently, waking him up. \"Ohh you're up are you?\" She drew pleasure in the panicked look on Ron's face. \"Not for long.\" Zelia hung Ron from her two fingers while undoing her shoe. Without hesitation she dropped Ron into her shoe and placed it on the ground. <br>\r\nRon looked at Harry defeated and yelled desperately.<br>\r\n\"Harry!\"<br>\r\n\"Ron! No!\"<br>\r\nZelia inserted her socked foot into the shoe before stomping down on it, after which Ron's cries could no longer be heard. She then crossed her legs without a care and went back to what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You monster!\", yelled Harry as tears began to well up in his eyes. Chills went up his spine as he heard Lucinda's sadistic voice behind him. \"You haven't seen anything yet tiny.\"<br>\r\nAs Harry turned around, Lucinda pressed down on him with her finger, pinning him to the table. \"Well now. Are you who I think you are? That scar on your head.\" Lucinda's face beamed with satisfaction, as if she had just figured something out. \"So you're my prize. The legendary Harry Potter himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could say nothing. Lucinda's piercing violet eyes had him frozen with fear.<br>\r\n\"Well this just got just a tiny bit more interesting.\" she said sarcastically. \"Tell you what Potter. For the next hour or so I'll be calling you 'slave' and you'll call be 'Goddess'. You'll do everything I tell you and in return I won't kill you underneath my foot. Is that clear?\"<br>\r\nHarry did not manage a response while Lucinda removed her green Slytherin socks and rested her huge feet atop the table right in front of Harry.<br>\r\n\"It better be. Now lick my feet clean slave.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Any courage that Harry was building up evaporated in an instant in the presence of the power of Lucinda's feet. He was subdued and humbled in his meek reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that. You're completely broken at my feet slave. So much for the legendary Harry Potter.\" <br>\r\nHarry dared not speak further. He gave all his attention to licking Lucinda's feet until they were spotless in hopes that she would be merciful and let him live. After a while, Harry's voice could be heard weakly trying to speak.<br>\r\n\"Did you say something slave?\"<br>\r\nHarry's words were slightly more audible the second time. \"I can't reach the top of your sole.\"<br>\r\n\"Who are you speaking to slave?\"<br>\r\nHarry let out a defeated sigh. \"I can't reach the top of your sole Goddess Lucinda.\"<br>\r\nLucinda grinned. \"I might have an idea about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucinda removed her feet from the table. As her foot smell relinquished, Harry dropped to his knees in a moment of relief. Such relief was fleeting as the goddess lifted Harry with two fingers before dropping him to the carpet just below her chair. She spoke no further words before planting the top of her sole onto Harry's powerless body.<br>\r\n\"Maybe this will teach you not to complain when I give orders slave.\" She increased the pressure of her foot slightly until Harry began screaming in pain. \"What was that slave? Speak up a bit.\" She increased the pressure again and again, Harry screamed in agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelia could not hide her amusement. She smiled and pressed down hard into her shoe as well. Ron's screams were muffled, but no less intense. \"These first year Gryffindors need to be taught their place from the start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity of relentless smothering, Lucinda dragged Harry across the mat under her foot before lifting off from his battered body. As Harry forced his eyes open, he was met again with Lucinda's violet gaze, and a massive grin on her face. <br>\r\n\"Looks like all that torture has gotten you excited slave.\" <br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\nZelia spoke up with a devious smile. \"I thought felt something poking out in my shoe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry lifted his head, he was appalled to see that there was a huge bulge in his Gryffindor pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her best efforts, Lucinda couldn't hold in her laughter. \"This is outragous! How old are you anyway slave. Twelve? Eleven? Ten? Do you even know what that thing does?\"<br>\r\nHarry shook his head. He had no idea.<br>\r\nLucinda and Zelia exchanged glances. It's as if their two minds became one for a moment. Lucinda's voice soon spoke up. \"Tell you what slaves. Whichever one of you creams first, is going to die first!\"<br>\r\nZelia was bewildered at Lucinda's comment on killing the students. As far as she knew, they were to torture them, but to take their lives would be a horrible and unforgivable act. She concluded to herself that Lucinda was bluffing and decided to play along. As her shoe came off, Ron's almost flattened body fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Harry to inspect the condition of his friend. \"Harry! What are they going to do to us?!\"<br>\r\nHarry shook his head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Lucinda's bare sole pressed against Harry once more. His head poked out between her toes and she began to caress his body underfoot with backward and forward movements. Zelia placed her socked foot onto the lower half of Ron's body and began moving her socks back and forth as well. Ron screamed with every movement of Zelia's foot to the point where both the girls became more than annoyed. Zelia placed her other foot down onto Ron's head to shut him up. <br>\r\nMere seconds had passed before Zelia could feel that she was almost finished with Ron. <br>\r\nLucinda looked down at Harry. The young Gryffindor was completely at her mercy and would soon cream under her foot, resulting in his immediate death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh looks like we're done here Lucy\" said Zelia with a smile. Ron's pants were stained and moist as he screamed in pain.<br>\r\nLucy responded. \"Looks like you're the first to go foot pet.\"<br>\r\nImmediately afterwards, Harry screamed out and Lucinda felt the bottom of her sole dampen. From below her foot, Harry could see Lucinda smile with satisfaction. \"I think it's a double execution now Zelia.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both girls hovered their feet over their hopeless victims, the door swung open and professor Mcgonagall marched inside. Both girls had differing expressions on their face as they hurried to retract their feet from above the tiny students. The professor approached and lifted them both by their collars as she inspected their conditions. As she noticed the moisture on both the boys' pants, she glanced over to the girls with urgency and proceeded to speak. \"Girls. It seems that you have done marvelous work with these boys while I was gone. 20 points to Slytherin.\" The two 'goddesses' looked at each other with glee and proceeded to celebrate with a high five followed by a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the professor took the boys outside, she focused her wand on them and uttered a spell. \"Engorgio.\" <br>\r\nThe boys were returned to their full respective sizes.<br>\r\n\"I hope in the past half an hour, the two of you learned to never be late in my class.\"<br>\r\n\"But professor. I thought that we were meant to be punished for an hour.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes but I felt sorry for you Mr. Potter. Do not make me regret it.\"<br>\r\nThe two boys nodded in an instant.<br>\r\nProfessor Mcgonagall concluded. \"Now then. I assume that you both have more classes today. I suggest that you wash yourselves off and get ready. You wouldn't want what happened with me to be repeated with the other professors now would you.\" The two boys shook their heads in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the friends departed, Ron placed his hand on Harry's shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Where are you headed now Harry.\"<br>\r\nHarry Turned to face his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he approached the door, the 'Fat Lady' portrait eyed him with a stern face. \"Password?\" she said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh. Caput Draconis\" With much effort, Harry managed to recall the password to his own common room. The Fat Lady nodded with approval and let the ragged boy through. Harry struggled up the stairs to the boys dormitory. The eventual sight of his bed filled him with relief as he inched closer. He paid no heed to the sound of approaching footsteps behind him as he thought it would be just another Gryffindor student. That was until he heard a familiar sadistic voice which made his skin crawl.<br>\r\n\"Hello slave. Miss me?\" The violet eyes of Harry's goddess latched themselves onto him and pierced fiercely into his soul. \"Such a naughty boy. Skipping classes are we?\" Harry felt his heart begin to pound like never before. Could Lucinda be even more menacing now than when he was shrunken? She was a fully grown woman, being a senior, much taller than Harry was and Harry felt as trapped now as when he was underneath her sole. As she stepped closer to him, Harry retreated backwards at the same time as if he was already hypnotized by her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe muttered in a weak and fearful voice. \"How did you get in?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh slave. I heard you as you came in. Caput Draconis. Typically bad Gryffindor password. I could have probably guessed it myself.\"<br>\r\n\"I'd leave if I were you. A prefect might come in here any second.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh slave. I'm so scared. Not that it's possible now that the Fat Lady is unlikely to wake up for a while. Let's just say not even she could resist my...charms. How unwise of you to come here all alone Potter, after what happened earlier.\"<br>\r\nHarry dropped his head in shame.<br>\r\n\"You should have stayed with your friends. Now, you'll kneel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry dropped to his knees.<br>\r\nLucinda lifted the bottom of her shoes. \"Lick my shoes slave.\"<br>\r\nHarry bent his head down to below her shoe level, completely at her mercy. He looked up at the sole which was covered in dust and dirt. Unable to muster any free will, he commenced licking the shoe and didn't top until the sole was spotless from top to bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad slave.\" Lucinda bent down gracefully to Harry's level and hooked her index finger below his chin, before lifting him to his feet as she rose. She grinned at Harry. \"Ugh. You need a bath slave. You smell like someone stepped all over you.\" Her palm then pressed against Harry's chest as she walked toward him, causing him to retreat backwards again until he fumbled onto his bed behind. Before he could make any further movements, Lucinda placed herself on top of the helpless boy, trapping him between her thighs. \"Such a week slave you are. And you thought you would last here in Hogwarts? Have friends? Be happy?\" Lucinda smirked. \"Those chances seem slim now don't they slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Lucinda moved up to kneel over Harry's face and sat down on him with her full weight. Harry's desperate attempts at escaping from under her were futile as his head was smothered by the force between the goddess's thighs. His violent clawing at Lucinda's body managed to bring a grin to her face as she effortlessly held the boy's arms in place and tilted her head in satisfaction while grinding her hips over his increasingly pale head. Before long, she felt that the boy was no longer resisting. As she released her grip, his arms dropped down to the sides, lifeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry opened his eyes to astonishment. He lay motionless in a grassy forest among tall trees at sunset. Unable to move his arms and legs, he tilted his head to the side where a bloody demon cursed his vision. The creature forced it's dying eyes up to Harry and whispered. \"Harryyyy...P...Potterrrr is dead. Finally.\" The beast attempted to laugh, but failed, instead releasing an excruciating moan until it expired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's vision was filled with blinding white until he opened his eyes again to see Lucinda on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know slave. Lord Voldemort gave me until the end of this year to kill you. How impressive of me to complete my task on your first day.\" she laughed.<br>\r\nHarry again tried to resist but Lucinda grabbed him by the throat and pushed him down into the mattress, with her wand at the ready in the other hand. Tears rushed down Harry's face as his goddess pointed the wand down directly over his head. She then whispered a spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sectumsempra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt the insides of his body implode as if slashed by an invisible sword. He tried to scream but choked on his own blood. Blood which had begun to flow from his ears, nose, mouth and other parts of his body, soaking the bed sheets in red. Lucinda placed her hands on her hips in satisfaction. She had carried out the dark Lord's plan. She rolled the suffering boy off the bed causing him to brutally fall on his back before standing over him one last time. All Harry could manage was to force his eyes up at her as a blood pool formed all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Harry. Sleep well.\" In a swift motion, Harry's mutilated head was crushed under Lucinda's shoe, ending his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Harry Potter eradicated with no effort at all, Lord Voldemort enslaved all the Wizarding World and proved to be the most powerful dark wizard in history.</span></div></div>",

Zelia, do us a favor and kill your little foot pet.\"<br>\r\nHarry's eyes swelled in shock at the revelation that Ron was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was surprised as Zelia seemed reluctant. \"But Lucy, we were just supposed to torture them for an hour.

She subtly turned back and pointed her wand at her friend and whispered \"Imperio\".<br>\r\nShe then rose to her feet and said softly \"You will kill him now Zelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelia didn't hesitate. She pulled off her shoe and flipped it over, dropping Ron to the ground. Harry watched with tears flowing down his face. There was nothing he could do.

He was lying down in a grassy forest. <br>\r\nHarry was unable to move his body but as he turned his head, he was possessed with fear. A bloody demon lay next to him, dying.

To the right of you at the opposite side of the table there is a girl who you have noticed hasn't really spoke much since you sat down, you ask her name and she tells you it's Pansy Parkinson, you, Draco and her get talking to each other and you can feel a friendship starting between all of you's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment you decide you are more than happy to become one of the Snake's in the Slytherin House.

Even among being rescued from an abandoned isle by an umbrella-wielding giant, to manning a flying getaway car while under house arrest, and all the way to blowing up an aunt as a means to ride a triple-decker London bus to uncharted magical territory, this year, right on the cusp of Harry's fourteenth birthday, had to be the strangest occurrence yet:  Being emancipated from the prison that is the Dursleys by four unlikely, and equally entranced, Wizards, all equipped with matching fiery hair, which were perhaps reflections for their blazing spirits as well.  One reunion, group hug, overly-stamped letter, victimized cousin, and chimney channel of transportation later, Harry Potter finds himself back at the Weaseley's, his spontaneous rescuers, along with one more unexpected, but certainly gratifying, guest:  Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry..are you okay?\" Speaking of whom, it was the wonderful, enchanting, but ironically Muggle girl that expressed the concern directed towards Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's head jolted upright from his downwards gaze, clearly too lost in his own thought.  His eyes met that of Hermione's, whose brown splash of auburn on white, circumscribed by a contrasting palette of her long eyelashes, had the most inviting aura about them, as if they were begging Harry to approach with closer intensity. However, appearing to be lost in an entirely different thought regarding that of the beautiful Hermione, the question is beckoned again:  \"<i>Harry!</i> Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" the word stumbled out as Harry regained his composure from the infatuating spell that Hermione's body affixes, \"Yeah, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's raises an eyebrow in suspicion, raising an issue not even Harry was aware of yet: \"Well, you were just staring so intently at my feet for some reason,\" Hermione stated amidst an innocent laugh, clearing thinking nothing of this gesture upon her feet.  Before returning back to the boardgame with Ginny that Harry's attention diverted her from, Hermione looked at Harry for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, Harry just stared back, mouth slightly ajar, bemused in his expression.  Had he really been recalling all the past events of the last 12 hours to the visual cue of Hermione's feet? Contemplating for a second without directly meeting Hermione's rising curiosity displayed in her eyes, Harry, fueled by mere curiosity, without an adherence to the extra suspicion it might manifest in Hermione, lowered his eyes to glimpse at Hermione's feet again, in some sort of attempt to find out why he was staring; the reason, upon second evaluation, was quite obvious:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's feet, positioned one on top of the other, were an ivory colour, one that Harry only saw a fleeting gaze of, considering that Hermione positioned her sitting self in such that she faced the opposite direction of Harry, legs squatted in a fashion that made it so her soles stared directly in Harry's direction, with her toes only peeking through to Harry's eyes if, by some fortune, Hermione had the good intention to scrunch her toes, permitting seductive peek.  The peek consisted of ebony painted toenails, long enough to be very inviting, with a perfect curvature of the nail; this complimented brilliant the wrinkled, creamy soles of Hermione, from extra milky, snowwhite ball of her foot, to the lush sole, all the way down to the velvety heel, protruding in such a way that Harry had to use all his available willpower to not become gravitated by.  Her ankles, unfortunately, were shrouded by jeans, so no critique could be made upon them--though, if Hermione's ankles were anything like her feet, the review would be lovingly.  Harry wasn't that annoyed though; after all, after four years of Hogwarts customary dresscodes of long socks and leather heeled shoes, Hermione's bare feet more than gratified The Boy Who Lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis trance of euphoria for Hermione' s feet, however, only lasted but a second, as Harry teared his stare from Hermione's beautiful feet to that of Hermione's face, which one could argue is equally beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally addressing Hermione's concern about staring at her feet, Harry finally summoned up the meekly words of:  \"Oh, y'know...thinking,\" finishing off with a slightly half-grin that was met with Hermione's amazed smile and eyes.  Ginny, however, from what little Harry was paying attention to her, looked annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first time Hermione and Harry were in the same house, spending the night with each other, he surmised.  Things could get...interesting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nothing got interesting that night.  Nor was it interesting the night after or the following nights to come.  Harry did concede that going to the Quidditch World Cup, knowing someone summoned the Dark Mark, meeting Mad-Eye Moody, learning about the Three Unforgivable Curses, and expecting the return of the Dark Lord Voldemort might be interesting to a normal wizard, but to Harry, these things are expected at this point.  What was interesting to Harry, at least ever since that one epiphany at the Burrow, was Hermione, and better yet, her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's anxiousness to even see Hermione's feet have even started manifesting in his actions, with Harry attempting, as best he could, to spend every waking available moment with Hermione, devising ill-conceived opportunities for her to take her shoes and socks off and reveal her gorgeous feet one more time to him.  Suffice to say, the opportunity had yet to present itself to Harry.  All of this changed, however, with Hermione's discovery of the houseelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione had taken kindly to these subservient creatures, and despite that the same could not be said for the houseelves unto her, a mutual bond was forming.  So much so, that the houseelves had now begun bequeathing Hermione with socks, and like the  courteous witch she was, Hermione was glad to oblige the elves by wearing the hand-woven leggings.  Harry, due his resilience in sticking with Hermione, seized the opportunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are <i>ridiculous!</i>\" Hermione gasped as she held the multi-patterned sock from its opening to the eyes of a derisive Harry.  The sock bore at least eight different colors in a pattern of varying consistency; it started just as repeating stripes at the top, but gradually coalesced into an obtrusive checkerboard-like arrangement, and then back to pinstripes at the very bottom toe section.  As if a satire upon real socks, these elf-made socks were woven with different materials, some rough, some soft--others weren't even for clothes, like plastic.  According to Harry, dubbing these garments as socks would pose an insult to all the other socks in existence.  Hermione couldn't help but laugh in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, c'mon,\" Harry urged, clear with his intent in mind to see Hermione's feet, \"You have to put them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the urging with genuineness, Hermione agreed with a heavy sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were in the Gryffindor Commons, Hermione sitting on the couch facing the fireplace, while Harry lay on the floor, leaning against the sofa, his arm resting upon the cushion, head turned to face Hermione's overly terrified look.  Hermione's shoes were already kicked, placed neatly on the Commons' floor, next to the sofa where Harry and Hermione were on.  With the shoes already off, Harry knew what had to come next, and he was egging the opportunity at every chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Harry began to offer, laughing at Hermione's hesitance, \"You seem scared.  Let me at least help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry slowly placed his hands on Hermione's socked ankles, fingers pointed towards the cusp of the customary long, ivory stockings of the Hogwarts Witches, which was made all the easier because Hermione, while laying back on the couch, stretched her legs, and by extension, her feet upright in front of her, giving Harry plenty of vantage from his ground position to place his hands lovingly on Hermione's beautiful, stockinged feet.  Then, as if seeking the continued approval, Harry looked upwards to see Hermione's expression, of which was still buried in her hands, the elf sock dangled from the fingers.  Hermione withdrew her exasperated face from her palms and looked downwards to Harry's helpful demeanor, giving off a smile and a smile that Hermione gestured as \"Thank you,\" but Harry took as, \"Yes, you can touch my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the given permission, Harry inched his hands upwards to the cusp of Hermione's long black stockings, digging his fingers into the inside, with his fingertips feeling the silky, soft, and slightly cold legs of Hermione Granger.  Aching with anticipation but not wanting to come off as overly anxious, Harry began removing, slowly, the socks from Hermione's legs, with his gaze focused sharply on the precarious task at hand, he felt Hermione's stare upon his neck.  At long last,  Harry had grappled the first sock from Hermione's foot and had let it drop upon his lap, as Harry, not since the Burrow, was able to fixate upon Hermione's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was glorious.  This was the first time Harry had a proper peer upon the front of Hermione's foot, and it was heavenly; it was snowy and soft, smelled like a rose-flavored fragrance, felt creamy to the touch, as if Harry's fingers were thrust upon a pillow;  the toenails were painted the same luster black as that from the Burrow, and Hermione's delicate toes, perfect in their complexion, stretched outright towards Harry's mouth, or so it at least seemed to Harry.  Harry instinctively started rubbing the Hermione's sexy sole with his right thumb in circles as the fingers of his left were tracing the top of Hermione's foot, edging in no particular direction, just savoring the sensual touch of Hermione's amazing feet.  Harry breathed in by impulse.  He was, for this very moment, in heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he was not in heaven.  He was not alone. He was in the Gryffindor's Common Room, hands groping the intensely sexy foot of Hermione Granger, who was the subject of Harry's sexual infatuation.  A fact, that Hermione might well have noticed.</span></div></div>",

He'd told his friends, that it'd been poured down the drain. Mostly in an effort to make Hermione smile, to watch those whiskers dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning, at the breakfast table, his attention was on the Slytherin table. His gaze flicking beyond Hermione's shoulder to keep an eye on Draco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to punch the air, as he watched Draco's face contort in disgust. As the house-elf prepared meal slipped down his throat. Clutching at his throat, Harry leered as Draco's skin started to bubble and roll, as the poly-juice went to work. He wasn't even sure whose hair had completed the potion, plucking a long blonde hair that had become caught in an unvarnished wooden door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, it was assumed to be female, and hopefully not from a teacher. Around his throat, his fingers slimmed, and his Adam's apple faded. His shortish mop of hair started pouring freely from his skull, cascading over his shoulders, down his back and chest. A chest that was changing quite undeniably too. Despite the new bagginess, the outline of two largish nipples was clear. As they brushed against the shirt, Draco's hands leaped to his chest. Unwilling to leave the girls visible, to allow them the freedom to shift at his awkward movements. He couldn't cover his chest, and leave the table. Instead stuck there in a limbo of indecision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes, the panic was becoming more noticed. The babble of low chat, changed tone, and more heads shifted towards the Slytherin table. There was a breathy, girlish gasp, and Harry watched, as some significant point was passed. Hogwarts was enforcing decency rules. Draco was now wearing her first bra. Slumping back, she tried to sink through the floor, her head dropping low. But it was the hands in her lap, that she couldn't hide. The feverish scrabbling, to tell herself she was still a boy, where it mattered. But her hands found no supporting evidence. Indeed, as she sat there, her trousers transfigured into a pleated uniform skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath her pristine white blouse, the shape of an emerald green bra was outlined. With the changes complete, the former Draco Malfoy stood up to flee his humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/7d/63/eb/7d63ebf89350b939e1a2cb83a3ef8f1c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the head table, the teachers were trying to restore order.

For the last few days, he'd been focusing on a page that clearly had some kind of scrawled advice, but it looked as if a pot of ink had been dumped only on that spot on that page, leaving whatever was once there illegible. There were obviously magical ways around that, but Harry didn't know what they were, and if he'd told Hermione what he wanted to use the spell for, she'd never tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was from that logic that, while writing essays in the library with Hermione and Ron, Harry 'accidentally' spilled ink all over his transfiguration textbook. \"Oh no!\" he said in an effort to appear shocked. \"My book's ruined now!\" Putting his meager acting skills to their limit, Harry looked at Hermione and said, \"Normally I wouldn't mind, but I need this to actually study for the upcoming exam if I want to be an Auror. Do you know a spell to get rid of spilled ink like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Hermione taught him the spell, and later that night, with the rest of his dormitory asleep, Harry used the spell to clear up the spot in his potions book, revealing a new piece of information written in a spidery scrawl. \"For improving one's love life,\" followed by one of the Prince's invented spells.</span></div></div>",

It was then he spotted Hermione through the book-shelves. A gap between one narrow passage and another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah... It had been Hermione that they'd talked about....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair had agreed, for Hermione own good, she should loosen up. Her angry declaration all those years ago, still ringing in his memory as the definition of the most Hermi... Hermiony-ish moment. 'Killed or worse expelled...', he resisted the urge to imitate her voice. It was the library after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhispering, Shushing himself... he looked around for anyone to complain. Instantly regretting the decision, as his head pounded and swam. Shrugging to himself, he wondered about the wisdom of being up and about. A pang of jealousy for Ron who'd chosen to go back to the common room, back to the dorm, and sleep it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry told himself, at least he was productively using his time. It took two attempts for him to draw his wand. Sliding the books aside he made a gap, wide enough for his aim. Absolutely sure, that Hermione would thank him afterwards...

Whisper thin hairs lightening her locks, until in a rush she was totally blonde. Bumping a book on the shelf, Hermione looked up at the noise.

Her face was a touch more feline, a touch more .... more Beauxbatons,still recognisably the same, but perfected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's bust had also grown, the girls a size or two larger, looking even more so, as her uniform had changed to fit.

She wasn't even glancing at the parchment spread in front of her. Instead, the quill tip, was tapping against her lush lips, as she struggled to think.

Hermione's face was more beautiful, with a layer of exquisite magical make-up, ensuring she could only look gorgeous. But the fire in those eyes flashed her anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing nervously, Harry curtly nodded, his submissive agreement, and walked around the shelves until he could approach Hermione at her isolated table in her favourite corner of the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry disappeared from her view, she ran her hands down her sides. Inspecting the damage, a wiggle of her hips in the chair confirming her panties were now frilly and brief... obviously tailored to tease, and not part of her normal wardrobe. The extra heft to her hips, and the additional padding to her posterior were almost too much to bear. A crack from those hips told her those weren't going away any time soon. Beneath her blouse, she found a corset had replaced her normal bra. Tentatively her fingers explored it's limits. Her expanded bust needing the extra support of the new garment, she scowled at the parchment in front of her as she considered what she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry rounded the corner, appearing from behind the book shelf, and Hermione stopped her exploration. Standing up, she planted her hands on her hips, and glowered at the approaching boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione didn't realise quite how she now looked. With her fists cocked on her hips, she revealed a magnificently thin waist, the perfect contrast to her boosted bust, and butt. Her eyes, while furious were set above a fixed mouth, that looked more pouting and seductive than tight-lipped and angry. The make-up, masking the rage trying to colour her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's furtive glances to her incredible face, reminded him of the Veela at the world cup. A passionate woman he couldn't resist, whose beauty commanded legions of men, while suggesting nothing behind those eyes of intelligence or wit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was fascinating in it's own way. A bimbo Hermione was such a contradiction, that he was drawn as much to that, as to her obvious glamour and grace. He made an effort to keep his eyes from her bust, that rose and fell, so teasingly, so well-presented in her blouse with every slow inhale and exhale, that it felt deliberate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeckoning, she held out her open hand. Knowing what was required, obediently, Harry dropped his wand into her palm. It should have felt weightier, as he let it go. The moment more laden with significance, that mere physics might suggest. But the bimbo Hermione couldn't look intimidating if she tried. A seductive siren who could command men... But not daunt or dismay them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the wand, holding it inches from her face, she examined it's surface as if reading the grooves, and grain of the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's hand twitched at his side, fighting the instinct to reach out and snatch back his wand. With her attention directed towards something other than himself, he was free to explore her face. His eyes roving over her face, examining the changes, the similarities, seeing the same intensity, the same passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her looks, her naive wide-eyes, her pouting, over-full lips, she looked as vapid as the dumbest hufflepuff bimbo. But her eyes told a different story. That same intensity was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Priori Incantatem{{/b}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell snapped Harry from his admiring looks, his gaze dropping from her face, it fell to the library floor. Only briefly pausing in it's descent to enjoy her pert, full bust, and then onwards to those wide, sumptuous hips straining the stitching of her skirt, and finally reaching the oak floor boards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this...\" her voice was like the smoothest velvet, and the sweetest chocolate. The question making him twitch, at the purring seductive tone. He nodded, keeping his head low, Hermione walked around him. His wand floating above her open palm, outlined in a the same glow as his last spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven that slow pacing around him, was somehow erotic, the sound of her feet, the creak of the floorboards, making him fantasise about high-heels, and the effect they'd have on her pace, the movement of her hips, the roll of her rump, as she sashayed around him. Harry's cheeks burned, at the image teasing him from his imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands crossed over his crotch, Harry hid as best he could his excitement, the crimson cheeks coloured by invented Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she completed her tour of Harry, she stopped in front of him. A smile flickered at the corner of Harry's mouth, as he spotted Hermione was wearing heels. Perhaps not high-heels, as Harry would like, but three inches or so, and far different from Hermione's normal choice of footwear. Burying his amusement, he sought a blank expression, as he saw the almost stiletto like slender heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floorboards creaked, as Hermione's weight shifted from side to side, the only noise in that part of the library. Neither of them wanting to talk first, to break first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry... Harry... Harry...\" she sounded disappointed, her tone erotic making him stiffen where he stood. A hint of Professor McGonagall in her voice. Harry opened his mouth, to explain, to apologise, but no words came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still lifting his head, hoping the sincerity in his eyes would speak to Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bimbonesis.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry recoiled a step, as the spell hit. His body outlined in a yellow-green glow. Harry felt warmth flush through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the world of bimbos.\" Hermione snarled with genuine anger.</b></span></div></div>",

Collapsing forward his hands slammed against the table top, as he fought to avoid falling to the floor entirely. Hermione placed the wand on the table, but it might as well have been on the Moon. Harry's fingers rippled and thinned, becoming more feminine with each passing moment. Hermione giggled at the changes, before disappearing behind the lengthening mop of hair spilling wildly from Harry's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he knew, Hermione was behind him. His ass brushing against her skirt, as if summoned by the contact, he felt that start to swell. Feeling the expansion herself, Hermione ground her hips against Harry's ripening arse. With a titter, her arms reached around Harry's body, and heaved him back upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was pulled upright with a gasp. Hermione's hands resting on his chest. Playfully, she squeezed his burgeoning chest. Already an A-cup, and with no sign of slowing, she shuddered and moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the world of mammals, and these are -<i>like</i>- your mammaries... sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's thumbs brushing back and forth over her new broadening nipples. Already pressing obviously against his stiff uniform shirt. Harry was glad for her support, when he heard his hips crack. He felt Hermione's grip tighten... or rather his chest swell further, until he was overflowing from her cupping hands. His trousers started to pop, as the seam of his trousers surrendered to the relentless growth of his ass... or rather her ass. There wasn't anything there to be outlined by the straining front of her trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the popping accelerated to a machine-gun ripping, the school's decency magic ensured he was kept appropriately dressed. The trousers transforming to become a skirt, the shirt shifting to become a blouse. But it was the underwear that Harry was most aware of changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe caress of satin, was shockingly chill after the dull cotton containment of his boxers. A gasp falling from her lips, as she felt her T-shirt, tighten, a sturdy band wrapping tightly around her chest. Uncertain what to do, she simply shook, as she felt bands of material slip over her shoulders. Moments later, the girls rising higher, pulled into place by her new bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry felt the magic fade from her body, Hermione spun her around. She staggered, as the heft of her bust seemed to take a moment to catch up. She looked up to Hermione's face, a mix of amusement, and a hint of feminine comparison clear in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think having a scar, drew eyes, you'll be familiar with the effect of having big titties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands playing with her bust, on the pretence of adjusting Harry's ... fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, she blew the excess hair away from her face. As a boy, he'd never been the tallest, and now as a girl, he was shorter still. Though judging by her curves, nobody would be mistaking her for a first year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do that again, it's cute.\" Hermione tittered encouragingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo impatient, she brushed the hair aside. Now long enough to tuck behind her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clapped joyously, \"Oooh... and it's taken your scar too. You're a cutie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an appraising eye, she looked Harriet up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just a cutie, but maybe bigger than me. About an H-cup... H-cup Harriet.\" she announced a little too loudly as if christening the newest Gryffindor witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I... Am I ... <i>like </i>a bimbo?\" Her question already answered, as she looked to Hermione for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Hermione answered, \"Probably as vapid as Lavender Brown... I feel as dull as Ron.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe planted her fists on her hips, she didn't realise the look she created. \"From the smartest witch of our age, to this...\" She huffed, her chest shimmying delightfully, \"The girl who giggles...\", she gestured to Harry, and the \"The boy who lived, now the Girl who jiggles.\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbidden a high giggle burst from her lips at her own wit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are both easily as cute as Fleur...\" Hermione took her shoulder, hugging her, as if that was meant to be any comfort.

Impatiently, as the moments turn into seconds, he snorts in slightly drunken impatience. The noise drawing a scornful look from Hermione towards Harry's hiding place. But he's well enough hidden, but he kneels lower, wobbling unsteadily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out to steady himself, he spots the wand in his hand. It's backwards. Rolling his eyes at his own stupidity, he turns it around. As he does he squints carefully. His hands looking different one from the other. Half sitting resting his back against the sturdy shelves, he twists them back and forth admiring... examining them from different sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne is now slimmer than the other. The fingers more slender, it's hard to tell which one is right, the changes are gradual, and he can't work out which one is the original. Is his free hand swelling... or his wand hand shrinking. Trying to work out which is the one that wrong... It's the appearance of nail polish that finally penetrates his fuzzy mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tingling sensation rising up that arm has him nodding at his own conclusion. Rising unsteadily to his feet, the jumper sleeve slips down too far, almost hiding his slimmer hand. Despite the loose fit of the shirt and jumper, a cursory feel of each arm confirms the magic is spreading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle bursts from his lips as the tickling tingling reaches and passes beyond that shoulder. At least, the uniform is hiding his mistake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giggling abruptly stops, as Harry remembers the spell he was casting. It's moments later that he feels an intense heat beneath his previously dull nipples. Feeling the warmth spread out, Harry stiffens. His had feels like it's exploding from his head. It's a barrage of changes, following too quickly to be assessed. Harry cradles his chest as it swells to become a bust... His hands now both slender and feminine desperate to push the growing titties backwards to flatten his chest. Instead sinking into the soft supple flesh. Even through his shirt and jumper the newer nipples are undeniable. Both bigger, wider, more sensitive than he'd believed possible they pressed into the palm of his cupping hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lengthening hair reached to brush over the backs of his hands. Harry's body told him of something else worrying. The swishing sensation across his bare thighs. With a gasp that sounded too girly, and high, he reached for the hem of his skirt. The brushing of his soft thighs drawing a shuddering gasp from her lips... Hands rising slowly over the fabric of the skirt... She reached higher... towards her waist, dreading, expecting... discovering she was fully a witch from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/dc4809e51f369876d9ddcc9026b99a8e/tumblr_p6eijiB7GP1w2lwkto2_r1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/dc4809e51f36...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle slightly too high, slightly too manic burst from her lips.

The look of hunger, of need was vaguely terrifying, and alluring from her new perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe truly was a bimbo.</span></div></div>",

Sweeping her eyes back and forth across the library, she saw nothing. She resumed reading her tome - a richly detailed account of Camelot's magical stratums - until she was interupted again by a high pitched tittering, again from the same source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brow knit in frustration, she closed the large tome, making sure to mark her page with an spare quill, and marched over to the giggling bookshelf. Time and time again she had to ask Roberta Ravenclaw and her man of the week - usually both hopped up on butterbeer - to take their snogging to some other corner of the library, and the scent in the air seemed to be a portend of a similar situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErgo, the sight she saw when she rounded the corner was that much more surprising. It was a girl to rival Roberta both in size and appearance. Her cardigan could barely disguise the mounds of prodigious size underneath them, and her skirt was barely long enough to cover her panties, which were almost swallowed by the curve of her ass.. Her expression was vapid, the eyes behind her round glasses practically glazed over, and her perfectly white teeth sunk into her plump, ruby-red lips. But what Hermione noticed first was not any of this. It was the girl fondling her chest, mashing her tits around almost as if to shove them back in her, a giggle accompanying her ever so often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione stood aghast for a second, words not coming to her lips. But before she gave the girl a tongue lashing for using her library in such a manner, a different possibility came to her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's mind was a bit muddled, to say the least. Besides the butterbeer confusing his thoughts, thinking through the new spell was like dragging a weight through molasses. Being vaguely aware that the massive weights on her chest were unbecoming of the Boy Who Lived, her limited mental faculties were dedicated to trying to push them in, each separate grope of her breasts sending a giggle of pleasure out of her lush lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was suddenly interrupted by a familiar hand grasping hers, and roughly pulling her to his feet. Amidst the confusion, she let out a \"Like, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione, looking back briefly over her shoulder, hid her expression of disgust by leading her by the hand, quickly exiting the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm taking you to the Hospital wing. I've read about girls who got hit by the <i>Libidinus</i> hex, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winced for a second, and continued, \"Anyways, Madam Pomfrey will know what to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had only half heard, having been occupied with waving her manicured hand at a goggling group of fifth-years.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her rump a symphony of movement, and her hips swaying, as her chest shifted with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuttering to herself, more than the bimbo, she knew there was no girl in school quite like this one.

Her spectral attentions had been hard to bear... and he was still shocked at the spell working on her. Ghosts being unaffected by most magic. But clearly she was affected, and severely. Her face looked more beautiful, her lips fuller, her eyes more haunting, her cheek bones now high and gorgeously defined. There was a hint of Veela elegance, grace, and timelessness in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't meet her gaze without being drawn into those eyes. Awkwardly, he looked elsewhere while still addressing her. His voice little more than a stutter of random syllables. Even this drew a smile from her. But from the corner of his eyes, the other effects of the spell were clearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took on a fuller figure, expanding in all the right places. Her spectral bust, brushing against Harry's chest, feeling a chill enter his bones at the contact. Unable to take her shoulders and thrust her away. He stumbled backwards. Her uniform was stretched lewdly over her figure. The skirt showing off her wider hips, her fuller ass. Moving with ghostly glide, she still swayed her hips as she drifted back closer to Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrtle giggled, as she approached clearly relishing Harry's shy retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did.....

But served to make Harry panic even more. Unsure how to restrain or resist a ghost. He cast one last horrified look at Myrtle, the idea of her pursuing him through the castle, passing through the walls as if they weren't there. Relentless in her harassment, a wild thought entered his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't take time to consider it, as Myrtle drifted closer, coyly her hands behind her back, her chest thrust outward. Her target was clear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry whirled towards the mirrors at the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Slutomakus</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only as he felt the magic enter his body, that he belatedly started to consider other options. However, it was far too late for that. With his hands gripping onto the sink he watched as the changes raced through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis flesh rippled and rolled, shifting as if boneless. His face quickly resettling into a new arrangement, a hint of Harry Potter still visible, and those same emerald eyes looking outward, but now she too had the same gorgeous proportions, the same grace, and refinement. As if she couldn't look ugly if she tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shook her head at the reflection, but that only set her hair in motion. As it cascaded over his shoulders. The same unkempt wildness, taking on a new aspect, the just-fucked look that told a different story, than his short mess of boyish hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to dismiss the faint shimmy he felt from his chest, the odd heightened sensitivity coming from his nipples. But the brushing against the inside of his shirt was too immediate to dismiss. His gaze drawn down to his chest. His shirt looked out of place, both too tight and too loose. Even that became clearer, as his chest pressed forward. The budding breasts undeniably pushing the shirt forward. Their shape unmistakable, their weight unsettling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crack from Harry's hips, made his spread his legs further apart, as if he needed that to keep his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry realised he was lower now, his eyeline lower than before. Even with his new stance, it was several inches down from a minute ago. His gaze shot between the widening hips, and his swelling bust. Each as horrifying as the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDreading, fearing the result, Harry's hands dropped to his crotch. A strangled whimpering mewling cry all that emerged, as he found... he was fully a witch. Nothing remaining of his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was small comfort to see that Myrtle had lost her interest. The price was too high, as she looked at her own sexualised body in the mirror. She barely registered, as her uniform changed, the trousers retreating up her legs, becoming first shorts, and then a skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same strangled noise came from her, as she felt the alien sensation, as a bra formed. Her bust lifting and looking more prominent with the support of the new arrival. Even before her hands rose to her chest, she could feel it's satin embrace, the teasing lacy edges that let her know it was frilly and erotic. A gasp spilling from her lips, as she felt her plain boxers transfigure... Their lacy replacements, making her feel vulnerable, and available. The new uniform making her squirm as a wave of excitement flooded her body.</span></div></div>",

The thought of braving the centre of the school, terrified her. Goosebumps rising on her skin at the thought of such a public, such a shaming experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thrill of excitement at the idea, he quickly buried, his broad, full nips still stiffening at the imagined attention from all those appreciative male eyes. Swallowing the warbling cry, a mix of mewling fear, and trembling anticipation. Harry felt the sting of the spell. The building need, an itch that demanded attention. Squeezing her eyes shut, she drove out the picture of what he needed. His former gender ensuring it's graphic, image was too intimidating, it was too familiar. Quaking in her shoes, she caught her half-reflection in the window pane. Pale, and spectral like a ghost, she had shrunk several inches in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks flushed from exertion, she looked breathless, and unkempt. Cruelly his imagination suggested, just-fucked... for his look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head to dislodge the image of him on his knees, the craving satisfied, as she surrendered to her instincts. She pushed past another student. The safest refuge clear in her mind, the nearest refuge... The Room of Requirement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready sensing her urgent panic, the door was already forming as Harry raced for it. Her bust still swinging heavily from side to side. The bra straining to keep her from over-balancing, and a humiliating face plant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteadying her nerves, with her hand on the handle, Harry took a deep breath to calm herself. Her free hand slipping lower, brushing her skirt into place. She felt a twinge, a hungry clenching of unfamiliar muscles, the drooling hunger of her pussy. Eager to feed. Her thighs warm and wet in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry swung the door open, and stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing the door closed by resting her back against it. Harry felt as well as heard the solid -<i>snick</i>- as the heavy door sealed behind her. Harry's heart relieved at reaching sanctuary.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As 'The Boy Who Lived', Harry found peace and quiet to be the hardest things to attain. Even in the library, he felt the pressure of eyes on his back as he studied. His adventures, over the years adding to the fascination. Some would say, his hunger for fame. Even the company of his best friends was sometimes a burden. Certainly one he couldn't share with them, or even fully explain, it was simply unique and his to solve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd vaguely offered them half explanations, about Quidditch, flying Hedwig, visiting Hogsmeade, and left them to work out when and where he be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it was that Harry found himself outside the chamber of secrets. Hissing a parseltongue command, he watched as the ornate metallic snakes withdrew and with an eerie silence opened wide to allow him entry. It brought back old memories, he couldn't imagine Ron would ever want to revisit this place or the memories of Lockhart's betrayal, or his sister's kidnapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Ron's half-repaired wand that he discovered, abandoned and forgotten. He wondered how often he'd wandered past it without noticing. The passage now cleared of the debris. Not certain why, he picked it up and tucked it into his jeans pocket. Walking deeper into the chamber. The ornate snake stone statues still as unnerving in the wand light. The half-rearing, gaping mouths still startling in the half light, and from the corner of his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with a hint of shame that he snuck the notebook from it's hiding place. Concerned that the half-blood prince's book was possessed, enchanted, cursed, or just working some other magic on him. His experience with magical artefacts was deeply unlucky, and with Riddle's diary it felt like any precaution was justified. Whoever had made the additions was clearly a talented wizard... or as Hermione suggested a witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis own untidy handwriting covered the page. Carefully transcribed from the 'Advanced Book of Spells', chastened by his fight with Draco in the toilet, he wasn't going to make that mistake again. An impulse to keep his own copy private, and to not use any spell he hadn't used at least once in here. The writing was done quickly, and without any attempt at comprehension. Faster was better, as he wanted to limit his exposure to any harm the book might be inflicting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lumos</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glowing ball rose into the air brightening the entire room even the arched roof, crafted to look like interwoven snakes slithering over one another. Baleful emerald green eyes glowering down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDismissing the thoughts of the basilisk from his mind, he sat down on the coils of a marble serpent, and read. He knew the value of the potions advice, but could hardly build a stockpile down here without attracting undue attention. So he scanned through his notes for non-potion suggestions. He also wanted to avoid any combat or duelling magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the part he'd reached, the highligher marks stopping where he'd left them. Distractedly, he recalled Mr. Weasley's reaction to seeing Harry use the yellow highligher pen on his notes. The muttering about muggle ingenuity. Harry promised to explain the 'magic' pen and also the 'thermos' spell he'd seen the muggles use on picnics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnsuring it wasn't marked 'for enemies', or involved bubbling cauldrons, Harry found a couple of interesting candidates for experimentation. Perhaps if benign, he'd sell them to Fred and George. There were times he wished he hadn't hidden the book. As Hermione observed rather too loudly, his handwriting was appalling, and he found himself wishing he could double check what he'd written.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout knowing who the author was, Harry found it hard to resist the temptation it was his father... or maybe one of the other marauders. While the book was gone, he comforted himself by reassuring himself it wasn't destroyed.</span></div></div>",

Harry watched with a degree of pride, half wishing Professor McGonagall was here to see the spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of the crystal grew louder, deeper as it gained mass, grinding away rough corners. Harry was forced to take a step backwards, a faint flickering inside hinting that perhaps his transfiguration spell wasn't as good as he'd hoped.

They took her to their sacred hollow for judgement. Their limited knowledge of her was already that she viewed them as inferior, that she saw them as little more than animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood in the middle of the natural bowl in the earth. She scanned around the rim, the centaurs formed a solid wall. Each with their own bow drawn. The creak of the wood under strain, as the last one left her alone. She knew not to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink.\" The bearded elderly centaur commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDolores glanced to the pedestal beside her, and the shallow silver bowl atop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's poison. I refuse to drink it.\" she folded her arms, her strident tone sounding more like a petulant child refusing a strange, new piece of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe centaur simply added, \"It is truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe refused to answer, with her jaw locked, she shook her head. As if she were afraid of the herd forcing her to drink. As if such a display would be a barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, the elder, Dolores assumed, repeated, \"It is the truth. Either drink or face summary judgement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creaking of the taut bow, made it perfectly clear what summary judgement involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lip tic'd, and with as much strained dignity as she could manage she tried to lift the bowl from the pedestal. Her chubby fingers going white as she heaved. But it remained an integral part of the pedestal. With a depressed groan of realisation, she worked out it was set up for the centaurs, at this height for them. She knew she needed to lower her head to the bowl, and drink... like an animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear like rain-water, and didn't have any strong odour. The surface rippled and flowed like water as her breathing disturbed the surface. Perhaps it was a test of courage, she half hoped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slurped loudly, as she took her first mouthful. Dipping for a second draught, her spine snapped rigid, and she stood erect unable to move. Her breathing shallow, with only her eyes capable of moving, of taking in the scene. It was somewhat reassuring. The bows were lowered, and the head centaur walked down to stand beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis muscular chest pressed against her back, so she felt his words as much as heard them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Truth. Confess your truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gruff voice striking a chord with her soul, she felt it vibrate deep inside her. Dolores' cheeks flushed, as she recognised the reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her jaw unlock, and for the next hour she confessed every dark deed, thought and fear, every malicious action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She confessed to her fear of ... of ... half-breeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe confessed to setting the dementors on Harry Potter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe confessed to her absolute terror of Lord Voldemort.</i> Even gasping at her own compelled use of his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She confessed her abuse of the students. </i>Drawing a whicker disapproval from the centaurs. The abuse of foals, of those in one's care was a heinous action in centaur society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dolores' throat ran dry, she knew she was doomed from her own mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell broke, and she collapsed to kneel beside the pedestal. Her confessions surprising even her with her own honesty. Her self-delusions ripped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe centaur softly stroked her hair, as he stood beside her. Offering what little comfort he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now you face judgement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA last flicker of defiance flared in her, \"Who are you to judge me?\" she snapped. Twisting she looked up at the figure towering over her. There was only sadness on his face, and he explained, \"We aren't judging you. The judgement comes from within you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through her eyes, he saw Dolores' judgement building in her own mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come here any time you wish.\" he offered. Taking a few shuffling steps backwards through the bed of fallen leaves, he gave her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there, determined to fight back the tears she felt coming. Then the transformation started. A steady tick-tick-tick came from Dolores' grubby pink skirt. The seams surrendering to her expanding rear. Until like a machine gun, it accelerated into a rapid rip. The tatters fell to the forest floor. Her riper rump was blessed with it's own equine tail. She gazed in horror at it. Transfixed, unsure whether to cover her absent clothes, and half-afraid to touch it, to confirm it's reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creaking of straining leather was the last and only warning her shoes gave before they were fired off her feet. Feet that had already transformed into stiff hooves. She watched as her plump thighs, grew even thicker, even fuller, gaining muscle as they developed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrieked as she felt her pelvis twist, and a long row of bones click outwards. Hearing her spine crack, she watched as it turned and extended backwards. Hands fumbling, she tried to force it all backwards. To somehow push that clearly horse spine back, to return her human bottom to it's pristine, original condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head shook in denial, she wasn't a mere beast. She was fully human, more than a centaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA button popped on her blouse, and she felt the tightening of her bra. Swallowing, she knew she was going to become fully a centauress. Her human half would expand to match the proportions of her horse-half. Her diet of cream-cakes, and little exercise had given her curves that she knew could draw Fudge's eyes. With a rippling surge, the bra too surrendered. Instinctively, she cradled her bust. Each full breast bigger than her head, she gasped. They were extra-sensitive too. Though she hoped that was purely for the transformation. Surely, they couldn't stay this easily aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of her clothes finally succumbed to her changes. Apparently, the centauress' went topless, as Dolores' changes, her nudity drew no great attention, or even much of a reaction from the surrounding centaurs. She didn't want to examine the twinge of anger, and offence that she briefly felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo concerned was she with her bust, that she hadn't noticed the rest of the changes were already complete. She saw her fore hooves folded beneath her broad equine torso. A glance over her shoulder confirmed the soft ginger fur that coated her down to the.... her tail. The tail matching her hair, again her hands scrabbled. Hair no more, it was her mane, cascading down her human half to reach the layer where human met horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fought her feeling of vulnerability getting unsteadily to her fee.... her hooves. She stood unsteadily wobbling like a foal, on her splayed legs. A sense of pride at her success, and the approving smile of the centaur elder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a were-centaur now, Miss Umbridge.\" he told her calmly. His voice felt fatherly and kind.</span></div></div>",
