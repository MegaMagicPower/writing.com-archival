You can\u2019t drink because you\u2019re under age, you\u2019re not a fan of night clubs and you\u2019re roommate and you have different work schedules so you don\u2019t hang out too often.<br>\r\nAnyways as you were pulling up to the main entrance of the hotel with an older gentleman\u2019s Audi A5, you noticed he was alone so there was a slim chance he\u2019d tip. <br>\r\n\u201cThere we are Mr. James, your Audi A5. Anything else I can assist you with today?\u201d You ask<br>\r\n\u201cHey thanks buddy, I don\u2019t have any cash on me but let me give you a tip\u201d he says. <br>\r\nConfused as to how you\u2019re going to receive a tip without cash you assumed just loose change in his car but instead he pulled out a pin. He hands it to you and tells you that it has an incredible power to switch your head with anyone in this location and that he used to have fun with it when he was younger. <br>\r\nYou took the pin, thanked him and wished him a great rest of his day. Thinking it was all nonsense you were gonna throw the pin away but the 3% interest you had made you question if it worked. If it did who would be your first target? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria \u201cAlex\u201d Cruz<br>\r\n5\u20193\u201d, 24 years old, married, mother of 3, long black hair, semi-hourglass figure, C cups.

Even though we don\u2019t have a lot in common we still are very close even outside of work, which is why I thought of her first thing when I decided to see if this pin actually worked. The old man didn\u2019t say how to make it work but I figured it out. It looks like the pin can be split in half and clipped on. <br>\r\n   I walk up to the concierge desk when business starts to slow down and start making small talk with Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s going on over here?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSame as always, nothing. You\u2019re not busy out there?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI was but we slowed down, but anyways I got this clip as a tip from an older guy who said it was magic. I don\u2019t believe it but i guess we can find out, take this half.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck, magic? Why would I take this half, what if it\u2019s cursed or dark magic or voodoo? I don\u2019t need that.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIf it was evil you really think he would\u2019ve gave it to me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou never know.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust clip it on.\u201d <br>\r\n Alex always has a good taste in clothing. Today she was wearing a semi clear, white top with some black jeggings and some 2 inch wedge heels. I on the other hand had to wear uniform so it was the black company polo, black jeans, and black tennis shoes. <br>\r\nAlex takes the pin and puts it on her white blouse. I put it over my work uniform. We stand there for a minute waiting to see what kind of magic would happen but nothing occurred. <br>\r\n\u201cSee it\u2019s not dark magic, nothing even happened.\u201d<br>\r\nAs soon as I start to walk away from the concierge window back to the valet podium I feel super light headed and then everything went black. <br>\r\nNext thing I know, I\u2019m opening my eyes and some white bright lights are flashing straight down on me. I lift my hand to try and cover the brightness but something wasn\u2019t right. For one I don\u2019t remember my arm being so slim and smooth, second of all I don\u2019t remember having manicured nails colored a light pink. I tried to remember where I remember seeing these nails and then I lift my other arm as well and it\u2019s the same. I guess my hand shrank or someone put some nails and shaved my arms while I was asleep? I tried to scoot up on the bed I was on but that\u2019s when I realized I was in a hospital room and felt a jiggle on my chest. As I lifted the sheet two bare breasts appeared under them on my chest. I couldn\u2019t help but put my hands on them and give them a feel.<br>\r\nEverything was so sensitive and I felt a wetness in my groin area instead of an erection. I could only imagine what had happened and as I lifted the sheet up higher I noticed that there was something that looked like black jegging and some heeled shoes. <br>\r\nThen it hit me, the magic pin. I realized that this wasn\u2019t some dream or hallucination but magic and that the body that was under my neck was Alex\u2019s. I thought I had her head too but I reached around and my hair was still it\u2019s short length and my beard was still there. <br>\r\nNow what?</span></div></div>",

Just due to the way you are right now we\u2019re gonna have you attempt something that you will definitely find weird but it\u2019s for the baby\u2019s sake\u201d the nurse said. <br>\r\n\u201cWait! Wait, what baby?\u201d I exclaim not ready for what\u2019s next.<br>\r\nAs I finish speaking in comes another nurse with a baby girl. The second nurse hands the baby to the nurse that was in the room with me and starts walking towards me. <br>\r\n\u201cWell since you have Mrs. Cruz\u2019s body and she has an infant child who still needs to breastfeed, you will have to feed her since you technically are her mother\u201d the nurse says as she puts the baby in my arms with the baby\u2019s head near one of my new breasts. <br>\r\n\u201cNow hold on a second aren\u2019t you going to..... oh wow, that actually feels good\u201d I say in a soothing tone as the baby starts to suck on my breast to get milk. <br>\r\n\u201cAlright Mr. Rodriguez, the thing is we don\u2019t really know why this happened. Someone from your job apparently called 911 when both you and Mrs. Cruz dropped on the floor and your whole neck are was glowing red. On the ambulance our paramedics saw that your heads had come off of your bodies cleanly, no blood, no broken bones, like if someone had cut straight through. When you arrived here after many attempts of putting your head back on your body through surgery or just placement, your head wouldn\u2019t stay on so as a last resort our doctors asked what would happen if we put your respective heads on each other\u2019s bodies and with no issues the heads just merged into each others body. Any other questions? </span></div></div>",

She has two kids and is 8 months pregnant with her 3rd so her stomach is really showing out on her 5\u20194\u201d body.

Since she was the one who was closest to my age, it felt natural to have a friendship with her. There was a point where I even wanted to start something more serious with her but the fact that she has her 2 year old son already and problems with the kids father made everything a little more complicated. <br>\r\nEither way as I was getting ready to clock out that evening and I was making sure that I had all my personal belongings on me, Sasha peaked in through the office window. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving already?\u201d She says in a sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am, I\u2019m tired as hell.\u201d I replied.<br>\r\n\u201cI mean you guys are busy all day, oh and by the way as far as getting dinner tonight, unless anything happens with Anthony (her sons dad), I will be able to get dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh okay perfect, what time do I pick you up?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIf you could be at my house at around 7:30, I think that would be ideal.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright pretty lady, I will see you later tonight.\u201d I said as I closed the door behind me and saw her blow a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going home, taking care of my dog, and taking a shower, I started to get ready for the dinner. It was just turning 7pm and as I was grabbing my wallet from my work jacket, I picked the pin the guy gave me earlier. I figured that it was still bull-crap but I still took it with me. <br>\r\nAs I came up to Sasha\u2019s front door, I was inspecting the pin after ringing her doorbell. It split perfectly down the middle and had a pin head on each side. <br>\r\n\u201cHey handsome, looking good\u201d Sasha said as the door opened. <br>\r\n\u201cWho me? No I\u2019m not even close to looking as good as you are.\u201d I replied in a more than fascinated tone. Sasha was looking taller than her usual 5\u20194 height because of the 3 inch black heels she was wearing. With that she was wearing a somewhat short dress, shorter than mid thigh. Her hair looking a perfect balance of wavy and straight. She looked perfect. <br>\r\n\u201cWhatcha got there? A gift for me?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis guy gave me this pin and said to give it to someone who meant a lot to me, that he used to use it when he was young. \u201c<br>\r\n\u201cAwww that\u2019s so sweet. Well let me have half and hopefully we have as much fun as that guy did.\u201d <br>\r\nAs soon as Sasha put the pin on I blacked out for what seemed like 5 seconds.

That\u2019s when it hit me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I reached my arms out to help myself out they seemed super odd. Way thinner, no hair, and the biggest difference of all was the black painted finger nails that were at my tips ends now. I turned my head down and was greeted by two friends that were never there before. Breast. Like real breasts. As I was going up to reach the girls attached to me I heard <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT THE HELL! YOU HAVE MY BODY! I HAVE YOURS! WHAT IS HAPPENING!\u201d Sasha yelled out at what seemed to be the top of her lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhhh! Let\u2019s just go inside and figure this out\u201d I said as I was trying to get both of us up and as soon I was gonna try and take a step, my ankle went soft and I would\u2019ve called face first if Sasha hadn\u2019t held my arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry not to hurt my body will ya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo promises!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked indoors to try and figure out what happened ........</span></div></div>",
