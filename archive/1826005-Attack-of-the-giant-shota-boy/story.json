How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skinny red-headed boy looked at his arm as he rubbed it. \"Okay, I guess,\" he replied. The shots hadn't exactly been pleasant, but he remembered what his father had said: he was ten years old now, which meant he was in double-digits. He wasn't a little kid anymore, so it was past time for crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then I'll see you next--\" The doctor stopped himself as he flipped through pages on the clipboard. \"Oh, I almost forgot! There's one more injection we can do. It's optional, but it's supposed to lead to healthy development in boys your age. I just got to go grab it from the supply closet. One moment please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith grimaced at the thought of another needle poking through his skin. He wondered if he could just tell the doctor not to do it; he did say it was optional, after all. But he figured that if his doctor was this positive about it, it couldn't hurt, and the pain would just be temporary. <i>Might as well suck it up and just do it,</i> he thought to himself.  He tried to focus on something else while he waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the doctor returned into the room holding a needle, one that looked much larger than the previous ones (or maybe that was just his imagination at work). \"All right, Keith, this should be the one. Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Should?</i> Keith thought to himself, not liking the slight hesitation in the doctor's voice, but he pushed his fear down and simply nodded. The doctor gently grabbed his arm, batted the already-tender spot where the needle was about to go in with a cotton swab wet with rubbing alcohol, and brought the tip of the needle to the skin. Closing his eyes and biting his lips, Keith braced himself, waiting for the inevitable sharp sensation of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sensation never came, though. Instead, he only felt a half-second's worth of pressure, and then nothing for several seconds. He waited, expecting that pain to come any second, until finally he heard his doctor say \"All done! That didn't hurt too much, did it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith spun his head around and gawked incredulously at his arm. Sure enough, there was a red spot where the needle had gone in, but he could've sworn that he didn't feel any hint of pain there. In fact, now that he thought about it, a slight feeling of pleasure was swelling through him, one that was rather unfamiliar to him. \"N-no,\" he stammered in reply. \"That didn't hurt at all!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" The doctor sounded skeptical, but shrugged it off. \"Well, that's certainly good news! You handled your injections like a pro, Keith. You're really growing up to be a fine young man. See you next year!\" And with that, the doctor was off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the car ride back home, Keith could feel the unusual pleasureful sensation spread throughout his body. It wasn't anything too overwhelming, and it was probably best to be ignored, he thought, but it certainly was a nice side effect of the shot, if that's what caused it, anyways. Much later that night, though, he began to realize just how significant that feeling was, and that it was only the beginning of something... big...</span></div></div>",

Go take a shower!\" his mother called. \"It's already 8:45!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith himself was currently in his room, playing a new game on his computer about a giant boy who must fight other giant boys to get even bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man,\" Keith muttered. \"Just when I grew to 75 feet...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe relunctantly began making his way to his dresser where he began looking for clothes. As he did this, that sudden pleasuring feeling that he felt from before came back. But this time it was way stronger! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs buckled from the sheer bliss that wracked his body, before eventually falling to his knees. Keith let out a soft groan as he suddenly felt giddy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as soon as the feeling came it quickly vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what was that?\" Keith asked himself. \"I have never felt anything like that. It felt so, <i>good</i>.\" Picking himself up, Keith quickly resumed searching for his clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked out of his room to the bathroom, he saw his mom by the door. Upon noticing Keith, she said, \"Keith, honey. I have to go do something. I will be gone for a few hours. When I return I expect to see you in bed. Understood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mom.\" He answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he did, he walked into the bathroom and shut the door. Keith put his clothes on a nearby table, undressed himself, and got in the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned on the shower, and let the nice cool water flow down his head and soak his body. However, as he was getting ready to clean himself, the pleasuring feeling from before suddenly came back with a vengance! This time, it was even stronger than before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith fell into the tub, unharmed. He began to shiver from the immense feeling, this time however, it didn't go away. \"It's that feeling again!\" Keith exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Keith sat in the tub, he noticed something. His body was sliding. At first, he thought he was slipping, however he felt his feet begin to to touch the end of the tub. Then the walls on the tub began closing in on him. Looking around, Keith saw that everything in the room had begun to get smaller and smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the pleasuring feeling stops, and so does his growth. After laying in the tub for a few seconds, Keith gets out of the shower, or tries to as he bumps his head. \"OW!\" He cries, rubbing his head. \"How big am I? Wait, why am I asking myself that when I can just find out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunching towards the huge mirror in the bathroom thanks to his new size, Keith looks at himself. But the only thing he he sees is his chest. \"Hmm, I've gotta be pretty big if I can't see my own face...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting another idea, he hunches up to the table and grabs his clothes. Much to his surprise, and disbelief, his shirt and pants are about the size of his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this is just awesome!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Keith know, things were gonna get even bigger for him...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly out of nowhere Keith's stomach rumbled loudly. Then his clothes started to feel unusually snug. Suddenly Keith began to grow, his clothes began to stretch apart as he passed 4'7. The bully was shocked, but Keith had a sly smile on his face. He passed 5 feet and his shirt ripped. The other students were so scared they turned ghost white. He passed 6 feet and his pants ripped, leaving him in a pair of blue underwear, which seemed to be growing with Keith as he was becoming a giant boy. He passed 7 feet, 8 feet, 9 feet. The other kids and staff ran out of the lunch room as Keith continued to grow. He passed 10,20, 30, 40, and stopped at 60 feet high.\"Now I rule this puny land\" said Keith evilly.

He was having a happy life by any means, and enjoyed so much that he got to spend some time with his family like it should.  That is until six months ago, when tragedy struck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was at school one morning when he was informed of a terrible car crash on a highway.  Sam knew his parents were heading through to go on a business, so he thinks they would be safe with an incident.  But it was not the case, when his teacher told him privately that both his parents were amongst the other fatalities involved in what was later learned, was a careless, drink driving from one man.  Yet, he survived at the expense of others on the highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis dropped Sam so hard, that he could hardly believe his parents are no more, and unable to spend some quality time together than he should get.  All because of one man to blame, he also felt angry in frustration with this cause.  He always wanted to take this loss and find this man some revenge, as if he needed it so badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix months on, and still can\u2019t get to terms of his loss, now that he lives alone that he needed some quiet reflection on his own.  He can be seen sitting on the bench at the park, wanted to have some quiet moment for his benefit.  It kinda helps sometimes, when he had bad dreams in the middle of the night, thinking about his parents he\u2019s unable to see them again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty common for Sam to take it easy for a while, but that was until one day when he spotted something that was laying on the ground.  It was some kind of a toy gun that some kids would use, but he finds it suspicious, and picked it up to take a closer look at it.  What turns out is  there\u2019s just two buttons and a trigger, which Sam begin to curious about this toy gun he\u2019s now holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm... so this is the size ray gun, eh?\u201d  Sam wondered for a moment, before he shrugged and thought otherwise.  \u201cI hope someone doesn\u2019t mind if I can have a shot at it for a while?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat curious smile was the first since his loss to his parents, as he feels he\u2019s been gifted to act his revenge or some sort.

His best friend ran outside too, Kyle. \"Hey dude, you ok?\" The 10 year old boy said. \"I'm here for you, what's up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. Feel so weird..\" Tony cried out, \"I think you should run.. Cause...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Tony let out a huge roar, his skin turning green for a second. Kyle noticed that his friend was beginning to change, rapidly. The boy moaned and groaned.. His clothes starting to rip off, as he started to grow in height. Kyle only watched as his friend was half naked in his underwear, which seemed to grow with him, as he grew taller and taller, becoming a gigantic boy... Somehow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children and teachers from the school gazed out from their windows at the sight they were seeing, and quickly tried to evacuate the building as the monstrous child grew bigger. Children from the gym stepped outside to see the boy becoming gigantic, and even the PE teacher who had just yelled at Tony was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony finally stopped growing for the moment.. He was confused, but he looked down, to see the tiny people below him. He just realized, he became a 50 foot tall monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could only admired for a while, when it started shooting the beam from its saucer, hitting Max in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat chain reaction to the beam had caused himself to passed out, and the UFO suddenly took off as if nothing had happened.  It was only minutes after it happened, when Max was starting to awake very slowly.  His eyes was blurring for the moment, which prompted himself to ask in great concern, whilst still feeling shocked from the beam it struck him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha...where am I?

That\u2019s the reason why he\u2019s so obese, he weighs at only 250lbs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had his love for food, so much so that he simply liked the flavours of junk foods and meats to fill himself up.  However despite he had grown fatter with his shirt gotten so tighter, which caused his fat belly to see underneath, Damien doesn\u2019t seem to phased from it, since it\u2019s these delicious foods that kept himself going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wouldn\u2019t be that easy if it wasn\u2019t for a challenge set by his parents.  Obviously concerned about their son\u2019s weight gain, they tried to convince him to stop and look after his own body, but even Damien tries at least, it\u2019s the food that got himself distracted, and couldn\u2019t help but gorge it so much more to have his stomach filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was someday when Damien had to walk to the shops, since his parents think it\u2019s better to burn off the fat than get in the car.  Of course, it was a challenge for Damien to give, but of course his mind about food became his number one priority.  He was about to walk into the store, when he spotted a vending machine that caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw, was some brand new bottle of soda, which he has never seen like it before.  Even he couldn\u2019t remember if it was advertised or not, but whatever the case, Damien couldn\u2019t help but shrugged it off, and wants to give it a try.  So he paid into the machine, and got the bottle out to pick up, and get a closer look to the soda itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...  I\u2019ve never seen a soda like this before.  I\u2019m sure hope I\u2019ll give it a try though, because I\u2019m so thirsty!\u201d  Damien says, since he felt his mouth rather dry for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he wasted no time but to open the top cap of the bottle, and takes a sip to give it a taste.  That\u2019s when he had that surprised expression and felt a satisfying taste of that drink.  Of course with him nodding his approval, Damien takes another drink, as he would chug down...</span></div></div>",
