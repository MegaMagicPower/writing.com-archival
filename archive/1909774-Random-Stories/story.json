We have to find a way to get out of here.\" Shadow said. \"Come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Shadow took my hand and led me. Where will we go?</span></div></div>",

It's Ren and Stimpy!\" I yelled. \"Oh yeah!\" Shadow said. \"Maybe they will give us a ride to get us out of here.\" I said. \"Good idea Lauren, let's go say hello to them.\" Shadow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow and I then went over to Ren and Stimpy. \"Hello can I help you?\" Stimpy asked. \"We need a ride.\" I said. \"Yeah it's important.\" Shadow said. \"I'll explain everything on the way.\" I said. \"Sure hop in.\" Stimpy said. \"Always nice to meet hitchhikers.\" Ren said.

We have to find our way home.\" Shadow said. \"I'm just playing around Shadow. Don't worry, we'll find it.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so I playfully tickled him. He giggled but was very serious. \"I'm going to go get something to eat.\" I said. And I ate what was my favorite until I got full. \"Oh boy, what a feast. I'm surely not going to do that again.\" I said, \"I'm going to bed.\" I then slept in the middle of the bed. Ren was on one side and Stimpy was on the other. Shadow laid on top of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's going to happen in the next chapter? We'll just have to wait and see.</span></div></div>",

Of course, that may take a while since his rank still has a queen as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better explain to me what's going on or things are gonna get ugly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, darling, if you insist. You are in chessland, a divided kingdom in wonderland. Your friend joined the game years ago as a bishop, but now he's finally been captured by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Years?\" You ask, bewildered. \"Wait! What is wonderland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you must be from the other dimension. Your friend Shadow is a wizard, and he opened the portal to this dimension, which is home to wonderland and many other kingdoms. He must have opened the portal for you so that you could help him. I was on his tail for quite some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so this game has been going on for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, with many pieces captured, including my mother, the original red queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen in chess can move as many spaces as she wants in any direction, this is why the red queen is able to move so fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough chatter for now, darling. If you wish to play the game and save your friend you must become a white pawn, the weakest of all pieces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a human, and the last thing I need is another on of you in my rank. As far as I'm concerned, you're the white queen's problem. I'll give you a head start, but I warn you that the red pieces shall be brutal and torture you before cl when they see you. This is no game, girl. Be cautious in these lands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red queen raises her palm and sends you away. When you wake up, you are . . .</span></div></div>",
