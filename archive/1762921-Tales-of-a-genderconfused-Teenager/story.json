It was a day you had both looked forward to and dreaded as it was the day you had to make the biggest decision of your life. For as long as you were able to understand the words, you were told that each third born child in your family was born genderless. Today you had to decide weather to start acting more feminine and become a girl or act more masculine and become a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you understood it, your frame of mind during your thirteenth year determined your gender. Until now, you had been acting somewhere in between to appease your older brother and sister who had been competing for a younger brother or sister for the past year. Now that you had to make a final decision, you knew that their rivalry over you was about to explode. \"It's going to be a very long day.\" you sighed, sitting onto your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a knock came to your bedroom door. You answered to find it was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I thought you taught me mostly everything.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, but your fashion sense is still all wrong. First off, those clothes don't show off any of your assets. If anything, they conceal your figure. There's also the fact that your not wearing a bra or panties. You don't want to hurt your chest or lower regions because your not wearing the proper clothing.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok ok, I get it. So what do you think I should wear?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" Rebecca got up from the bed and ran over to her wardrobe and closet. After a minute, she threw down some clothes on the bed. <br>\r\n\"Now go try these on. I won't watch, promise.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok...\" <br>\r\nYou really felt uncomfortable changing in front of your best friend, but you trusted her. She went on her bed and put her head under the covers. Quickly, you took your clothes off and put on the bra and panties she put on top. You looked over at her to make sure she wasn't looking. Of course, she wasn't. You proceeded to put on the rest of the clothing. <br>\r\n\"Ok, I'm done.\" She pulled her head out of the covers and sat up, looking at you. You were wearing a pair of ripped jeans and a black tank top. Compared to your old clothes, these clothes clung to your body more, showing all of your curves. You also felt a bit more comfortable wearing the bra, your chest less irritated by the clothing. Rebecca sat there, staring at you.<br>\r\n\"Wow, you look...Amazing.\" <br>\r\n\"Well you did pick out some nice clothes.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Now what to do?\"</span></div></div>",

If felt so natural.<br>\r\nThe next morning, you woke up and found Rebecca standing by her closet, changing. Your eyes widen and your gasp slightly at the sight of her in only her bra and panties. She looks over and see you're awake.<br>\r\n\"Oh morning. Sorry about this. I didn't think you would be awake.\" Your face turned to a bright shade of red.<br>\r\n\"It's...ok. This isn't weird, is it...?\"<br>\r\n\"No, not really. I mean, we are the same gender now. It's not weird for you, is it?\"<br>\r\n\"Not really. Just got to get used to it is all.\"<br>\r\n\"It's ok.

You followed Rebecca into the changing room and you both changed into swimsuits. Rebecca wore a two-piece swimsuit while you wore a one-piece she had lent you. You andRebecca headed out into the pool area and jumped in, Kyle no where in sight. You and Rebecca started swimming around a bit, waiting for Kyle to show up. You took this bit of time to get used to swimming with your new body. You found it much easier to swim due to your smaller and smoother body. After about 5 minutes, Kyle finally showed up. He jumped into the pool and splashed water all over you and Rebecca.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you messed up our hair!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh Rebecca, it's only a bit of water.\"<br>\r\n\"It's now funny, I spent so much time on it.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever.

To your shock, it was Tim and Teri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alex\" Tim started, his voice a bit shaky. \"So me and Teri have been talking and...\" he stopped. You looked as he tried to get his words and wondered what he was about to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to ask though, Teri chimed in. \"We've decided to put this rivalry between us to an end. No matter who you choose to be, we're both going here to support you, no matter what. This is <b>your</b> decision to make, not ours\" she said. She looked over to Tim. \"Tim, you have the box right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a simple nod and revealed a small black box from behind him. He handed it to you, and both looked at you as you peered at it curiously. \"Mom and dad gave this to us to give to you\" Tim said. You wondered for a moment before opening the box, revealing a plain looking pendent. You picked up the pendent and examined it closely. <i>Surely this is some kind of joke, right?</i> you thought to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeri spoke again. \"I know this pendent looks a bit...plain, but from what mom and dad have told us, it is quite special. As you know, every third child in our family goes through the same thing as you are now, having to choose a gender between your 13th and 14th birthday. For generations, this pendent has been given to these children on their 13th birthday, the last one being mom herself. She-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly interrupted. \"Wait wait wait. So you're telling me...mom was just like me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both nodded, this time Tim explaining. \"Yeah, surprising isn't it. This pendent was actually the same one she wears all the time. From what she told us, when you wear this pendent, it will allow you to experience whichever gender you want for four weeks, changing your body accordingly. After those four weeks, it will need to recharge for about five days. One year from now, on your 14th birthday, you will have to make the final decision, the pendent fully changing your body to whichever gender you choose. Does...that make sense?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the both of them, trying to fully understand everything they just told you. <i>So I can try both...</i> You nodded to them, their faces lighting up with relief. \"Thank you guys. Can I just...get some time to myself... to think all this over? I'll be down in a bit, ok?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. We'll be downstairs waiting\" they replied, waving off and heading downstairs, leaving you to ponder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking your time to take all of this in, you looked to the box again and slowly pull out the pendent and wrap it around your neck. You thought for a few moments, taking your time to decide what gender to start with. You soon made your decision and thought of hard, wanting to be....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
