You look up and down your street wondering when it will arrive. Then you see a red bus appear in the distances. When the bus stops in front of your house the door opens and a man in a black suit steps out holding an umbrella. \u201cGood Morning.\u201d the man says to you politely \u201cMay I help you with your bags?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes p-please.\u201d You reply shivering from standing in the rain. The man grabs a few of your bags and helps you on to the bus. \u201cJust hang your coat and take a seat.\u201d The man says as he places your bags in a storage compartment. You hang your dripping wet coat and you proceed towards the back of the bus. As you look around you start to see that this is no normal bus. The windows where blacked out so you couldn\u2019t out them, the lighting was very dim, and the seats where lined with red velvet. As you take your seat you see some other people that where on the bus. Some where reading books or playing game\u2019s wile others where lost in thought or sleeping against the window. You lay against the window listening to the sound of the rain outside. After waiting for about two hours you hear the rain stop and you feel the bus come the a stop. \u201cWe have arrived.\u201d The man calls out \u201cPlease get your coats and bags and step of the bus.\u201d After you got you bags you step off the bus and you are greeted by an amazing site. You see a huge Mansion that is bigger the you could ever imaged. Once you got in side you are standing in a massive foyer. Then Another Man in a black suit walk down the hall and stops in front of a table with a large book on it. \u201cGreeting guests and welcome the Pokemon Manor\u201d The man calls out \u201dIf I may please ask that every one would please sign there name in to our guest book.\u201d Then every one stood in a line as they each signed there name.

The man with the book looked at your small, lean countenance as you write the name \"Alex Connell\" on the sheet. The man picks up the guest book, looks at it, then looks at another sheet of paper. \"Perfect,\" he says after a few seconds. Then he says to the entire group, \"Follow me to the Great Room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what the Great Room was, but if he knows it, you do also. On the way, you note the size of the mansion. The elegant, golden ceilings were held high above the red carpeted floor, with doors the size of houses with bronze numbers on them. Walls featured art of a man holding Pokemon, the same man, different Pokemon every painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for about five minutes, without hearing a word from the mysterious man, you arrive in an enormous room large enough to hold six commercial airplanes, and among the most magnificent art and architecture in the world. Chandeliers covered the entire ceiling. The room was clashed with red, bronze, and gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the far end of the room was another man, a Charizard, and a red bowl on a glass table. There was also what looked like from a distance to be a map of the entire mansion. Chairs were seated around the table, inviting the guests to come and attend some sort of orientation. The man near the bowl began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon. My name is Andrew Majors, who was recently elected to be Head of the Pokemon Manor Staff after Master Sterling passed away. Before he died, he asked to have one last wish granted. He wanted a group of young people, Trainers, Breeders, anyone interested in Pokemon, to come to the mansion, and to give one a taste of its glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you have probably guessed, this event is his wish brought to life. We have invited 30 people of ages 11 to 17, who you sit among right now. You might have read in the letter that if you are worthy enough you will receive a prize fit for a king. We will not tell you the prize specifically at this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurmurs burst through the crowd. What prize? How can we be worthy? And what the heck is this place anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will first begin by randomly pairing you up with one of Master's Pokemon,\" Andrew continued. \"There are 30 people here today, so you will be with a Pokemon of a group of 30 for your entire stay, like it or no. If we notice that Pokemon has a disliking towards you, you will be escorted out of the manor. So please, try to get along. Let's start in alphabetical order, so that means Katie Armstrong will go first. Drake, draw a Pokemon from the bowl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish,\" the Charizard spoke as if he knew fluent English. 30 gasps came from the crowd. No Pokemon could speak a human language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake, the Charizard, flapped his wings and a piece of paper flew out of the bowl. Andrew Majors caught it and read it. \"'Venusaur',\" he read. \"Katie, you'll be paired up with Ivy in Room 15 during your stay. Please refer to the map for directions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small, 12 year old girl got up, dazed and confused. One would wonder if she was thinking if she could cope with such a monster or if it's a dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo boys were then paired up with different Pokemon. Sammy Bacon was roomed with a Raichu named Watt. Peter Burbank got a Flareon named Torch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, Alex Connell. Drake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake flapped his wings again, and the paper of which Andrew Majors will read reveals which Pokemon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(NOTE: If you are adding the Other chapter, try to make the choices powerful, but no legendaries. And they can't be the Pokemon already revealed.)</span></div></div>",

You'll be receiving one of Master's first and favorite Pokemon; Force the Gallade. He'll wait for you in Room 1. You should've saw the room on the walk over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake began to speak again. \"I should warn you, he can have a nasty temper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still scratching your head on how a Pokemon could speak English that fluently, but for now, you have to meet this Force that you have been assigned to. Speed-walking through the enormous corridors, you arrive at Room 1 near the entrance of the Manor, larger than life itself. The bronze doors were easily 30 feet tall, which made the knobs seem tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open a massive door to find the room completely dark. The door closed behind you. Nothing but pitch black everywhere. You take a step forward, hoping there's solid floor beneath it. Suddenly there was a flash of light, and the lights came on, revealing the room's glory. The same layout of the corridors were also presented here, only it was a bedroom covering half an acre of space. Besides the double-king size bed by the far end, it was completely empty. No Gallade inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you felt a sharp pain on your cheek, blinding you temporarily. Then you found yourself pinned to the ground by a tall, unknown figure. Everything was blurry from the pain. The figure seemed to speak, \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to grab the strength to say, \"Alex Connell. Who are you and what do you want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you were there, and was chosen, you would know,\" the figure spake, as if it were a riddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Force the Gallade. Now may I return to my senses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight pause, then the figure released you, and you began to restore your sight. Standing on your feet groggily, the figure spoke, \"Please excuse me. I've been cranky and paranoid ever since Master passed away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision cleared, and you began to see a Gallade clearly. This Gallade was different, however. Most humans are slightly taller than a normal Gallade; this one was more than eight feet tall, and looked as fierce as ever. Maybe that's why Master Sterling loved him so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gazed at your timid eyes, the bedhead, the pimpled face. Your gut, slimmer than the norm, along with your height. Your expression of fear mixed with depression. This he did for moments of silence. You decided to break it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... how can all of the Pokemon here talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe responded with a smirk, \"How does a Gallade become eight feet tall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touche.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both are classified,\" he answers. You weren't seeing a good bond just yet, maybe it's too early, maybe you're not good enough for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bronze doors opened again revealing the same man who led you to the Great Room. \"It is now time for the opening banquet,\" he said.</span></div></div>",

Once he knows you can keep yourself stable on the top of the Mansion, he realeses his grip and just walks away to the other side, across a more flatter area, and to an inclined ledge. You felt very embarressed but it was soon filled with flustered emotions, not only was this Charmeleon a trouble to you, he was inconsiderate too. You stand up and begin to waltz up to him before you notice his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis silloutte shown against the blazing moon, white all around him and next to him. He was big for a Charmeleon, at least half a foot taller than you and his tail flame, it wasn't the same color as you would expect, it was glowing white and slow, almost like strands of cloth in the wind. You all but forgot about scolding the Charmeleon because of his size, but then realize he did you a great favor in saving you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...thanks for saving me..i guess.\"He tilt his head still staring at the bright moon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it.\" He pats at the ledge right next to him wanting you to sight down. If not intimidated by his attitude, definately his size that scared you a bit. You sat next to the big fire lizard, noticing the warmth eminating from his body, you almost felt like leaning against him, but kept your distance to not make things too awkward. \"No really, don't mention this at all, you could get in trouble. And why didn't you just use the stairs?\" He pointed to a small door that had the words 'ROOFTOP' on them. You nearly face-palmed yourself, but instead focused your rage on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't YOU just come down to the room like you were supposed to.\" You stood up with as much bravado as you could slightly shaking. He just stared blankly at the moon. \"You hear my lizard?\" He nods slowly, an annoyed expression on his face. \"You could have stayed down there like the rest of them, but noooo, i had to nearly fall to my death to meet my host. You weren't thinking about me were you?\" Your about to shit your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOR!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimper and fall back down he just sits there with most 'i-don't-care-much' attitude ever. He sighs,then he looks to you. \"You think i didn't know i was supposed to be there? Be in my 'room' and great you happily with a 'OH WHAT JOY, WE'LL THE BESTEST OF FRIENDS FOREVER!' attitude?\" He held his hands together pretending to be a giddy little girl, but it was an act of mockery. \"I knew, and guess what i didn't want to do it! Cause lately no-ones been asking me what i want to do,i never ask for much anyway!\" You look back to his tail its dark-red, creating massive amounts of heat,he was raging. \"It's like i have to play along, well i don't want to and i won't...\" He crossed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were on the verge of pissing yourself, you had pissed him off good, but now the hard part was coming; how to respond. \"I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. No need to apologize, i'll probably apologize later.\" He hunched over resting his head on his hands, a pouty angry look on his face. He grumbled under his voice; \"This was the worst birthday ever..\" Birthday? It was his birthday? Now you felt like a complete dick. You hadn't realized that he must have been ignored all day, let alone no recognition of his most important day of the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt sorry for the Char and scooted over to him, gently placing a hand on his back. A loud growl rumbled from him making you twitch, but  you think quickly and gently start to rub his back. A small purr was heard, a little bit of whimper in it too. \"I'm sorry... i-i didn't realize you weren't being payed attention to, i know how it feels, i had six brothers, and im the youngest. I was always fighting for recognition. So, i apologize for misunderstanding you. I'll just leave now, leave you with your moon.\" You retract your hand and turn but his tail wraps around your legs \"Don't go.. that felt nice.\" He spoke in the direction of the moon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place your hand on his soft warm back again, it was so soothing. \"I guess... i guess i have been a little too harsh though.I'm not the most important person in the world.\" He sighs. \"Sorry for having an outburst.\" You just nod and keep rubbing, yawning while doing so. \"Well-\" he stood up and stretched \"Guess we better head inside.. hey i never got your name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were drowzy \"Oh me?\" You neraly collapsed but his tail kept you upright. \"My names Jack. Funny aint it?\" The charmeleon shrugged and put an arm over your shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets just use the stairs this time.\" You nod in agreement.

You thought it was just a coincidense that these two were abnormally large for their kind, but you soon figured out the connection. You were all too focused on the Charizards stern and strict face to notice that the Charmeleon was sort of shuffling in his stance.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \"Jack, curfew was an hour ago, and yet i see you're still keeping our guest up with your delinquent activities. I thought i raised you better.\" He slowly walked up to the two of you, even towering the Charmeleon. He stared at his son in disappointment and then two you with a more relaxed look. \"I'm sorry for my sons ill behavior, and for not introducing him to you myself, i should've known you wouldn't receive the normal introduction. He raised his head back up to its astonishing normal height. \"This is my son Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ugh.. here we go again.\" Jack sighed while frowning and crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The Charizard snarled at Jack making him twitch in the slightest, but barely noticed by you to fixated on this massive Charizards sermon. \"I was speaking son, it;s very rude to interrupt.\" He looked back to you. \"As i was saying, he is my son, but he is very special for his kind. You've probably noticed his tail and abnormal height, which was gained from me, but his tail is another story. Jack here, can be very mischevious or very calm and quiet. But mostly he loves his solitude, that is why you did not gain a proper greeting from him. I apologize for any inconvenience.\" You nodded not wanting to tell him that you partook in visiting the roof. \"By the way, where were you two? I did not see you in any of the halls... Jack?\" He looked at him with a more stern face than his usual, as like if he had known something already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The Charmeleon gulped a little. \"We.. we went outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Where outside exactly?\" He pressed his hands to his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Y'know just outside, nothing to far away.\" He bit his lip looking to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Jack, tell me the truth... i saw the rope.\" He pointed to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He sighed \"Okay dad... i went on the roof... for some fresh air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     His dad began to growl then started scolded him right from the growl. \"Son, how many times must i tell you not to climb up there, it's dangerous and you could easily fall. And tell me, did you let your guest climb the rope.\" He dropped his head and nodded. \"I am very disappointed in you, and to you Jack, it's not your fault that my son was being selfish and inconsiderate, therefore you went be penaliz-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"SELFISH AND INCONSIDERATE?\" Jack almost roared, but the shout was enough to wake a few people. Lights in the rooms gently light up. Some even slightly peeking their heads out to look at the commotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"JACK. Keep your tone down with me! I am our father and deserve respect, Now apologize for your rude behaviour!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"DAD!\" He almost let a tear fall, but held it back looking to his angry father, the one had forgotten the most. \"Do you know what day it is dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That has nothing to do with this, Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He wiped his eyes with his arm, tail fire blue and droopy. \"Dad, today was my birthday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The Charizard was about to shout again at his son, but stopped with his mouth open, his expression melted into one of surprise and regret. He soon felt like the worst father in the history of fathers. He looked at his son in remorse and tried to reply, \"Son I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"No.. dad, i understand. You were busy getting everything ready and preparing for the hosts.\" He slowly began to walk away past his dad, almost in a most solemn expression dragging his foot across the floor. \"But, you forgot the one thing i asked for all year. Your always busy, always everyone else, i admire that but you forgot the only thing i asked for: just to spend one quiet night with you, outside, under the stars.\" He looked back at his dad, hating to see his dad in this sort of pain, the expression on his face of pure agony and remorse. \"But i'm sorry too... i've been rude and i apologize for that.\" He walked to his doorway, all the others now shut with their lights off. \"At least the moon was there for me.\" He gently shut the door, a blue light eminating from beneath the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You stood there speechless, then looked to the only source of light now; his sad father. You had to do something so you spoke up.\"I'll cheer him up don't worry, i know you're feeling bad about forgetting.... but i'll get him to like you again, just you wait.\" You placed a hand onto the thigh of the Charizard and you could feel his more stronger warmth almost burning your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He looked to you in his defeated expression. It was so sad to see a pokemon of this size in such a terrible mood. \"I'm afraid the damage is already done. I should have remembered.\" But he stood up once again and looked to the room, almost with a new found hope, that hope in you. \"But, i know you get him into a better mood! Please, for my sake. I know i'm a terrible father for forgetting, but try to make him understand i'm sorry.\" He turned around. \"Now i must be off. I still some things to prepare.\" The orange dragon slowly walked off, his light fading, the only one now to be seen was Jacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You began to walk toward your room, hearing tiny conversations going on, some being terrible at hiding their communications because of some burly pokemon. You came up to the door and knocked gently. Jack replied with a depressing sounding: \"Come in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He was sniffling, wiping his snout, looking as if the waterworks had hit. You couldn't think of much to do, only one thing came to mind.</span></div></div>",

You were both become friends pretty quickly and when the two of you were interrupted, you were both quite upset that you had to stop talking. At the top of a large staircase, a large man in a black suit loudly cleared his throat to get everyone's attention and began to speak. \"Thank you all for coming! I greatly appreciate it. Our master would be pleased to know that strangers are so willing to help him to fulfill his last wish.\" There was a brief pause, and for you it felt very awkward. Thankfully, the man started to speak again. \"I assume that you are all familiar with the rules, so if you please make a neat line in front of the sign in table, and you shall receive a card.

The card was a simple shade of green with the number 117 printed on it with bold letters. \"Okay. So I either have room seventeen on the first floor or room one hundred seventeen somewhere in the house... please let it be on the first floor!\" He thought to himself. Finding his room did not turn out to be a simple task. There were no rooms in the area Drew was in, so he was forced to look for an area that had some. He wondered through various halls for a long time before even finding any rooms. When he finally did, he realized that the first room was 501. \"Oh my-! This is ridiculous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need assistance?\" I voice behind Drew asked. Turning around he saw before him a Pokemon; more specifically a Servine. \"Yes please! I've probably been wandering for an hour or so looking for rooms. I just found some but they're not even close to what I'm looking for.\" \"Alright buddy, calm down. Navigating this place is pretty tricky. Just follow me.\" Replied the Servine. After walking for a few moments, something finally struck a cord in Drew's brain. \"Wait a minute. Did you just talk? But I thought Pokemon can't talk.\" The Servine snickered. \"Anything is possible now with Science. There's a translation system in this house and it translates everything we say.\" Drew decided to just accept that answer. \"My name's Sever by the way. What's yours?\" \"Oh! Um, it's Andrew. But just call me Drew, I'd prefer that.\" The rest of the trip was generally silent accept the occasional Pokemon would walk by and Sever would greet them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here we are. Room 117.\" Sever said upon arriving at the room. He opened the door for Drew. \"Come on in.\" \"Thank you!\" Drew replied, relieved to finally be at his room. His luggage was already laying on his bed. It was open and completely empty. \"What happened to my stuff!?\" Drew asked concerned. \"Oh I put away for you. You took so long to get here I thought I'd help you unpack and I ended up doing the whole thing.\" Sever replied. \"What do you mean by that?\" Sever sighed, \"You gotta learn to figure things out. I'm to be you humble host for your, hopefully, long stay at the manor.\" He said with a little bow. \"You'll take a little work, but I believe we'll be able to get a long very well.\"</span></div></div>",

Being perhaps the youngest guest here, you had never really ventured so far from your parents before, especially not for three whole weeks. They hadn\u2019t even been certain about letting you stay here until they heard that the famous Matthew Sterling was hosting the event. They only ended up sending you in the hopes that the eccentric billionaire was planning to, for some reason, grant you some of his inheritance and make your family rich beyond their wildest dreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, had a different motivation for coming here. Your parents weren\u2019t big fans of Pokemon, and never allowed you to own one of your own. You\u2019ve only been able to see them from a distance, or watch shows about them on television. Your eyes sparkled at the idea that maybe, just maybe, you would be given a Pokemon that was bred by Sterling himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cLadies and gentleman!\u201d</b></span> The posh old man tapped on the wooden floor with a fancy cane, drawing the crowd\u2019s attention back to him. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cAs you may have heard, master Sterling possessed the most prestigious and pedigreed collection of Pokemon in all the known regions.\u201d</b></span> He gestured to the portrait on the wall, which portrayed Sterling surrounded by every Pokemon you could imagine. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cIn his waning days, he said that only those with a special gift can care for his great fortune\u2026\u201d</b></span> He pointed to the crowd dramatically. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cIndeed, he said that he was certain that gift is within one of you!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited and confused murmurs ran through the crowd. Somebody here had Sterling\u2019s natural talent with Pokemon? The guests all seemed so mundane, it was hard to believe that was possible! The man waited for the crowd to calm down somewhat before continuing. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cNow, in the coming weeks, you will be given ample opportunity to prove you\u2019re the one who possesses that gift. If you do, all of Sterling\u2019s assets will be placed under your ownership\u2026\u201d</b></span> The crowd practically cheered in excitement. One of you was going to given Sterling\u2019s entire fortune? You\u2019d be the richest person in the region! The man chuckled at the sight. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cDinner will be at six. There, the details of this challenge will be explained. In the meantime, you\u2019ll want to meet the Pokemon that have been so gracious as to host you. Please, step forward to be assigned a room.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the crowd excitedly stormed forward all at once, eager for a chance at Sterling\u2019s seemingly endless fortune. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cForm a line, please! Patience, patience!\u201d</b></span> The old man commanded, and the guests sheepishly formed a line before the desk. One by one, they were handed a colorful card and disappeared down a nearby hallway, eager to meet their new companions. You tried to act natural as you waited in line, even though you were bursting with excitement. What Pokemon were you going to be assigned? Maybe a big, intimidating Charizard! Or perhaps an adorable little Eevee!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you made your way to the front of the line.

You immediately rushed down the hall, following the other guests, searching for the room you\u2019d been assigned. Finally, you were standing right in front of it. Room 120. You sigh, taking a deep breath to calm your nerves. Somehow, you knew that this was the first day of the rest of your life. With that thought, you reached forward and knocked on the door\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to realize it was already slightly ajar. You felt a little embarrassed when your gentle knock caused the door to just swing open. Still, you peeked curiously into the room. It looked sort of like a studio apartment, but without a bed, or a fridge, or any human amenities whatsoever, really. You only noticed a big Pokemon bed in the corner. <b>\u201cHello?\u201d</b> You gently called, and heard rummaging from within as a pair of paws tapped softly along the floor. What came walking \u2018round the corner had to be seen to be believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to be some kind of ninetales, but\u2026 blue? It was hard to even explain it. Rather than the straight fur you\u2019d expect from a ninetales, her fur was incredibly curvy, and her paws, tails and \u2018mane\u2019 ended with snow white tips. She was obviously well groomed; her hair and tails almost seemed to defy the laws of physics, remaining perfectly in place as she walked over to you. You had read a lot about Pokemon, but you\u2019ve never seen nor heard of anything like her. The biggest surprise, however, came the moment she opened her mouth. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cAh, well if it isn\u2019t my humble guest! I\u2019ll be honest, I was expecting\u2026 <i>more</i>.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYou can talk?\u201d</b> You gasped. You had heard of talking Pokemon, but you weren\u2019t sure if it was even possible. It was a shocking sight, to say the least. Something about hearing such a posh, aristocratic voice come from the mouth of a Pokemon was just\u2026 uncanny. It sort of freaked you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cWell, you haven\u2019t done much research, have you?\u201d</b></span> The weird, blue ninetales said, rolling her eyes. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cOf course I can talk.

You can\u2019t tell me what to do,\u201d</b> you said, a little bit offended by the demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b> \u201cUh, actually, I <i>can</i>,\u201d</b></span> she replies. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cUnless you <i>want</i> me to speak with the headmaster and have you escorted off the premises.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks. If you\u2019re kicked out of the manor, you\u2019d never have a shot at Sterling\u2019s fortune. <b>\u201cYou can <i>do</i> that?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cTry me.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate, before sighing. Best not to take any chances. <b>\u201cUgh. Alright,\u201d</b> you comply, slipping your jacket off and tossing it aside. You gestured to your jeans and t-shirt. <b>\u201cIs this outfit fine at least, your majesty?\u201d</b> You ask sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places a paw on her chin as she stares at your outfit, as if pondering. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cHmm\u2026 well, it\u2019s a start. But in my professional opinion, I\u2019d say you\u2019re due for a complete wardrobe change.

In the meantime, we shall go over your responsibilities.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow her, checking out the apartment. <b>\u201c\u2018Responsibilities\u2019?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cMhmm. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve written up a schedule so you don\u2019t forget,\u201d</b></span> she said, pulling a clipboard down from the nearest table. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cLet\u2019s see here.

After that\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa!\u201d</b> You interrupted her, holding up your hands. You were fine with taking off your jacket, since she is your host and all, but these \u2018responsibilities\u2019 were far too much to expect from <i>anybody</i>, much less a guest! She was your host, not your master! <b>\u201cSorry to burst your bubble, lady, but I\u2019m not going to do any of that stuff!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks a bit surprised by your outburst, before glaring. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cYou really don\u2019t get it, do you?\u201d</b></span> She says, her voice a mixture of anger and amusement, though she tries to maintain a ladylike persona. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cYou are my guest, which means that if you don\u2019t make me happy, I can have you kicked out. So if you want any chance of getting Sterling\u2019s fortune, I suggest you do as I say.\u201d</b></span> She turns away, flicking her tails in your direction indignantly. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cAnd no back-talk, you hear? A lady like myself doesn\u2019t have time for your tomfoolery.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she stomps off, leaving you swelling with emotions. Apparently, your chances of your dreams coming true were all in the hands of a single, narcissistic, weird-looking ninetales. You weren\u2019t sure whether to laugh or cry. All you knew for sure was that this was going to be a lot more difficult than you were expecting... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend some time getting your stuff unpacked while she busily grooms herself in preparation for dinnertime.

If he was, why would he ever keep a Pokemon as insufferable as her? You\u2019d only been around for a few minutes, and she was already bossing you around, making you do this or that while acting like she was so much better than you. She was obsessed with her appearance, too, always sitting in front of that mirror of hers, grooming her fur with almost obsessive dedication. By the time dinner rolled around, you\u2019d only been hanging out with her for a couple hours, and already you were at your wit\u2019s end. How could you stand three weeks of this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you didn\u2019t have to bring Adelia along you with you to dinner today. For some reason, this feast was humans-only. As you shuffled into the dining room, you noticed all the other guests looked just as miserable and exhausted. The food looked delicious, at least, no doubt prepared by some of the top chefs in the region. As you sat there, licking your lips hungrily, you were interrupted by the man from before walking up onto the stage on the end of the room. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cLadies and gentlemen. Before you begin eating, I would like to go over the more pressing details of your stay here,\u201d</b></span> he says solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room goes deathly silent as he clears his throat, preparing to make his announcements. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cAs you have probably noticed, Sterling has specifically assigned you Pokemon that are the direct opposite of you in terms of personality,\u201d</b></span> he explains, and the audience quietly gasps as they suddenly understand the situation. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cIf you are confident, you were given a host that is anxious and paranoid. If you are shy, your host is judgemental and narcissistic. If you avoid confrontation, your host is relentlessly aggressive, and so on.\u201d</b></span> He glances sternly up over his glasses. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cMake no mistake; this is by design.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cYou see, Sterling convened with Mesprit itself in order to identify you all as candidates for his fortune. He knows your personalities in detail, and knows exactly what challenges will push you to your limits,\u201d</b></span> he said, gesturing to another portrait behind him \u2014 this one portraying mesprit. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already heard, there are two ways to be disqualified from ever obtaining Sterling\u2019s fortune. The first is to leave the premises, under any circumstances. The second occurs if your host comes to me and requests you be removed from their room.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few worried murmurs around the table. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cThat may sound concerning, but know this; you are all on an even playing field. All of your hosts will be equally difficult for you to appease. Whether you make it through these three weeks depends on your ability to improvise and deal with the challenges that may be presented by your host,\u201d</b></span> he reassures you all. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cIf you truly have the gift, you will make it to the end of the competition. Mark my words.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glances down at the paper he was holding in his hands. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cNow, onto the final bit of information. Every three days, you will faced with a challenge that will force you and your host to cooperate,\u201d</b></span> he explains. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cYou will not receive a reward for completing these challenges successfully. However, your host will. Thus, if you fail a challenge, your host will probably be very, very upset.\u201d</b></span> He looks up, glancing at every person at the table, one by one. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI would recommend you not fail any challenges.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cAlright, that should be the end of it. Please, enjoy your meal.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked off stage, leaving the guests to silently start chowing down on your meals as you consider what he\u2019s told you. You all had one thought on your mind \u2014 how were you possibly supposed to win this? You had no idea how to take care of Pokemon, especially one specifically chosen to be as difficult as possible. You shuddered as you realized you might not have the \u2018gift\u2019 at all. After all, only one person here could have the gift, and most of the guests looked a lot older and more experienced than you did. Were you hopelessly out of your league?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, you stumbled back to your room feeling drained and demoralized. Seeing Adelia\u2019s smug face greeting you as you walked in certainly didn\u2019t help. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cAh! There you are. I\u2019ve been wondering what\u2019s been taking you so long,\u201d</b></span> she smiled, sitting in front of that same mirror again. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cCould you be a dear and help me with my nails? I have places to be, so hop to it, now!\u201d</b></span> You sigh as you sit down in front of her, grabbing the nail trimmers. Indeed, these three weeks were definitely going to be harder than you expected...</span></div></div>",

To be honest, part of you thinks she\u2019s just toying with you; seeing how far she can push you before you give up. Well, if this is just the beginning, you shudder to imagine what she\u2019ll have you do as the month drags on. Eventually, you return to her room, your scheduled list of chores for the day finally completed.

You wonder lackadaisically out into the lobby, dedicated to putting as little effort into this task as you possibly can. Sure enough, the man from before was at the desk, apparently in the process of wrapping things up. \u201cIs there a, uh, Jonah around here?\u201d He gives you an indiscernible look, before seemingly buzzing someone on his laptop. A few moments later, a smeargle suddenly pops out from a nearby hallway! <b>\u201cWhoa!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWell, don\u2019t you look like a bright young lad?\u201d</b></span> He talks quickly, grabbing you by the hand and leading you down the hall. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYou <i>must</i> be bright \u2014 you\u2019ve chosen the <i>greatest</i> stylist in the region!

Were all the Pokemon around here complete narcissists?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped into the smeargle\u2019s room, only to find the living area has been repurposed into a surprisingly fancy barber shop. There was a big, leather chair and everything. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cNow, I must admit, being the resident couffier of the Pokemon manor, I mostly have experience dealing with, well, <i>fur</i>,\u201d</b></span> he smiles, gesturing to the chair, <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cbut I\u2019m more than confident I can tame that \u2018do of yours.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh, thanks,\u201d</b> you say as you take a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYou know, there\u2019s been humans roaming around the manor all day, with their hair mangy and unkempt, just begging for my skill and finesse\u2026 but you\u2019re the first to come to me!\u201d</b></span> He says as he wraps a cape around your body. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cMay I ask how you heard of me?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAdelia sent me,\u201d</b> you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAh, Adelia!

You can do this\u2026\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the rest of the morning keeping up with Adriana\u2019s rigid standards of hygiene, and doing random chores for the egotistical vulpine. You spent an entire hour grooming and washing her fur all while she constantly complained that you \u2018weren't doing it right\u2019, which felt like the longest hour of your life. By the time you were taking Adriana on one of her scheduled walks around the manor, you were completely exhausted\u2026 and the day was only halfway over. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t want your stay here to be all bad. I am a gracious host after all,\u201d</b></span> she said over her shoulder while you walked. She almost sounded a little guilty. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cTell me. What sort of thing do you like to do in your free time?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh\u2026 I like reading, I guess,\u201d</b> you shrug, not really putting much stock into her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cThe manor has a fabulous library,\u201d</b></span> she notes nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cDoes it?\u201d</b> You raise a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cOh, yes. All the greatest literature by and for Pokemon,\u201d</b></span> she smiles pridefully at you, suddenly turning and heading down a different direction. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cHumans are allowed too, of course. Come, let me show you to it.\u201d</b></span> You stand there for a moment, confused, but ultimately decide that a trip to the library would be a nice reprieve from constantly pampering the vixen. You reluctantly followed her through some double doors, only to stumble into one of the most illustrious libraries you\u2019ve ever seen. Thousands of books were arranged perfectly in huge, ornate shelves, dozens of Pokemon of all shapes in sizes enjoying them freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhoa...\u201d</b> You gasped, staring in awe at the room. <b>\u201cThis library is\u2026 amazing. How big is this manor, anyway?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cLarger than you could imagine,\u201d</b></span> she smiles. It occurs to you that if you win this \u2018competition\u2019, all of this will be yours. You couldn\u2019t even imagine this level of wealth and opulence. All you had to do was avoid angering the ninetales for a month. Easy, right? <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cGo ahead. Pick out something you like.\u201d</b></span> With her permission, you eagerly rushed towards the nearest shelf, quietly looking over the selection. Almost immediately, you found a fiction book that seemed interesting, and you sat down to lose yourself in its vivid storyline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the ninetales pulls out a self-help book of some kind, dons some reading glasses, and sits down beside you. It was actually rather nice. You were so used to Adriana being so active and up-tight all the time, it was a pleasant change of pace to just snuggle up with the vixen and enjoy a nice book. Of course, such relaxation was not meant to last. Adriana tenses up visibly when someone new enters the library; a strange-looking arcanine, covered in bows, a miserable-looking human trailing along behind her. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cOh!\u201d</b></span> Adriana whispered, panic in her voice. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cVincent, I\u2026 think we might have to leave.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</b> You ask her. Judging from the way the other Pokemon treat her, the arcanine seems to be popular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cThat arcanine and I\u2026 we aren\u2019t on good terms,\u201d</b></span> she says, forcibly tugging you out of your seat and draggin you towards the door. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cSeriously, I-\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns around, only to realize she was standing face-to-face with the arcanine herself! She gulped as she looked up at the massive canine, who smiled down on here, showing a huge maw full of long, jagged teeth. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWell, well, well! If it isn\u2019t the world's ugliest runt,\u201d</b></span> the arcanine taunted, <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cand it looks like she brought her manservant with her.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdriana immediately tried to slip past her. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cC-come on, Vincent, let\u2019s get going...\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arcanine steps in front of the entrance, blocking Adriana\u2019s only route of escape. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cYou know the only reason he puts up with you is because he <i>has</i> to, right?\u201d</b></span> She taunts, her voice tinged with cruelty. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOnce he finally gives up and bails on you, you\u2019ll be all alone again.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cI-I\u2019m not alone, Vivica,\u201d</b></span> the ninetales insists resolutely, though her voice quivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOh yeah? When\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve had a friend that you didn\u2019t have to pay to keep around?\u201d</b></span> The sadistic arcanine laughed. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cNobody likes you because everyone knows; all you think about is your looks. And the worst part is, you don\u2019t even <i>look</i> good! Not even half as gorgeous as I am, for sure, runt.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Why are you calling her a runt?\"</b> You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\"Oh, you haven't heard? Adriana was the runt of her litter... the ugly duckling, you could say,\"</b></span> the arcanine laughed, <span class=\"corange\"><b>\"and they hated her for it! Even her own family doesn't even like her! It'd almost be pathetic, if it wasn't so hilarious.\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately stepped forward. Sure, the ninetales was annoying\u2026 but this was too much! <b>\u201cHey! What\u2019s your problem?\u201d</b> You ask angrily. <b>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything to you, so step off.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to you, and you shrink away beneath her intimidating gaze. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOh? Trying to look impressive in front of your \u2018master\u2019, here, huh?\u201d</b></span> She starts. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI mean, with a haircut like that, you-\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the arcanine says that, Adriana suddenly stomps her foot, looking positively furious all of a sudden. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201c... Vivica, if you know what\u2019s good for you. <i>Leave. Him. Alone,</i>\u201d</b></span> she stares assertively up at the canine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the arcanine simply guffaws. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOr what?\u201d</b></span> She smirks. Your heart skips a beat as, without hesitation, the ninetales lifts a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><i>Smack!</i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp when Adriana suddenly slaps the arcanine across the face! Even the arcanine looked stunned, the slap leaving a sizeable welt on her cheek. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cDid\u2026 did you just\u2026?\u201d</b></span> She whispers, as if in disbelief that anyone would be so daring. Eventually, fury overcomes her. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOh, you\u2019re <i>dogfood</i>, runt!\u201d</b></span> She rushes forward, her maw open, ready to swallow the ninetales in a single gulp\u2026 but Adriana dodges out of the way just in time, and shoots an Ice Beam straight into the canine\u2019s side! <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cAgh!\u201d</b></span> She roars, turning around and snapping at the vixen. Adriana was able to dodge the arcanine\u2019s attacks, but didn\u2019t seem capable of doing much damage herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in horror as the two started fighting in earnest. You\u2019ve never been part of a Pokemon battle before! You didn\u2019t know what you were supposed to be doing! Should you be giving commands, or breaking them up, or\u2026 or\u2026? You glance around at the other Pokemon in the library, but they all seem completely nonplussed by the fight, acting as if this was a daily occurence. <span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cUgh! Could you keep it down? This is a library, you know,\u201d</b></span> one leafeon yelled, as if the massive Pokemon battle occurring in front of her was simply an inconvenience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could run out and get help. Surely, the man at the front desk would break this fight up. On the other hand, he might take too long to get here. You could try to break them up yourself, though that would put you directly in harm\u2019s way. The last option you could think of was to start giving the ninetales commands directly, like a real Pokemon trainer would do. You knew a few things about type advantages. Maybe you could lead Adriana to victory. It was an insane idea, but it just might work...</span></div></div>",

Before making it across, you look back at the matted ledge you dove from.

You remembered that he was a fire type, so it was only natural of him to dislike water. Stopping your swimming strokes, you hold your arms up, calling to the Quilava, \"Candle, you have to jump!\" He responded with nervous shake of his head. You yelled again, \"Do you want me to leave? I'll catch you, but you have to jump!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandle braced himself as he took a few steps back. He sprinted forward, flying over the edge above you. He hurtled down to your open arms, however he accidentally lands on top of your head instead! Your face was forcefully dunked underwater, while the Quilava atop you scrambled in distress, kicking and stomping on your head that remained floating above the surface. You burst from the surfacing, taking a huge breath in. Candle panicked and clung his forepaws around your neck, grasping it tightly. Ignoring the pain, you swim the rest of the way, arriving at the coastal finish line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandle hops off your shoulders as he shakes and wiggles any water from his thin fur. It splattered at you, while you return the favor by whipping your long drenched hair back at the pokemon. He chuckled as both of collected complementary towels, drying off the freezing water from your bodies. Drake congratulates the two of you, \"Well done, to the both of you! That was quite the close call there at the end. Let's hope that didn't cost you the round!\" Before long, everyone had finished the course and headed directly to the scoreboard, watching their time rankings. You and Candle made seventh place!

Surprised by the act, he was flipped onto his back, as you began to dry off the spots he couldn't reach. You rubbed his underbelly and brushed off his paws of the pool water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no clue how your master gave you baths if you hate water this much.\" You suggested to the Quilava as he cuddled into the white towel. He replied with snickering grin, \"It was a 'grow-on' kind of taste. I prefer hot water any day than the useless frigid kind.\" You smiled and headed towards the Manor, with Candle walking directly by your side, wagging his tiny tail with pride. Suddenly, there was someone standing in front of you!</span></div></div>",

Sorry about that, I wasn't watching where I was going.\" You said as you brushed the hair from you face.

I'm pretty sure it was an accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, are the two of you okay?\" A male Floatzel asked as he helped the boy, (Donald), back up to a full stand. The fox raised a fore-paw to you, as you grabbed it to heave you off the ground. You answered the Floatzel, \"Yeah, I doubt anything's broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Floatzel continued holding your hand, shaking it once to say, \"I'm Jet, and this is my guest Donald.\" He looked down to see Candle slightly hidden behind you. \"I see that you've been paired with Candle...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm Amber.\" You replied. \"And like I said, I'm really sorry about bumping into your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about it.\" Donald answered happily. \"So how are you and your host holding up in the manor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes, \"This place is too big that I think I'm running through a Maze. My first impression with Candle wasn't exactly...friendly.

I can't imagine what it would be like to move out so suddenly in the competition, and I would hate abandoning Jet here. We've actually become really good friends in just the second day.\" Jet smirked at Donald as he continued, \"Hey, I was going to get Jet to show me more of the manor.

He poked his head up to ask, \"So are you taking a nap to rest or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, I'm taking a shower and drying my hair afterwards. It's all frazzled thanks to that pool water.

We were about to go to the Dining Hall together until he ran off before I could leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake clapped his hands together, \"Ah, yes, Candle. He's quite the frequent consumer. I swear that little Quilava has the metabolism of a dinosaur because of his lean size. I'm surprised he isn't fatter than a Snorlax by now! Please, allow me to escort you to the Dining Hall.\" The Charizard lifted an arm up for you to hook around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back and answer, \"You're a life saver. I was sure that I would die walking through these halls.\" You locked arms with dragon while led you down the manor maze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe broke the silence between the two of you by asking, \"I'm still trying to remember names and faces.

Continue playing your cards right and bond close with Candle, you'll be the headmaster of this manor in no time. Ah, here we are.\" Drake unexpectedly stopped, halting you from continuing any further. You arrived within the Dining Hall.

You loosened up in relief as you turned to Drake. \"Thank you again for showing me the way. I wish we could talk longer, but I have a little fire weasel to go punish.\" You say with a sly grin. The Charizard responds with a single huff of laughter, reflecting a similar smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the large dragon embraces you into a hug, clutching your body into his scaly pudge. \"You are always welcome, Amber! Good luck in the contest, and I hope to see both you and Candle progress in through your troubles.\" And with that, the Charizard abandoned you and padded over to other guests within the room, attending and conversing with them of any topic given about. You make your way to Candle, who in turn, continued to devour the plate of assorted sliced berries in front of him. You approach him from behind, placing one hand on your hip and the other to reach for the scruff of his neck. The Quilava winced at the sudden touch, as you lifted and turned him around, forcing the dangling pokemon to face you directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cheeks were bloated with chewed up berries while his eyes widened with fear, igniting his flame-tail even brighter. Candle swallowed heavily during his small struggles in the air as he spoke out, \"...Oh, uh, h-hey Amber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scowled at him as you raise a brow, answering, \"What part of, '<i>We'll leave together after I get out of the bathroom</i>' did you not understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on! You were taking forever in there! What's with it and human girls to procrastinate in the restrooms to pamper up. My stomach was growling louder than your hair dryer! I needed food ASAP, so just let me down now, okay?\" He begged. His hindpaws wiggled to try and reach for his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you just expect me to magically find my way here? I think I'll take you back to that pool and drop you into the frigid cold water again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Candle ceased his constant writhing, fixating his glare on you. \"I don't think you will. After all, I <i>am</i> your host. You wouldn't try to do anything to make me unhappy, would you? I noticed Drake is around this room, so I doubt you would want me to make a scene unless you want to pack your bags and leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clenched his neck tighter, \"You wouldn't dare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe curled a long smile along his round muzzle, glaring out his fangs as he dared, \"Try me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou angrily grumble and drop him back onto to his seat. He scolds back at you for the sudden impact, however, he flips back to smiling as he munches down the last of his meal.

What a shameful life to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Quilava growled in return as he hissed back, \"Don't listen to her, Amber.

I meant in no way any disrespect.\" Candle was clearly right. This Swampert was in fact a jerk, but she could insult him to get a rouse of him, yet Candle let her harsh words get to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Mira! You're one to talk since you eat way more than I do. All your care about his filling up your stomach and feeling better than everyone else.\" The Quilava sneered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira sucked her fingers that were slathered in chocolate icing from her recent pastry as she patted her somewhat chubby white belly. \"Don't be so hasty Candle. The reason I have to eat so much is because I need the energy for the pokemon battles I enter. I've defeated every pokemon at least once within this manor at one point or another, and I've certainly beaten <i>you</i> way too many times for me to count. So, in a way, I am better than everyone else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Candle growled loudly.

You couldn't help but worry for the Quilava in his abuse. He was so easily succumbed by Mira's pestering bullying that he lost any regards to you or his happiness. This battle could easily be avoided, but Candle was certain on proving himself.

She, Candle, you, and a small group of bystanders had walked out of the manor and into a large field next to the estate for the battle. Mira had already taken her position amongst the yard, as Candle waddled over to his spot, facing the cocky Swampert as he glared at her in displeasure. You were left at the sidelines along with other guests and pokemon to watch the conflict unfold. Her grin never vanished, while the Swampert crouched down in a fighting position. Candle dug a paw into ground, readying himself to charge the chubby water-type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips before calling out, \"Make your move, <i>runt</i>. I haven't got all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Quilava growled back, instantaneously bolting forward to pounce his opponent. As Candle gains momentum towards Mira, you clench you fist firmly far off, staring ahead and wondering what the outcome would be. Candle was a low experienced fire-type facing off against strong looking water-type, therefore the odds weren't on his side. Mira seemed to have plenty of confidence in defeating Candle, just sitting and waiting for Candle make his move. The Quilava was just a few meters off as he breathed out a scorching stream of fire, releasing the flames at Mira. The Swampert merely hopped out of the way and ejected water from her mouth, extinguishing the flamethrower and striking Candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Quilava howled as he was launched back against the ground. Mira smiled while diving forward, aqua jetting towards the downed Quilava to knock him into the air again. Spinning through the air, Candle gags out as a ray of water shoots him again to keep his frail body up. Each and every time Candle was about to plummet to the ground, Mira would squirt a water gun from her mouth juggle the Quilava about, humiliating him. You cupped a hand over your mouth, begging the fight to just end already, however other watchers began to snicker and joke at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandle squirmed about in the sky, whining as Mira would dash to a different spot along the ground to shoot him at the needed angle. She laughed as she tortured the poor fire-type and never gave him enough recovery time. He squealed each time the cold water hit him, wriggling his drenched body in midair as he cried out, \"...S-S-Stop it Mira! I mean i-it!\" Mira grinned devilishly, halting her attacks. Candle cried out in pain once hitting the ground with a wet splat. He sprawled on the grass in a massive puddle. His furry body was slick with with water as his tail flame had been quenched through the entire onslaught of water. He panted helplessly as he endeavored to stand back up. Just then, a Swampert's foot pressed against his face, plopping him back against the ground. Mira slid her foot down against his chest to exert pressure down on his weakened form,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe choked from his squeezing lungs as Mira chuckled out, \"How long will this charade last, Candle? Every time you want to pick and fight with me and every time it ends like this. Do you think you're getting stronger by losing over and over again? You're pathetic. I don't know why Master Matthew kept you around this Manor at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered her face closer to his, whispering a snide remark...</span></div></div>",

A drop of from salivating jaws dripped onto the Quilava's face, striking even more terror in him. She continued, \"You interrupted my snack time in the Dining Hall to have this stupid battle, so I think I'll be satisfying my hunger with that little fuzzy body of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandle squirmed and thrashed with all of his might, but the weight of Mira's leg pinned him down. She chuckled and clutched her hands against his sides, lifting the exhausted Quilava up to eye level. She lapped her thick tongue, dragging the fleshy lump across Candle's face to leave a line of saliva to smear his face in. She murred at his taste while Candle continued his effortless struggles. Mira opened her mouth to let her meal stare down the long slimy tunnel that awaited him. Candle was pushed in face first, having his entire head stuffed into her drooling maw. He grunted and made muffled cries, but no one came to his rescue. Not even you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too busy having your hands placed over your face, expecting Mira to literally eat Candle in mutilation. Some of the other guests and pokemon began to laugh at the sight of a Quilava wobbling around like worm as he stuck out from a Swampert's mouth. You lifted your head up to see Candle slip deeper into Mira's throat, wiggling around as his devoured head bulged out of her neck to sound out suppressed sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira's fat tongue brushed under furry Candle's underside, licking his chest and belly to tickle the Quilava in his descent. His struggles were dying down to mere twitches, and Mira knew he had already exhausted himself. Now with an easy meal, the Swampert lifted her head up, closing her mouth after a pair of Quilava hindpaws disappear between her lips. Now with bloated cheeks, she throbs her tongue over the paws, forcing more wiggles from Candle's body in sensitive reflexes. With a final gulp, Candle was swallowed down the tight confines of Mira's slimy esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid into an opening which plopped into a fleshy sac, dripping with gooey saliva. The wet hot walls constricted the Quilava to curl up inside the small organ, squeezing him until he remained trapped inside. He whimpered as he kicked at the stomach walls, yelling out, \"...Ergh! Let me out Mira! This isn't funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira listened to his plea in a muffled tone, unable to comprehend what he was yelling. \"What's that runt? I can't exactly hear you in there? But if you're open for discussion, I have to let you know how delicious you taste! A little spicy for a fire-type, but that little fuzzy meaty body of your works wonders in filling my belly up! I should've eaten you the first time I beat you.\" She pressed her hands around her white belly, stroking it round edges and sloshing it about to torture Candle inside. She poked her fingers into her froggy flesh, feeling every little squirm Candle gave off. She belched out loud as she continued to rub her sagging gut. </span></div></div>",

She spat out a Quilava drenched in saliva to splat the grassy surface of the ground and wiped her arm across her chin to clear up any spilt drops. Candle shivered violently from the sudden cold air of the outside world than of the hot and wet surroundings of Mira's stomach. He could barely manage to stand, too weak and disturbed by what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneel down and open your arms to hug the poor fire-type, yet he doesn't even look at you. Quickly, he dashes away from your gesture, heading off into the direction of the Manor rapidly but almost slips from the puddles of Mira's saliva seeping from his body. The Swampert chuckles and waves off to the retreating Quilava, calling out, \"Hee hee! Come find me when you want to lose and get eaten again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare an evil eye towards her sneer, and Mira immediately realizes her actions. She attempts to pass it off, \"Oh come now deary, how is it my fault if he wants to fight me? I tried to stop him but he was simply too eager! He had this coming to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even bother arguing and urge yourself to find Candle. <i>Again</i>. This would become the second time he's ran off, and you really doubted Drake could save you a second time wandering the Manor's chasm.</span></div></div>",

Candle sprints on all fours towards an iron barred grate indented into a grass hill below the manor estate, hopping between the metal rods to enter what looked like some kind of dark and black-bricked sewer system or an underground portion for the manor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yell out Candle's name for him to come back, but the Quilava merely disappeared into the pitch black shadows of the tunnel. Running over to the grate, you lace your hands against it, trying to joggle it to see if it'd move out of the way as you peer into the darkness. The brick walls were damp with water, and an eerie moan of the wind whisks along its edges to rumble some that send you shivering at the cold a bit. Of all places, Candle <i>had</i> to hide in this chasm of death. Stressing your hands powerfully at the gate, you groan as your arms feel like they're going to rip off but at last the gate actually budges for you. With the barred doorway slightly open, you slide through and trek through the damp tunnels in search of Candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was frigid, almost impossible to see, and above all ominous inside this place. There were constant turns and passages that it seemed like it was meant to keep travelers inside forever, like an evil maze. You cross your arms and hold them against yourself within the cold air, calling out for your Pokemon more. There were no generous answers. Not even Candle's soft whines could be heard anymore. Only your echoes were all that you heard. Looking back, you take note that you didn't remember your way back either, seeming like you'd either starve or freeze inside of this place until...</span></div></div>",

Heheh...\" Another young man walked into the room to greet his friend as the two of them fist bumped, with a red letter in his left hand. \"Hey, just came back from work and found this letter in the mail.\" Mr. anchorman stood up with excitement twinkling in his eyes, saying \"Ooh, it's red!\" \"And you know what that means, right Travis?\" Travis jumped into the air and suddenly looked like his friend, but younger in age and in more ideal clothing. \"It means it's uncommon mail, Rod!\" Rod smiled and showed Travis the mail, already opened and exquisitely red accompanied with gold shining font. \"Wow! Why are you always the lucky one? I mean, going to a mansion? That's huge!\" However, instead of replying with a usual \"I know, right,\" Rod handed Travis the letter, it's weight surprisingly greater than that of regular postage. \"Uh, Rod... You <i>are</i> gonna go there, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRod shook his head and sat down on the couch, sighing and crossing his arms. \"Well, it's just that... there's this thing I call a job, y'know, and... business over interest, I suppose. Oh, and I haven't been around long enough to get vacation time, either.\" Travis shined purple again, and this time he reverted to his original form, a Zoroark. \"Come on, man. You can't just let this slide...\" Rod looked up at Travis and smiled again, giving him a thumbs up. \"Don't worry, dude. You can go there and tell me all about it when you come back.\" Travis stepped backwards, exclaiming \"This seems a bit more fitting for an actual human! Come on!\" \"Don't worry, Travis. Besides, how long have we known each other? How long have you been living like a human yourself?\" Actually, the two of them have been more like brothers if anyone looked at their childhood. Travis was only a newly hatched Zorua when Rod's mom picked him up from an adoption building when he was only two years old, and ever since then they have had the luxury of living under the same roof. Rod even taught Travis what he learned at school, giving him past spirals and notes from his classes and helping each other out with problems. Now, the two of them live in an apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know... You sure you wanna give me the honors?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm positive!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay... I'll pack up what I need!\"<br>\r\n\"I doubt you'll need much, but if you insist...\"<br>\r\n\"Come on, if I go there with nothing, won't that look strange?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right. Oh, what did the weatherman say today?\"<br>\r\n\"It'll most likely rain.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's pouring like there's no tomorrow!\" Travis stood outside in front of the apartment complex in his usual younger Rod appearance, with only an umbrella and a light jacket to protect himself from the weather. His suitcase was wrapped up in towels next to him, now rendered as a sopping wet mass of, well, towels. \"Finally, there's my ride!\" A taxi drove by, then kept going it's way down the street. \"... Darn...\" Looked like it was the wrong ride for Travis, which meant more waiting in the rain. A crackle of thunder could be heard in the distance; a red bus looked as if it would keep going, but stopped in front of Travis. <i>Finally.</i> A man stepped out from the back seat, dressed in a suit and occupied with a large umbrella. \"Ah, you must be one of the participants. May I see the letter?\" Pulling it from your pocket to reveal a drenched red letter, you could only chuckle on the matter and tell the man \"Here it is, more or less.\" Inspecting it quickly, the man set the suitcase inside the bus and signaled Travis to hop in, saying \"Come now, Rod (heheh). This weather is begging to get worse.\" \"Gladly!\" Once inside, Travis couldn't help but notice the fancy decor and tinted windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther people were there, too, minding each other's business and doing whatever they felt would pass the time. A kid in the back waved at Travis and signaled him over to sit with him. Now, he may have been like a human for the past twenty years, but nevertheless he was still wary of others. <i>Just do it. I mean, he's just a kid!</i> Travis sat next to the peppy little boy, who had eyes as big as the moon right now. \"Oh, hello! I'm really excited about this mansion! You looked more normal than anyone else, so I thought you would be a good seating buddy!\" Analyzing the kid, he seemed to be quite the trainer with all of his gear, yet no Pokemon around his waist. \"You, uh, seem to be quite the trainer there.\" Travis could've sworn his eyes grew even bigger at the mere mention of Pokemon, to which the kid happily remarked \"Thanks! I couldn't bring my Pokemon with me because my mom wouldn't let me, but they are sooo strong! Look at how many badges I have!\" He held up his little messenger bag to show the five badges pinned on the front, proudly displayed with his name 'Tommy' next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's pretty impressive.\" Travis attempted to comment on the colorful badges, finding no real interest in them.<br>\r\n\"Thanks again! Oh man, when we get there, I'm gonna see sooo many Pokemon, and I would be like 'Oh, boy!' when I walk inside!\"<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, my Herracross rocked at my last battle! He was all like 'Shoom! Wa-bam! Pow!' with his strength!\" The kid was like an endless bag of wind, geez.<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh! Do you know what!?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n\"When I get my prize, I'm gonna be sooo awesome! I'm gonna be all like 'In your faces!' when I win!\"<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...</span></div></div>",

Hey! Hey! We're here! Finally!\" Travis yawned and stretched his arms, taking notice of the fact that it wasn't raining anymore and of Tommy's bouncing up and down in our seat. \"Come on, chill. I'm afraid you may explode all over me in anticipation.\" Tommy made a face at him and exclaimed \"Yeah, I don't wanna give all of my excitement to you!\" <i>Who does he take after? A Smugleaf?</i> The kid's smug look now burned into Travis' memory; maybe Travis should disguise himself as Tommy later and give him a little visit? <i>Hehehe, that'll be too funny!</i> Travis felt the bus come to a complete stop, hearing the man in the suit say to everyone \"Please get your coats and bags and step off the bus.\" Conveniently, Travis could freely take off the layers of still soggy towels to reveal a perfectly dry suitcase, and Tommy couldn't help but say as he was climbing over him \"Wow! You could look like a business man with that!\" \"Very funny.\" Stepping off the bus and onto the Mansion property, seeing the structure beyond a large gate was really breathtaking! \"Holy cats, that's big...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it...\" A lady looking to be around her late twenties stood next to Travis, having her hands on her hips and dark eyeliner carefully edged around her eyes. She was most definitely <i>not</i> attractive to you, but if someone were to gawk at her, they would most likely say \"She's so beautiful... and rich...\" Her outfit screamed out the 'rich' factor. \"Well, time to get going...\" Her voice was very smooth and calm, but that had no interest to one such as Travis. Maybe a non-romantic comment towards her wouldn't hurt, but loving her would just be weird... Especially for him. Travis eyed the mansion, but couldn't help but see her blow a kiss towards him. \"The name's Rose, by the way...\" <i>I didn't even ask for her name!</i> Now to proceed through the large gates and into the mansion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings guests, and welcome to the Pokemon Manor!\" Travis looked at a tall man in another black suit, looking as crisp as crisp could get. He patted a book on a small table in front of him and continued, \"If I may please ask that everyone would sign their name into our guest book.\" A line was formed, and the signing procedure was as good as done. While Travis signed an impeccable copy of Rod's signature, he could feel little eyes piercing right through him, to which Travis assumed to be Tommy. \"Oh, your name is Rod! Hi Rod!\" \"Hello, Tommy.\" Everyone waited for the man to collect his guest book; Travis heard an anxious pitter-patter sound behind him, noticing Tommy jumping up and down as his curious eyes probed the interior. \"If I could have everyone's attention, please!\" Everyone turned to face him, and Travis couldn't help but feel like a stranger among the crowd of humans. \"My name is Andrew Majors, head-of-staff of this manor, and let me be the first to say thank you for your participation. I know that you all are wondering what it is that you have agreed to and you will find out at dinner tonight. But before that, we should show all of you where you each will be sleeping at. Now I have gathered,\" he paused for a bit as he pulled out several envelopes from underneath the table, continuing \"these envelopes contain a card with a color and a number. The cards will tell you what room you will be staying in and some scarce information about your host.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man handed Travis and everyone else an envelope, to which you said a casual \"Thank you\" to the man. <i>This card is...</i></span></div></div>",

I will see you all again at dinner.\" At that moment, Andrew departed up a flight of stairs and went through a door, out of sight. <i>He... seems alright. For a guy in a suit, anyway.</i> One of the servants approached Travis and politely asked for the card. \"Ah, I see. Stay close, now, as I direct you to---\" \"Yay! Guess what, Rod!? My room number is 123! We're reeealy close by!\" Tommy held his card up proudly, doing a dance that may either mean he's excited or has to use the bathroom. \"Okay that's, uh, great.\" Tommy smiled happily at Travis; the servant took the opportunity to say, \"Well, if both of your rooms are close by, then I can guide both of you. The card, please?\" Tommy gave his card up, and the two of them followed the servant through the maze of hallways. As they walked, Travis couldn't help but notice the colored doors. The mansion must be divided up into several large sections, each section containing one of each type of Pokemon, or more than one depending on the similarities. \"Hey, Tommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"What do you think your guest will be like?\"<br>\r\n\"I dunno, but I hope he likes Pokemon as much as I do!\"<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n\"Um, Tommy?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, again?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... (I'll ask later...) Why are you so happy all of the time?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not happy ALL the time! I mean, I'm just excited is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, room number 123.\" The servant took a peek inside and told Tommy \"Oh, I'm afraid your roommate is absent for the time being. I believe all of your guests down this hall are elsewhere in a more suitable environment.\" It felt fine to Travis, maybe no cooler than 75 degrees. \"How come? The temperature feels fine in here.\" Tommy walked inside his room and set his bags against the wall hastily. The next thing Travis knew, Tommy was making a break for the restrooms. <i>Looked like I was right about the dance.</i> \"Oh, the hosts and hostesses here prefer chilly environments. We are having their a/c units replaced as we speak, but with such a large estate, it takes a long time.\" \"Ah, I understand. Thanks.\" Travis and the servant approached room 126, and said politely \"Your welcome. Now, here's your room. Remember, though, your host is absent. May I also take note that it's... 4:23pm right now, and dinner starts at 6 o' clock sharp. Don't be late!\" The servant then departed, and Travis was now alone. <i>At last... silence.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was occupied with two beds, each placed against the opposite wall; a desk for whatever may require its use; a round blue and white shaped rug on the floor; a poster with a Snorunt on it, with text above it saying 'Chill out.' <i>Alright, now what?</i> After a bit of thinking, Travis decided to...</span></div></div>",

Opening his suitcase, Travis pulled out a phone that Rod used to use until he had purchased a newer one. If smart phones were really smart, wouldn't they just upgrade themselves the way a Porygon would? Technology is just so confusing nowadays; Travis opened the contacts menu and went down through the alphabet until he found Rod's name. With the touch of a screen, the phone instantly dialed Rod's number and waited for him to pick up. A few rings later, Rod answered: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Travis, how's it going?\" <br>\r\n\"Hey Rod. It's alright here, not too much has happened though. This place is HUGE, by the way!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it <i>is</i> a mansion. Sounds pretty chill to me.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. How is it for you right now?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a weekend, so I've been chilling with my Sigilyph and Porygon. The two of them are finally getting used to each other! Wanna say hi to Sigilyph real quick?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Rod held up the phone to Sigilyph, making a kind of chirping sound that Travis could clearly understand.<br>\r\n\"(Hello there, Travis the Zoroark.)\"<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Rod put the phone back up to his head and continued their conversation.<br>\r\n\"What did he say?\"<br>\r\n\"He called you a knucklehead.\"<br>\r\n\"Liar.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. He just said hello.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah. How about Porygon? I'm sure he... <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Hey! What did I tell you about downloading memes!?</font>\"<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh. Is everything okay, Rod?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, he just downloaded data on trolling. He's... being very difficult. I'll talk to you later, okay? <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">... Wh-what did you say!?</font>\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis hasn't been with Porygon that long, but he does know that it has an excessive habit of downloading random stuff. Anyway, the phone call killed about... two minutes. <i>Now, back to other things...</i> Travis examined the two sides of the room again. The right side seemed to have some more stuff laying around, and the left side was completely clear of anything that didn't belong. Assuming that was his side of the room, Travis tossed his suitcase on top of the bed and laid out all of his items. There was some clothing, a spiral and pencil for drastic measures of entertainment, an iPod for boredom, a clock to keep track of time, a toothbrush and toothpaste set, a <i>borrowed</i> Nintendo Dual Screen, and a phone. Into the nearby drawer they went, and organization had assumed control over his side of the room. While Travis was adjusting the clock, the a/c kicked in. <i>I guess they finally fixed it. Awful lot faster than what the servant thought.</i> Everything was set up, and now all Travis needed to do was to meet his host and attend dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened behind Travis, who was currently feeding the cord for the clock behind the drawer. \"Oh, hello there. You must be my guest for the next few weeks.\" Her voice sounded different, and the room's temperature quickly started falling. Whoever just walked in wasn't a regular person.

Hm, for a human you seem pretty relaxed. Have you heard about us having the knowledge of the human tongue?\" Travis felt the temperature continue to drop, but he didn't mind since he can adjust to weather conditions a bit. \"I can't recall if I have. I <i>have</i> communicated with a Porygon a whole lot lately, but it only speaks what it downloads. I guess I have gotten used to it.\" Froslass seemed impressed, and asked politely \"So, what do you think of this place so far? Is it like a maze? Is it as voluminous as you thought it would be?\" Travis scratched the back of his head and answered \"The people here are nice, the interior and exterior looks amazing, and you seem nice as well.\" She started blushing, accepting the compliment with a wink. \"A whole lot of us are nice, but where there's light there's always darkness. We have our fair amount of troublemakers here, especially this one Zoroark who would run around and pose as the servants.

I'd have to ask Drake about it, I mean, he knows all about that kind of stuff.\" Wondering who Drake was, Travis couldn't help but ask her. \"Well, he was our master's first Pokemon. It's incredible that Drake outlived him, y'know...? I miss our master...\" Travis felt sorry for every Pokemon there; they all must miss their master a whole lot. \"I'm really sorry for your loss. For everyone's loss, I mean.\" Froslass smiled, knowing that it was for the best of things. \"Don't be. It was better for him to move on, anyway. It was hard to watch him barely hang on day after day. He's now in a more joyful place!\" Sorrow left the room already, yet it seemed it left at the wrong time.

Not after that last prank you pulled...\" <i>Hm? Were they boyfriend-girlfriend towards each other before all of this or something?</i> \"Yeah know, but I admit that being a mishap of events. Can't you call me Roark at lea-- Who-ho, now! Is <i>he</i> your buddy now?\" Froslass hid a blush as best as she could and answered \"Yes, he's my host.

Travis whispered over to Yuki. \"Drake's the Charizard over there?\" She answered back in a hushed voice. \"Yes, but I think Andrew's introducing him.\" Travis nodded, and directed his attention over to the orange lizard. Andrew then continued to announce his important message. \"May I introduce to everyone Master Matthew's first Pokemon, Drake.\" He then pulled out a chair for Drake politely; Drake thanked him kindly, then looked at all of the guests with piercing eyes. \"Greetings guests.\" His voice was nice and loud, fitting for such a Charizard with visible scars. The several scars on his face and body were most likely from past trainer battles. \u201cIt is a privilege to finally meet all of you. As you know Matthew Sterling, the owner of this Manor, has recently passed.\u201d Everyone fell silent in respect for his recently deceased owner and friend. \u201cBefore his death he asked me one favor, and that was to find someone who could take care of all his Pokemon. That someone is one of you.\u201d Everyone remained silent as the thought of owning the entire estate dawned on everyone. <i>Wow, an entire estate... I wonder how difficult that would be, not to mention stressful?</i> Drake lifted a sheet of paper, bringing it up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I\u2019m going the read the Rules that was disclosed in the Masters will. <i>In the event of my death I wish for you to invite 30 random individuals to stay at the Manor. Each guest is to be paired with a Pokemon host. The guest is to stay with his or her host Pokemon and must participate with the Pokemon when asked no matter what the request my be. If the Pokemon is ever displeased with it\u2019s guest or a guest breaks a rule of the house the guest will be disqualified and will leave the manor immediately. A guest may leave by request if he or she wishes to. Who whoever is remaining at the end shall inherit all of my estate.</i>\u201d Drake then proceeded to let everyone eat upon announcement. \"Hey, Yuki?\" She turned towards Travis and asked \"What is it?\" Travis spun his fork around while explaining: \"If multiple guests win, does that mean multiple people are allowed to own this place?\" She nodded. \"I guess you could be right, as long as everyone gets along. Why do you want to know?\" Travis shrugged. \"Well, it would be better to have more people to share the place with, like of how my brother and I share the same apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all continued talking about the topic in question until dinner was over...</span></div></div>",
