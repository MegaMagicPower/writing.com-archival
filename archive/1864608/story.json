Being extremely desperate, they call upon anyone that is willing to put their sword up for the cause.  Small groups like Crimson Blade come to play as they march against the Fomors.  Our story takes place on a few rookies who helped save the Oracle and are now on their way to be heroes.  Which hero fits you the best?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLann, at first glance, he looks to be a common sell-sword.  Doing it for the money, contract killer, making blood-gold.  In reality, this muscled swordsman is in it for revenge when he watched as his town burn.  He is dead set on exterminating all of the Fomors for ruining all that was in his life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorn from a wealthy family, Evie was taught the best magic that can be bought.  This busty sorceress trained in all schools of magic to master combat against the Fomorian armies.  When she sparred, she would taunt the rest of the class wearing tight and revealing clothing.  That old habit carried on as she joined the Crimson Blades for her first taste of real battle.  Even though comrades were getting cut down and slaughtered, she practically reveled in it.  She was in the war she always dreamed of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thundering giant Karok comes to the town of Colhen in search of answers.  Who are the Fomors and can you smash it?  Karok's home isn't in immediate threat of the Fomor's but they are smart enough to ready themselves for battle.  This 300 pound moving muscle seeks to find the biggest Fomor and crack it's head open with the biggest rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest came with stories, titles, and legends.  Fiona comes with just her name and her shield.  She offers no background and no reason of fighting.  This stalwart defender is built strong yet is still attractive.  Most men fear her because of her mysteriousness.  She likes being noticed but not being touched.  She keeps everyone at arms length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Evie's breasts bounce with every step and her butt sways with her movements.  She is wearing a brown robe given by her graduating class where she made some 'modifications' to it making it as tight as possible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want more\"  Evie demands<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarrec almost didn't hear her with Gywnn yelling at him about the strategies hes giving her. \"I'm sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me more to fight, I did not sit through hours of lectures to fight fodder.  I want to fight ogres, lizardmen, kobolds, bears, or hell, throw in a dragon if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I'd want to give you a mission, our men aren't ready to go out yet.  Now sit down and relax, we have a couple days until our next move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saw me single-handedly save the oracle and fight of hordes of Fomor.  You know I can go do more fighting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those Fomor were deep in our territory, outnumbered and cornered.  Even if you fell, our reserves could have easily handled it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need your men, I need a  place and I will conquer it.  I need a monster and I will slay it.  I need a war and I will win it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really that eager to get yourself killed?  Fine then, go take a boat to one of the listed locations.  I will tell your family you didn't die by boredom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, about time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie struts out the door ready for battle.  She gets to the docks and preps for sail.  Where shall she go?</span></div></div>",

Marrec, after being pestered to his last nerve, sent Evie to regain some land and establish a foothold.  Evie comes in wearing the Broken Ash armor that she bought from another adventurer.  With her tits perked up, and her skirt conformed to her ass.  She sets off to fight what monsters that lay ahead.  Quickly dispatching the small group of gnolls guarding the dock entrance, she sets deeper into the ruins.  Evie notices a large spiderweb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One would say this place has a spider infestation.\" She giggled to herself, not even considering that she might be in imminent danger.  Just as she turns around she notices a shadow creep out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out and fight like a <i>man</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notices a shadow slip away again from the corner of her eye.

Evie panics and starts flailing about, making it spread all over her arms and getting herself locked in.  She drops her staff and collapses as the spider begins to spray over her breasts.  As the one spider is working on he chest, she notices a swarm of spiders come out of the ruins engulfing her head to toe in a cocoon of web.  She is completely immobilized but can still see through some of the webbing.  The spiders drag her into a hole where she can see thousands of the tiny spiders all underneath with other cocoons nestled in webs.  Evie is taken past the others and brought to a large chamber where it is almost big enough to fit half of Colhen in.  The spiders leave her in a nest to wait for her impending doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFading in and out of sleep Evie finds out that she has a small opening near her hand enough to wiggle her fingers.  She is trying to attempt a small flare spell without attracting the attention of the spider horde.  As she is getting ready, she hears the spiders in the room scatter out, and she feels a small quake.  Evie fears what is coming out of the large tunnel and starts casting the spell.</span></div></div>",
