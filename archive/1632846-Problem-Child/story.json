            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was close to noon in a small suburb inside the busy streets of Rome. There was a certain calm in the air, one that would make any alert person uneasy. Greg, in traditional western clothing, walked out into the open and gazed upon the ten story building they had targeted.  There did not seem to be anything out of the ordinary, however, his instincts were telling him otherwise.  Inside the target building was a man named Sykes, whom they needed information from, and they were not about to let that man get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep a sharp eye out, everyone.\" he said, through his ear piece radio. \"I have a nagging feeling that we are not the only people working this side of the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, Jon, a tall, well built man in a black business suit, raised a hand to an ear piece radio of his own, having heard the transmission. \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that, Jon?\" came a woman's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, Crystal.\" replied Jon, radioing back. \"It's coming over the static, their frequency must be overlapping our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means they must be real close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rodger that. Keep your eyes out. I don't want any surprises.  Sykes won't get away this time.\" he turned to a small girl, standing next to him, holding a sniper rifle in her arms. \"Kayo, get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked up at Jon with a blank look in her eyes. \"Yes, Jon.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the roof of another building, Heather, in western clothing, sat crouched down in front of a number of small flat panel screens on a folding rack rising from an expensive violin case. Each screen showed a parts of the surrounding area and key rooms inside their target building through cameras on small, mechanical flies, built by Mech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm nervous, Greg.\" she said, her voice wavering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" asked Greg. \"What do you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has been a large increase of suit activity in the area and there is a heavy smell of gun oil in the air. I'm afraid we are not the only people after Sykes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remain calm and keep an eye on them.  If they get too close to your location, move to your alternate spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rodger that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside a small government car, Crystal, a slender, well dressed woman with Italian features, listened to the children talk, taking notes, then turned to her radio. \"Confirmed. This group is also after Sykes.  What are your orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wait for them to make their move.  If they are successful, we simply surround them and take Sykes off their hands.  You know the routine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rodger that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in a nearby alley, Tex, also in western clothing, rolled his eyes and touched his radio. \"We tracked this guy for weeks.\" he said, irritably. \"I say we go for it now!  Besides, that worm is holding a small girl hostage!  Who knows what he's doing to her in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside a black, full sized van, Sam, also in western clothing, frowned. \"Relax, Tex.\" he said into his radio. \"You'll get your chance to bust a few heads soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to consider the suits.\" added Greg. \"We can not afford a battle on two fronts, not now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if they are after Sykes as well?\" radioed Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg gnawed his jaws in decision. \"Tex, I want you to crash the party inside the target building. Make as much noise as you can and take Sykes.  I will follow behind, handle anyone you miss, and rescue the girl. Sam you're our transport out, be ready.  Heather, do you have a physical visual of the girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Greg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep an eye on her, tranquilize anyone who gets too close, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Greg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, I placed the book down with a dream like smile on my face. \"If only super heroes really existed in this world.\" I said to myself. \"I wish I were one, it would solve a lot of my problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did I know that my wish was about to come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich character am I?...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I tend to spend a lot of time by myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dad wishes I would be more social. He also wishes I were less interested in science, and follow him into law and politics. You've probably never heard of David Rodgers. He's more of a behind-the-scenes player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the only one who can pull me out of my science studies is Rhea. When Mom and Dad adopted her, I thought she was an intruder in my perfect little world. As she grew out of diapers, though, she became more inquisitive, and I recognized a kindred spirit. She likes to watch me with my chemistry set, and I like to show her what I can do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this isn't about my solitary nature, or my conflict with my dad. This is about the time my whole world turned upside-down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up feeling... weird. That's the best way I can describe it. There was no one thing that stuck out. It was like everything was off where it should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI trudged to the bathroom, trying to figure out what was wrong. Was I sick? Did I just not get enough sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I reached the bathroom mirror, I realized what was wrong. It was me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy whole body was... I can't really describe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know exactly what I was seeing in the mirror, but I knew what it wasn't. It wasn't human.</span></div></div>",

My cheeks were hanging down off my face like that of a bull dog, my canine teeth were larger than normal, and all of my senses seemed more keen than ever. This caused a light chuckle to escape my lips as I had dreamed about dogs during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I must still be dreaming.\"</i> I thought with a sleepy smile. then I said, \"Bow wow, what a face! I think I'd rather be a cute little girl than look like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, that weird feeling I experienced when I woke up returned and I watched in surprise as my reflection quickly changed to that of a cute young girl. Now wide awake, I slowly looked down at myself and discovered that it was not just my reflection that had changed. I had somehow become a beautiful female version of myself with clothing to match! As I looked at the mirror, dumbfounded, I found that I was also beginning to shrink quickly, my clothing shrinking and changing with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... What's happening to me!?\" I screamed hoarsely, my voice rising in octaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, the shrinking stopped and I found myself to be around five years old, Rhea's age... That was when I finally screamed at the top of my lungs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I didn't let that break my concentration, though, and I stayed focused on the way I was supposed to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Mom said, \"There. That should do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes and looked to the mirror. There I was, in my pajamas, just like any other morning. \"Mom,\" I asked, \"how'd you know what to do to fix me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another deep breath. \"I suppose there's no sense keeping this from you any longer,\" she said. \"Your father and I... we're not from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you guys move here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not it, Clem. We're not from this planet. We come from a race of shapeshifters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you mean we're... aliens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"We were once the rulers of our planet, until a revolution sent us into exile on this world. Once we felt we understood the customs well enough, we assumed the Rodgers identities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and Rhea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wanted another child. However, I didn't feel up to being pregnant again. Perhaps it was just me, but I found the experience terribly uncomfortable, and your father didn't want to trade identities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clem, listen to me. We don't want Rhea to know any of this. When she's your age, we'll tell her she's adopted, but she must never know that she's the only human in the house.\"</span></div></div>",

The effect isn't lasting, but you'll want to be aware of the temperature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need to keep your focus, even at times when a teenage boy isn't accustomed to focusing. You saw how quickly you changed at just a thought. You can imagine what might happen when you're at school, if you were to fantasize about one of your classmates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. I know she's way out of my league, but I'd recently started fantasizing about Caitlin Spencer.

You don't have enough tongues to capture all the complexities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"And we're the only aliens on this world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as we know. As I said, this isn't exactly a hot spot for interstellar travel.\" She returned to the shape I had always known. \"Any other questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the limits of our shapeshifting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can assume any shape you can imagine. I should warn you, though, that shapes considerably larger or shorter than your natural shape can be quite stressful to mimic. I wouldn't recommend assuming those shapes for an extended period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Clem.\" With that, she left my room.</span></div></div>",

With no hair, your skin is going to be sensitive so you will need to get clothing of a lighter material than thick cotton such as silk or fine cotton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pouted, hearing that. \"Any other surprises I should know about?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom grinned. \"They wouldn't be surprises if I told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom placed a light hand onto my cheek. \"Keep your thoughts silent.\" looking at me, she said. \"Your impulses will be getting stronger for a while as hormones begin to run rampant through you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be at the mall, mom.\" sighing, I said. then I thought, <i>\"Caitlin will never date me, looking like this.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a big crush on Caitlin Spencer, the rich girl in town. It was not because of her money, we had plenty of our own to be considered very well off. It was because I saw something in her no one else seemed to notice, she had a good heart but it was fortified. I imagined myself scaling the walls and rescuing the fair maiden from her self imprisonment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun, dear.\" said mom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once that was done, mom handed me a recent news clipping. \"What's this?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just recently, a brand of body wash named Plutonium was stripped from the shelves as it washed all the hair off people's bodies, making their skin as smooth as silk.\" looking amused, mom said. \"It's your cover story for loosing all your hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, mom.\" taking the news clipping, I said. \"It's not going to tone down the teasing though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let them tease you.\" lightly patting my head, mom said. \"How often does a boy learn he's an Earth born alien?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that. \"Can I go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, dear.\" allowing me up, mom said. \"Have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, I found myself at Our Founders Mall near the center of the city, rummaging through the men's clothing department, searching for items that were made of soft material. The clothing you were wearing felt like sandpaper against your skin, making you very uncomfortable. \"Mom was not joking when she said my skin would be very sensitive during this... puberty.\" wincing, I whispered. \"At least the wig I'm wearing is comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, I found nothing that was made of silk, satin, or fine cotton. Frustrated, I looked over at the women's section but cringed at the thought of wearing girls' clothing to school. Still, the clothing I had on was torture to my now sensitive skin.

I avoided any feminine colors though as I then moved on to the shirts, shorts, and pants as Tracey helped me find the style I was looking for. During this time, I introduced myself and my hope to gain Caitlin Spencer's attention, even though I was now hairless for the time being. In all, we spent three hours, putting together a small wardrobe for me.  \"Thank you for your help, Tracey.\" smiling, I said. \"I would have been shopping forever otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracey giggled. \"It was my pleasure, Clem.\" smiling, she said. \"Good luck with your crush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that then handed Tracey a hundred dollar bill from my wallet. \"For your services.\" handing it to her, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracey smiled, accepting the tip. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" smiling, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then walked towards the front of the store to purchase my selections. Unknown to me, Tracey sighed. \"He and Cait would make such a great couple.\" with a dreamy smile, she said. getting an idea she chased after mew. \"Hey, wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" turning to her, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The store is looking for people to stand in as living mannequins.\" quickly, she whispered. \"Its good pay and I can introduce you to that coworker I told you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only have eyes for Caitlin right now.\" slightly annoyed, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tracey smiled and it hit me. \"She's that coworker you told me about!?\" shocked, I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracey nodded. \"You just didn't hear it from me, okay.\" whispering, she said. \"If you're interested in the job, come in the afternoon and take the 5:00 bus home, she normally rides that bus so to give her chauffeur a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she left and a grin slowly began to form. \"Maybe....\" whispering, I said. \"Maybe I have a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, I made the call and arranged an interview at Macy's. The next day, I walked into Macy's and informed the customer service rep that I was there for my job interview. I was taken to a rear office where I waited for about five minutes before the manager I had spoken to over the phone, Mrs. Rachel Waite, walked in with a folder of paperwork and sat down across from me. \"Good afternoon, Mr. Clem Rodgers.\" she said politely. \"I'm curious as to why the boy of such a well off family is interested applying for a job with our company as a living mannequin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To help my broken self esteem.\" tearing up, I replied, removing my wig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel gasped, even though she saw it before. \"What happened!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took the newspaper clipping from my chest pocket and handed it to her. \"A new body wash named 'Plutonium' was stripped from the shelves, leaving many people with all their body hair permanently removed.\" looking at Rachel, I said, sadly. \"I used it and this was the result.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel gently touched my head then pulled back, whispering, \"Nearly flawless, just like...\" she stopped talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'm sorry?\" not hearing her, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your skin is nearly flawless.\" complimenting me, Rachel said. \"Do you think you can stand perfectly still for four hours at a time, between breaks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give it my best try, ma'am.\" I replied. \"Dad wants me to get a job to 'learn responsibility' and since my sister and I am currently being home schooled, I can think of no better job...\" I chuckled, adding, \"given my current condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel giggled at my remark. \"I think you will do nicely, Mr. Rodgers.\" she said. \"We will start you out in the men's swim wear department.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed slightly at that. \"Swim wear?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel nodded. \"What better place to rebuild your confidence than to have people stare at you, wearing noting but a fashionable pair of swim trunks?\" she asked, smiling. \"I could have placed you in the underwear section.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, my tension falling, seeing her humor, unaware she was thinking about placing me with another living mannequin in the women's department. \"I accept your offer, ma'am.\" I said, offering my hand. \"When do I start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You start next week but I need written proof that you are being home schooled.\" she said, shaking my hand. \"That will give you some time to prepare as I would like you to stand without your wig, to make you more like a true mannequin.\" pausing, releasing me, she added. \"I just need you to fill out some paper work and then you will be free to go.\" she handed me the paperwork and quietly left the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got the job!?\" after calling her, asked mom. \"Congratulations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom.\" blushing, I said. \"I told my boss I was being home schooled...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced, expecting the riot act but I was surprised when mom sighed. \"Well, its the truth, dear.\" with a sense of sadness, she said. \"We can't risk allowing you and Rhea go to a public school, not with the possibility of our enemies searching for us.\" there was a pause. \"Your dad and I had a fight over you getting that job so be thankful I won that argument for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom.\" seeing the bus coming, I said. \"I'm getting on the bus now, I'll talk to you later, bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at my watch, I frowned, seeing that it was only 4:00. <i>\"Oh well, I'm still nervous about talking to her.\"</i> sighing, I thought. <i>\"Maybe I'll build more courage as a work in the men's clothing department.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I stepped onto the bus....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a picture of me, Garth, and Gary. \"No, we're all guys in that picture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh,\" she said, pointing at Gary. \"She's a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat took me by surprise.

Rhea, of course, was loving the experience of having a big sister but she was also sensitive to my feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Dorothy?\" using my female name, she asked. \"I-If you really don't want to do this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Rhea.\" unaccustomed to my new voice, I said. \"It's just very different from what I'm used to.\" I then smiled, adding, \"Imagine yourself suddenly turned into a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea made a face. \"Ewww!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made me giggle, surprising myself, as it was a delightful sound to my male mind. <i>\"I hope we don't bump into any guys I know .\"</i> worried, I thought. <i>\"I don't need anyone hitting on me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if we grab a snack first, you'll feel better.\" suggesting, Rhea said. \"Being a girl is not bad.

I was smiling with her until I saw Caitlin on the far side of the court. I felt my heart race, wondering if she would recognize me. Only those thoughts were interrupted by the sounds of gun fire. Rhea and I both screamed to the sounds as the skylight shattered from the gun fire but I managed to keep my head and saw the shards of glass falling from the high ceiling. \"Rhea, look out!\" shouting, I cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled my sister out of the way, just as the rain of glass came crashing down and quickly changed shape, not caring if anyone saw us as I was only thinking of Rhea's safety.

I could hear the people screaming around me as the gunfire continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it stop!\" screaming, Rhea pleaded. \"Dorothy, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're safe, Rhea.\" my echoing voice assuring her, I said. \"I won't let anything hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, just as the gunfire started, it stopped and I heard Rhea whispering to herself. \"Who are you?\" quietly, she asked. \"Why are you doing this?\" she paused, as if to listen then she sternly said, \"You leave the boy alone or I'll have my big sister come after you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you talking to?\" curious, my voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boy with the guns out there has a mean voice in his head.\" frowning, Rhea said. \"I told the voice to leave him alone or I'd have you go after him.\" she then proudly smiled. \"That made it shut up... no one messes with my big sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I heard the sound of something being dropped to the floor and took the chance to change back to my female human form to see the police drag the boy away. I sighed then turned to Rhea. \"Good work, sis.\" smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea blushed. \"I just talked to the voice in his head.\" looking at me, she said. \"Three other girls talked to the boy, he was hard to reach with that big meanie yelling at him to hurt everybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to see Caitlin leaving with some kids I knew from school and breathed a sigh of relief, not knowing that my move had attracted some unwanted attention. \"Well, that was exciting.\" joking, I said to Rhea. \"Let's grab a snack, I really hungry right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you're coming out of the box.\" smiling at me, Rhea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny, sis.\" giggling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to us, two men were watching us. \"Who are they?\" asked one. \"We have no records of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are millions of people with unique abilities in this world.\" calmly, the other stated. \"We have no chance of securing the children of the original group but we may be able to isolate these two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he took up a telephone and dialed a number. \"Sir, we have located some raw talent...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remain focused on your task.\" came a deep response. the line then went dead.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My first thought was that they were my family's enemies from their home world but I managed to keep my head. It did not matter who they were, their intention was clear, top take Rhea and I by force. \"Rhea, run!\" screaming, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicked, Rhea hesitated and I was forced to grab her arm, running instead of fighting. \"I told you to run!\" scolding her, I said, panting. \"Listen to me every now and then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I couldn't leave you!\" wailing, Rhea said. \"What if they hurt you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it.\" quickly, I said. \"We have to find a place to hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting an idea, I took a glace back to see the men far behind but taking pursuit and pushed Rhea towards a large mannequin display. \"We're going to play a game with those idiots.\" pulling off my wig, I said. \"Think you can hold perfectly still for a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain, Rhea nodded and I had her stand between four mannequins while I quickly a spot near the front, holding a simple pose among other skirt wearing models.

The two security guards, watching the doors, instinctively jumped out of the way as I ran through the large turn-style door and galloped down the side walk as fast I could carry my little sister.

Garth saw that and asked, \"What do you mean a 'form' of puberty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, removing my wig. \"Alien puberty.\" near tears, I said. \"Rhea wasn't joking when she said my parents are aliens, I am one too, just born on Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's completely hairless... Just like Cait.\" whispering, Lyssa said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I turned to Rhea and saw that she felt the same way but said nothing. As we got underway, we told Dad about the fight, and I told them about the note we had left, asking for their help. \"What do you think, Chief?\" once the story was told, Garth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like Rhea's caught the attention of the Agency,\" Ted said. \"It's a quasi-governmental agency that recruits kids to do their dirty work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,\" making a face, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When a 5-year-old girl points a sniper rifle at your head, 'weird' is one letter longer than any word going through your mind.\" He said this while staring at Rhea. I got the feeling that there must be something about her that made him uncomfortable, but he wasn't saying what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like my dream,\" Rhea said. \"I saw some men who wanted to take me away. And there was something much worse looking for me, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be Sykes,\" Ted said. \"Sykes and the Agency are out to destroy each other, and they don't care much about anyone caught in the crossfire.\" He turned his attention to me. \"How are you explaining your, uh condition? I mean, when you're not changing shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom found an article,\" I explained, 'about Plutonium beauty products causing hair loss. I tell people that I used the body wash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting timing,\" Ted said. \"I heard through the grapevine that Plutonium had just dodged a buyout attempt by Cain Chemical, right before that problem started. And Cain is one of Sykes's front companies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you guys do me a favor?\" Rhea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, boo,\" Lyssa said. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If something bad happens to me, find my mommy. My real mommy, the one who borned me.

Just above the rear bumper, a large panel opened, revealing what looked like a rocket booster. \"Turbo turbine ready.\" turning to Ted, Geo said. \"Kick it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not see what was happening up front but heard Ted let out an excited yell as we all felt the van suddenly pick up a lot of speed when the turbine fired. Ted, I imagine, turned the wheel with expert precision, moving through the traffic, leaving the back car in the dust.

That's how we wound up telling her about the adoption; mom was going to wait until she was around our age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused, as Ted led Lyssa up the stairs towards what looked like living quarters. As strange as everything seemed, she was not repulsed at the fact my parents were aliens or that I was one myself. It made me realize how much of a friend she truly was and I wished I had been more of a friend when she needed me. <i>\"All that changes today.\"</i> knotting my jaws, thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed then turned back to Garth. \"What freaked me out, though, was when she found this old picture of you, me, and Greg from when we were ten.\" continuing my story, I said. \"She asked me why my friend was dressed like a boy. Remember, that was when Lyssa was Greg's little secret. There was nothing about the shot that said we were different from how we looked, yet Rhea could tell. Then, she used her symbiont to show me Lyssa's medical records, saying that she was changing into a real girl.\" She paused. \"I can't believe how I reacted when she first told me. I don't know how she can forgive me for being such a rotten friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could have been worse,\" Garth replied. \"If she wasn't a descendant of Iole, she'd still be a girl trapped in a boy's body. She used to cry about how long it was taking the hormones to work, thinking she'd be underdeveloped forever.

All of our concerns rose when she pulled out a cellphone and dialed a number. <i>\"What's up?\"</i> curious, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, upon finishing the call, Lyssa quietly called us all together as Geo and dad entered behind her. Garth was the first to reach her, worried something was wrong. I and the others were right behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Lyssa, what was so urgent that you needed to see all of us right away?\" concerned, Grace asked. \"You sounded super worried over the house intercom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember those goons who were after Clem and Rhea?\" seeing Ted Jones shake his head, Lyssa asked. \"Well, Mr Jones told me that the Agency was after Rhea's birth mother twenty years ago. My guess is they want Rhea and Clem for the same reasons, they both have a unique power they can use to their advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was stunned to say the least but i managed to ask, \"How did they learn of Rhea or even me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhea's mother got away from the Agency on our last mission.\" speaking up, dad said. \"In that sense, I guess we gained a small victory.\" he shuddered slightly. \"Bear in mind, though, these people are true monsters. I can only guess they had been tracking Rhea's birth mother and discovered her child in one of those searches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The van watching the house.\" thinking out loud, I said. \"They must have been with this Agency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy blood began to boil, knowing that such monsters were right outside my own home an I wished I had confronted them then when I had the chance. Only I dismissed the thought as quickly as it came. <i>\"No, I would not have lasted long.\"</i> scolding myself, I thought. <i>\"Monsters like the Agency should not be faced alone.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that is the case, they had been watching you for a while, young man.\" serious, Ted said. \"They were merely waiting for the right time to strike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one is going to take you two anywhere if we have anything to say about it.\" serious, Gar said to Rhea and I.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh- What about my- my birth mommy?\" frightened, Rhea asked. \"I do- don't want mo- monsters to g- get her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe mom and dad can find her.\" trying to calm my sister, I suggested. \"They have... gifts of their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea gave me a grateful smile only to have it suddenly turn to terror. \"They found her!\" her lips and hands quivering, she screamed. \"The monsters are chasing her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa quickly knelt down and turned Rhea's head to face her. It broke all our hearts to see such a small child so very terrified. \"Where is your birth mommy?\" firmly, she asked. \"Can you tell us where she is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hospital!\" crying in hysterics, Rhea replied. \"They're running from the hospital!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only five miles from here.\" startled, Geo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mount up!\" pointing in the direction of the garage, dad ordered. \"Grace, you drive. We will give advice through ear piece radios as we watch through the camera feeds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, we were all given earpiece radios, exactly as they were described in the comic series and led to the garage where Grace moved to get into the family car. \"Not that one, honey.\" moving to a tarp covered vehicle, Ted said. \"This one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned and gasped as Ted pulled off the tarp to reveal a modified, sleek black, van! <i>\"It's the Beast!\"</i> my mouth open in awe, I thought. <i>\"Just as it was described in the comic series!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Beast!\" an awe filled smile forming, Lyssa whispered. \"You really had it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the 1983 GMC Vandura G series, which Ted and I had modified.\" quite proudly, Geo said. \"This bad boy as a 10 inch armored plated hull and armored glass windows. It carries a 2.7 liter supercharged V8 engine that delivers 300+hp and 400+ torque with a top sustained speed of 180 mph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an incredible piece of machinery, a true work of art. I wondered if Mr Jones would later let me test drive it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can talk cars later.\" scolding, Ted said. \"Get moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all piled into the van and sped off, towards the hospital.

Mommy and her boyfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked passed Gar, but all I could see was a small boy in a dress carrying a doll, being surrounded by some goons carrying weapons. \"Rhea's mom or not,\" Garth said, \"we can't let this go down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all piled out of the Beast and made for the group, Garth hulking up to weightlifter size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got to the group in time to hear the goons' leader say, \"Kiss, Kiss, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KISS THIS!\" angrily, Garth roared. he landed a strong right hook into the man's jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy sat up, after being thrown off his feet, rubbing his jaw. \"Hello again, Garth. You caught me off guard, but not without resources.\" At that, the goons aimed their weapons at Garth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to hold Rhea back as she wanted to charge in but we both paused as Lyssa said, \"Think fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gust of wind and a quick blur later, all of the men had been relieved of their weapons as they were now lying on the ground at Garth's feet while Lyssa smiled as if she had never moved. \"Too slow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice move.\" impressed, I thought. \"Maybe mom and dad can tell us more about the weapons they have once I get one to them to examine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader's eyes narrowed. \"You kids don't know what you're in the middle of.

And Rhea is a clone of me, created to save Tobi's life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were about to walk through the garage door, when it opened, revealing Ted's muscular form. \"She's not coming in here!\" he declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she's my mommy!\" Rhea protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey,\" Todd asked, \"what is he talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was Rhea's age,\" Sarah explained, \"Dr. Hagen had me shadow the Problem Child Gang. Then, he wanted them dealt with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed shook his head. \"You have such a pretty way of describing shooting someone in the shoulder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that I shot you in the shoulder. It's that I didn't shoot you in the head or heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded. \"Hagen ordered me to kill you, but I didn't want to. I deliberately shot you in the shoulder, instead. Then, I went into hiding, using the last name Barns. If it weren't for Cain Chemical, Hagen still wouldn't know where I was living.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed shook his head again. \"Sykes again. These names just keep turning up, don't they?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were both the size of teenagers, wearing teen clothes. Looking at them, I guessed it was Ted's attempt to keep them under control. I could not be sure though, I did not see any adult clothing around so it might have been simply all they had. We all sat around them, explaining the events surrounding our brief encounter with Hagen and his men on the streets near the hospital. Fortunately, no one seemed too upset that Rhea decided to join us by teleporting in. Once we were done, we listened as Ted and Geo explained who Sykes was and how their group came to lock horns with the Agency. \"We had thought that the Agency wanted us as part of their army of brainwashed soldiers.\" finishing his explanation, Ted said. \"Apparently, we were wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Agency had considered it but, with half your group was related to the most wealthy families on the planet, it was too much of a security risk.\" looking at Ted, Sarah said. \"Believe me, Mr Jones, you will never know how lucky you and your team was.\" she teared up, adding, \"They killed my family to claim me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to be of comfort, I placed a reassuring hand onto Sarah's shoulder. \"They won't get you a second time, not if we can help it.\" smiling, I said. \"Rhea is my adopted sister, I won't let anything happen to her birth mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica is really my brother, Clem, mommy.\" smiling, Rhea said. \"He can change into almost anything.\" giggling, she added, \"Even an older sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah could not help giggle at that, making me blush. \"Thank you for taking care of my little girl.. Jessica.\" giving me a light kiss on the cheek, she said. \"Do you all have powers like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do.\" seriously, Gar replied. \"However, I think its more important that we focus the issue at hand... The Agency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, we need to place all we know on the table now.\" equally as serious, Geo said. \"We don't want to be caught off guard a second time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know that Dr Hagen knows about all of us, perhaps even that Travis kid.\" speaking up, Lyssa said. \"Only I'm guessing you didn't know him back then, Mr Jones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed shook his head. \"No, we didn't.\" with a hint of regret, Ted replied. \"Had I known who Dr Hagen was, I would not have allowed him anywhere near my children.\" then a thought occurred to him. \"He told us that he had removed the 'tumor' that caused Garth's body to build up, yet the symbiont...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amara said that Hagen only took a piece of her, stunning her enough to return me to normal.\" after a pause, Gar said. \"That can only mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He knows about the symbionts.\" his face turning white, dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Or, at least, he suspects.\"</i> worried, I thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was supposed to start teaching in a couple of days.\" sighing, Sarah said. \"I'll have to come up with a believable explanation for my absence, since no one is going to ever believe I'm on the run from some shadowy government organization.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief Jones will help you in any way he can,\" Lyssa replied. \"My mom will help, too. She's got to drop off my aunt at a treatment center, then she wants to talk with my cousin. She should be by sometime after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at the thought of Cait Spencer coming to the clubhouse. \"Maybe I can get the courage to tell her how I feel.\" dreamily, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone has a crush.\" smiling, Rhea whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that but, fortunately, the group was focused on Sarah and Todd at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell them thanks. Actually, though, I'm worried about how my absence will affect my homeroom class.\" with a grateful smile, Sarah said. \"As a baptism of fire, I've been assigned mother-hen status to a group of kids who've been classified as problem children.\" after a pause, I explained, \"They are a number of kids who aren't applying themselves well, a rich girl with an attitude problem, and a transgender student I'm supposed to keep my eye on in case of bullying. I don't know how they'll react if I'm not there; they might think I'm abandoning them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll be fine,\" reassuringly, Lyssa said, \"don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. You kids wouldn't be cruel to the transgender girl, would you?\" asked Sarah. \"You understand that she's going through a rough time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try to treat her well,\" Lyssa said, suppressing a chuckle. \"She looks me in the eye when I brush my teeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's eyes just about popped out of her head. \"Y-you're her? You-you look so feminine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's my turn to thank you,\" she said, turning around to show her figure. \"This past summer, I started turning into a complete girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story.

Both of them were still in the form of teenagers. \"Ms. Barns,\" Lyssa said, \"this is Cait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do?\" calmly, Cait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Barns shrugged. \"My life's turned upside-down and inside-out in the past week, but I'm holding together.\" looking shaken, she said. \"Ted says you can help me unravel my past?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try.\" stepping in front of Sarah, Cait replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that work?\" curious, Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax, and trust me.\" her voice almost echoing, Cait replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two made eye contact, both of their eyes fell half open as they stood, unmoving. \"Cait must be in Mrs Barns' mind right now.\" watching, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their auras are hugging.\" whispering in awe, Rhea said to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that then turned serious as I watched with the others. Minutes ticked by with the two unmoving as we could only watch, and hope. Then, Cait turned her head to the side. \"Bad guys?\" in a flat tone, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*No! No!* came Tobi's frightened voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Rhea and saw that she was just as startled and confused as I was. <i>\"What's wrong, Tobi?\"</i> concerned, I thought. <i>\"Talk to me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobi did not answer, all I heard was her silently sobbing in my head, making Rhea tear up as well. <i>\"Something scared her good but what?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait paused then rose her hands as if she were holding a rifle at Mrs Barns. <i>\"What's going on in her head?\"</i> curious, I thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'm trying to obey, Jon.\" apologetically, Cait said. \"I want to obey but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She must be getting caught in some memory.\"</i> wondering what to do, I thought. <i>\"This could turn ugly.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dared not voice my concern, fearful that I might interrupt the mental link at a bad time, but I stayed on guard as I saw Cait's hands begin to shake. She had an uncertain look on her face as if she were fighting conflicting emotions. \"I- I must obey.\" stammering, she said. \"Jon is my master, I am his slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clem, help her...\" fearful, Rhea whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Rhea, not knowing what to do. None of the others seemed to have heard Rhea's whispers and I began to wonder if I was hearing them in my head as she was too young to understand telepathy. I turned back to Cait as she spoke again, her hands still shaking. \"Mommy... daddy....\" tears forming, she whimpered. she then rose her hands, barely still as she blankly yelled, \"I must defend Jon! Do not come closer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGar turned to Ted, as if to look for advice then turned back to Cait as she once again quivered, crying. \"Jon... did.\" slowly, tearfully, she said, as if answering a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's gotten into Cait?\" concerned, Grace asked Gar. \"She's acting more and more like she's reliving a painful memory in Sarah's mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to panic anyone with my own fears, I turned to and shrugged. \"You're asking me? You're the one with the supercharged brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Look out!*</i> came Tobi's warning. <i>*Rhea, empty it!*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, I was about to ask what Tobi was talking about when a handgun suddenly materialized into Cait's hand and she turned to Gar, leveling it at his left shoulder. Everyone in the room froze as a sad smile formed onto her face.

No good will come of this if the others knew this happened, is that understood, Clem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly nodded then turned to Rhea, worried for her. \"I'm going to have grey hairs before I turn thirty.\" muttering, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will she be okay?\" more softly, Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"She just needs some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put her in one of the bedrooms to sleep.\" nodding back, Ted said. with that, he left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was told later that Cait was awake and I went up to check on her to meet Gar and the others. We could hear her talking to Lyssa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you awake?\" concerned, Lyssa asked. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" in a pained voice. Cait replied. \"I guess I did something stupid, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could call it that,\" walking past us, into the room, dad said. \"Apparently, you wanted to kill me, and tried to kill Garth. Good thing the gun you teleported wasn't loaded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good thing Rhea is still asleep.\"</i> wincing, I thought. <i>\"She's too honest for her own good.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right,\" sighing, Cait said. \"Ms. Barns still has her programming. I took her back through her memories, and stumbled onto it. When I tried to undo it, I got trapped in the programming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed nodded. \"So we'll need to be careful around her. Rhea's not going to like that, but we can't take chances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Gar spoke up, \"Is she back to normal yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still bald and telepathic,\" Cait called back, \"but not homicidal. Is that close enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGar stepped into the room, relieved to see Cait acting normally again. \"I'll take it.\" smiling slightly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of us entered behind him, relieved that Cait was doing better. Only I was more worried than the others as I knew a second hesitation would have brought a much different scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hagen was too clever for us,\" Ted explained. \"Cait's attempt to undo Barns' programming got her into a trap. The feedback loop from her unloaded gun knocked her out and freed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to be gentle with her, Chief,\" begging, Cait said. \"She's as much a victim as you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to remember that, Cait.\" nodding, Ted said. \"Thank you for the attempt. What do you want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go a few blocks away, and arrange for my driver to pick me up.\" with a rueful smile, Cait replied. \"See you guys at school tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you wouldn't rather spend the night here?\" Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait shook her head. \"I've got some personal stuff to check up on. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace smiled. \"You did what you could.\" sounding positive, she said. \"And the old Caitlin Spencer wouldn't have done half as much for us. See you at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed unlocked the handcuffs. As Cait stood up and rubbed her wrists, Ted asked, \"What was her trigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was 'Kiss Kiss, my dear',\" I replied. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea,\" was his answer. \"I'll have the kids tell you about it tomorrow, if it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even a hint?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"Let's just say Hagen wouldn't be the first person I've dealt with who turned out to be too clever for his own good.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I knew I would not have a chance if she did not have my phone number so I quickly wrote it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... call me later?\" offering the piece of paper, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait, also snapping out of her trance, shyly accepted the phone number and jotted down her own, offering it as well. \"Um... you call me, okay? I have to go to work after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mall?\" smiling, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" blushing, Cait said. \"I'm working as a living mannequin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I.\" to Cait's surprise, I replied. \"A salesgirl named Tracy Flynn suggested that I apply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you interviewed by a Mrs. Rachel Waite?\" looking at me, Cait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I was.\" nodding, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy.\" smiling, Lyssa said. \"You two are likely to end up on the same display.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Cait and I blushed at that as Lyssa gave us back our wigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cait later left, I wondered what Mr Jones had in mind to help Mrs Barns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the plan, dad?\" after Cait was gone, Gar asked. \"You saw the result of trying to fight the brainwashing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't fight the brainwashing, we use it.\" with a knowing smile, Ted replied. \"like a scorpion stinging itself, we make the brainwashing cancel itself out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" raising an eyebrow, Geo said. \"What do you propose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We use the trigger phrase then command her to ignore that phrase completely before using the trigger word again to bring her back to herself.\" confident, Ted said. \"Once that is done, the Agency will not be able to control her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Genius.\"</i> impressed, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, yet brilliant.\" impressed, Geo said. \"It's worth a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it.\" offering, Ted said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Sarah Barns still has a standing order in her subconscious to kill you.\" firmly but kindly, Geo said. \"I will do it.\" he then turned to Gar. \"Garth, I will need you and your dad as back up in case something goes wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGar nodded, though he looked uncertain. \"I'll do my best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Geo walked into the room where Sarah and Todd were being detained, I walked into a bedroom that was originally used by Lyssa's mother to find Rhea still asleep on the bed. \"Rhea...\" lightly shaking her, I said. \"Rhea, wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea moaned slightly then opened her eyes. \"Is it morning already?\" sleepily, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at her comment. \"I'm very proud of you, Rhea.\" softly, I said. \"You saved Gar from getting hurt, you are a hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea opened her mouth to speak but I placed a finger onto her lips. \"Don't tell anyone that there were bullets in that gun, okay?\" quietly, I told her. \"It would hurt your real mommy's feelings if she knew that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bad guys want mommy back, don't they?\" her lips trembling, she asked. \"Please don't let them take her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't get her with us around, I promise.\" touching her shoulder, I replied. \"Want to go see her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea eagerly nodded and I led her out of the room, down the hall where the others had gathered. \"Did it work?\" seeing Lyssa in the hall, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked like a charm,\" smiling, Lyssa replied. \"Chief Jones' hunch paid off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What hunch?\" confused, Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had a trigger phrase,\" Geo explained, \"which Hagen used to control you. Cait told us what it was, and we used it to shut down the mind-control system. Hagen won't be able to control you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you told me to kiss you?\" disturbed, Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeo nodded. \"That was your trigger. When I said it the first time, you went into a trance, ready for orders. If Hagen tries it again, he'll get a much different response from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded, looking relieved. \"So I'm good to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed smiled. \"We'll let you see more of the place, but they're still looking for you at your apartment. By the way, somebody's waiting to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the door open wide, Rhea rushed in with me following. \"Hi, Mommy,\" giving Sarah a big hug, Rhea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, sweetheart,\" Sarah replied. she turned to me \"Who's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Clem,\" smiling, I said, \"Rhea's brother. This is what I usually look like. Jessica was... something of a punishment. I called Lyssa by the wrong name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk, tsk. You shouldn't have done that.\" shaking a finger, Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am. Yesterday gave me some insight into what she went through all those years. It won't happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like Jessica,\" Rhea said, pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled. \"I meant that I won't call Alyssa the wrong name again. Maybe sometimes, I'll let Jessica out to play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all laughed, and Rhea told Sarah about the years since the Rodgers family adopted her. As we talked, we did not notice the others quietly leaving the room to give us a private moment with Sarah and her husband.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We have to be ready!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next breath, I heard Grace, Lyssa, and Garth screaming, \"DAD!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI came out of my room to see Ted run up the stairs with Geo following. \"What's wrong!?\" concerned, he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe relayed Cait's message to him and he was about to grab his smartphone when a panicked scream was heard, it was Rhea and, knowing her abilities, I guessed she got the same vision as Cait. Lyssa was in Rhea's room in a heart beat with the rest of us quickly following to find Rhea siting on her bed. She was shaking, wide eyed, and terrified as she looked out into the distance, crying. \"It's going to be okay, Rhea.\" as dad quickly walked off, dialing a number on his phone, Garth said. \"My dad is the chief of police, he will stop this before it happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- What about the wolves?\" still shaking. \"Who will deal with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGar increased in size to the size of an Olympian and made a 'muscle' pose. \"Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?\" using a poor Arnold Schwarzenegger imitation, he asked. \"I will pump him up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that Gar was trying to cheer Rhea up so I decided to mimic his poses behind him to add to the humor. For a moment, Rhea looked at Car as if he was insane then giggled, seeing me behind him, making the same poses but with my significantly smaller body. The others soon followed and Gar turned to see me; I just smiled. \"I couldn't resist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGar shook his head, smiling only that smile vanished when Ted walked back into the room. \"Okay, everyone, listen up.\" sternly, he said. \"I want all of you to act as if nothing is going on when you go to school but be ready for anything, understood!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded and got ready for school while Ted discretely took a hold of my arm. \"I'll take you and Rhea home.\" quietly, he said. \"Just tell your mom, Christina, that Tex says hi and she will understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Ted, stunned. \"My mom was a member...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she was not a member of the original group.\" motioning Rhea to follow, Ted replied. \"She and her husband, David were unrelated street orphans twenty years ago; the two became our contacts as they seemed to have a knack of gaining information from the shady parts of the city.\" smiling, he added, \"We called them Mr and Mrs Rogers to protect their identity and I guess it stuck when they later got married.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They... They lived on the streets?\" tearing up, Rhea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did not know where they lived.\" sighing, Ted replied. \"They were very secretive about that. However, they had since made a name for themselves, opening a law firm as they had unearthly experience dealing with the criminal element.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I wonder....\"</i> smiling back, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ted led Rhea and I out of the house to his squad car.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is my personal vehicle, customized by Megan's father. He was another member.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ted drove, I puzzled over everything I'd learned so far. The Problem Child Gang, the heroes of my favorite comic, were real. My friends were the children of the PCG. And my parents were involved in this, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrived at our house. As we got out of the car, Mom came out to greet us. \"Good to see you again,\" Ted said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise,\" Mom replied. \"How bad is it, Ted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to say.

Or that you were involved with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the same reason we didn't reveal where we came from,\" she replied. \"We were trying to make a home for ourselves, on a planet where the inhabitants had only gone as far as their own moon. It's quite a comedown from royalty, as you can imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We adopted the identities of young people, so nobody would be suspicious of our ignorance of the ways of this city. As we learned, we encountered certain persons who took great interest in the downtrodden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Problem Child Gang,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just them, Clem. We encountered the criminal element, as well. There were many who sought only to exploit the weaknesses of others, and many others who regarded them with disdain.\" She sighed. \"I won't go so far as to say I came to approve of the revolutionaries who drove us here, but I began to see their point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do, Mommy?\" Rhea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father and I began to study these criminals. When we saw that they trusted each other readily, we figured out a plan to bring them down. We would pose as members of the criminal fraternity, then relay what we learned to Ted and the others. They respected our privacy, and helped to conceal us where they could, passing us off as homeless when they told their detective friend about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the Agency?\" I asked. \"How much do they know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly more than they suspect. I can only say that, at the time, they figured out that someone was working on the fringes of the criminal element. If what you say about Rhea and her birth mother is true, they've begun tracking us through her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got Rhea scared. \"Th-they're going to hurt me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom dropped to her knees to Rhea. \"If they try, my little one, they will wish they hadn't,\" she said. \"Your father and I can become creatures this world has never seen. Against us, they will learn what it is to be afraid for their lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom straightened up again. \"For now, though, the two of you must learn more basic things.

Thanks to mom's methods of teaching, it was almost too easy for Rhea and I, we finished the work in less than an hour. \"Do not post that work yet.\" standing behind us, mom said. \"Posting too soon will throw up red flags.\" she smiled. \"Wait about an hour then post the work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do till then, mommy?\" curious, Rhea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"You continue to school with me.\" simply, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea and I both sighed but nodded as mom's lessons continued.

I spotted one that closely matched my hair color and thought, <i>*Wonder how this would look on Jennifer?*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Who's Jennifer?*</i> asked Cait, in my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped in surprise, momentarily forgetting that Cait could read minds. <i>*I'm a shape-shifter.*</i> thinking, I replied. <i>*Rhea likes it when I turn into a big sister for her, and she's taken to calling me Jennifer when I do that.*</i> blushing, I mentally added, <i>*She wants me to be her a little more often.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait smiled at that and I could only guess she was amused by the thought that Rhea had me neatly wrapped around her little finger. I was about to speak when the clerk returned. Cait pointed out a wig closer to Clem's hair and said, \"I think I'd like one of those, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk nodded and said, \"Just let me see to your friend, and I can pick up both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned to me, I could sense she had ill givings towards Cait. I did not know why but I decided to let it go as she did not say anything rude. I got my new wig and we paid for our purchases. Once we were out of the store, Cait gave me the second wig she had picked out. \"Jennifer should look lovely in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" shyly taking it from her, I said. \"So, what's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go home, if you like. I've got to go see Lyssa. She had a bad day today, and I want to see how she's doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go with you,\" serious, I replied. \"For two years, when Lyssa needed a friend, I stayed away. If she needs some cheering up, I want to do my part.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Does she think you own the store, and she'll be fired if she screws up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed. \"Imagine that you didn't know what telepathy was, and a girl my age walked in and started arguing with nobody. What would you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe implications sank in, and I gingerly touched her hand. \"She thinks you're... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait nodded, and took my hand. \"And I can't tell her she's wrong, 'cause I don't know who she'd tell. We've got enough problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrived at Lyssa's house. Mrs. Vance opened the door for us. \"Cait, good to see you.

How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked to her to reply, but started shaking his head instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll feel better on the ground,\" Cait said, holding her arms under him. \"Come down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam floated down into Cait's arms. \"You had too much blood going to your head,\" she explained to him. \"It was making you dizzy. Don't do that again. You might get hurt, and we don't want that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait placed Sam into Mrs. Vance's wheelchair, just as Lyssa came downstairs. \"Hey, guys,\" she said. \"Wow, Cait.

We were exiled to this planet, and we used our shape-shifting and reality-warping powers to fit in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ever read the Problem Child Gang comics?\" I chimed in. \"They really existed, and Mom and Dad helped them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked from one of us to another. \"How much of this do the other kids at school know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're home-schooled,\" Rhea answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are now,\" I clarified, \"but a lot of my friends from before are kids of the original Problem Child Gang, and they have powers of their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex sat down. \"This is a lot to take in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's more coming,\" Mom said. \"Oltroxian puberty is a little different from what humans go through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, and took off my wig. \"I'll take you to the wig shop tomorrow, after our lessons.\"</span></div></div>",

Your father and I only needed to change reality for ourselves and those who know this family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I know Alex as adopted rather than a part of the family?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we exempted you from that change, along with the other members of the Problem Child Gang.\" simply, mom replied. \"The reason I did this is because there are a number of members who can see right through the reality change, such as Beth Vance, Lilith Nightshade, Caitlin Spencer...\" I blushed at Cait's name and mom smiled. \"The point is, we would have to explain the situation again and again to those in our little circle who can see through the reality change. It's easier to have them all see the truth and be told we changed reality to make Alex our son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense, I guess.\" shrugging, I said. I then turned to Alex. \"Want to grab some pizza? I know you love that extra peperoni.\" I paused, surprised. \"How did I know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom laughed. \"You are not <i>completely</i> unaffected by the reality change, dear.\" amused, she said. \"You see, having 'grown up' with Alex, you would naturally know all of his likes and dislikes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is deep.\" sighing, Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Just accept what you know and the rest will follow with ease.\" kindly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she walked away as Alex sat onto a bed that had his name carved into the foot board. \"At least I won't be jumping from family to family anymore.\" sadly, he said. \"I just wish they could have done that with my real family.\" he sighed. \"No offense... bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got me thinking and I excused myself for a moment before walking to dad's study where I was surprised to find him waiting. \"I guess you know what I'm about to ask.\" softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"We did not have the heart to tell Alex what really happened.\" sadly, he said. \"We found his real parents but they were not alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face turned completely pale. \"What....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hit was professional, we suspect the Agency was after him.\" almost whispering, dad said. \"I have no doubt in my mind that they too have people who can see through local reality changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped at that. \"So you made him think they were still alive because...\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth would have destroyed his spirit.\" serious, dad replied. \"As such, your mom and I have just decided it would be in all of our best interests to join the other members underground as they will no doubt sense our reality shift and come searching for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Underground?\" startled, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Subterranean Urban Base station.\" patiently, dad replied. \"It was only vaguely mentioned in the books a few times but not what or where it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" feeling sorry for Alex, I said. \"When are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as soon as everyone can get packed.\" serious, dad said. he placed a hand onto my shoulder, seeing me beginning to shake. \"It will only be until we can deal with Sykes and the Agency once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be years from now.\" tears falling, I said. \"What of school, friends...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be going to regular school as long as you stay on alert for trouble.\" smiling, dad replied. \"Try not to worry, everything will work out, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I walked back to my room to find mom talking to Rhea, she seemed upset. I guessed she did not like the idea of living underground. I sighed, knowing mom was better suited to talk to her than I and walked into my bedroom to tell Alex the news. He took it a lot better than I had feared and we began to pack. Minutes later, just as we were about to leave....<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I looked over at him, to see he now had a bald spot, and was holding a handful of what I knew was his hair. \"My scalp itched,\" he explained. \"I just scratched, like normal, but... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"I was asleep when my hair fell out. I'm sure Mom and Dad have a wig or two for you. They're homemade, so they'll look kind of rough, but they'll cover your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding at one of my bundles, Alex asked, \"What's with the girl's wig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, Rhea likes to pretend she has a big sister. Since I can change shape, I get to play Jessica for her. I'll bet Mom has a female identity picked out for you, too, so don't laugh too loudly at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad came up. \"Ready, boys?\" He saw Alex's hair. \"Honey, Alex needs his wig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a hunch he would,\" came Mom's voice as she climbed the stairs. Walking up to Alex, she produced a hairbrush. \"Don't fight me on this, Alex, we might as well get as much of this off as we can before we put your wig on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gave Alex a thorough brushing, removing about half the hair on his head. \"The rest will come off in due time,\" Mom assured him. Then, she gave him his wig to put on. \"I've received word from Ted. There are five families down below already, with more to come. Good thing the S.U.B. Station has so much room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S.U.B. Station?\" Alex asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"Subterranean Urban Base. It was always a fallback position for the Problem Child Gang. Now, it seems, it's time to fall back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all followed Dad to his den. It was the first time I'd ever been in that room, as Dad kept a strict rule about only going in if invited. Now, I could see the reason for such strictness, as he opened a secret door in his bookcase. As a kid, I would have played with that thing for hours, if I'd had the chance. \"This way to the S.U.B. Station,\" he said. \"This'll be our home until things are straightened out.\"</span></div></div>",

Sumer vacation was almost over, I would be moving up to high school and, with any luck, lose my junior high title of being a 'problem child'. \"I can't stand it when a kid is being knocked around and all the teachers do is watch.\" I said to myself. \"Their job is not only to teach but help provide a safe environment for the students to learn.\" you sighed. \"Someone has to stand up for the 'underdog'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of kids look up to you for that, Gar.\" said dad, standing in the doorway of my bedroom. \"I know a few teachers who think highly of you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to my dad, sighing. He was tall, very muscular, with short brown hair and brown eyes, like myself. At the age of 35, he was a captain in the Waterfront City police department, he knew how bad the streets and schools could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't they step up?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do, son.\" replied dad with a sigh. \"Only they have to do so in a professional manner, they can't just step in and slap the aggressor silly as you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"Politely asking a bully to stop only works in fairy tales, dad.\" I stated. \"I know, you told me a thousand times, I can't take the law into my own hands but you know me, I can't stand to see others suffer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a good quality, Garth.\" said dad, patiently. \"I can see you as a fine police officer in the future but for now, please promise me... no more fights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that my dad was serious, he was tired of constantly getting calls from the school to be informed that I jumped into another skirmish on school property. \"I promise there will be no fights, started by me.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We never accused you of starting the fights, Garth.\" said mom, stepping in. \"You just can't seem to help trying to end them, we're afraid that one of the fights will involve a knife... or worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was just as tall as dad but she was very petite with long flowing black hair and blue eyes. She had a figure most models would kill for and it annoyed me no end when my friends made verbal note of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't just stand there and watch...\" I said, tearing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more fights in school!\" said dad, sternly. \"I'm to the point that, when the phone rings, I'm going to hear that you had been stabbed or shot! How do you think your mom and I or your older sister, Grace would feel then!?\" he shook his head. \"I bust dirt bags on the streets every day!  There are a few I would <i>love</i> to slap silly but I have to uphold the law, the same law you must follow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" I said, softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad took a breath. \"I know you want to help, son.\" he said. \"But you are on a dangerous path right now, I do not want to be the one to bury you before it is my time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" I said, crying slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad, knowing that he was becoming overly harsh, walked away with mom soon following. <i>\"They don't understand me at all.\"</i> I thought, turning of the light. <i>\"I only want to make them proud of me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slept uneasily that night, I kept feeling a tightness all over as if my own pajamas were trying to smother me. I woke up slightly in the middle of the night, hearing my bed and the floor underneath it moaning. At first, I thought it was someone trying to break into the house but I quickly drifted back to sleep, my dad's words echoing in my mind. <i>\"No more fights!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up the next morning, feeling refreshed and energetic. I could not believe how great I felt, despite the night I had and decided to take a shower. Dad had already left for work so it was just me, mom, and Grace. <i>\"Dad's only trying to protect me from harm.\"</i> I thought. <i>\"I'll tell him that I'll try to break up fights without actually fighting.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill half asleep, I turned on the water and disrobed to step into the shower. As I did, I caught a glimpse at myself in the mirror and thought I had seen dad. Looking closer, I discovered that the reflection was me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, I screamed at the top of my lungs, shaking the room....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can't move!\" I yelled, crying. \"Help me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the floor gave way and I fell into the basement with Grace screaming my name. I hit the basement floor hard and let out a scream of my own as my body felt like it was literally on fire. Soon after, I heard the sound of sirens as the ambulance arrived, just after my dad had reached home. The last thing I heard before I lost consciousness was my dad calling out to me. \"Hang on, Garth! We're here, we're here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, I woke up to find that...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It felt as if my body had been thrown into a giant blender and reduced to a pasty mess. I heard myself moan, which hurt my throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think he's starting to come around.\" I hear one voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already?\" asked another, lower voice. \"I guess you were right about him being tough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt something cold touch my chest, causing me to moan again as even the slightest touch seemed to hurt me. \"Sorry.\" said the low voice. \"You are going to be very sensitive for a while.\" he paused then the cold object was lifted. \"His heart rate has returned to normal, the worst is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard sighs of relief around me and then a 'beep beep beep' somewhere nearby. By this time, I was conscious enough to realize that it was a vitals monitoring machine which meant I was in the hospital. I tried to shift positions as I was very uncomfortable but it hurt too much to move and i moaned again. \"He's starting to stir.\" I heard Grace say. \"Garth, can you hear me, open your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did my best to do so but the light of the room stabbed my eyes, causing another moan to escape my lips as I snapped them shut again. A moment later, I felt the lights dim and I made a second attempt. This time I was able to keep them open and my eyes soon focused to see my family looking over me, smiling with tear stained faces. \"Welcome back to the world of the living, bro.\" said Grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gave us all a real scare, son.\" said dad. \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to answer but it hurt to even moan. Still, I managed to quietly say two words. \"All hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad did not hear me and asked me to repeat it but mom cut him off. \"He said everything hurts, Ted.\" she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard that from the other side of the bed?\" asked dad, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"When you work with children, sent to the ER for ten years like I have, you too will develop a good ear.\" she said. \"I'm not surprised that everything hurts, he went from a size twelve to a size sixty and back in less than four hours.\" she managed a small grin. \"Talk about a crash diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI weakly laughed at that but it came out sounding like a raspy cough, though I had a grin on my face. Seeing it, Grace smiled. \"I'm glad that you can still laugh, bro.\" she said. \"I know everything hurts so, for now, just listen.\" she turned to a person out of my line of sight. \"Doctor Hagen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man in hospital scrubs walked into my sight and looked me in the eye. \"Yes, well you condition was caused by an unusual tumor that had grown onto your adrenal gland, causing it to constantly secrete both adrenaline and testosterone into your system.\" he explained. \"Normally, such a condition would have killed a man in less than an hour but your body somehow adapted rather than falling into shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagen suddenly smiled as he took up a chair and continued to look me in the eye. \"You see, we found evidence that your pituitary gland, responsible for bodily growth, had mysteriously gone into overdrive.\" he said, sounding enthused. \"Also, we found evidence that your muscles had gone through intense hypertrophic adaptation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound excited by all of this, doctor.\" said dad, unimpressed. \"I'm more worried about the pain my son in right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Mr. Jones.\" replied Hagen, standing up. \"I will order another run of morphine immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked out of the room with mom following. \"I'll make sure he gets it in quickly.\" she said, looking at me. \"I'll be back as soon as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was gone, chasing after Hagen, dad shook his head. \"You find a new medical mystery and the leading doctor is more worried about writing a paper about it than the patient who is suffering.\" he muttered. \"Unbelievable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take first watch.\" offered Grace. \"Mom is a wreck and you have to be back on duty in four hours, you should both go home and get some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shook his head. \"I took my two weeks vacation early.\" he said. \"But I will take mom home for some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, I was injected with the morphine IV while mom and dad said their goodbyes, promising that Grace would stay with me. \"We'll be back first thing tomorrow morning, honey.\" said mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care, Garth.\" said dad. \"We'll see you in a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, they left the hospital for home to get some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gr...

Grace, who was watching television at the moment, heard my moan and turned to me as I opened my eyes and saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, bro.\" she said with a smile. \"Are you feeling any better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything still hurts.\" I replied softly. \"Just not as bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you can talk better.\" said Grace. \"You've been out cold for nearly ten hours, it's seven at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened in surprise. \"I slept the entire day!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace smiled. \"Yep. I was scared that you had slipped into a coma for a while there.\" she paused. \"Do you feel up to having something to eat, you haven't had anything since dinner last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" I replied, wincing. \"I don't know if anything will stay down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could run across the street and get you one of those nutrient shakes.\" offered Grace. \"You have to eat <i>something</i>, Garth, you need to build your strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not like the idea of Grace leaving me alone for any amount of time with that enthusiastic doctor Hagen running about but I was not about to admit it. \"Maybe... Maybe I can try a hot bowl of chicken noodle soup.\" I said, trying to sit up. \"The cafeteria should still be open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give them a call.\" picking up the phone, Grace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dialed the proper number and got the kitchen on the second ring. \"This is Grace Jones in room 436.\" she said. \"My brother, Garth finally woke up and he would like to order a bowl of chicken noodle soup.\" there was a pause before she then said, \"I'll ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace turned to me. \"Would you like some crackers with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced. \"Some white bread would be nice.\" I said, meekly. \"Maybe some milk to wash it down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sister nodded then turned back to the phone. \"He would like a few slices of white bread and a carton of white milk with his order, please.\" she said. \"Me? Oh, I'll have the same, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ending the call, she turned back to me and smiled as she found that I had managed to reach the bed controls and sat myself up. \"It's good to see you sitting up after lying down all day.\" she told me. \"You better try to get to the bathroom before your dinner gets here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my sister, uncertain. I knew that she was right as it was try to get to the bathroom or have the nurses use some method to control it for me, which did not appeal to me at all. \"I... I might need your help.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm right here, bro.\" said Grace, pulling the covers off of me. \"I won't let you fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, painfully, I managed to slide off the bed and stand onto my own two feet. As I did, I gripped the bed rail and, without realizing it, I completely crushed the metal. Grace saw this and swallowed hard but she stayed right beside me, helping me to steady myself as I took my first step. I felt my knees shake as if I had never walked before. \"I feel like a baby taking my first steps.\" i muttered, sourly. \"This is so embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your body nearly exploded due to a tumor on your adrenal gland, anyone else would have died from that, it's a miracle that you are even alive right now.\" said Grace, comforting me. \"Look at yourself, your body returned to normal within two hours after the doctor removed the tumor. Such a shock to the body would have killed anyone else and here you are, ten short hours later, already walking to the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed brightly at that. \"I didn't think about it that way.\" I said. \"I guess I am very lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace blushed as she pulled my drawers down and guided me down onto the toilet. \"I'll give you some privacy.\" she said, after washing her hands. \"Just call me when you are ready to go back to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded as Grace then left the bathroom and closed the door. Unknown to me, she looked at the bed rail and shivered. \"What is happening to you, Garth?\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, I was back in bed, wondering why a section of my bed rail was wrapped in medical gauze. \"It's for luck.\" Grace told me. she smiled then added, \"It's a long story, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged then turned as someone had knocked on my door...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I heard that someone had finally woken up and is a little hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me.\" I said, shyly. \"I'm not sure if anything will stay down, though. I'm still hurting pretty bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace giggled after turning to me. \"Well I haven't seen you drool like that since mom last cooked her homemade pizza.\" she said, smiling. \"Or are you finding the young Sarah here attractive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed brightly at that as Sarah giggled with Grace. \"I'm sure he's starving.\" said Sarah, pulling out a try with a number of covered dishes. \"I'll get him his tray so he can start on his meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Grace operated the bed controls, bringing me to a sitting position before pushing my bed try into place. \"I want you to eat every last bite, Garth.\" she said in a motherly tone. \"You need the nutrients if you are going to get better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that. \"Yes, <i>mom.</i>\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you sass me, bro.\" warned Grace, with a smirk. \"Mom and dad told me to make sure you eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, though still smiling, and lifted the cover off the main dish. The aroma that kissed my nostrils forced me to moan with a certain delight. Before I knew what was happening, I was hungrily (but politely) devouring the soup. As Grace worked on her own soup, she occasionally glanced over to me and giggled, seeing how hungry I really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he's going to need another order of soup.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, who was walking out the door whispered her reply. \"There's twenty four hour take out restaurant just next door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace nodded then quietly finished her meal as I did so about the same time. \"I can't believe I'm still hungry.\" I said, hearing my groaning stomach. \"That was a fairly good sized bowl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not, those changes you went through must have burned an insane amount of calories.\" said Grace, looking at me. \"Don't worry, as soon as mom comes to relieve me I'll run out and get you something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled but it flattened as a thought came to me. \"Um... Grace, what happened to all that extra mass I gained when I grew in size?\" I asked her. \"I mean, it couldn't have just vanished, it had to have gone somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace shook her head. \"I'm not sure.\" she replied. \"There was a lot of excitement in the ER while you were being treated, unconscious but you were back to normal when we were finally able to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means only that Dr Hagen can answer that question.\" I said, shuddering a little. \"He seems too excited by my condition, if you can call it that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll talk to mom when she arrives.\" promised Grace. \"Maybe she can get some answers for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was a huge surprise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, champ!\u201d dad said, as he walked in a slowly wandered over to the side of the bed, as he gently punched me in the shoulder. \u201cI heard you gave mom and Grace quite a scare before she dialed 9-1-1 this morning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I guess\u2026\u201d I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the other hand, I saw how huge you had become... some growth spurt, huh?\u201d he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah\u2026 Grace thought I was you!\u201d I chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGar looked just like <i>you</i>, dad! When I walked into the bathroom, I thought you were standing there, brushing your teeth or something!\u201d Grace added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m happy to see that everything turned out okay\u2026\u201d dad said, just as the nurse walked in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there, Mr. Jones! I came to check up on the vital signs before we could release you tonight\u2026\u201d Nurse Sarah said, as she walked up to the side of my bed. She dutifully took my temperature and my blood pressure. \u201cDr. Hagen would like you to come back on Thursday for some x-rays, alright? He just wants to make a follow-up appointment with you just to see that everything is okay!\u201d she paused, then added, \"It's amazing how quickly you healed up after you got a bite to eat... (giggle)... it must be the hospital food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone chuckled at that as mom followed nurse Sarah out into the hall to talk for a moment. Meanwhile, dad helped me gather all my clothes before I got out of the bed and took everything with me to the small bathroom where I quickly got dressed. A few minutes later, I was able to walk out of the hospital, along with my sister, my mother and my dad. What a relief! I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt so good walking into my own bedroom about an hour later. I missed my computer, my X-box and my own bed! Not only that, but I was looking forward to taking a shower in my own bathroom again, and wearing my own clothes. The service in the hospital was great, but as the saying goes, \u201cHome Sweet Home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes after I had gotten home, I noted that I had lost my watch. Grace and mom had helped carry my stuff into the house, and I figured that they may have dropped something when carrying stuff from the car to my bedroom. So, while wearing my shorts and a t-shirt, I quietly wandered out to the covered garage while the rest of the family was already fast asleep. I turned on the lights in the garage as I walked over to mom\u2019s new Grand Cherokee SUV. I opened the passenger door and looked around, and I didn\u2019t see my watch anywhere. Then, after I closed the door, I looked down and I spotted my plastic watch on the concrete floor, just under the front tire of the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked over towards the front of the large SUV and bent down to retrieve the small watch, I held on to the front bumper of the vehicle. As I looked down, I noticed how easily I was making the large car rock sideways just by pushing gently against the bumper with my hand. That was strange. Didn\u2019t a big SUV like a Jeep Grand Cherokee weigh something like over three-thousand pounds\u2026 or more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bent down and retrieved my watch, putting it around my right-wrist. But, before I turned around to walk away, I looked back at the SUV. The large vehicle just seemed very light. A thought had entered my mind to try something. For a moment, I thought the idea was very silly, but then again, why not? I noticed that the vehicle moved very easily, whenever I placed my hand against the side of it and even gave it a gentle push. It seemed as if it had become lighter to me. Could I even try to lift it, just for fun?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked to the front side of the Cherokee and I placed my hand under the bumper. Once I was certain I had a good, firm grip on the bottom part of the steel bumper, I flexed my arm just slightly in my attempt to lift up the front half of the car. To my big surprise, I was able to lift the SUV off the ground, high enough, so that both front tires were hanging suspended above the concrete floor of the garage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d I gasped, when I realized how easily I was capable of lifting the SUV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gently squatted down, allowing the front tires to touch the floor again. Then, I lowered myself all the way down, until the vehicle was resting back on the ground. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Was it normal for a fourteen-year-old boy to have the strength to lift a SUV off the ground with one hand? I quickly turned around and switched off the lights before I walked back into my bedroom. I decided to keep this little experiment a secret for the time being. I didn\u2019t tell anybody about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as I walked in my room, mom confronted me with another housework or yard work assignment, which was her usual thing to do on the days when I was home for a whole day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, can you rake the lawn for me, sweetheart?\u201d mom asked me with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw mom\u2026 I just got home from the hospital and you\u2019re already putting me to work!\u201d I groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss, honey\u2026 And while you\u2019re at it, try to get the baseballs and tennis balls out of the gutter, will you?\u201d mom added, as she gently rubbed the palm of her hand over my chin. \u201cI\u2019ll make a big pasta and chili dinner for you, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! I\u2019m already hungry!\u201d I sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked out the door and as I headed out to the garage, I spotted all the leaves in the yard. I walked closer and exhaled, emptying my lungs as I was facing the lawn. I was surprised to see how the mighty gust of air which had escaped from my mouth had caused all the leaves to fly up and fly off to the corner!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! I didn\u2019t blow that hard, did I?\u201d I whispered to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took the rake in the garage and started gathering all the leaves that were scattered all over the lawn. Finally, when I had everything in one pile, I crammed all the leaves in the trash bag, which I left by the trash can. Then, I turned my attention to the gutters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t looking forward to getting the ladder out of the garage, and I was hoping there was a way I could just catch a glimpse of where the balls were, so I could fish them out of the gutter using the rake. I wondered if I could just jump high enough, so that I could see what was on the roof?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a few steps back and squatted down, before making my body leap straight up in the air. To my big surprise, I soared over fifteen feet into the air, before coming straight down on my feet again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! What the heck? I didn\u2019t know I could jump that high!\u201d I exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized that if I could jump that high, I wouldn\u2019t need a ladder to get on the roof. I could just leap from the ground to the roof!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a few steps back and then, with one mighty leap, and vaulted into the air, landing on the rooftop of my house! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn! That was easy!\u201d I chuckled, looking down from where I was standing. I must have leaped over twenty feet into the air! I wondered if I had broken any records by doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gathered the tennis balls and softballs which were stuck in the gutter, and I tossed them to the ground below. Then I used my mighty breath to blow the leaves and branches off the roof, before I easily leaped off the roof and landed with my feet on the ground below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d I laughed. If I can leap that high, I wonder how fast I can run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust for fun, I decided to go for a short jog. I was wearing my shorts and my tennis shoes, and nobody else was around to see me, and what my mom was concerned, I was still doing yard work, so this was a good time to have some fun with my newfound strength. I headed out the driveway and increased the speed, while going down the street and heading towards the main street. As I was running, I noticed that I was going faster and faster without even getting tired. In fact, it felt as if the muscles in my legs were actually up for the workout and liking it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was going faster and faster, almost passing the cars by! Fortunately, I was on a bike path, obscured by trees, so i really was not seen from the road. After a few minutes, as I came to an intersection, I realized that I needed to head back and cross the road. The red light was holding me back, and I had three lanes of traffic blocking me, so what to do? I did something crazy: I just leaped over the intersection! I figured that if I was strong enough to leap over a house, then I was strong enough to leap across an intersection as well. I vaulted over the street and landed on the other side, where the sidewalk was, so that I could run back. Again, fortunately, I was not seen as I momentarily looked back to find traffic was still flowing smoothly, no one had stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I finally made my way home, I hadn\u2019t even broken out in a sweat and mom had no idea that I had gone for my 'light' jog down the street. The yard was all cleaned up and the gutter was cleared. Only now, I was absolutely starving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a rush!\" I whispered, happily. \"That was incredible, I wonder what else I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon walking in the door of the house, I reached down and noted that my quads and my calves were bulging with new layers of muscle. <i>Wow\u2026 It was like these little workouts were just making me stronger!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, I was happy that I was super strong. My biggest concern, however, was keeping this super strength a secret from my family, my friends, and my classmates in school.

I was surprised to find that I was having a difficult time moving, as if I had pulled every muscle in my body. \"I think I might have over did it the other day when I did the yard work.\" muttering, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged it off and turned to leave my room only to find mom standing in the door of my room, blocking my advance. \"Where do you think you are going, mister?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at mom, surprised, I replied, \"Um... to school, where else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head and pointed at my bed. \"One, school does not start for another two weeks.\" she said. \"Second, as you put it, you just got out of the hospital so back to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't seem this concerned when you had me do yard work yesterday.\" I grumbled lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed, looking guilty, then pointed down at my larger leg muscles. \"That was before you suddenly gained muscle mass again, Garth.\" she said. \"Grant you, its not nearly as bad as the first time but I'm scared that you might have a relapse if I push you, or worse, you push yourself.\" she paused. \"Please go back to bed, dad and Grace have already given me the riot act for making you work yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, wanting to test my strength on at the school football field while no one was there. Only, I did not want to cause mom any trouble so I reluctantly nodded and changed back into my pajamas. \"I feel just fine, mom.\" I told her, crawling into bed. \"I just wanted to throw the ball around on the football field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want our family physician, Dr. Stone, to give you a once over anyway.\" said mom, tucking me in. \"He just got back from vacation, dad is on the phone with him now.\" she gave me a weak smile. \"If he gives you a clean bill of health, you can go but not alone. I do not feel right with you having this... condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced at that. \"Geez, mom, you make it sound like I have a disease or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garth, you went through something that would have normally killed any other man!\" said mom. \"You then literally healed overnight, even the wound from the emergency surgery to remove that tumor was gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed hard. \"Do you think I'm... still recovering?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly don't know what to think, dear.\" replied mom, wearily. \"Just promise me that you'll stay in bed until Dr. Stone has a look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, feeling frustrated. \"I promise mom.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled, looking relieved. \"Thats a good lad.\" she said. \"I'll be back in a few minutes with some breakfast, you just rest up until Dr. Stone can come see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, mom walked out of the room, turning off the lights and closing the door as she left. Once alone, you crossed your arms, frustrated. \"This is fun.\" I whispered, sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a soft knock came to my door before it opened and in came...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We had to buy new pajamas for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New pajamas?\" I asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace sighed and picked up my school shirt, all of the seams were torn out. \"You are at least a size bigger than you were when you left the hospital.\" she said. \"Doing that yard work caused your body to grow again, which is why dad went went through the roof and called Dr. Stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think that tumor has grown back already!?\" I asked, somewhat alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know.\" replied Grace, tearing up. \"The next time you explode like you did, you might not survive it.\" she began to sob a little. \"You shouldn't have been released so soon but that Dr Hagen was getting too interested in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, you pushed for my release?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad pushed for your release as your body seemed to have healed completely.\" replied Grace, rubbing her tears. \"But he then asked Dr Stone set up shop at the hospital in case you have a relapse of what had happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to tell Grace what I had discovered but I was not sure what it all meant myself.

I think mom sensed that and gave me something to do.\" I shrugged, hiding my nervousness. \"Maybe there's some left over testosterone and adrenaline in my system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" said Grace, nodding. \"Only that would not explain how you had grown two full sizes in measurements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you inquire about what happened to the extra mass when I changed back to normal?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Hagen had no explanation for it.\" replied Grace. \"He said it was yet another mystery surrounding your case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI allowed my head to fall. \"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace sighed then placed a hand onto my shoulder. \"You are going to need a whole new wardrobe.\" she said, smiling. \"What do you say to a mall trip with me and a few friends?\" she paused, seeing my reluctance. \"It will get you out of the house and allow you to show off your new buff look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed slightly at that. \"Alright, I'm in but after I see Dr. Stone.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We decided to go to the large sports store, where they had some sweats on sale. I found the largest sweat pants and shirt and I walked over to the counter to pay for them when something caught my eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at these cool new treadmills!\" I said to my sister, as we walked past their latest models. I was only wearing shorts and sneakers and a tank top, so I decided to try out the treadmill just for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped on the machine and pressed the start button. As the belt below my feet began to move, I started walking. I quickly accelerated and turned the walk into a light jog. A few seconds later, I was running. I was going faster and faster. It felt awesome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garth! Get off that thing!\" Grace shouted. \"You're still recovering from your illness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly began to hit the brakes and started to slow down until the treadmill came to a complete stop. Then I hopped off and walked up to her, when it happened again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt that weird tingle in my legs. It wasn't painful or anything, just weird. I let out a soft moan, which Grace noticed as my calves ballooned out from the back of my legs and grew to the size of melons! My skin was paper thin and veins started to pop out all over them! Next, my thighs began to swell, as they expanded sideways and thickened in every direction. Within seconds, my legs had become twice as thick as they were before, and they were absolutely bursting with muscle! I felt like I was walking on rocket boosters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garth! Your legs! Look at you! You spent three minutes on the treadmill and your leg muscles just exploded!\" Grace gasped. \"We need to tell mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh boy... At least, we may have figured out what had caused my muscles to blow up. I didn't mind it. I use my muscles all the time! So am I gonna be a Hulk from now on? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

First, though, I have an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If exercise builds your muscles,\" she explained, \"perhaps a lack of exercise will shrink them. Until further notice, Garth, I want you to stay in bed. You can only go as far as the bathroom, if you need a shower, or if you finally need to use the toilet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't like the sound of that. \"What am I supposed to do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garth,\" she said, \"I'm ordering you to get in bed, where you are to do nothing but watch TV and play video games. If you think this is a punishment, I'm sure none of your friends will see it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right about that. I knew nobody else would hate the idea of doing nothing all day.

I still felt as if I was going to literally jump out of my own skin and with my forced inactivity, that feeling was steadily increasing, driving me utterly mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going stir crazy!\" I yelled, more to myself. \"I need something to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a knock came to my door and dad walked in with a gentle look on his face. \"Hey, sport.\" he said. \"I heard you've been thrown into 'jail'.\" he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like jail, dad.\" I replied wearily. \"I'm going nuts, just lying around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"I spend several weeks in the hospital when I took a bullet in the back in my rookie years.\" he said. \"The slug barely missed my spine but I was still unable to move for a good fourteen days, it was maddening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you do know how I feel.\" I said, grateful. \"How did you deal with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad looked around as if he was about to do something he shouldn't then handed me a number of DVDs. \"I watched a lot of science fiction and horror movies.\" he replied. \"These are all rated R but I think what you are facing is nothing compared to the content of these classic flicks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, I looked at the titles then turned back to dad, amused. \"These movies might have been rated R when you saw them, dad.\" I told him. \"But they are nothing when pit against todays horror flicks.\" I took a hold of his hand. \"Still, these are <i>true</i> classics, thanks, dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"You're welcome, Garth.\" he said. \"Maybe I'll come in and watch one with you tonight over supper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great, dad.\" I said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad returned my smile then patted my shoulder as I released his hand. \"We'll talk more later, son.\" he said. \"I have a mountain of paperwork to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he left.

In fact, I was more than healthy, I was super strong! Even as I pulled up the covers of my bed, I saw my thick, muscular legs. I ran my hand over my quads and smiled as I felt my thick, hard legs. If only I knew how to make them shrink back to normal again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went by, I started getting very bored. I heard raindrops falling on the roof of the house, indicating that a rainstorm was starting to pass over the area. Great\u2026 Now there really was no other reason to go outside anymore. So, I may as well just stay inside after all. Oh well\u2026 Normally, when the weather was bad, I would just crawl in bed and fall asleep. There was just something about the sound of rain. As the rain intensified and I saw flashes of lightning and I heard rumbles of thunder, I figured that I may as well try to get some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to lie on my side and I clenched my pillow, before I glanced at the clock. It was about 4 in the afternoon, so what I was hearing was that typical afternoon thunderstorm. The next thing that happened was that I dozed off into a deep sleep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I opened my eyes, the first thing I noted was that it was dark everywhere. The window was open but it was also dark outside! Holy smoke! I glanced at my digital clock and I saw that it was about 8:30PM! Wow! I had been asleep for the past 4-and-a-half hours!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over to the bathroom when I noticed something odd about my reflection in the mirror: My hugely muscular legs had returned to normal! That was it! Sleeping for a few hours had gotten rid of my hulking muscles! I didn\u2019t have to stay locked up in my bedroom anymore! YAY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! Mommmm!!\u201d I cheered, as I rushed out of my room and ran into the living room. \u201cLook!

So what did you do?\u201d Mom asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI fell asleep on my bed! I just took a nap and when I woke up\u2026 Those huge muscles were GONE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we\u2019ll just have to let the doctor know! Very good!\u201d Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a relief.

I felt like a child, having to always have my older sister with me everywhere I went but I agreed as it got me out of the house for a few hours. As we walked with our back packs over our shoulders, Grace insisted that we take our time walking to the school to prevent any 'hulking out'. That annoyed me no end as I still felt as if I was on the mother of all sugar rushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that this is killing you, Gar.\" said Grace as we finally reached Goliath High School. \"Just try not to hulk out too much, the fewer people who know about you medical condition, the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe football field was outside the school gates and was free for anyone's use when school was out. I pulled my football out of my pack pack and lightly tossed it to Grace. Only lightly to me now was like a heavy throw to Grace and she grunted slightly, catching the ball. \"Easy, bro.\" she scolded, rubbing her chest. \"That hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm sorry.\" i said, blushing. \"I did throw it lightly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you, Gar.\" she said, tossing the ball back to me. \"Try throwing it as if you were...\" she then blushed. \"...as if you were tossing it to a toddler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that but wiped it off my face when i saw she was being serious. \"I'll try.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then very lightly tossed the ball, as if it were made of glass and Grace caught it with less effort this time. \"Much better.\" she said. \"It seems as if your natural strength is growing with each 'hulking' experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like we're starting to piece this puzzle together.\" I told her. \"Hopefully, we'll get the whole picture soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace smiled. \"One piece at a time.\" she said. \"Let's see where this one fits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed at that. \"With our luck, its a corner piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace laughed but but froze as she saw two boys walking onto the field, carrying baseball bats. \"Gar, we have some bad company coming.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned and inwardly moaned, seeing two of the school's biggest bullies walking towards Grace and me. They both worked for a local gang in the city, roughing up kids for money in a secret protection racket. Of course, no one could prove it, these boys were as slick as they came. The students they could not control out of fear, they paid off. Only two refused to back down, either way, me and Grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like cash time as come early.\" said one muscular boy. \"What do you say we give them our new offer, Clyde?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they'll really like our new offer, Kyle.\" said Clyde with a smirk. \"It's our new family policy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two idiots blabbing about?\" I asked, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple really.\" said Kyle, grabbing Grace's hair. \"You pay up or we make her life... uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace screamed as Kyle forcibly dragged her by the hair around the corner of the school, two steps away, out of my line of vision. I had no idea that she had a few surprises of her own for Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pay up or my associate will make your sister's face look like raw hamburger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes narrowed with a primal sort of rage and I felt the tingling sensation growing again, only this time, it was everywhere and, at the time, I had no intention of stopping it. I felt my calves and hips grew at an alarming rate as my biceps and triceps grew with them, forcing Clyde to take a step back, his face turning an ashen white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.... Kyle...\" he said, hoarsely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Grace screaming and thought she was in danger, little did I know she was giving Kyle the beating of his life with moves she had taught herself watching Kung-Fu movies. Seeing him being kicked to a pulp by Grace, Clyde knew he was on his own and turned back to me, shaking his head, terrified. Fortunately for me, I could smell marijuana on his breath and assumed that Kyle was high as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am having a very bad week .\" I told Clyde, smiling slightly. \"You would be wise not to anger me today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it.\" said Clyde, his voice high in fear. \"No problem, we're out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he ran off and you turned the corner to find Grace giving him one last kick to the gut, sending him stumbling backwards, you caught him. \"I think you are confusing us for someone else.\" I said, calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle took one look at me and ran off, screaming. As I watched him run off in a panic, I turned to Grace. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace nodded. \"Just annoyed.\" she said. \"What a bunch of jerks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fine then.\" I said with a sigh. \"That's a relief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took in a cleansing breath and slowly let it out. As I did, another piece of the puzzle was found as Grace watched my muscles return to normal. \"Gar, you returned to normal.\" she said. \"That relaxing breath must have helped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remembered a relaxation technique the school councilor tried to teach me last year. \"I said, blushing slightly. \"I guess it really does work.\" I then sighed, pulling out my cellphone. \"We better report this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second I said that, Grace ripped out her own cellphone and started dialing. Who called dad first...?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is me! I\u2019m at school with Gar! We were just tossing the football around when two thugs approached us and started threatening us near the back of the main building. Yeah\u2026 Well, Gar Hulked out again and scared them away! Yes, it was amazing! Well, they started pulling my hair and they wanted money, but they freaked when they saw Garth\u2019s muscles blow up! No\u2026 They won\u2019t tell anyone\u2026 They were completely stoned! You could smell the drugs from a mile away! Nobody else saw us! Yes, we\u2019re alright\u2026 Garth is fine, his muscles returned to normal\u2026 Yes, we\u2019re coming home right now\u2026 Okay, bye\u2026 Love you dad\u2026 Bye!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just stared at my sister for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat took a lot of guts, you know?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHoney, can you run down to the convenience store and pick up a gallon of milk?\u201d mom had asked me, just as I had taken my seat on the couch. I wanted to enjoy the basketball game on TV, but mom had other plans. She just loved giving me stuff to do whenever I just wanted to sit down and relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh mommmm!\u201d I whined. \u201cI thought you just went grocery shopping!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know honey, but I forgot to pick up a gallon of milk! Please\u2026\u201d mom pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to put on my gray sweat pants and my gray sweater. That way, I could pull my hood over my head in case I didn\u2019t want to be recognized. Not only that, but the pants were big and so was the sweater. I put them on, on purpose, in case I needed to\u2026 Hulk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked out the door and slowly made my way down the street to the main road which leads to the busy intersection where the convenience store was. Since it was quiet and there weren\u2019t a lot of cars or people out, I decided to take a shortcut and cut across an alley between the tattoo parlor and an Italian restaurant. The alley was dark and quiet, and it only had a few trash cans and a large garbage bin there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, my quiet stroll was interrupted when at the end of the alley, I spotted three men. Two men were questioning a third guy. In fact, it almost looked like a robbery!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, man! I don\u2019t have any money!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHand over the cash, you twerp!  Or you\u2019ll be bleeding home tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave me alone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second man made a fist and punched the man, who was pushed up with his back against the wall, straight in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAOOOUUWWWW\u201d the man cringed in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw it all from a distance. These guys were robbing him. Anger flared up inside of me. My breathing increased. I hated what I saw. It pissed me off. My muscles\u2026 I felt it again. My muscles were inflating. I could feel it. The anger was causing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!\u201d I shouted at the thugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men turned and stared at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly walked closer to them, as one man held the third with his hand against his chest, pushing him against the brick wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second man stepped away and turned towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet lost, asshole!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! You leave this man alone! NOW!\u201d I shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put my hood over my head. That way, nobody knew who I was. They couldn\u2019t see my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man walked over to me and made a fist. He swung his fist and struck me in my stomach. It hurt, but he didn\u2019t hit me hard enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain made me angry. VERY angry. I wanted to kick him into next week but I found that my muscles would not respond, I was basically immobilized. <i>\"What the hell!?\"</i> frustrated, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit me, my powers had a 'safety switch', they would not work when I was furious or emotionally distraught. That was why I could not move to leave the bathroom when I panicked and why I could not move now. <i>\"I need to relax and fast.\"</i> taking a deep breath, I thought. <i>\"Otherwise, I'm a sitting duck.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the relaxation technique I had learned worked. Seconds later, my muscles were on FIRE. They were burning as everything inflated with outrageous size and strength! Luckily, thanks to my over sized sweat pants and sweater, the thugs couldn\u2019t tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArrrrrrggggg\u201d I growled, as I felt my entire body fill up with amazing physical strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was game over for the thugs. The most beautiful part was that they didn\u2019t know it yet. I was keeping my muscles hidden. Nobody knew who I was. I was going to hit these guys like a freight train. A tornado is going to strike the alley and it had my name on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed the man\u2019s arm and I hurled him through the air, making his body sail through the air until he landed into the large trash bin, a few yards away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I turned and walked towards the second thug, who was busy robbing the man against the wall. He let go of the man and turned towards me, pulling out his knife and aiming it at me as he tried to take a few swings at me. I was unarmed, of course, so I all I could do is try to evade his swipes. Then, I kicked the knife out of his hands with my shoe, making him drop it on the floor. When he tried to reach down to pick it up, I quickly made a fist and punched him in the jaw, sending him flying into the trash bags, which were piled up in the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the other man had climbed out of the garbage bin, and tried to attack me from behind. He snuck up on me, and wrapped his arm around my neck. He held me only for a few seconds, trying to put a choke hold on me, when I just used my upper body strength to lunge forward and to cause him to fly over me and to fall face down on the concrete before me. He fell down in a daze, giving me enough time to run over to the man who was about to get robbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d I said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor kid. He was just a teen. He was being robbed for just twenty Dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet outta here! Go home!\u201d I ordered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2026 Who are you?\u201d the teen asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just a friend\u2026\u201d I replied. I felt like an unknown, masked vigilante who saved the kid\u2019s skin that night. But, I wanted to remain anonymous, and I certainly didn\u2019t feel like revealing my identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, I head police sirens approaching the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around, and I leaped to the rooftop with one mighty leap. From the edge of the roof, I could spot the police cars below. The cops arrested the two thugs and they took the teen to the hospital for a checkup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the police cars had left, I leaped down from the roof and I finally made my way to the convenience store, where I bought the gallon of milk. I took the normal route home and I arrived at the house, to mom\u2019s many questions to why it took me over an hour to buy a gallon of milk at the store which was only five minutes away from the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got held up\u2026 I just ran into some friends\u2026\u201d I lied. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the teenager was explaining to the officers how some guy wearing gray sweats had easily overpowered his two assailants using amazing physical strength\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, I cringed slightly as the top story on the news was of a mysterious muscular man saving the life of a local teenager who described exactly what I was still wearing. Fortunately, only Grace was watching the news with me at the time and threw me an annoyed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you ran into a few friends, huh?\" she asked, sarcastically. \"If mom and dad see this, they'll go through the roof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to answer when I heard mom scream from the garage. \"Ted, get out of there, the jack is slipping!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart immediately went into my throat and I ran towards the garage. The thought of dad being crushed under the family SUV ran through my mind as my muscles reacted to my emotions, making me look like I did when I first changed that fateful day. Too worried about my dad, I charged right through the door, turning it into splinters and caught the bottom of the car just as the jack fell. Dad let out a startled scream, raising his arms in a vain defense as mom screamed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, dad.\" I said, quickly. \"I got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad opened his eyes, sweat beading on his forehead, as he saw that I had hulked out and was now easily holding the entire side of the car up, away from him. An unsteady sigh of relief escaped his lips. \"Thanks, son.\" he said, shaking. \"You just saved your old man's life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would have done the same.\" I said, quietly, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad rolled out from under the car and chuckled. \"Within my power, I would have.\" he said. \"Think you can hold the car up for a few more minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"No problem, dad.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Garth.\" said mom, finding her voice. \"I don't know what I would do if I lost any of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we won't find out today.\" said dad, smiling. \"Why don't you go and start on supper while Garth and I finish up fixing the breaks and changing out this flat, I need to have a talk with him anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, still shaken nodded then walked back into the house. Once she was gone, dad got to work on the car while I continued to hold it up. \"I'm very proud of you, son.\" he said. \"I heard of your efforts to save that kid on the police radio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cringed slightly. \"You... you heard about that, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled slightly. \"I head about it but I did not really know it was you until you just confessed.\" he said. \"I did not become captain of the local police department by good looks alone, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swallowed hard. \"So what's my punishment?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to punish you, Garth.\" said dad, serious as he continued to work. \"I'm going to train you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say I was surprised was an understatement. \"Train me for what?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first, discipline.\" replied dad, placing the fixed tire into place. \"Before this, I was sacred that you would get hurt, now I'm scared that you are going to hurt someone else. Without control, your colossal strength is going to make you very dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad motioned me to slowly lower the car, which I did, finishing the repairs then took a moment to study my face, as if waiting for me to ask what was on my mind. \"How are you going to help me find control?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was expecting dad to explain something drastic, like shipping me off to some ancient temple in the high mountains of the Himalayas but he caught me by surprise when he replied, \"As of this Saturday, your ass belongs to me in my own style of police boot camp! For the next three weeks, your life will be a living hell as I mold your sorry civilian carcass into a fine tuned machine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned as that was exactly what I wanted, a way to master my new found power. \"But how will we do this without anyone, especially that creepy Dr Hagen finding out?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let me worry about that, son.\" said dad with a smile. \"I know you are going crazy, wanting to see how far your powers can take you but I want to keep this all on a controllable level, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"Where do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We start by agreeing not to tell mom or your sister.\" said dad. \"Both of them will 'kill' me if they find out I'm doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense.\" I said, wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, my muscles had returned to normal, now that I had discovered relaxing myself brought myself back to normal, and dad gave me a one armed hug. \"Mom and Grace tend to overly worry, son.\" explained dad. \"I promise I will tell them both when the time is right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI managed a weak smile. \"Okay, dad.\" I said. only I was not about to promise him anything along those lines, it did not seem right somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to dad and I, while he went over his plans of how to start my training, Grace went to mom, looking very pale and concerned. \"Mom, I need to talk to you.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned to Grace and saw her concern. \"What is it dear?\" she asked. \"Are you feeling ill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace began to cry. \"Mom, I have a confession to make...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was certainly doing his best to put me through my paces, then teaching me how best to use my strength. It wasn't easy. Once I hulked up, it took me two dozen eggs before I could hold one without crushing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the session was over, I relaxed my muscles away and washed up. Also, I finally went to the bathroom. It seemed to me like my body was using food more efficiently, so I didn't build up waste as quickly. I made a mental note to talk to Dr. Stone about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock came on my door. \"Garth? It's Grace. Are you decent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. C'mon in.\" As she entered, I asked, \"What's on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the door behind her and said, \"I promised Mom I wouldn't tell you this. But it feels kind of weird, keeping this from you, since I know about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keeping what from me? What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on the edge of my bed. \"You're not the first person in this family to go through something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Grace. If someone else got super-strong, they'd have used it by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't my strength that was affected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Remember two years ago, when I got those awful headaches? I went to Dr. Stone about them, and he found this tumor in my brain. He gave me a month to live. I was so scared, I couldn't bear to tell anybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened,\" I asked, jokingly, \"you couldn't pay, so he kept giving you more months?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"I got better. A lot better. After that, my grades went through the roof. I can't remember the last time I got less than an A+.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, I discovered that I can do just about anything I see done. That's how I got so good at martial arts, just by watching some movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed,\" I said. \"It sounds like your tumor improved your brain, like mine improved my muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. I can even learn languages this way. I can already speak Spanish, French, and Japanese, just from the language tracks and subtitles on DVDs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" I said. \"All this time, I thought I was alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"You were never alone, little brother.\" We embraced.</span></div></div>",

When asked if there was any place in particular, to narrow down the search, mom sighed. \"Grace confessed to me about the tumor in her brain that was discovered when she was fourteen.\" she explained. \"Now Garth has a tumor on his adrenaline gland while he is fourteen...\"<br>\r\nher voice trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Stone nodded. \"I see.\" he said, softly. \"I will run you through some tests, see what I can find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, doctor.\" said mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was put through nearly countless tests and scans that day before Dr Stone sent her home, promising to call her when the results were in. Upon returning home, mom told dad that she had gone to the doctor for a check up and then did some window shopping to clear her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I just hope my fear is unfounded.\"</i> thought mom, going to bed that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, the telephone rang and mom answered quickly, so not to wake up dad. It was Dr Stone. \"I fear that I have some bad news, Mrs. Jones.\" he said. \"I did find an unusual tumor inside your body, exactly like the one Grace and Garth have\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where... Where is it?\" asked mom, shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause before Dr Stone sighed. \"It's in your ovaries, which means its not a tumor, its a life form and it passed its children onto your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A parasite!?\" asked mom, alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a crude way of putting it but yes, it is a parasite.\" replied Dr Stone. \"It lives of of its host, giving super powers in return for 'room and board'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what... what is this parasite giving me?\" asked mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wondered that myself... until I saw an older photo of you.\" said Dr. Stone. \"I have always commented that you never seem to change, I don't know why you or I never noticed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned slightly pale. \"What do you mean?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look in the mirror, Heather.\" said Stone, seriously. \"You have not aged a single day since you last suffered from those migraines nineteen years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gasped, the telephone falling from her shaking hand as she rushed out of bed to look at a mirror. She looked just as she did on her fourteenth birthday with the exception of a different hair and makeup style. \"Oh my God...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Two years ago, Grace was diagnosed with a brain tumor, like Garth's. She kept it secret from us, thinking she would die in a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Dad said. \"Wait a minute. Since she didn't die, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how Garth got a supercharged body from his tumor?\" Grace said. \"Well, I've got a supercharged brain. I've got total recall, I can do just about anything I see done, and I can learn languages in minutes. Mom, are you saying that this is all connected?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"They're not really tumors. They're organisms, living off you, giving you extraordinary abilities in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad asked, \"Where did they come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best answer I can give,\" Mom said, \"is, from me. I have one of them, attached to one of my ovaries. It passed its young on to you kids. In return,... it's caused me to keep my youth.\" She looked back into the mirror. \"I still can't get over it.

I was... I was...\" she could not get herself to say it but the look on her face spoke volumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, god, mom!\" whispered Grace, horrified. \"You were raped, weren't you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom began to cry freely as dad quickly pulled her into his arms, causing her to wail. \"It was horrible! He was an older man, about forty years of age, begging for money on the street.\" she said, crying. \"He smelled like he had not bathed in days so I gave him a twenty, trying to be nice!  He... He and he grabbed me as I was walking away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He attacked you, right on the street!?\" I asked, terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"He pulled me into a van and attacked me there.\" she said. \"I only got away because I was kicking the inside of the van in morse code, S.O.S.!\" she sobbed a little before adding, \"The police came and pulled me away from him but... he managed to escape... no one has seen him since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo hear that my mom was attacked, even though it was a long time ago, caused my muscles to grow in tune with my turbulant emotions. Knowing that the creep who did it was still out there made it worse, I badly wanted to get my hands on him. Unknown to me at the time, just as my muscles went into 'hulk' mode, Grace's mind went into super computer mode as she imagined every possible means to track down mom's attacker and deliver him some justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand down, Garth.\" said dad, firmly. \"That goes for you too, Grace. I will not have vigilantes in my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was twenty years ago, kids.\" said mom, rubbing her eyes. \"Unless that man had the same... condition as me, he's no doubt in his late sixties by now.

She just looked me straight in the eye and concentrated. After a few moments, it appeared as if her efforts were unsuccessful. I was beginning to suspect that it was the symbiont that had contacted my sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 Maybe if I touched you?\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she touched my hand before she closed her eyes and tried again, her mind searching for a way to make a link work but all she heard was something like a whisper.  After a few seconds, she opened them, and looked up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear something, but it\u2019s very faint\u2026 Maybe I need to touch another part of your body. Let\u2019s see\u2026 Your strength is in your muscles. How about I touch one of your muscles instead?\u201d she pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached out and gently placed her fingers on my right bicep before closing her eyes for the third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d she said, almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Aha, what?\u201d I asked her impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard it! I heard something!\u201d she said, as she closed her eyes and tried again. As soon as she closed her eyes, a wide grin appeared on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell? What? Do you hear anything?\u201d I asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s there! It lives inside of your muscles! All of them! Your muscles are a part of the symbiont! It likes making your muscles grow, too!\u201d Grace said, while still keeping her hand on my bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? The symbiont lives inside of my muscles? You mean\u2026 My muscles are ALIVE?\u201d I gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Not quite.*</i> I heard a voice say. only it was not in my mind, it was from inside my ears!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked. no response came so I touched my bicep as Grace did and repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Your sister has a more highly developed brain and can thus receive our telepathic signals more clearly.*</i> replied my symbiont. <i>*I live off your body but because I happened to anchored onto your adrenal gland, I 'pay rent' so to speak by enhancing your physical prowess.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you communicate with me?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*By using your muscles as a sort of phone line, I send focused vibrations through your muscles to your inner ear, where it translates them to my voice.*</i> said my symbiont. <i>*I can make you grow, if I so wished, your pectorals, biceps, and calves are all a part of you and thus, a part of me.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace, who's mind was in tune to the symbiont's telepathic signals, heard the conversation and gasped. \"The symbiont likes it when you hulk out!.\" she said. \"It feeds off the extra mass when you return to normal! It also explains why you are always hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a symbiotic relationship.\" said mom. \"My question is, can the symbiont work Garth's muscles on its own or does he have full command?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find out.\" said Grace. She tickled my chest, causing my pectorals increase dramatically!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhooaa!!!\u201d I gasped as my pectorals doubled in size, pushing out forward until they became thick mounds of muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking strong there bro!\u201d Grace giggled, as she took her hand off of my pectorals. \"That was an unconscious reaction on the symbiont's part, Garth, it can make your muscles grow and shrink.\" she then smiled. \"Only I suspect it will not make a habit of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Correct.* replied my symbiont.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my pectorals, which were bulging with muscle to the point where it looked as if someone implanted two bricks into my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnbelievable!\u201d I smiled, as I ran my hand over my muscles. \u201cSo, you think I can control the size of my muscles by just  talking to my symbiont?\u201d Grace nodded and I added, \"Please return me to normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, my huge pectorals shrunk back to normal again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, you just asked the symbiont to shrink your chest back to normal\u2026\u201d she giggled. \u201cCool, huh? Now, check this action out..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I was overcome by an intense tingling in my legs, specifically in my calves on the back of my legs. And there it was: Both calves swelled until they were as large as melons!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! My calves are monsters!\u201d I chuckled, as I looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like your symbiont\u2026 It listens to me!\u201d Grace smirked. \"I do not have telepathy but these symbionts do and they are apparently able to pick up my thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well\u2026 These are MY muscles on MY body, so the symbiont had better listen to me too!\u201d I added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does\u2026 Just remember, big bro\u2026 I can make you bigger, or I can shrink your muscles back to normal!\u201d Grace said with an mischievous grin. \"So don't get too big for your britches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind\u2026\u201d I sighed, just as my stomach started to rumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat little demonstration of making my pectorals and my calves grow made me hungry again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Somehow, it completely intrigued me, knowing that I had a female alien creature living inside of me. I had to get used to the idea at first, but after awhile, I started to like it. I mean, what's better than having a girl living inside of you, with you, twenty-four hours a day? She knew me and she was a part of me. She was a part of my mind, my body, my arms, my legs, my torso, my chest, my muscles... everything! Not only that, but from this point forward, I always had someone to talk to! In a way, I felt like the luckiest guy on earth: I had a built-in girlfriend and she was mine forever and mine alone and she could never be with anybody else! As weird as it sounded, it was also very cool at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright sunlight was just beginning to shine through the opening between the curtains and the wall, lighting up my bedroom. I turned from laying on my left side, with my arm around my pillow, to laying flat on my back when I was greeted by a friendly female voice for the first time that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Good morning, Garth!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Good morning... Amara...\" I whispered while still feeling groggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*How are you feeling today?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be better... Once... Once I'm fully awake...\" I groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I sense that you're still feeling a bit sleepy. You're also a little congested. Maybe you should take something for that. And you're feeling a little thirsty. Your throat is dry. You need something to drink. Obviously, you need to have some breakfast as well.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes when I heard her complete diagnosis of me and my feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Yeah... You know everything I'm thinking and feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Yes... I'm here to help you and to make sure your needs are being met!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... Okay... I'm awake... Or, at least... I'm still waking up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Do you need some help waking up? Some extra energy to face the morning and start your day?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I felt my pectorals swell up and push outwards! My biceps became hard as rocks and tightened at the same time. My abs stiffened up as they hardened while my triceps, my calves and my thighs all inflated with bulging, rock-solid muscle. Amara was making me hulk out while I was still laying in bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhnnngg! Amara! Whoa! I'm awake! I'm up! I'm up!\" I said, as I pulled the covers off me and leaped out of my bed and landed with my feet on the floor. Boy, was I pumped up! She certainly knew how to get me going in the morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all my muscles bulging all over the place, I grabbed some clean clothes and ran into the shower. I figured that it was time to give my massive muscles a good bath anyway, thanks to Amara!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all of the excitement over the passed few days, mom decided it best we all unwind and spend a normal day. All in all, it was fun but as the day began to wind down, I felt the urge to go out and tackle more bad guys, if I could find some. Only dad had other plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garth, it doesn't take a super sleuth to figure out it was you who saved that man from the three thugs a few days ago.\" he said, sternly. \"If you are going to continue to fight crime, you are going to learn to do it by the book.\" he took up a light jacket and grabbed his keys. \"Let's go, son. I'm going to introduce you to law enforcement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, knowing I was in for a lecture but nodded as I also knew he was only trying to help me out. \"Okay, dad.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled, seeing my expression. \"Relax, I know you mean well but the law applies to everyone.\" he said. \"Let me tell you a few things you can do as a citizen to achieve your goal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter telling mom and Grace we were going out for a ride, dad and I were off, just driving around town with him pointing out various buildings. \"There I had to break up a fight between two neighbors.\" he said with a sigh. \"They're both good people but one's son was dating the others daughter and they had a break up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One blamed the other for it happening.\" I said, guessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"Correct.\" he said, smiling. \"So I talked to the two kids and it turned out they were not breaking up, but talking about another couple across town, it was a misunderstanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh brother!\" I said, laughing. \"That must have been embarrassing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was.\" replied dad, smiling. \"The point is, you need to know the situation before you take any action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha, dad.\" I said, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I noticed a car on the side of the road. \"Hey, that's' Mrs Vance's car.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad pulled to the side, behind the car then stepped out with me following. I watched for traffic as dad walked up to the driver's side window. \"Having a little trouble, Mrs Vance?\" he asked. \"Could you use a hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be wonderful.\" said Mrs Vance (Sarah), smiling. she pulled a handle, popping the trunk. \"The jack is not the best in the world, I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay.\" I said, smiling at her. \"I think I can work with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over to the back of the car and pulled out the spare tire. \"Okay Amara.\" I whispered. \"Are you ready for a little work out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Of course.\"</i> giggled Amara's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked to the side of the car, holding the spare tire, the rear passenger door opened and I saw Lyssa step out, holding a pair of thick work gloves. If it could, my jaw would have fallen to the ground. She was a complete knock out in that blue summer dress she was wearing. It accented her curves very well and with her raven hair and green eyes... I was blushing, I had to take a step back to keep myself from fainting at the sight of her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you're hot.\" I whispered. then, seeing her blush I quickly composed myself. \"Um... nice dress, it accents your figure well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad, coming up from behind, smacked me in the back of the head. \"Behave yourself.\" he scolded, lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa giggled. \"Thank you for the compliment.\" she said, smiling. \"I'm a real girl now... the whole enchilada.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised me and I turned to dad to see him turn to her, surprised as well. It looked as if he wanted to ask her something and I had an idea what it was but he dismissed it and smiled politely. \"Congratulations, Alyssa.\" he said, politely. \"I know that was your dream, I'm glad it came true for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Jones.\" said Alyssa, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone sit tight.\" I said to Mrs Vance and Beth. \"This won't take but a minute or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no one around, son.\" said dad. \"Let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling my muscles quickly expanding under my sweat pants and shirt, I placed the spare tire down then easily lifted the front end of the car up before unscrewing the lug nuts with the other. I did not have the time to see Alyssa's reaction but I figured she would be surprised. After all, I was not able to do this at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm sure they'll be questioning us about this later.\"</i> I thought. <i>\"Oh well.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin two minutes, the spare tire was on the car and the flat tire was in the trunk. \"You're all set to go, Mrs. Vance.\" said dad, smiling. \"I'm happy for your daughter.\" he then whispered something I did not hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Vance smiled. \"I'll be sure to pass that along.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your help, Garth.\" said Lyssa, blushing. \"I really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gave me a quick kiss on the cheek, causing me to blush brightly. \"You're.... welcome.\" I said, slowly, rubbing my cheek. <i>\"She kissed me, oh wow!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she quickly got back into the car as mom thanked dad again and was soon driving off as dad and I got back into their car. I was still rubbing my cheek. \"I think someone has a crush on the young lady.\" said dad, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" I said in a dreamy voice. \"I guess I do.\" then a thought occurred to me and I began to panic. \"Wait, we just revealed our secret to the Vance family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, son.\" said dad. \"I know Mrs Vance. If there is one thing she excels at, its keeping secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" I asked, confused. \"What's that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad laughed. \"Let's just say you're not the first 'crime fighter' to come into town.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you look for trouble, that is all you will find, try looking for solutions instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do that.\" softly, I replied. \"Dad... can you teach me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teach you how to what?\" asked dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"Can you teach me how to be a police officer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"What do you think this talk was all about, son?\" he asked. \"As I said, if you are going to fight crime, you need to learn how to do it right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe returned home about an hour before sunset and I walked up to my room, feeling closer to dad that I ever had before. Only I wondered who the other three characters in the story were, dad refused to tell me. I looked at my phone and thought of Lyssa. I could not get over how beautiful she looked. <i>\"I wonder if she really likes me.\"</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to find out, I dialed her number. Three rings later, I got her mom. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Vance?\" I said. \"This is Garth.

For me, its super strength, endurance, and healing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa looked at me, completely shocked but she seemed to believe my statement as she managed to ask, \"How did... she get there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled. \"My mom gave her to me and Grace.\" I said. \"You see, Amara is the offspring of the alien mother inside my mom. Her alien lives on her ovaries and grants her immortality in return but she passed her young onto Grace and myself when we were conceived.\" I smiled, thinking about it. \"Her alien lives in or on her brain, giving her a type of total recall. It's amazing what she can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa seemed more stunned than before but she snapped out of it as I said, \"Your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you know I always wanted to be a girl, right?\" asked Lyssa, beginning her story. I nodded. \"Well, it seems as if I am related to a man who wanted the same thing and set adrift by his own townspeople. He was found by an Amazon woman tribe who heard his story and transformed him into a woman through what I can only guess as magical means.\" I smiled. \"She was renamed Iole and had the power of incredible speed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Lyssa, shocked but remained silent as she continued her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that gift of super speed was passed down onto me and, I guess upon reaching the proper age, I transformed into a real girl, gaining that power, just as Iole did centuries ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa's story left me stunned but smiling as I knew she always wanted to be a real girl and that I had a crush on the girl she was, wishing for the same thing for her so we could be together. <i>\"Thank you Iole.\"</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think there might be others like us out there?\" asked Lyssa, pulling me from my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" I replied. then I fell silent, as Amara said, \"Our people have been running to Earth for centuries, it is possible that this Iole could have had or received a symbiont from the Amazon, they were advanced in their own right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Alyssa, looking at me, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amara just told me that her kind have been coming to Earth for centuries.\" I said, still stunned. \"It's possible that this Iole was a bearer of one of Amara's ancestors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" said Lyssa with a questioning look. \"I'll ask Beth, she seems to have powers similar to your sister, Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll ask Grace, maybe she can dig something up on her end.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa and I talked for a few more minutes before her phone beeped, alerting her of a text message. After reading the message, she winced. \"I got to go.\" she said. \"Mom says it's time for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me tomorrow.\" I said. \"Maybe we can catch a movie or something before school starts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Lyssa replied, \"That sounds great. I'll meet you at the mall, say 1:00?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lyssa ran out the window and I watched her run out of sight in less than a second. Letting out a whistle, I fell back onto my bed. \"What a woman!\" I breathed, happily. \"I can't believe I'm going out on a date with her tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she doesn't get grounded.\" said dad, behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped, startled and stood up, facing her. \"Dad!

The clothes he was wearing weren't the best fit, but he knew they'd attract less attention than the prison-issue orange jumpsuit he'd had on. Satisfied that nobody was following him, he continued on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police, he knew, would be watching his ex-wife's house, certain that he'd come looking for his daughter. But he was just a little too clever for that. Sykes had set up a safehouse years before, and that was his destination. Arriving at the innocent-seeming house, he knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young woman in business attire answered. \"Were you followed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was,\" he replied, \"I shook them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped aside to admit him. \"Welcome, Mr. Mayweather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stepped in, he asked, \"Is Sykes in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Sykes is in seclusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too good to say hi to an old friend, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suppose I had been there,\" came a familiar voice from somewhere, \"and you had been followed.

That is, unless you're in a hurry to return to prison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman dropped a sheaf of papers she'd been holding. As he helped her with them, he saw some of them.

Once the side of the house is cleaned, you will be free to do what you want, just not alone until the two weeks are up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" sighing, I said. \"Just, did mom have to call Grace my 'babysitter'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"She could have been more harsh and had you stay at home for the full two weeks.\" smiling, he replied. \"It's better to be kept on a short leash than be locked up in the 'dog house'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, knowing dad was right and we piled into the car with dad taking the wheel. \"I have some errands to run so you have at least two hours to shop.\" looking at me, he said. \"Just be ready to be picked up when I get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be ready.\" serious, Grace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive to the mall was uneventful and dad dropped us off at the main entrance. \"Remember, two hours.\" looking out the window, he said. \"If I have to come looking for you two, Grace, you will be grounded as well, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace quickly nodded and dd drove off.

Standing beside her was her sister, Bethany, who giggled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alyssa, you look great!\" taking her hand, Grace said. \"I overheard your conversation with Garth, you're one hundred percent girl now, congratulations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" still blushing, Alyssa said. \"I'm really happy this way.\" she then pouted slightly. \"Only I'm grounded... no dates until the side of Gar's house is cleaned up and no going anywhere alone until the two weeks is up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an idea struck me. \"We might still have that date as you will be with me and I'll be with you, we won't be going anywhere alone.\" smiling, I said.

I couldn't figure out what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Lyssa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked. The boy was shaking his head, as if he was drowsy, but he was wide awake. We still didn't dare to move a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the boy put his guns on the ground and kicked them away. Mall security grabbed him, and he didn't resist as they took him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait released the girls, and I asked, \"What just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That boy was an undiagnosedschizophrenic,\" Grace explained. \"The voices in his head were telling him to kill everybody here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a psychic vision,\" Cait added, \"warning me of what was about to happen. I tried to reason with him, but I had trouble getting him to distinguish my 'voice' from all the others. So I needed Grace and Beth to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you can do that?\" Lyssa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a few days now,\" Cait replied. \"I found out what the people around me really thought about me, and I've been working to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she added, \"I've got a question for you: Do you guys really have these powers?\"</span></div></div>",

I have one of her friends with me, we need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad cautiously opened the door and peered out before allowing a tall and muscular man with short sand blond hair and blue eyes to enter with Travis Greenway and Megan from school following behind. Travis was a tall and muscular boy with jet black hair and blue eyes. Megan was a shy petite girl with blond hair and green eyes. Both seemed white as a sheet and they staggered slightly as they entered.

It did not take a mind reader to know Marisol was not going to put up with male pride. \"Sit... down.\" with a firm tone, Marisol said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis sat down, his expression softening. I guessed he was not used to anyone so forceful. \"Yes, ma'am.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you again, old friend.\" returning his sidearm to its holster, dad said. \"Any idea who tried to kidnap your daughter and her friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They weren't professionals.\" quickly, Steve said. \"I'm guessing they were sent by Sykes. he motioned to Megan and Travis. \"These two are just now discovering their 'gifts'.

A test screen came up as a thunderous voice called out, \"Puer\u00ed Problementa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Latin for problem child.\" turning pale, Grace said. she turned to dad. \"What does this mean!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone has placed a note in the 'blind post office'.\" raising a single eyebrow, uncle Geo said. \"It's a loose brick in the outside wall of the gymnasium of our old school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a motion detector there that sends a signal to us when it detects a note being placed in the slot.\" seeing our stunned looks, dad said. \"Only televisions with a special box Steve made at the time receives the call.

It's really giving me insight into what Lyssa was going through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you said Rhea knew all that, before we told her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's her symbiont. It started with her seeing auras. She can look at you and tell how you're feeling. Only, when she looked at me or Mom or Dad, she'd see funny colors, in shapes that didn't match the forms we were wearing. That's how we wound up telling her about the adoption. Mom was going to wait until she was around our age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What freaked me out, though, was when she found this old picture of you, me, and Greg from when we were ten. She asked me why my friend was dressed like a boy. Remember, that was when Lyssa was Greg's little secret. There was nothing about the shot that said we were different from how we looked, yet Rhea could tell. Then, she used her symbiont to show me Lyssa's medical records, saying that she was changing into a real girl.\" She paused. \"I can't believe how I reacted when she first told me. I don't know how she can forgive me for being such a rotten friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could have been worse,\" I said. \"If she wasn't a descendant of Iole, she'd still be a girl trapped in a boy's body. She used to cry about how long it was taking the hormones to work, thinking she'd be underdeveloped forever.

My own concern rose when she pulled out a cellphone and dialed a number. <i>\"I wonder what's going on.\"</i> watching her, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, upon finishing the call, Lyssa quietly called us all together as Geo and dad entered behind her. I was the first to reach her, worried something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Lyssa, what was so urgent that you needed to see all of us right away?\" concerned, Grace asked. \"You sounded super worried over the house intercom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember those goons who were after Clem and Rhea?\" seeing Ted Jones shake his head, Lyssa asked. \"Well, Mr Jones told me that the Agency was after Rhea's birth mother twenty years ago. My guess is they want Rhea and Clem for the same reasons, they both have a unique power they can use to their advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shocked, not noticing dad discretely nodding before Clem asked, \"How did they learn of Rhea or even me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhea's mother got away from the Agency on our last mission.\" speaking up, dad said. \"In that sense, I guess we gained a small victory.\" he shuddered slightly. \"Bear in mind, though, these people are true monsters. I can only guess they had been tracking Rhea's birth mother and discovered her child in one of those searches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The van watching the house.\" thinking out loud, Clem said. \"They must have been with this Agency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that is the case, they had been watching you for a while, young man.\" serious, dad said. \"They were merely waiting for the right time to strike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one is going to take you two anywhere if we have anything to say about it.\" serious, I said to Clem and Rhea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh- What about my- my birth mommy?\" frightened, Rhea asked. \"I do- don't want mo- monsters to g- get her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe mom and dad can find her.\" trying to calm her sister, Clem said. \"They have... gifts of their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea gave Clem a grateful smile only to have it suddenly turn to terror. \"They found her!\" her lips and hands quivering, she screamed. \"The monsters are chasing her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa quickly knelt down and turned Rhea's head to face her. It broke all our hearts to see such a small child so very terrified. \"Where is your birth mommy?\" firmly, she asked. \"Can you tell us where she is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hospital!\" crying in hysterics, Rhea replied. \"They're running from the hospital!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only five miles from here.\" startled, Geo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mount up!\" pointing in the direction of the garage, dad ordered. \"Grace, you drive. We will give advice through ear piece radios as we watch through the camera feeds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, we were all given earpiece radios, exactly as they were described in the comic series and led to the garage where Grace moved to get into the family car. \"Not that one, honey.\" moving to a tarp covered vehicle, dad said. \"This one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned and smiled, as pulled off the tarp to reveal a modified, sleek black, van! <i>\"It's the Beast!\"</i> impressed, I thought. <i>\"Just as it was described in the comic series!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Beast!\" an awe filled smile forming, Lyssa whispered. \"You really had it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the 1983 GMC Vandura G series, which Ted and I had modified.\" quite proudly, Geo said. \"This bad boy as a 10 inch armored plated hull and armored glass windows. It carries a 2.7 liter supercharged V8 engine that delivers 300+hp and 400+ torque with a top sustained speed of 180 mph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was indeed an impressive machine that carried a lot of muscle, I just hoped Grace would be able to handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can talk cars later.\" scolding, dad said. \"Get moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all piled into the van and sped off, towards the hospital.

Dad thought it was too dangerous for such a young girl to get involved, I had to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I heard Lyssa let out a low scream and turned from the front passenger seat to see Rhea standing in front of an equally startled Jessica. Rhea looked painfully pale and she was shivering but her voice was determined. \"I- I'm go-going with y-you, Jess.\" panting, she said. \"S-She's my mo-mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhea, are you crazy!\" gripping her shoulders, Jessica asked. \"Look at yourself, you look like a ghost!\" she sighed wearily. \"Please don't use your powers unless you really have to, you're going to hurt yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea began to cry, having been yelled at by her brother/sister. \"But... my mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shook her head and I felt a lecture coming.

Mommy and her boyfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked, but all I could see was a small boy in a dress carrying a doll, being surrounded by some goons carrying weapons. \"Rhea's mom or not,\" I said, \"we can't let this go down.\" We all piled out of the Beast and made for the group, Garth hulking up to weightlifter size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got to the group in time to hear the goons' leader say, \"Kiss, Kiss, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was not about to let anyone hurt a kid and let my fist fly! \"KISS THIS!\" I roared, punching the man in the jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy sat up, after being thrown off his feet, rubbing his jaw. \"Hello again, Garth. You caught me off guard, but not without resources.\" At that, the goons aimed their weapons at Garth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to order everyone behind me but Lyssa said, \"Think fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gust of wind and a quick blur later, all of the men had been relieved of their weapons as they were now lying on the ground at my feet while Lyssa smiled as if she had never moved. \"Too slow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good, we can examine these later and see what kind of tech we are up against.\"</i> smiling slightly, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader's eyes narrowed. \"You kids don't know what you're in the middle of. You need guidance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got guidance,\" my own eyes narrowing, I replied. \"And it's you who doesn't know what he's doing. Drop this, before it gets dropped on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the goons said, \"Looks like Blue team wasn't kidding. Your orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got all the information we need,\" the man said. \"We can easily pick up Sarah and her fiance at our leisure.

I deliberately shot you in the shoulder, instead. Then, I went into hiding, using the last name Barns.

I never looked back after I fled from The Agency.\" tearing up a little, she said. \"I was found, trembling in an empty alley, by a young couple who adopted me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace sighed. \"Unless you saw someone to break that brainwashing, you are still under their control.\" serious, she said. \"All it takes is one code phrase from them, likely over a phone, and you are theirs again.\" pausing, she turned to us and muttered, \"We better get Cait over here, fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cait?\" confused, Sarah asked. \"How many members does this new gang have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all ignored her question as I suddenly grew to the size of an Olympian and took a strong hold of her arm. \"Please do not take any offense to this.\" pulling Sarah along, I said. \"We can not risk you turning on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I half dragged, half carried a struggling Sarah into a spacious room with only one exit and gently pushed her inside while Grace pushed Todd in behind her before I shut the door and locked it tight. \"I really hated to do that.\" muttering, I said. \"She's as much a victim as anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*You did what you thought was best for the team, Garth*</i> soothingly, Amara thought to me. <i>*Perhaps Cait and Amatra can help her break free from the brainwashing.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"One can only hope.\"</i> sighing, I thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both of them were still in the form of teenagers. \"Ms. Barns,\" Lyssa said, \"this is Cait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do?\" calmly, Cait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Barns shrugged. \"My life's turned upside-down and inside-out in the past week, but I'm holding together.\" looking shaken, she said. \"Ted says you can help me unravel my past?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try.\" stepping in front of Sarah, Cait replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that work?\" curious, Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax, and trust me.\" her voice almost echoing, Cait replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two made eye contact, both of their eyes fell half open as they stood, unmoving. <i>\"Cait must be in Mrs Barns' mind right now.\" </i>watching, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes ticked by with the two unmoving as we could only watch, and hope. Then, Cait turned her head to the side. \"Bad guys?\" in a flat tone, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused then rose her hands as if she were holding a rifle at Mrs Barns. <i>\"What is she doing?\"</i> curious, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'm trying to obey, Jon.\" apologetically, Cait said. \"I want to obey but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This can't be good.\"</i> worried, I thought. <i>\"Something might be trying to get into her head in return.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not voice my concern out loud, in fear of being wrong but I stayed on my guard as I then saw her hands beginning to shake, a look of uncertainty on her face. \"I- I must obey.\" stammering, she said. \"Jon is my master, I am his slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is not good.\"</i> worried, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to try to shake Cait out of the trance when she spoke again, her hands still shaking. \"Mommy... daddy....\" tears forming, she whimpered. she then rose her hands, barely still as she blankly yelled, \"I must defend Jon! Do not come closer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what to do, I turned to dad to see he was just as concerned before Cait once again, quivered, crying. \"Jon... did.\" slowly, tearfully, she said, as if answering a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's gotten into Cait?\" concerned, Grace asked me. \"She's acting more and more like she's reliving a painful memory in Sarah's mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to panic anyone with my own fears, I turned to and shrugged. \"You're asking me? You're the one with the supercharged brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a handgun materialized into Cait's hand and she turned to me, leveling it at my left shoulder. Everyone in the room froze as a sad smile formed onto her face. With a glassy look in her eyes, Cait said, \"I am sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she pulled the trigger...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He repeated the process with the other hand. \"We'll see how she acts when she wakes up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was told later that Cait was awake and I went up to check on her to hear her talking to Lyssa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you awake?\" concerned, Lyssa asked. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" in a pained voice.

Good thing the gun you teleported wasn't loaded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right,\" sighing, Cait said. \"Ms. Barns still has her programming. I took her back through her memories, and stumbled onto it. When I tried to undo it, I got trapped in the programming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"So we'll need to be careful around her. Rhea's not going to like that, but we can't take chances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I spoke up, \"Is she back to normal yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still bald and telepathic,\" Cait called back, \"but not homicidal. Is that close enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped into the room, relieved to see Cait acting normally again. \"I'll take it.\" smiling slightly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hagen was too clever for us,\" dad explained. \"Cait's attempt to undo Barns' programming got her into a trap. The feedback loop from her unloaded gun knocked her out and freed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to be gentle with her, Chief,\" begging, Cait said. \"She's as much a victim as you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to remember that, Cait.\" nodding, dad said. \"Thank you for the attempt. What do you want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go a few blocks away, and arrange for my driver to pick me up.\" with a rueful smile, Cait replied. \"See you guys at school tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you wouldn't rather spend the night here?\" Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait shook her head. \"I've got some personal stuff to check up on.

As Cait stood up and rubbed her wrists, dad asked, \"What was her trigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was 'Kiss Kiss, my dear',\" I replied. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea,\" was his answer. \"I'll have the kids tell you about it tomorrow, if it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even a hint?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"Let's just say Hagen wouldn't be the first person I've dealt with who turned out to be too clever for his own good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cait told us what it was, and we used it to shut down the mind-control system. Hagen won't be able to control you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you told me to kiss you?\" disturbed, Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeo nodded. \"That was your trigger. When I said it the first time, you went into a trance, ready for orders. If Hagen tries it again, he'll get a much different response from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded, looking relieved. \"So I'm good to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"We'll let you see more of the place, but they're still looking for you at your apartment. By the way, somebody's waiting to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door wider, and Rhea came in, accompanied by a teenage boy. \"Hi, Mommy,\" she said, giving Sarah a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, sweetheart,\" Sarah replied. \"Who's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Clem,\" he said. \"Rhea's brother. This is what I usually look like. Jessica was... something of a punishment. I called Lyssa by the wrong name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk, tsk. You shouldn't have done that.\" shaking a finger, Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am. Yesterday gave me some insight into what she went through all those years. It won't happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like Jessica,\" Rhea said, pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClem chuckled. \"I meant that I won't call Alyssa the wrong name again. Maybe sometimes, I'll let Jessica out to play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all laughed, and Rhea told Sarah about the years since the Rodgers family adopted her.

She was shaking, wide eyed, and terrified as she looked out into the distance, crying. \"It's going to be okay, Rhea.\" as dad quickly walked off, dialing a number on his phone, I said. \"My dad is the chief of police, he will stop this before it happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- What about the wolves?\" still shaking. \"Who will deal with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to make Rhea feel better, I increased in size to the size of an Olympian and made a 'muscle' pose. \"Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?\" using my best Arnold Schwarzenegger imitation, I asked. \"I will pump him up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Rhea looked at me as if I was insane then giggled, seeing Clem behind me, making the same poses but with his significantly smaller body.

She gave Grace a loving kiss then looked at her crossly. \"Where have you been the past couple of days!?\" worried she asked. \"It was as if you had suddenly dropped off the planet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story, Nat.\" sighing, Grace said. \"Garth was in the hospital..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" startled, Natalie said. \"Garth, are you alright!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" focusing on my watch, I replied. \"Just a little rattled, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie frowned. \"There is more to this.\" stepping in front of me, she said. \"Garth, what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, turning to her. \"It would take too long to explain everything.\" quickly, I replied. \"Do you remember the Problem Child Gang mystery book series?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie nodded. \"Yeah, Grace and I love to read them together.\" confused, she said. \"What does that have to do with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jaw dropped as I increased to an adult size in front of her. \"The characters in that book were based on real people; Tex the mighty was our dad, Natalie.\" returning to normal size, I said. \"Grace and I... inherited those powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their enemies are real as well and we suspect they are after us.\" adding Grace. \"We needed to train so to be better prepared when they make their big push.\" tearing up, Grace added, \"Please don't think differently of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie gave Grace a passionate kiss. \"Never.\" touching her forehead onto Grace's. \"I love you, no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace smiled, grateful and kissed her before breaking away and we continued walking towards school. On the way, I quickly explained the situation to Natalie and assured her that everything would be fine. Upon entering the schoolyard, we were met by Cait and Lyssa. \"It's okay,\" seeing their worried looks, I said. \"Dad's got a team in position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just act like everything's normal,\" added Lyssa, \"and the other kids won't have any reason to believe otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were soon approached by a young boy I'd seen at the clubhouse. As he got closer, a knowledgeable smile formed onto Cait's face. \"Hi, guys,\" the boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ncocking an eyebrow, Cait asked, \"Aren't you a little old to be hanging out at the schoolyard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did... oh, yeah, Sarah told me about you,\" he said. \"My name's Todd. I'm Sarah's fiance. We heard on the scanner that there was something going on here today, so I came to keep an eye on things. I figured a teenage boy wouldn't attract as much attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah Barns, our homeroom teacher this year.\" whispering carefully, I said to Natalie. \"She and her husband have certain powers as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of Sarah, how is she?\" curious, Cait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fine,\" I said. \"Once you were gone, they used the trigger phrase against itself. Hagen will never control her again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore another word could be said, Trish screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we looked to see why, we saw a pair of wolves, snarling and snapping at every student they approached. What Rhea had explained was coming to life, wolves at the school! \"Then I heard Cait's voice in my head. <i>*Garth,*</i> she warned, <i>*these wolves... They're human!*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get everybody inside,\" running towards the wolves, I said. \"I'll handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that few would notice in the chaos, I grew to Olympian size and scooped my arm under the first wolf to reach me and heaved it into the air. It was my intention to stun the animal by hitting it against the wall of the building only I missed and sent it loudly crashing through a window. A child like yelp reached my ears as Cait's voice again echoed in my ears. <i>*Careful, Garth!*</i> scolding, she thought to me. <i>*They're human!*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a break, Cait.\" whispering, I said. \"I didn't throw it that hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped through the window to see a person lying where the wolf was supposed to be and gasped, surprised by who I had found. <i>\"Travis Greenway!?\"</i> stunned, I thought. <i>\"How did he get mixed up in all of this!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing!?\" annoyed, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis looked up at me, just as annoyed and replied...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He may want to conduct that interrogation personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked about to see that everybody else had started to calm down, but then I heard another voice, saying, <i>*Don't give him the chance. Run him down. Finish him off.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho?\" whispering, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*It wasn't me.*</i> concerned, Amara thought to me. <i>*It came from somewhere else but I don't know where.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I jumped as Lyssa appeared in front of me. She looked very concerned as she wrapped her arms around me. \"Garth, I was so worried for you!\" almost in tears, she said. \"When I saw you go after that wolf, I... I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs suddenly as Lyssa appeared, I pulled her into a long, passionate kiss. Cheers from fellow students rose around us but I could only hear Lyssa's soft moan and see her eyes slowly close as she kissed me back. Fireworks went off in my mind as the kiss seemed to last forever. When we finally broke the kiss, Lyssa sighed, a dream like look forming on her face. \"Never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled and kissed her again, this time hearing the students cheer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The events of this morning became the main topic of conversation in class. My kiss with Alyssa Vance was on the top of the gossip list as she was still considered a he/she. <i>\"They're in for a surprise.\"</i> smiling, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was an an anonymous tip someone had made to the school about a shooter. I was surprised by that but anyone who asked me about it, I explained that my dad got the tip as well and had it under control. Lastly was a news report that three wolves had escaped from Crater Zoo but were captured not far from the school. This surprised me as well but I guessed that Mr Connors had heard it on the radio and decided to use it to make us  and the students harder targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird, huh?\" sitting next to me, Jim asked. \"This town is certainly seeing a lot of action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, who would have thought.\" smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was moving smoothly until third period, physical education. Coach had us play dodge-ball tournament, to the annoyance of the class. Although my focus was on the game, I kept an eye on Alyssa and found it odd that the local goth girl, Lilith Nightshade, seemed bothered not to be on Alyssa's team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Cassie, one of the 'popular girls' in school called for my attention. \"Hey, Garth, check out your girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I turned, she and Amber, a fellow 'popular girl', pulled Alyssa's shorts and panties down around her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face turned red in tune with Alyssa's only mine was from anger. I knew I could throw have easily them both across the gym with one arm but violence was not the answer in this case. Fortunately, Jim and Morgan had jumped in front of me as Coach benched the two school bitches and escorted Alyssa to the locker rooms. \"Easy, big guy!\" thinking he was holding me back, Jim said. \"They're not worth getting expelled over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a breath, calm down!\" firmly, Morgan added. \"Let the principal deal with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched helplessly as Coach led Alyssa, tears streaming down her face, out of the gym. I knew she was taking her to the principal's office, most likely to return shortly for Cassie and Amber. I again saw red when I saw the two trying to leave but paused as Amara's voice reached me. <i>\"Careful, Garth.</i> silently, she warned. <i>\"I will not allow you to use your super strength out of anger.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Thank you.\"</i> grateful, I thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over to the two, ignoring Jim and Morgan's pleas to calm down and stared them in the eye. \"Even you two should find it obvious that Alyssa is a girl.\" evenly, I said. \"She is my girlfriend so back off.\" I turned to walk away but paused, adding, \"As if either of you two losers had a chance to begin with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not look back to see their expressions as I walked away but a sly smile from Lilith told it all, they were stunned. When Coach returned without Lyssa, she said, \"Everybody, hit the showers.\" then she turned to Amber and Cassie and said, \"You two are going straight to Principal Hendrick's office when you're through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice touch, telling them they did not have a chance, Garth.\" giving me a firm pat on the shoulder, Morgan said. \"I saw and I believe, Alyssa is a very cute girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's mine.\" raising a playful fist, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled. \"Congrats, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, those two trouble makers Cassie and Amber, had been given a few days suspension for their little prank. Only, less than an hour later, Grace and I were called to the principal's office. \"This is weird.\" muttering, Grace said. \"What did we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" worried, I replied. \"These past couple of days have been all weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace nodded in agreement but said nothing as we entered the principal's office. There, waiting for us with principal Hendrick was dad. \"I'm sorry to pull you two from your classes, kids.\" flatly, he said. \"I'm here on official business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, dad?\" looking frightened, Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been assigned to watch over a traumatized child who came to <i>us</i>, looking for help.\" seriously, dad replied. \"We believe the boy had escaped from a certain terrorist group in Europe as he had a punched plane ticket from Berlin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, noting that dad had emphasized 'us' meaning the PCG. \"What does that have to do with us?\" fearful, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until we can hide this boy in the system, I am not taking any chances.\" gripping my shoulder, dad said. he then turned to principal Hendrick. \"I am pulling my kids out due to a threat against me and my family by the shooter who tried to attack the school this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace gasped. \"He escaped!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he did not escape.\" firmly but kindly, dad said. \"Not on my watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confused me more but then principal Hendrik spoke, \"This is official business, kids.\" firmly, she said. \"Please sign out and go with your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about?\" curious, I asked as dad led us to his squad car. \"Were you really threatened by that jerk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"Yes but I'm not worried about him.\" seriously, he replied. \"That boy I mentioned had escaped from the Agency and he confirmed my worst fears.\" he took a breath as if to steady himself. \"They are after you, all of the kids of the original members.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped at that. \"So, they're bringing the fight to us?\" guessing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not certain.\" getting into the driver's seat, dad replied. \"I do know that the Agency is already pulling strings to get the boy back though the legal system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any way to stop them?\" alarmed, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boy is an orphan.\" turning back to look at Grace and I, dad said. \"I had to push to adopt the kid to stop them from taking him back.\" he then smiled. \"My team moved faster, you two have a new little brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" a smile forming, I asked. \"What's his name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do we get to meet him?\" smiling as well, Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going out to meet him just as soon as I pick up your mother.\" turning back to the front, dad said. \"He has talents of his own so don't be too shy around him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, dad drove away from the school with his lights flashing...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Grace and I both noticed this and began to worry. \"Um... dad, where are we going?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had a secret underground headquarters set up, which we intended to use if things got too dangerous.\" driving, dad began. \"It is an old subway system project that the city abandoned years ago due to budget issues. The tunnels go everywhere under the city but no one remembers it even exists, they abandoned the project over fifty years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that where you are keeping our new brother, Tim?\" curious, I asked. \"This underground headquarters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"When the Agency makes their move, and I believe they will, that is where we will be taking everyone.\" firmly, he said. \"No one knows it exists and we removed all evidence of its existence from the city records to make sure of that so everyone would be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stole them?\" surprised, Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... misplaced them.\" with a knowing smile, mom replied. \"I believe they were 'accidentally' sold at a charity auction years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To who?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Geo Tanner.\" innocently, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, we arrived at a dead end road where dad hit a garage opener. Curious, I looked out and watched, wide eyed as a part of the road slowly sank into the ground, forming a ramp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" whispering, I said. \"The graphic novels never mentioned anything about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then drove down the ramp before it rose back into position, hiding the entrance. \"That was originally the parking garage entrance, we just installed a door.\" calmly, dad said. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ted parked the car, we stepped out to see that the subway station had been modified from what was a subway station to a command center I had seen in many a action movie. \"Welcome to the Subterranean Urban Base station.\" motioning to the many rooms on either side of a crudely paved road, mom said. \"This is where we took Tim to hide and train with an old friend of ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way.\" walking ahead, dad said. \"Let me introduce you to the newest member of our family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked down the wide sidewalk between the road and the many offices to a small boy standing with a tall young woman who excused herself and left before we could reach her. \"Who...\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim, this is our son, Garth and our daughter, Grace.\" motioning to us, dad said. he then motioned to the boy. \"Kids, this is Tim, your new little brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears formed Tim's eyes \"Little... brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom knelled down, smiling. \"The final adoption papers rushed through only an hour ago.\" looking at him, she said. \"Welcome to the family... Tim Jones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim jumped into mom's arms, crying. \"Mommy!\" whimpering, he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Its alright, Tim.\" stroking his hair, she said. \"Let it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Tim had managed to compose himself, mom released him and dad pulled him into a hug as well. \"No one can replace your biological father.\" holding him tight, he said. \"Still, I am honored to call you my son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim lost it again, crying into dad's arms. It was truly a touching sight. Grace and I exchanged smiles before I stepped up to him. \"So you are Tim.\" smiling, I said. \"Good to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad broke the hug and Tim took my hand, shaking it. I tried not to grip him too tight but I could see him wince when I shook his hand. \"Sam-Same here.\" shyly, he replied. \"I hope we can be good friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends?\" smiling, Grace asked. \"Tim, you are family now, it goes beyond friendship; you are a part of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim blushed brightly at that to which Grace giggled and gave him a warm hug. \"You will never be alone, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Agency... they- they...\" frightened, he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom took him into another hug. \"They know all about it, dear.\" cooing him, she said. \"Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled then grew to Olympian proportions. \"We are far from defenseless, little bro.\" my voice booming, I said. \"Like dad, we have talents of our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to me, dad did the same behind me as Tim gaped at me. Only I guessed I had eased his mind as he then smiled at me. \"We inherited abilities from our mom and dad through a symbiont.\" returning to normal, I said. \"An alien creature, living inside our bodies which give us our power in exchange for 'room and board'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is epic.\" whispering, Tim said. he then smiled. \"I have a power of my own, want to see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace and I eagerly nodded and Tim pulled out a pen and pad before quickly drawing an image. Once done, he seemed to drag the image off the paper and onto himself before he transformed before our eyes into a tall female warrior with large breasts and powerful muscles in a tight body suit. \"I am Amazona, Princess of Power!\" in a strong female voice, the woman before us said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace and I looked at Tim's new form with our jaws dropped as mom and dad merely shook their heads. Once the initial shock wore off, Grace giggled. \"Um... your character is a bit much.\" clearly amused, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you need to tone that character down a little.\" smiling, I agreed. \"For one, err, Amazona is proportioned all wrong, she'll have a hard time standing straight, let alone fight anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe costume I was now wearing began to rip and Grace quickly covered my eyes. \"Please put the drawing back before we all get a show.\" firmly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim touched the paper pad and the woman returned to it, becoming a mere drawing again. In her place, Tim stood, looking slightly drained. \"I just wanted to impress you.\" pouting, he said. \"Please don't be mad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Grace giggled. \"We're not mad.\" roughing up his hair, she said. \"It's just that Amazona character needs work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't believe me, ask the others.\" smiling, I said. \"You'll meet them later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, dad drove Grace and I back into town where I asked to go to Lyssa's house. \"She had a bad day, dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, the principal informed me.\" calmly, dad said. \"I'll drop you off and pick you up later.\" he then frowned. \"Just two things; no word about Tim for now, he is still in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" worried about my new brother, I said. \"The second thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"Stay in the common rooms, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, glad dad was allowing me to visit. \"Yes, dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I got a concussion from my father beating me when I was a kid, and my senses have been cranked to 11 ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not sure if Lilith was aware but she rose off the floor by a full inch. <i>\"What on Earth!?\"</i> surprised, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my mouth to tell her but Lyssa clapped her hand over my mouth, motioning me to remain silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you expect us to take your word for this?\" Tim continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is more,\" Lilith admitted. \"I know it sounds crazy, but I woke up this morning lying on the ceiling over my bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would explain it,\" Tim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain what?\" curious, Lilith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa took her hand away from my mouth and nodded. \"Lilith,\" I said, \"you're an inch off the floor.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We all turned to see a tall, slender young woman with long, raven black hair and green eyes; she was wearing a flattering black dress that complimented her figure well. She smiled at Sarah and knelled down to hug her as if she were an old friend. <i>\"They must know each other.\"</i> watching, I thought. <i>\"I wonder from where.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been too long, Madam Vague.\" releasing the woman, Sarah said. \"I'm honored that you bring light to my home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The honor is mine, dear child.\" rising to her feet, Madame Vague said. \"When Lilith told me the address, I knew it was your family and the family of your friends she was concerned for.\" she then teared up slightly. \"I am truly sorry I was too late to save you from the wrath of Clarence Mayweather...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saved me from bleeding to death on the side of the road, Madam Vague.\" tearing up with her, Sarah said. \"I owe you my life, still today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" her voice shaking, Lilith asked. \"You know Mrs Vance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes; I do.\" turning to her Madame Vague said. \"She had called herself Heather 'Hawkeye' as a member of the Problem Child Gang, twenty years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... you- you were just a- a kid then too.\" stammering, Lilith said. \"Please mom, what is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame Vague smiled and casually walked over to her daughter. \"The cards will explain everything, Lilith.\" showing her a Tarot card deck, she said. \"Place your trust in the wisdom of the Mystics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, those aren't my cards.\" confused and frightened, Lilith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my dear.\" still smiling, she replied. \"Your cards are in your hands.\" shocked, Lilith looked and saw that she was holding her Legacy deck then turned back to her mom as she said, \"These are mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she threw the cards into the air and they flew about with a fluttering sound as they shuffled themselves before lining up in the air as if they were being stacked onto a table. Once done, they were all shown face down, no matter which side you looked at, ready to be read and shown to all. Everyone's jaws dropped in shock as the Tarot cards fell from Lilith's hands. Sarah alone was smiling as Lilith's Tarot cards, like her mother's shuffled themselves in the air then lined themselves up before her. \"Not the most graceful cast, my dear.\" amused, Madame Vague said. \"Still, you are just beginning to learn.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Do you know what that signifies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith nodded. \"There was a call that you should heed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Always trust in the cards, daughter. I disregarded their warnings once, when I was attracted to my first husband. As a penalty, I was denied my powers, until today. That is why I could not protect us from his wrath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI asked, \"Why does Mrs. Vance keep calling you Madame Vague?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame Vague smiled. \"Her expectations were formed by old movies, where the fortune teller could lay out exactly what was to come.

Whenever I do, though, I keep drawing the Death card. What does it mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lilith spoke, I saw her draw another card. It was the Moon card. I did not know what that specified but, from the look on Lilith's face, something was about to change. Being the son of a police officer has its advantages, I had learned to read people's faces, knowing what they were feeling, I could tell... Lilith was scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame Vague sighed. \"If he ever learned about this, it would mean the death of us both.\" pausing, she said. taking a breath, she said, \"Lilith, you drew the Death card because your father is dead.

I ran out of the house, not daring to look back but I knew they were on my tail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who were they?\" concerned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" shaking her head, Madame Vague said. \"I managed to lose them just outside of Fallen Heroes Cemetery on the edge of town where I found a number of people in dark robes gathered around a fire among the tombstones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creepy.\" shivering, Lyssa muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It turned out to be a coven of witches.\" said Madame Vague, softly. \"A young woman among them approached me and smiled....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Madeline Wallace.\" the woman said. \"I have been expecting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline, terrified and out of breath, took a step back. \"Yo- You know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled then threw a number of cards into the air. They shuffled on their own then lined themselves in the air. \"The cards never lie.\" serious, she said. \"My time in this world is coming to a close but your time is just beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline took another step back. \"What do you want from me?\" almost crying, she asked. \"Has everyone gone crazy!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in no danger, Madeline Wallace.\" said the other cloaked people. \"Come....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline found herself slowly walking forward, though her mind screamed to run away. Once she was before them, staring into the camp fire, the young woman walked up and placed her hands onto Madeline's shoulders, staring into her eyes as the others formed a circle around them. They all began to chant with Madeline reciting it with them, though she had never heard it before. As they did, a light, glowing mist bellowed from the woman's mouth and entered Madeline's mouth, causing them both to glow with an eerie light. Madeline stared in horror as the woman became older and older before her eyes. Finally, the chanting stopped and the once young woman was not nothing more than dust, blowing in the light wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... happened?\" trembling with terror, Madeline asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our sister has passed to the next realm.\" solemnly, one of the cloaked figures replied. \"She had no children to pass her power onto so she has chosen and entrusted you to to be that daughter she never had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her knowledge, her wisdom, and her power is now your own.\" added a second hooded figure. \"Use your gifts wisely.\" she then smiled. \"Welcome to the coven sisterhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame Vague wiped the tears from her eye. \"I had lost my mother when I was young and watched a woman who had chosen me as a daughter she never had die before my eyes.\" emotionally, she said. \"I had vowed make her proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" awestruck, Lyssa whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Epic.\"</i> impressed, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*There is much tragedy in her past*</i> sadly, Amara said in my thoughts. <i>*That makes her strong in character.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame Vague nodded. \"My first husband, Darren, and I fell in love quickly and did not consult the cards before marrying him.\" looking slightly ashamed, she said. \"That brings us to Dr Thomas Vague.\" she paused to force a smile. \"He was our family doctor and always defended me when he could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, mom.\" taking in every word, Lilith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One night, Darren had beat me senseless and left to get even more drunk. I called Dr Vague and he came over to tend to my wounds.\" her smile vanishing, Madame Vague replied. \"As he was treating me, Darren returned, found the two of us together, and went into a rage. He mortally wounded Dr Vague with his hunting knife.\" she cried freely. \"That was when I had enough and used my magick on him. One punch sent him through the closed door, across the hall, and through the wall into the room beyond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That had to be some punch!\"</i> surprised, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom... one punch!?\" her eyes widening to saucers, Lilith asked. \"That could have killed him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I learned that magick can not kill.\" almost regretful, Madame Vague said. \"Still, to this day, he fears me when I become angry.\" she sighed. \"I then turned my attention onto Dr Vague and consulted the cards to find a way to save him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't find a way, though.\" sadly, Lilith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't.\" shaking her head, Madam Vague replied. \"But I did find a way to help him carry on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made love to him as he died?\" stunned, Lyssa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's creepy...\"</i> shuddering, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honored his last request as a debt of honor, Lilith.\" sternly, Madame Vague replied. \"He wanted... a family. I had intended to 'introduce' you to him once Darren's visitation rights were officially revoked next week, Lilith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Lilith did not respond as she, we all were still soaking everything in. Finally, a small smile slowly formed onto her face. \"My dad sounds like an incredible man.\" dreamily, she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadam Vague smiled. \"He was.\" she then turned to Sarah. \"The Agency may be after my daughter and I for my involvement with the Problem Child Gang twenty years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible.\" admitted Sarah. \"You did help us in your own mysterious ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to join the new gang?\" offering her hand to me, Lyssa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith turned to the cards, causing her to frown slightly, before she turned back to her. \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She will drive you to the SUB station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to pick up Lilith and her mother.\": serious, dad replied. \"They were the target.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they okay?\" coming down the stairs, Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They handled the situation but this is only the beginning.\" quickly, dad said. \"We'll talk more later, please just do as I say and go with your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough we were both worried, Grace and I walked to the garage where mom helped us load the suitcases into the car before we piled in and mom drove away from the house. \"Don't worry, kids.\" sighing, she said. \"It's just a house, home is where your head rests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You talk as if we may not be coming back here.\" worried, Grace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for a while, at least.\" frowning, mom replied. \"The Agency is as evil as they come, I'd rather be homeless than see them take either of you away as their prisoner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all fell silent after that as mom quickly drove out of town, towards the SUB station's secret entrance....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The boys are on the right side of the hall, the girls are to the left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into an empty room near the middle of the hall and found a small bed, a dresser with a mirror, and a washroom on the other side. It was not much. \"Home sweet home.\" sighing, I muttered. \"I guess it could be worse, I mean this can be worked on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just temporary, Garth.\" standing behind me, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't we stay at the mansion headquarters?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"It's not there anymore.\" sadly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace and I turned to her, startled. \"What!?!\" stunned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mansion and its general location were mentioned several times in the graphic novels.\" tearing up, mom explained. \"It was heavily fortified but not from a Napalm bomb.\" she held back a sob. \"The mansion was engulfed in flames within seconds, just like the mansion in Europe. Had we been there....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grace and I stared at mom, our jaws dropped then pulled her into a warm hug. \"It's going to be okay.\" tearing up myself, I said. \"It's just a building, they can rebuilt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father managed to salvage the mission log book and the 'Beast' van.\" composing herself, mom said. \"The rest is just a memory.\" she sighed. \"Why don't you go meet the others and, please, not a word of this until we can determine who was responsible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace and I nodded then walked out of the hall to a spacious room, dominated by a large table surrounded by chairs. There we met up with Lilith, Alyssa, and Beth. \"Are you alright?\" Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just surprised,\" Lilith replied, as Beth and Lyssa joined us. \"Being jumped by Agency goons is no way to start the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" came Cait's voice. When I turned to see her, I noticed that she was now wearing a light brown hair wig, it really showed the family resemblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith's place was attacked by the Agency,\" I explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My house was attacked just a few days ago,\" Cait said. \"I think the two might be connected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody, keep your eyes open,\" Grace said. \"If the two home invasions are part of a pattern, any of us could be next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, I went to school on edge. My friends had been attacked, the mansion headquarters had been burned to the ground with a Napalm bomb, and Travis and Megan have vanished without a trace without a word after school yesterday. I was not so certain it was a good idea to be at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few classes moved smoothly, though the teachers noticed I seemed rattled In geometry class, my teacher, Mrs. Dawkins walked up to my desk. \"You seem unnerved, Mr Jones.\" concerned, she said. \"Would you care to talk about it after class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy uncle's summer mansion burned to the ground yesterday.\" softly, I replied. \"It was arson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Dawkins eyes grew wide for a moment. \"I see...\" softly, she said. \"I'm sure your father will find those responsible for the crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded but did not respond as the bell had rung for lunch...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To my surprise, she pulled out a key and unlocked the door before quickly ushering us though with her following, closing and locking the door behind her. \"When the substation was built, we made this shortcut to the school to avoid being tardy after fighting crime.\" smiling, mom whispered. \"Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, mom moved down the stairs to the basement boiler room where she pushed hard against one wall, revealing a secret door to yet another set of stairs.

He grew slightly, his hair falling passed his shoulders, which rounded slightly as his body took on the shape of my older sister. We did not have to wait long for the transformation to finish before we saw our 'new sister' a copy of Grace Jones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" grinning slightly, I said. \"I'm the youngest again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace rolled her eyes and Tim imitated her, earning a laugh from everyone, including me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know yet if you have my powers,\" said Grace \"We'll have to try a test to find that out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat sort of test?\" Tim asked, suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace took on an offensive pose. \"I've always wondered what it would be like to fight myself,\" smiling, she said. \"I guess now I'm going to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This should be interesting.\"</i> smiling, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Tim faced the real Grace, I guessed that he knew it was not going to be an easy match.

I shook my head, knowing he was at a disadvantage from the start, not used to fighting as a girl. Grace took a swing at Tim, which he too dodged easily and swung back. \"You're pretty good, sis.\" struggling to make a hit, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back at you... sis.\" as if toying with 'her', Grace replied. \"Only, I think we should raise the bar a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that said, she went at Tim with a barrage of kicks and swings, hitting 'her' with most of them.

Only Grace seemed to be onto him as she charged 'her'. \"You won't get the chance to draw anything else.\" almost teasing, she said. \"I'm too fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then heads up!\" throwing the paper at her, Tim yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paper flew from Tim's notebook and, as if following her thoughts, wrapped themselves tightly around Grace until she looked like a paper wrapped mummy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was unexpected.\" stunned, I whispered. \"It looks as if Tim has a few aces up his sleeve after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad called the sparing match over, seeing Grace was unable to move and hurried to her only to see her tear herself free. \"It seems as if Tim has a telekinetic power over paper, dad.\" blushing, she said. \"We should look deeper into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" eying Tim, dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am- Am I in trouble?\" worried, Tim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"No but we should work on that new part of your power.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had a lot of old electronic equipment but they all still worked. \"Let's take a look at the sparring match a little more closely.\" queuing up a recording of the fight on a screen, dad said. \"There seems to be more to your power than meets the eye, Tim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he played the video of Tim's transformation into Grace at a much slower pace. What we saw was a surprise to us all. As Tim dragged the image off the paper, the paper quickly followed, attaching itself to his very body! It surrounded and encased his body in an instant, forming a paper body over his own! Then, in a flash, various colors of ink colored everything in, creating a perfect likeness of Grace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible!\" whispering, dad said. \"Here I thought it was some type of magical ability but it seems to be more of a psychic ability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Epic...\"</i> stunned, I thought. <i>\"My new brother has the coolest power.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it explain the drawings I make being able to talk?\" stunned, Tim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace thought for a moment then asked Tim, \"Have you ever worked on a character for so long, that it seemed to have a life of its own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I think I get it.\"</i> guessing, I thought. <i>\"Tim's powers give the characters he draws a life of their own, meaning they can almost think for themselves.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made those characters so you know how they would react to certain situations.\" jumping in, dad said. \"When you are not certain of what to do, you ask yourself, what would this character or that character do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the character answers...\" astounded, Tim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a truly unique ability, Tim.\" smiling, I said. \"Only becoming someone else only seems to work when it is a character you know well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" nodding, dad said. \"I would focus on summoning only what you know you can control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thought, Tim asked, \"Do you think I can control this without drawing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can react more quickly?\" asked Grace. Tim nodded. \"Maybe, give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim turned to my large notebook, about the size of a small satchel, concentrating. Seconds later, paper flew from the notebook and quickly wrapped itself around Tim in a frenzy. It was a mere blur to me but, in a flash, Tim was wearing an impressive looking suit of armor, like in the medieval times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it!\" looking him myself, Tim declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is only the tip of the iceberg, son.\" serious, dad said. \"Its time for some serious training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, dad led him out of the room, back to the main track and motioned him to stay as he continued on for a few steps. Suddenly, his muscles grew in size and he charged him. I was tempted to run out to his defense but Grace held me firm, shaking her head. Reluctantly, I turned back to the window where we watched Tim yell as dad let his fist fly. Tim rose rose his arms as if to shield himself but, in an instant, papers flew from a nearby table and a shield was formed in the blink of an eye, meeting dad's fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was holding way back on that swing.\" relieved, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh.\" giggling, Grace said. \"You should know dad better than that. Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just as I thought, the paper reacts to your mind's need to defend yourself and others.\" smiling dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was surprised to find myself now holding the shield but even more surprised to find that a sword had been added, resting in a sheath at his side. \"Did I do that?\" almost whispering, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did.\" smiling, dad replied. \"Though most of it was through reflex, you made that happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Immediately, he started flicking through the pages. I saw his eyes glaze over and shared a concerned look with Grace and dad. He stopped on a page with Sykes pictured on it. Sykes was young, fair skinned, with short brown hair and what looked like cat's eyes. He wore what looked like antique leather armor from the middle ages. It was a strange look but that did not make him any less dangerous. Tim looked at the picture for a moment then turned to us, his face becoming pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sykes has found you,\" his lips trembling, he said. \"At least, he has a rough idea where you are, he's flying to Waterfront City at first light to attack the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much time do we have?\" looking at him, dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim teared up as the picture had stopped moving. \"I- I don't know.\" crying, he said. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call Alyssa,\" grabbing my cellphone, I said. \"Grace, you call Cait, see if she has sensed this. Maybe she can give us more details as what Sykes has planned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" grabbing her own cellphone, Grace replied. \"We'll have to coordinate this, Cait's communication with all of us by telepathy and Alyssa's speed will save us a lot of time.\" she turned to dad. \"You might want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already on it, sweetie.\" dialing a number on his cellphone, dad said. \"We need to get the civilians off the streets for when this dirt bag makes his move.\" he paused. \"This is the real deal, kids. Sykes is as dangerous as they come, pray what little training you got was enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will need disguises.\" suddenly, Grace said. \"We already decided that, but we never got around to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that.\" serious, dad said. \"All of us had made costumes for you, similar to what we wore when we fought crime. It may not be your style but there are lives on the line, there is no time to pick and choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the pages in the graphic novel turned on their own until they reached the back of the book, showing a picture of the author, Aaron Flynn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, lad.\" in a heavy Irish accent, the man said. \"You look like you could use some help and a bit of luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim's eyes went wide. \"How are you able to talk to me?\" stunned, Tim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not hear Tim talking to the book but I did see him staring into it. <i>\"What now?\"</i> worried, I thought. Curious, I placed my hand onto Tim's shoulder as I looked over his shoulder. You can imagine my surprise when I saw an image of Detective Flynn moving... and talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be plenty of time to answer that later, lad.\" firmly but kindly, Flynn replied. \"For now, tell your new pop to answer his phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture stopped moving and Tim turned to dad as he ended his call with the police station. \"You might want to answer that.\" his voice quivering, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad gave Tim a questionable look but jumped as his cellphone rang...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was surprised to see Amber, looking shaken, stepping out of the car with Lilith. Deciding to find out, I walked towards them with Grace at my side and out new little brother, Tim between us. Mom came out from a hall and took the lead. I guessed that Lilith had used the moon card to get everyone underground in a hurry, which was why Amber seemed so shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took me by surprise as well.\" urging Amber out of her mother's car, Lilith said. \"Welcome to the Subterranean Urban Base station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really existed!?\" startled, Amber asked. \"Does that mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief Jones was Tex the mighty.\" serious, Lilith replied. \"All of it was real, including the Agency, who attacked you today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did your mom know my mother?\" still rattled, Amber asked. \"Is there anything else I should know about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, there is.\" walking into their view, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to find her walking towards them with Grace and I following, leading our little brother, shyly staying between us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blessed be, Mrs Jones and family.\" kindly, Lilith said. \"Who is your new friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Everyone, I'd like you to meet the newest member of our family.\" motioning to the small boy, she said. \"This is Tim Jones, he was an orphan from Europe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense you were in the hands of the Agency.\" serious, Lilith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was but he was not brainwashed.\" cutting in, Cait said. \"His mind is free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and I have already met him.\" smiling, Vague said. \"He has the strange power to make anything he draws come to life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't we meet him earlier?\" confused, Lilith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim gave a sheepish smile. I knew he was too shy to come out so I did not push him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, child,\" patiently, Vague replied, \"he was too scared to come out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We convinced him you were all cool.\" placing a firm hand onto his shoulder, I chimed in. \"These are my friends, little bro, you couldn't be in safer hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the S.U.B. Station, Tim,\" Lilith said, holding out a hand. \"My name's Lilith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" shaking her hand, Tim said. \"If dad had said there were pretty girls like you here, I might have made my presence known sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool your jets, bro,\" Grace told him. \"Lilith isn't into guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stifled a chuckle as Tim blushed slightly but it fortunately went unheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you can bring your drawings to life?\" Lilith asked, brushing off the attempted flirting. \"I can call up the figures from my Tarot cards. That sounds similar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly,\" smiling, Tim replied. \"My drawings actually move on the page. And I can actually become them. Want a demonstration?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all nodded eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his sketchbook and stopped on one page. \"Say hello to... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a good idea of how Tim's power worked better, I watched as dozens of pieces of paper surrounded and reformed Tim's body into a different form. In the blink of an eye, a tall woman appeared where Tim once stood. \"... Amazona, Princess of Power!\" finishing his line, the woman said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, remembering Tim's first character example. <i>\"Not much of an improvement.\"</i> sighing, I thought. \"Oh well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazon Tim created was six feet tall, with breasts that looked like she was smuggling basketballs under her skin tight costume. Lilith snorted. \"Yeah, you came up with that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" confused, the 'woman' asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you try moving around off the printed page,\" Lilith explained, \"those bazongas are going to be more of a hindrance than a help. They block your field of vision, they'll restrict your arm movement, and they'll make you fall over the second your back isn't straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya, Tim,\" Grace added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did well to hide my smile as I heard Madame Vague stifle a giggle. <i>\"Tim is a good kid.\"</i> bemused, I thought. <i>\"But he needs serious help understanding girls.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, Amazona, tried moving around, and quickly saw that we weren't joking. \"I see your point, younglings,\" she said. \"I am sure the artist sees it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim doesn't just change physically,\" calmly, I explained. \"The characters he creates come alive as he envisions them. So you're really talking to a character in a comic book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazona touched the paper again, and a sheepish Tim stood before us. \"Thanks for the advice,\" he said. \"I'll definitely redesign her before I call on her again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do that,\" Grace said. \"And, please, stop making her costume rip in strategic places in battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled, again glad that no one heard it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I saw that Cait was very shaken as Lyssa asked, \"What about him? Is he okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait began to cry, something I don't think anyone has seen her do before. \"They attacked his house....\" tearfully, she said. \"The Agency... they invaded his home, his kids are on the run.\" after a moment of looking into the distance, she suddenly announced, \"I have to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she vanished from sight. There was no way of knowing where she went and Lilith and Vague were busy talking with Amber. I turned to Beth to see if she could sense anything when Lyssa suddenly ran off as if the devil himself were chasing her. \"Where is she going!?\" worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, feeling helpless. \"Some leader I am.\" pouting, I muttered. \"I can't even keep my team together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so hard on yourself.\" said a voice with a heavy Irish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stumbled forward as a firm hand swatted me on the back. I turned to see an elderly but tall, muscular man in a twenties style gangster suit with a bollman hat and a long black jacket. Next to him was an elderly but tall and physically fit woman in similar attire. I recognized them immediately from the graphic novels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Detectives Aaron and Zena Flynn.\" almost in a whisper, I said. \"The A-Z Detectives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Retired.\" kindly, Zena said. she turned to Tim. \"We thought you were lost...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim's lips trembled before he jumped into Zena's arms. \"Grandma...\" crying, he whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear your father adopted Tim.\" taking my hand, Aaron said. \"I'm glad to see he is in good hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me but... how did you get here so fast?\" confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say I've had a bit more experience than Tim.\" smiling, Aaron replied. he paused, seeing dad rushing out of a room. \"You better go see what's going on, lad. Take Tim with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and ran over to the others with Tim following. \"We've got big trouble,\" dad said, as everyone quickly gathered around. he pointed to a flashing light. \"We're getting a distress call from the Vance residence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber groaned, and became a boy again. \"Just what I didn't need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary,\" Vague said. \"The strength of a Guardian will be needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll probably need this, too,\" Tim added, bringing out a male character this time. \"The name's Nightside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, everyone,\" Vague said, as she took out her Tarot deck. \"Focus on the Vance household.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were surrounded by a bright light. A blink of an eye later, we were standing in the Vance living room, as a horde of Agents ran roughshod over the place. \"Everyone, pick an opponent!\" dad commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone scattered to take on one of the invading agents, dad and I tag teamed against two muscular men who each took a swing at us with a stun wand. Dad grew in physique while I did the same as well as in height before the now startled men. <i>\"This is not a game.\"</i> firmly reminding myself, I thought. <i>\"This is real, no turning back..\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men attacked, one going after me and the other taking on dad. I dodged a swing from the stun wand then knocked it out of the man's hand before 'tapping' him in the stomach, causing the man to keel over, coughing. I grabbed the man by the belt then turned to dad, who had also had his opponent. We both exchanged a nod before I gave the man a heave, throwing him towards dad while he swung the man around, sending him flying towards me. The two men collided then fell into a heap onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to see two women, who I assumed were from Lilith's Tarot deck, slice two men's guns in half with their swords before a lion, a tiger, and a leopard appeared before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyssa! Machine gun kick!\" I heard Mr Vance yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to see Mr Vance take Lyssa into his arms and swing her around while she kicked at high speed, knocking out a number of men who had surrounded them. <i>\"Nice.\"</i> impressed, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Tim yell and turned to see him, as 'Nightside' and the former Amber back to back fighting street style and winning. \"Heads up, bro!\" yelled Grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ducked as Grace threw a punch into a man I did not see coming. \"Thanks, sis.\" relieved, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both eyes open, bro.\" firmly, Grace said. \"Stay focused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick up brass!\" called one of the Agents. They all activated devices on their wrists and disappeared, leaving only the ruined weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody okay?\" Lilith called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks that way,\" dad said. \"Hey, we scored a bonus. When these guns were chopped, it must have damaged whatever lets them teleport. We can finally get a look at their tech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sent someone disguised as me,\" Lyssa said, rubbing her hand. \"Her problem was, she moved too slowly. A few dozen punches per second, and she didn't see them coming.\" Her attention turned to the former Amber. \"Thanks for the help, Amber. Though it sounds funny calling you that at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I'll think of something,\" he said. \"I guess I'm finding out what life was like for you, huh? Sorry I was such a pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like they say, what doesn't kill me makes me stronger,\" Lyssa replied, as she gave Amber a hug. \"Thanks again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped listening and turned to Tim as he returned to his normal form. \"Nice work, Tim.\" smiling, I said. \"You did great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim blushed slightly. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention, everyone,\" Ted called. \"Given the current situation, we think it's best that we all relocate to the S.U.B. Station until things blow over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got the phone tree started,\" Mrs. Vance added. \"So, for those of you already at the station, you're all going to have company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's cell phone rang, and he checked it. \"Cassie,\" she said. \"We usually get together about this time, but I'm not at my house. And if she went there, she's probably seen what a wreck it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me talk to her,\" dad said. \"Hello? Hello, Cassie, this is Chief Jones. Yes, we're aware of what happened at Amber's house. She and her family are safe, and they've been relocated. I'll see that she gets your call, and I'm sure that she'll return it as soon as possible. Just remember that she's going through a lot right now. More than you know. Alright. Goodbye.\" He returned Amber's phone to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Amber said. \"Now I just have to figure out how to explain all this to her. When I change back, it won't be all the way. Who knows what I'll look or sound like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe start with texting,\" Lillith suggested. \"Let her know as much as you're comfortable with. She will need to know what's happening to you, though. If you were to keep it secret from her, she'd want to know where her friend went, and where this guy came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"I'm not sure if I'm cut out to be a leader.\" uncertain, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No leader is when they first start out.\" serious, Grace said. \"Don't second guess yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, sis.\" managing a weak smile, I said. \"I'd just be more comfortable if I had a second in command.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of you are in command right now.\" whispering to me, dad said. \"The others turn to you because you are a strong leader. They turn to Grace for her wisdom, Beth for her insight, Cait for her view into the future and Lilith for her clairvoyance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all rely on each other.\" catching on, Grace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the strength of a team.\" serious, dad said. \"When the time comes for one of you to take the lead, you will know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Vague gathered everyone around and drew the moon card....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It came on, showing camera images all over the city. One showed a number of strange hovering platforms, moving into the center of the city. He hit another button, filling the screen with that image. What they saw was Sykes and a number of his followers on five strange floating platforms, firing what looked like sci-fi laser rifles at random buildings. Dad focused the camera image on a man on the lead platform before a low growl echoed from his throat. The man was tall with longish brown hair and piercing green eyes. He was wearing oddly ancient leather armor as he held a laser rifle of his own while holding the hilt of a sword at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sykes!\" anger in his voice, he said. \"He's returned and he is attacking the city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why!?\" angry as well, I asked. \"What could he possibly gain by...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bait.\" flatly, Geo said. \"He's trying to draw us into the open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- What are we going to do?\" worried, Lyssa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll handle this.\" serious, dad said. \"Its us he wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not alone, you're not!\" firmly, I said. \"We are the new Problem Child Gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a bunch of kids with no real experience in taking down criminals!\" snapping, dad countered. \"All of you will stay here!\" he then turned to Tim. \"I need you, however, to come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim gulped. \"Me?\" surprised, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"I'll explain on the way to the surface.\" serious, he said. he then turned to the other parents and nodded before leaving the room with them following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I watched them leave, I realized I was facing my first real command decision....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I knew that it would only be a matter of time before they discovered the entrance and invaded our new headquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sykes destroyed the old headquarters.\" fuming, I muttered. \"I'm not letting them destroy this one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran back into the meeting room and alerted the others of what was happening. \"We need to get to the surface and stop them before they discover the entrance!\" firmly, I ordered. \"If they get in we will have no place to call headquarters, no place will be safe for us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" standing up, Amadeus said. \"What do you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Lilith. \"Can you teleport us all to the surface with your cards?\" hopeful, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe so.\" wincing, Lilith answered. \"I really never tried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can give your powers a boost.\" standing up, Caitlin offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith smiled then turned back to me. \"Yes, we can arrange that.\" she said. \"What's the plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to take them by surprise.\" serious, I said. \"Dad is right, we have no real experience; but there is no other choice, we have to fight them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others nodded and we all gathered around Lilith and Catlin before calling out, \"Problem Child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lilith produced the sun card.

Fortunately, Lyssa chimed in. \"You boys must be new in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men produced automatic weapons in response to which Amadeus laughed. \"What do you intend to do with those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when inspiration hit me and I turned to Amadeus. \"Let's show these guys some friendly Waterfront City hospitality!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Damien and Annette grew to the size of ten foot giants while Lyssa and Susan vanished; one in speed the other in ghost powers. Lilith drew a card while Caitlin lightly touched her left temple. Clem and Alex approached the men while undergoing a startling transformation. The now startled men raised their weapons to fire in defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore a single shot was fired, the rifles swiftly vanished or were sliced in half by an invisible sword, causing the men to shout in fright. Damien and Annette made short work of the floating platforms, reducing them to smoldering wrecks on the side of the road. One of the men swung what was left of his rifle at Clem only to have it caught by a tentacle!  Both Clem and Alex had become something out of a science fiction nightmare as they threw the men into the air left and right. Those they threw were sent flying at least ten feet up to come crashing down hard onto the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knight in shining armor appeared before another group of men before a dozen or so more appeared along side of him. They rendered the startled men unconscious with a single blow of their metal clad fists despite the men having gotten a few shots out at them. I ran through the ranks of the men with Amadeus at my side, knocking them out left and right with a single blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, the small army of men had been defeated and forced to surrender just as dad and his group returned from the city. Dad looked at our handiwork and sighed. At first, I thought we were in trouble until I saw the high hovering cameras above us. With a wave of her hand, Caitlin destroyed them all only we feared we had just given Sykes what he really wanted, what powers we had and how far along we were in using them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shook his head. \"All of you need to be a lot more alert than this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I felt I needed to speak up as I had become something of a leader. \"We beat them, dad.\" Frowning, I said. \"That, and we have a better idea what Sykes is after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You beat a scouting party.\" Flatly, dad countered. \"Also, we have a better idea what everyone is after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the Agency.\" Sighing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sykes, the Agency, and C.H.I.L.D.\" Sternly, dad said. \"We were a thorn in all of their sides but for different reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sykes was searching for alien technology.\" Thoughtful, Clem said. \"Our town proved to be a honey hole for that and he was taking it piece by piece through seemingly unconnected crimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, he was using us.\" Angered, Geo stated. \"Our interference allowed Sykes to get away with what he was really after without anyone ever realizing it.\" He shook his head. \"All the while, we thought we were stopping him cold at every turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Agency was after the same technology.\" Frowning, Madame Vague said. \"Only they were more direct in their approach. We saw them as hired mercenaries working for Sykes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We locked horns with them when they kidnapped Heather.\" Darkly, dad added. \"It was the mission that nearly killed us all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C.H.I.L.D. wanted us.\" Chiming in, Sarah said. \"They offered us jobs as young agents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We refused.\" Evenly, dad said. \"They had been a thorn in our sides ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, taking everything in. \"We need a plan. Sykes has obviously returned to finish what he had started twenty years ago. Only he's far more powerful now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is obvious with Sykes.\" Sternly, dad said. \"Normally, I would never agree to splitting up but there is too much ground to cover as a unified group.\" He looked about the room, gaining nods from all of the parents. \"We will split up into family teams. Each team tackling a different mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once our missions are complete and successful, we will all converge upon the agency.\" Firmly, Geo added. \"We will finish this as we should have all those years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Lyssa who rewarded me with a weak smile. \"You be careful.\" Eying her, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa nodded. \"You do the same.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Get in the car; NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all rushed out through the front entrance of the mall to find dad outside a strange looking grey four door car. Right behind him, Alyssa's mom stopped with a strange car of her own; calling for her and Beth. \"Hurry, kids!\" Urgency in her voice, she screamed. \"Run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all ran for our parent's cars with Caitlin behind us! She breathed a sigh of relief seeing a black limousine with a tall dark figure holding the back door open. \"Please, Miss Spencer!\" Firmly, he urged, time is short!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone knows where to go!\" Firmly, Dad barked. \"Move! Move! Move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace and I jumped into the back of the car as mom was in the front passenger seat. The second the doors slammed shut, dad threw the accelerator to the floor causing the car to scream away from the mall with Mrs Vance and the limo driver each taking a different route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on, dad?!\" Alarmed, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHILD has caught up to us, kids!\" Looking back at us, mom replied. \"Only I fear they are not that interested in us anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped at that. In the graphic comic, CHILD, or Central Headquarters of Intelligence, Logistics, and Defense was a mysterious and powerful underground global organization that worked outside of the world's governments. Their goal was to maintain a 'balance' in the world with or without the world's blessings. They gained their funding through unknown and assumed dark means. Everything I read about them made me believe they were no better than the terrorists they fought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think they are after Grace and I?!\" Stunned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are after all of you!\" Angrily, dad said. \"We're all meeting at a secure location to discuss our options but first, we need to lose our tail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked out the back windshield to find an ominous black four door car with tinted windows in hot pursuit of dad's car. I considered jumping out to somehow slow them down but dad had other plans. He pushed a button on the dash board which threw the steering wheel to the passenger side of the car with gas and break pedals emerging from the passenger side floor! \" Heather, take the wheel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom screamed in surprise as she took the wheel and steered the car through the traffic. \"Dad, what do you think you are doing?!\" Alarmed, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stepping out!\" pushing another button, dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top of the car opened, like that of a convertible. Dad unbuckled his seat belt, throwing on a ski mask, before leaping from the car with surprising strength! It was like a slow motion scene in a movie. Dad's body quickly grew to a near impossible size and slammed his fist into the hood of the pursuing car! The vehicle stopped dead in its tracks with a sizable dent in the hood! The front tires were both blown out from the sheer strength of the single powerful blow! Mom slammed on the brakes, bringing the car to a halt in the break down lane. Dad then leaped away from the pursuing car and landed back in the front seat with his body back to normal size. Removing the ski mask, he winked at at a stunned Grace. \"You're old man still has a few surprises up his sleeve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really were Tex the mighty!\" Shaken, Grace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad calmly pressed a button on the dash board, returning the wheel to the driver's side. \"Believe me, kids.\" Frowning, he said. \"I'll likely be feeling that in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now, dad?\" Worried, I asked. \"Everyone on the freeway just saw you hulk out and turn a car into junk with one blow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"I'm the chief of police.\" Calmly, he said. \"This will be chucked up as another 'strange incident' in the small city of Waterfront, New York.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, dad pulled away from the curb and sped off down the now clear freeway as he took up his police radio. \"There has been an accident on the Forefather's Bridge!\" Firmly, he reported. \"A pile up has followed with reports of debris falling from a truck causing the accident!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to see a truck speeding ahead of us with various items falling from it and smiled. \"Clever, dad.\" Impressed, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rodger, Chief Jones!\" Came a male voice over the radio. \"We have units dispatched and on the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be following a lead on the mall shooting!\" Firmly, dad radioed back. \"I will be in touch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rodger, chief!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad then placed the radio back in the nook he took it from and pressed a button, closing the car top. \"This is just the beginning, kids.\" Serious, he said. \"Your favorite fantasy is now your new reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going, mom?\" Almost whispering, Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"We are going to all meet up at a place we called...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The road was one I remembered from the graphic novels. It lead to Nowhere, a small addition to Waterfront that was abandoned after the builders discovered they were building the city addition on top of an abandoned coalmine. \"Welcome to your home away from home, kids.\" Sporting a sly smile, dad said. \"No one comes near this town since it <i>was</i> all falling into the mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI caught on to dad emphasizing the word 'was' and raised a single eyebrow. \"Don't tell me this small town was your back up headquarters!\" Surprised, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"No, it was our primary headquarters.\" Smiling, dad said. He then threw mom a smile. \"Did you really think everything in the graphic novel was completely accurate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and the others changed the story around for the graphic novels just in case you went back to fighting crime!\" Catching on, Grace said. \"You knew this might happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but we did not count on you kids developing powers of your own.\" Serious, mom said. \"The club house we are going to is a decoy to lure The Agency to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will have a better chance of controlling the situation that way.\" Serious, dad explained. \"With any luck, you kids will be going back to school from spring break with all of this finally behind us for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad stopped the car at the entrance to the old coal mine and pressed another button on the dashboard. The boards blocking the entrance moved up like a garage door and dad drove the car in with the door closing behind the car. Beyond was a tunnel that lead downward in an easy slope but had several turns before reaching several floor below the town.

You will also get your own key to get in when needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, dad shoved the key home and turned it. A soft click was heard before a larger section of the wall opened and we followed him through into the clubhouse. It was just as the comic depicted it. They were in a barren room with dozens of doors that lead into all directions. \"Welcome to maze hall, kids.\" Smiling, mom said. \"We call it this because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call it that because the clubhouse is literally a maze.\" Interrupting, Grace said. \"If you don't know which direction to take, you could end up lost of hours.\" She smiled. \"By then, the Problem Child Gang will know you are there and you will be caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Taken straight out of the graphic comic books.\" Bemused, she said. \"The maze of halls is one of our last lines of defense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will have time to tell you all about it later.\" Serious, dad said. \"Follow us and don't lag behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace and I followed mom and dad through a small number of dark passageways before entering a well lit chamber Grace and I recognized immediately as we saw it pictured several times in the comic series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the war room!\" In awe, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe war room had flat smooth stone walls with two levels of computer stations against the far wall. There was a door in the middle of each level leading deeper into the lair. The wall to the left was covered with monitors with several doors below them leading further in. The wall to the right was covered by a huge machine I recognized as the team's super computer. In the center was a large round table with two dozen chairs resting around it. On the table was a map of Waterfront and its surrounding communities. As we walked further in, I turned to the wall behind us to find it lined with books and paperwork with staircases and walkways to get to all of the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was where the Problem Child Gang met to discus plans of action during any crisis.\" Smiling slightly, dad said. \"We solved many crimes here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of our cases were against  man who called himself 'The immortal thief'.\" Frowning, mom added. \"We later learned that his real name was John Sykes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you two will be safe.\" Serious, dad said. \"We will come get you when this is all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure we can't change your mind?\" Wincing, Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, kids.\" Sadly, mom replied. \"This is our fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, dad dropped a small ball onto the ground creating a blinding flash and a thick smoke. Grace and I coughed slightly, breathing it in. When the smoke cleared, mom and dad were gone. I ran to the door we came in from but there was no sight of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to go after them!\" Worried, Grace exclaimed. \"They need us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree but do you remember all the turns we made getting here through that maze?\" Grimly, I countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace sighed, shaking her head. \"What are we going to do, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought, I replied, \"This was their base of operations. I say we get it running again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will that do?\" Curious, Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Recall the comic series, sis.\" Serious, I said. \"Every member of the Problem Child Gang had a marker on them so the other members could find them fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace smiled. \"So, if we can get this old equipment up and running again, we can find where they are!\" Excited, she said. \"Garth, you're a genius!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, we have to get this equipment running.\" Looking around, I said. \"I just don't know where to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace looked about then said. \"We have power so I think we need to first...\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I took the controls and flipped through the most recent scans to find mom and dad running out into the parking lot and quickly driving off. \"We missed them!\" Frustrated, Grace said. \"Only where did they go? They said that not all of the facts in the graphic comic series were accurate so we can't completely rely on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled slightly. \"Perhaps they were not being accurate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace looked at me, confused. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it, Grace.\" Turning to her, I said. \"We know the graphic comic series from front to back, minus the last issue. The best way to detour us is to say that the info was not accurate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a stretch, bro.\" Wincing, Grace said. She then smiled, an impressed look on her face. \"The comic series said the clubhouse was in the forests of New York State. It didn't say it was underground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking the information is accurate, just not complete.\" Smiling, I said. \"Dad told me to look for solutions, not problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace rubbed one arm as she did when she was nervous. \"So what do we do?\" Uncertain, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hit a few buttons on the security controls and pointed to an image of a black van in a garage. \"We won't help them finish what they started.\" Smiling, I said. \"We'll help them pick up where they left off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace's eyes widened slightly, seeing the van then slowly smiled. Only her smile vanished just at quickly. \"We can't do this alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to.\" Startling us, a familiar voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe turned to find Alyssa and Beth enter with Sam in her arms. Behind them was Cait, Trish and Marisol. Our friends smiled at us but Marisol seemed confused. \"What is this place, Caitlin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up and approached her. \"Welcome, Marisol.\" I said. \"You are in the presence of the new Problem Child Gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of the members, anyway.\" Smiling, Grace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisol turned from one person to another then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was a bit surprised as well since I heard her voice in my head as well. Her powers were growing just as all of our powers were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have telepathy, Caitlin?\" Whispering, Marisol asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all have our own powers.\" Speaking up, Alyssa said. \"Just like our parents before us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Become a part of the new Problem Child Gang.\" Stepping up, Beth said. \"You can be our eyes and ears while we help our parents end this fight once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have the experience of our parents but I'm betting they didn't have any experience when they started either.\" Serious, I said. \"However, with a federal agent guiding us from headquarters, we might have a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pwease, Marisol.\" Looking at Marisol, Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisol sighed. \"I'm going to get hell for this...\" Whispering, she said. \"Alright, if we are going to this, we need to first wait for the other members to arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're already here.\" Pointing to the security screen, I said. \"Still, we need a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me what you know and we'll piece something together.\" Serious, Marisol said. \"I have an idea what your parents are planning but there is more than one enemy at play here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, knowing full well she was talking about. There was Sykes, the 'immortal thief', the terrorist group known as 'The Agency' and then there was the secret counter terrorist group known as 'CHILD'. All three of them had tangled with the original group so we may have to tangle with them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll lead the others here.\" Reaching the door in a blur, Lyssa said. \"The sooner we get a plan together, the better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she was gone. I turned to Grace who rewarded me with a quick smile. \"We might get grounded for this.\" Serious, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisol grunted. \"If you don't get killed first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, knowing that there was now no turning back. We were the new Problem Child Gang and we had our first mission, help our parents any way we could.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only that, but it was a great way to fend off any tough guys or thugs. On the other hand, I really didn\u2019t want to draw too much attention to myself and become known as the dude with the growing muscles, either, so I decided to take a middle path and just make my muscles slightly larger than before, but not too large in order to cause any alarm in school. I looked like a guy who had made some trips to the gym, but I wasn\u2019t ridiculously big either. I knew I could make my muscles grow much larger if I wanted to, and I was determined to do this only if it was absolutely necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking down the hallway past my locker, I spotted all my friends from the science and computer class. I just wore my polo shirt and jeans, since I wasn\u2019t in the mood to show off any of my muscles. There was no reason for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Garth!\u201d Jack said to me. He was one of the geeks in the computer lab. \u201cHow\u2019s going, dude?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, doing alright, man. Yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to work out in the gym with me during P.E. class this afternoon? I think we\u2019re all just lifting weights today!\u201d he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sure\u2026 I had no other plans and I really don\u2019t have a spotter!\u201d I shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you look like you\u2019ve put on some muscle!\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t think I looked that much bigger but obviously I had made my muscles big enough for other guys to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Jack. I\u2019ll spot you!\u201d I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, I walked into the gym at school and I changed into my shorts and tank top in the locker room. Then, I returned to the small weight room, where Jack was waiting for me. He got on the bench and added about fifty pounds to the bar, while I just stood at the end of the bench and looked down as he grabbed hold of the bar and pressed the bar up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job, mate! Seventy-five pounds is a good start!\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but I should go for more!\u201d he said, as I took my turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI added another thirty pounds to the bar and I pressed a few reps of a hundred-and-five. Obviously, I wasn\u2019t even straining to lift the bar or the weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn, dude! You can lift way more than that!\u201d Jack noted. \u201cYou\u2019re not even breaking a sweat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, man! Did I look like I was that strong? I didn\u2019t want to make it seem that obvious that I could become stronger all the time. I looked over and realized that whenever I wanted to lift something heavy, my muscles would automatically grow bigger to accommodate the increased weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 Yeah\u2026 I guess I can lift more, huh?\u201d I chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack added some plates to my bar, adding the total weight to 200 pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know I could lift that, and go up to 300, 400, or 500\u2026 What to do? What if Jack realizes that I\u2019m a lot stronger that anybody else at school even knows? Do I have to tell him about my muscles?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This place actually gave me the creeps, on one hand, but on the other, I knew that I had nothing to be afraid of, knowing how strong I was capable of becoming once I allowed my muscles to hulk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAha! Here it is\u2026\u201d dad said, as he drove the old pickup truck into a dirty, dusty old lot where tons of old cars were parked side-by-side, next to an old abandoned brick building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, dad\u2026 What\u2026 What are we doing here?\u201d I said nervously, as I got out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to lift and move some old cars around, son!\u201d he replied, as he walked over to the chain-linked fence. He pulled out a key and unlocked the padlock, which held the chain together, which was wrapped around the two metal ends of the steel doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026 How did you find this place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA friend of mine owns it\u2026 But he doesn\u2019t do anything with it\u2026 So we can make as much noise as we want!\u201d dad grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked through the gate and stared at the rows of old, beaten-up cars. Every car had something broken or missing, and was no longer in condition to be driving on the road anymore. These cars were just saved for spare parts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I want you to have some fun, Garth!\u201d dad said with a smile on his face. \u201cRemember how you used to love to play with those little toy matchbox cars when you were little?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah\u2026 I had a ton of those!\u201d I laughed. \u201cI lined them up side-by-side and I would push them across the tiled floor in the living room all the time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, son\u2026 It\u2019s time to be a kid again! This time, you get to play with real cars! I want you to take these cars over here, and stack them up over on the other side of the scrapyard, over there!\u201d dad said, as he pointed to the large empty area near the far corner of the property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to carry all these cars?\u201d I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can carry them, push them, or throw them\u2026 Whatever you like!\u201d dad replied. \u201cTreat them like toys!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rubbed my hands together as walked to the first row of cars. I squatted down besides an old Mustang and grabbed the bottom of the chassis and then the inside door with my other hand, lifting the side of the car easily. Right away, I felt my muscles bulging the moment I lifted the car off the ground. Then, I turned around and carried the car to the other side of the scrapyard, about seventy yards away, before setting the car down in the corner. I could already feel my biceps growing and my thighs and my calves getting bigger and harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around and ran back to the row of old cars, using the muscles in my legs. Running made my muscles in my legs grow even more so, and I could feel my muscles burn. I lifted and carried a Thunderbird, then a Camaro, and then an old Dodge Ram truck. My pectorals were pushing even further out of my chest and my biceps were becoming absolutely enormous! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was time to get some more cars, I decided to be more efficient. I grabbed the old Pontiac and I stacked it on top of the old Volvo station wagon. Then, I just pushed the Volvo to the other side of the field, with the Pontiac resting on top of it! That made my thighs just burn like crazy, and my calves were screaming with power by the time I made it to the other side. In the meantime, my dad was just looking on as I was pushing cars around the lot like they were nothing more than toys!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to get even more adventurous as I started hurling cars through the air. I lifted the other Volkswagen Beetle and I just launched it through the air, watching it crash on the ground next to the other cars. This made my arms, my shoulders, my triceps and my biceps bulge even more, and I could feel the burning sensation in my arms every time I lifted a car and hurled it through the air! It felt wonderful hurling a large piece of metal through the air. What a feeling! I had never felt so strong in my entire life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still had a few cars to move and I was quickly becoming impatient. I wanted to get the job done, and I wanted to move as many cars as possible. So, I took a car and I lifted it and smashed it on top of another car, which was of about the same size and shape. Then, I took a third car, also a sedan, and I placed that one on top of the second car on the stack. Then, I crawled under the bottom car, and grabbed hold of the chassis, lifting up all three cars at the same time. I had never lifted so much weight at once in my life! It just felt amazing! I had no idea I could be so strong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only could I feel the muscles in my arms burning like crazy, but I could feel my legs burning too as I walked across the yard carrying three cars over my shoulders. I could tell by the look on my father\u2019s face that is must have been quite a sight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I had finished moving all the old cars to the other side of the lot, I walked over to my dad. I was completely drenched in sweat and my shirt and shorts were soaked. Not only that, but my pectorals and biceps had grown so much, that they had torn my short in the front and at the sleeves. My shorts were also torn by the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dad just stood there, watching me with his arms folded in front of his chest. I could tell that he was pleased with what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026 Very good\u2026\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what next?\u201d I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee that old abandoned brick building over there?\u201d dad said, pointing to an old three-story building that had no windows and no doors. The building was completely empty and there was no paint and no plastering on the outside of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead and demolish it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at dad with a surprised look on my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPositive! My friend wants to use the property to store more cars and other things but you can save him the money of hiring a demolition crew!\u201d dad explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the small building and decided that it couldn\u2019t be too hard to demolish it. I figured I could try to lift the building up by the concrete foundation and then hoist it into the air, and I could drop it to the ground and watch it crumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over to the building and I stepped over to the edge of the building. Then, I used my hands to dig into the ground, just by the edge of the building. I dug into the ground until I could feel the edge of the foundation. I reached down with my hands and I grabbed hold of the edge of the building\u2019s foundation. Then, using every ounce of strength that I could muster, while standing at the corner of the building, I pulled up on the foundation, causing the corner of the building to come up from the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUUUUUURRRRRGGGHHHHH\u201d I grunted out loud, as I literally lifted the entire corner of the building off the ground, exposing the underside of the foundation while tilting the building to one side. I then walked closer to the center of the building, lifting the foundation further from the ground, tipping it even further from the ground, until the building tipped over and crashed to the other side of the ground, crumbling to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoohoo!\u201d I cheered, as I watched the building break apart. I had actually demolished a building with my own, bare hands! What a feeling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy adrenaline was running sky-high! My blood was pumping! My heart was racing! I was panting! But it was such a rush! My muscles were bigger than ever! I felt so strong, I felt like I could lift anything! At the same time, I felt like my muscles had grown to the maximum they could reach! I had maxed out! I couldn\u2019t become any stronger than this! So what would happen to me now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I was overcome by an intense tingling sensation all over my body. This was not just in my muscles, but everywhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAARGGGHHH!\u201d I moaned out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I felt like I was having a massive growth spurt! My feet were expanding so fast, that I ripped out of my shoes. My legs were growing longer and bigger all at once, expanding in every direction! My torso was growing wider and deeper in proportion, while my hands and my arms were becoming longer and thicker while becoming more muscular at the same time. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, I woke up feeling great; the only thing was that I was hungry as a wolf. I ate two omelets and three pancakes along with four slices of toast. Boy that felt great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just watched some TV during the day and I worked on my reading list for school. I breezed through a few chapters of one of the books which I needed to read, and I worked on some math problems, before I took an afternoon nap. Needless to say, I was totally recharged by the time evening rolled around, and I had to get out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to go to the gym that night. Just because there were fewer people in the gym, and nobody would be around to ask questions if they saw me hulking out after a few reps on the bench. I knew chances were I would hulk out quite easily, and I didn\u2019t feel like explaining my condition to anybody in the gym, so I decided to go over there when nobody else would be around to observe my workout routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked in and dropped off my bag in the locker room. I changed into my shorts and tank top before hitting the weight room. Of course, lifting weights was a piece of cake for me, and I was done in no time at all. The heaviest weights were like plastic to me, and the highest settings on the machines didn\u2019t even faze me one bit. Even when I added the heaviest weights to the bar, I was able to lift them with ease. I didn\u2019t even break out in a sweat. I could feel my body and my muscles just getting stronger with every rep and with every lift. Needless to say, I was feeling totally pumped up by the time I left the gym late that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, it was just past midnight by the time I walked out of there. I was wearing my gray sweat pants and my gray sweater with long sleeves and I pulled my hood over my head, covering my face, so that nobody was able to recognize me from a distance. I was just carrying my gym soft bag in my right hand, and I decided to take a different route home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t even feeling tired. In fact, I decided to take the long way home. I noticed that I didn\u2019t need to sleep as much as I used to, and now that I was all pumped up, I figured I could spend a few hours on the street. I had my cell phone with me, just in case my parents needed to get a hold of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to walk behind a small strip mall rather than walk along the main road, so that I wouldn\u2019t be seen by any cops who would be funny and pull me over and ask me why I was out so late at night. As I was walking, I spotted one back door to a store, which was open. I thought that was kinda unusual, for a shop that was normally closed, at this weird hour of the night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked up to the opened door and I quietly walked into the back of the store. From the signs posted against the wall, I noticed that this was the shipping store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d I said out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quietly walked further and saw someone shining a flashlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I spotted somebody standing over the cash register, which was wide open as he was trying to crack open the safe, which was on the floor behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What\u2019s going on?\u201d I shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo men turned around, both dressed in black, and carrying flashlights. I noticed right away what the deal was. They were in the process of robbing the store!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first man then swung his metal flashlight at my head, which I blocked using my arm. Then second guy took a bag with money and ran off, out the door behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed the man with the flashlight by the arm, and hurled him against the wall of empty boxes behind me, causing all the boxes to fall on top of him. He was out for a moment, giving me time to run after the second robber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I got outside, the robber had already reached a white van, which was parked outside the back door. He leaped in the van, closed the door, and started the engine. The engine roared to life, and the van\u2019s lights turned on as the driver was about to run off, when I jumped right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold it right there!\u201d I shouted, holding my arms before me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, I heard the van\u2019s engine go into first gear, as the van started to move forward. The van was heading straight towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a few seconds to Hulk out. I concentrated on gaining as much muscle on my body as I could in the few seconds I had. Luckily, I had mastered this skill during the past few days, and I could feel my thighs, my biceps, my calves, and my pectorals fill out as my physical strength increased dramatically while my weight gained at the same time. I continued to gain strength while pushing the growth so fat, that my entire body continued to grow in height as well as in muscle. I quickly shot up, from 6 feet to 10 feet tall, in a few seconds. I was big and strong enough to stop an oncoming van with my bare hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAAHHH!!!\u201d the driver of the van screamed, as he saw me Hulk out and double in size right before his very eyes, at the same time as he tried to run me over with his large, white van. I can just imagine how that must have scared the living daylights out of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front of the van slammed into my giant hands with a large thud, which pushed me back a little bit, but it didn\u2019t faze me. As the rear wheels of van kept on spinning, I was able to lift the entire front side of the van into the air, using my superhuman strength, and I turned the van sideways and set it back on the ground, laying it on the right side, smashing the right mirror as I dropped the van on its side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud sound of the van falling to the ground made enough noise that the police was called, and I heard sirens off in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I saw the red and blue lights coming, I leaped into the air, and landed on the rooftop of the building. Police officers, pulled out their guns, and they quickly arrested both men: The one in the van, and the other inside of the packaging store. Another robbery was foiled, thanks to a mysterious man dressed in sweats who possessed superhuman strength!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just remained on the roof of the building, patiently waiting for the police to take the robbers away, before I leaped down from the building. Then, I grabbed my bag, which was in the store, and I continued walking around the neighborhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody saw me and nobody knew who I was. I had already shrunk back to my normal height, but I decided to keep my muscles at an enlarged size, just in case something else came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was young and I wanted to be ready for anything else that might come my way that night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every muscle ached, my head throbbed, and I felt nauseous. \"What hit me?\" I asked myself, heading to the shower. \"I feel like crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into the bathroom and found it difficult to even push the door closed, which scared me. Upon finally closing and locking the door, I began to painfully take off my pajamas and winced as I heard my own bones cracking with nearly every movement and began to sob. <i>\"Have I lost this power already?\"</i> I thought, alarmed. <i>\"I was just starting to like it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill sobbing, I slowly took my shower, wincing as every movement seemed to hurt. \"I better talk to mom about this.\" I said to myself. \"It could be a sign of something worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after my shower, I stepped out and toweled dry, feeling slightly better then got dressed and walked out of the bathroom to search for mom. She was in the kitchen, washing the morning dishes. \"Mom, I have a problem.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned to me, concerned then gasped seeing how I was limping. \"Oh, honey, sit down!\" she said, pulling out a chair, which I gratefully accepted. \"What did you and dad do yesterday afternoon!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI explained where dad took me, what he had me do, and the resulting transformation into a giant. \"I felt as if I were literally invincible, mom.\" I said, finishing my tale. \"Only, when I woke up this morning, I could barely lift a finger. Mom, what does it mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"I'd say you over exerted yourself, Garth.\" she replied. \"Everything has a price. Do you remember how you felt after you 'hulked out' for the first time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, understanding mom's reasoning. \"I thought I was over doing it.\" I said, lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom tapped her foot for a moment. \"Young man, you were having the time of your life moving those cars around and you know it.\" she said, lightly scolding. \"I suggest you take it easy today, no hulking out, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sighed, giving mom a child like pout, causing her to giggle. \"I haven't seen you pout like that since you were five.\" she said, smiling. \"You will survive one day without using that power of yours, go find something <i>relaxing</i> to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she returned to washing dishes and I walked out, feeling frustrated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat am I to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything relaxing to do!\u201d I said to mom, while she had just started to wash the dishes. Then it just struck me that I shouldn\u2019t have said that. It was like inviting my mother to assign me work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen go and spend the rest of the afternoon cleaning up your room!\u201d she responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww mom!\u201d I groaned. \u201cNow you\u2019re making me work!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be home all day then you might as well be productive! Start by cleaning up your bedroom! Grab a trash bag out of the pantry and clean up all the junk that\u2019s scattered all over your room!\u201d she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommmm!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet going! NOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stammered over to the kitchen pantry and pulled out a trash bag. From there, I marched over to my room, where I closed the bedroom door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGREAT! I want to relax and what do I get? More work!\u201d I cried, as I walked over to the desk, where I had papers all over the place. I sat down and read through the loose notebook papers, deciding for each sheet whether or not I needed to keep it or if I could toss it in the trash bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was done with all the papers on the desk, I turned towards the stack of papers piled up on the third shelf on the bookcase, next to a stack of comic books. I walked over to the tall bookcase and sat down right in front of it, grabbing the sheets of paper one by one. I would glance at a sheet of paper and I would decide right then and there whether I would ever look at it again or not. If I needed it, I would throw it in another pile, otherwise it would end up in the trash bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was done with the papers, I came to the stack of comic books. I had a little bit of everything: Superman, The Flash, Captain America, Batman, Green Lantern, Archie, Justice League, Teen Titans, and then I came across one which really peaked my curiosity: The Hulk. Wow\u2026 I could feel so much in common with the big green muscle dude! He was huge and muscular and he had green hair. He would normally be an ordinary guy who grew into this huge, muscular guy when he was angry or provoked in the comic book. On the other hand, once he was back to normal again, he would be extremely exhausted and worn out from spending time as the Hulk. He would be physically drained and he needed a day to recover just from being the Hulk. I thought that was very interesting. Maybe that could explain a little bit why I was feeling so wiped out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026 Maybe I used a little too much muscle yesterday when I went to the scrap yard with dad!\u201d I said out loud. \u201cI should\u2019ve taken it easier. Now I\u2019m completely exhausted! Maybe I should just lie down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a few other comic books and I crawled in bed. It felt great, just lying in bed with just a dozen or so comic books, just like old times. And, you know what? I was only able to read another three more pages of the comic book before I completely dozed off, lying in my bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up, it was three hours later and I could tell by the look of the sun that was shining through the window that it was much later in the afternoon or early evening. I had slept for more than three hours! But, I felt like new again! I was refreshed and recharged, and I was feeling much, much better than before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Knowing that Amara would tell mom that I hulked out, I decided to keep myself 'normal' to humor her. \"Maybe I could pay Alyssa Vance a visit.\" I said to myself. \"She seemed down the last time I saw her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*That sounds like a wonderful idea.*</i> came Amara's voice. <i>*I too sensed that he was saddened about something.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's 'she', actually.\" I said. \"Alyssa is on a mission to become female, I have come to accept her as such.\" I blushed slightly as a tiny smile touched my lips. \"She looks good for a being born a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ah, you have feelings for... 'her'?* asked Amara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed a little more. \"Yeah, sort of.\" I replied. \"I mean, I liked him as a guy. Only, now, as she becomes more and more feminine... I like her even more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking my decision, I walked four blocks to Alyssa's house and knocked on the door. Mr. Vance (Frank) answered a moment later, smiling as he saw me. \"Garth!\" he said, surprised. \"It's been a while since you visited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've had a rough few days.\" I replied. \"I fell through the bathroom floor, ended up in the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" asked Frank, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm better than ever.\" I replied, honestly with a smile. \"I came over to see how Alyssa is doing.\" I gave Frank a look of genuine concern. \"She seemed depressed the last time I saw her, I didn't the chance to talk to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank smiled. \"Allow me to assure you that she's a lot happier now.\" he said. \"Come on in, I'll call her for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Alyssa and her sister, Beth came down the stairs with a look of surprise. Only they were not the only one who was surprised as I immediately noticed that Alyssa looked far more feminine than before. Seeing her, my eyes nearly popped out of my head. <i>\"She's... beautiful.\"</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Garth. How are you?\" asked Alyssa, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm, uh, pretty good,\" I said, my eyes still just about popping out of my head. \"You look... different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a good way, I hope.\" said Alyssa, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Definitely.\"</i> I thought. then replied, \"Yeah, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa smiled wider, as if unable to contain herself. \"I'm changing.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changing?\" I asked, though I knew what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa nodded. \"I'm turning into a real girl.\" she said, her eyes dancing. \"I thought I'd have to wait 'til I was grown to have surgery, but my body's doing it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... how did this happen?\" I asked, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still piecing it all together.\" replied Alyssa, blushing. \"Part of it is because of my ancestry, a boy had changed into a girl under strange circumstances ages ago and, well, I guess it's my turn now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of creepy and mysterious.\" I said, hiding a grin. \"I like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa giggled then leaned her weight onto one foot, imitating my sister when she was annoyed. \"A girl can't share all her secrets.\" she said, with a playful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy smile broadened slightly. \"You sound like my sister.\" I said. \"I guess you really are becoming a girl.\" I chuckled, thinking how Grace would respond to the news. \"I came over to see if your were okay but, from what I can see, you're doing just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I walked to the door, hoping to leave before I started to blush again. I then turned around, seeing Alyssa with her hand outstretched as if as if she wanted to stop me but quickly lowered it. That made me smile as I had done the same thing when she walked from me, all depressed, a little over a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, you really look cute.\" I said. \"I'll see you at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then saw myself out, closing the door behind me. Only, before I could even take my seventh step, I heard Alyssa and Beth scream then giggle loudly inside the house, causing me to wince. \"Girls, tell them their cute and they go ballistic.\" I muttered. \"Go figure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Excuse me?*</i> asked Amara in my ear with a playful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that. \"Oh, sorry.\" I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara giggled. <i>*So you really do like her.*</i> she thought to me. <i>*I sense that she is nearly completely female, whatever is driving her change, the final result will be permanent.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what she always wanted.\" I whispered, smiling. \"I'm happy for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then moved on to...</span></div></div>",

Garth, this is Marisol Reyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you, Ms. Reyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same to you, Garth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you two know each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marisol is Cait's housekeeper. Today, she's also acing as chauffeur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on,\" I asked, half-joking, \"is Cait buying the mall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Trish said, \"she's applying for a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes just about popped out of my head. Caitlin Spencer looking for a job? Next, I'd probably hear that she was being nice to someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be staying with Cait for a while,\" Trish said. \"I kinda got pregnant, and my mom kicked me out. Also, we're getting Marisol some new clothes. We want her to look and feel her best, when she takes her citizenship test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe it. The Caitlin Spencer I knew had no respect for anyone who wasn't Caitlin Spencer. What brought this on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara communicated with me. *<i>Garth, can we leave?</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll let you get back to what you were doing,\" I said. \"I hope Cait's job application goes well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked away, I asked Amara, *<i>I guess that stuff about Cait surprised you, too?</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>Partly. More importantly, I sensed two symbionts somewhere nearby.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>Whoa. Two more, like you?</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>Not exactly. These were not of my race. One was about our age, one was quite young, perhaps just a hatchling. I don't know much about them. I was afraid of what might happen if they found out about us.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat threw me for a loop. Two different races of symbiotes on Earth? What else was going on?</span></div></div>",

Thing is, they weren't of the same race as ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Grace said, \"there's other symbionts out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently,\" Mom said. \"Here, Garth, let Amara tell my symbiont what she's learned. Grace has been teaching me how to communicate with mine, so I'll be able to pass on anything we find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us sat in silence, as our symbionts discussed what happened at the mall. Finally, Mom smiled. \"It's an offshoot of our symbionts,\" she said. \"The two races have been separated for untold millenia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How close are they to ours?\" Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These other symbionts don't impart super-powers,\" Mom answered. \"Instead, they act to protect their host organisms. You said that one was a hatchling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what Amara told me,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your friend is pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You think there's a connection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be a coincidence. But, if the hatchling is connected to your friend's baby, it'll look out for her, as well as her unborn child. What's more, her birth will be largely free of complications.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you had quite a day, Garth.

All she knows is, she had an ancestor who went through the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom grinned. \"Sounds like high school will be a big change for you and your friends, in more ways than one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Grace asked, \"what's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Grace,\" Mom said, \"I'd like your help with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking that we'd go back to the mall tomorrow.

Their kids all go to our school and are good friends of ours as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who should we call first then?\": Curious, Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought for a moment then decided to call...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Originally, she was Greg Vance; a boy who desperately wanted to be a girl. I did not meet her as Greg but as Alyssa. Well, I fell in love with that girl and when she confessed she was a actually boy on the path to become a girl, I was still in love. Grace was very supportive too as she was a lesbian and very much in love with Alyssa's sister, Beth. Well, fate played a hand in Alyssa's life and she slowly transformed into a real girl; something to do with a strange ancestry involving the Amazon women of the Brazilian rain forest. All that mattered to me was that she was a real girl and my girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was snapped from my thoughts as Alyssa answered her phone. \"Hello, big guy.\" Kindly, she said. \"What's on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, tomboy.\" Smiling slightly, I replied. \"I called on a rather serious matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Concerned, Alyssa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI relayed everything that had happened to Alyssa then asked, \"Have you gained any special powers or skills that might help us help our mom and dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a short pause before Alyssa replied, \"Yes, I gained a few super abilities along with my gender change. So did Beth. I have developed incredible speed and can heal real fast. Beth has gained some odd form of clairvoyance making her close to a super genius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grace and I want to help mom and dad in case this meeting goes sour.\" Serious, I said. \"Is there any way you can help us call all of our close friends and see if they had developed anything that might help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they have no powers?\" Curious, Alyssa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then tell them its for a fan fiction project.\" Smiling, I replied. \"We're all huge fans of the same graphic novel series.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\" Giggling, Alyssa said. \"I'll make some calls and then call you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" Nodding, I said. \"I'll talk to you again soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ending the call, I considered who to call next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Within a few short hours, Grace and I discovered that all of our closest friends had developed incredible abilities and that their parents were all a part of the original Problem Child gang depicted in the graphic novel we all loved to read. There were ten of us in all and we all agreed to meet each other at Nomad's Park near the pond at noon the following day to help our parents. Only we all also agreed to go in some form of subtle disguise so not to be easily recognized. After I ended the last call, I turned to Grace, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unreal, sis.\" Rattled, I said. \"Alyssa has super speed while her sister, Beth has a form of clairvoyance that gives her the wisdom of an ancient master.\" I sighed and added, \"Her mother was Heather, the thinker, the strategist of the group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan Connors told me that she has what her dad had dubbed Telemechanics or the ability to communicate with and control machines. Her father was Sam the machine.\" Frowning, Grace said. \"Susan Tanner told me she had the powers of a ghost. Her father was Greg the chemist, the leader of the original group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed at that. Megan was a my age of fourteen with shoulder length sand blond hair and green eyes. She was slender but well built and had a knack for mechanics. I wondered if her father had the same powers. It made sense as he always seemed to be able to make anything run perfect. Susan was also fourteen only she had mid-back angel blond hair and blue eyes. She had a doll like frame and features, making her appear very fragile. Only that was far from the truth; she was highly skilled at dodging anyone's advances and delivering good hits of her own. In the graphic novel, Greg seemed to be able to pop in from nowhere. Hearing of Susan's powers, it made a lot more sense; Greg materialized through a wall or simply became visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clem Rodgers told me that he has the power to transform into anyone or into almost anything.\" Serious, I explained. \"Apparently, his parents are literally out of this world. His adopted sister, Rhea seems to have powerful mental abilities including seeing auras. Only he is reluctant to get her involved; she's only ten after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace nodded. Clem Rodgers was a strange kid. He was tall and well made with short black hair and brown eyes. He mostly kept to himself but he was very friendly to everyone. She recalled reading about an odd couple who would give inside information to the Problem Child Gang when they needed it and wondered if they were Clem's parents. Grace then thought of Rhea. She was a cute kid with mid-back auburn hair and hazel eyes. She remembered babysitting her a few times and noticed that she had a curious nature. Everything she looked at she did so as if she were making a serious study out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That leaves Caitlin Spencer and Lilith Nightshade.\" Serious, she said. \"Caitlin was a rich, stuck up snob a while back but she has really changed lately. She has become kind and generous to almost a fault after losing all of her hair to some defective body wash.\" She sighed. \"Anyway, she said she had developed incredible mental abilities including telepathy which was what lead her to realize what a complete pain she had been to everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grunted but didn't say anything. Caitlin was tall and slender and had long blond hair before the incident with the body wash. Her family was insanely rich. Alyssa was her cousin as Caitlin's mother and her mother were sisters. \"Lilith, I heard has some kind of magic power.\" Wincing, I said. \"Something to do with Tarot cards...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace shrugged. \"Lilith told me that she doesn't understand it all herself but the Tarot cards are basically the tools for her magic.\" Serious, she replied. \"It's some kind of magical summoning power that allows her to make the images on the cards come to life.\" She sighed and added, \"Her mother claimed to be able to use the cards to accurately guess the future. She had called herself Madam Vague.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, remembering Madam Vague from the graphic novel. She was a strange character, always hidden in the shadows who gave cryptic clues or warnings to the Problem Child Gang when they were close to danger or stuck on a case. Lilith was tall and slender with long raven hair and deep green eyes. She was a goth girl; always wearing dark makeup and nail polish, wearing mostly black all the time. Still, she was very kind and helpful to all who asked for it and a very good friend of mine. She was the first to stand up for Alyssa other than myself and the first to congratulate us on becoming a couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will have to come up with some form of disguise for ourselves.\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace giggled slightly. \"I already have that covered.\" Bemused, she said. \"I think you'll like what I picked out for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only roll my eyes. \"We better get some sleep. Tomorrow is going to be interesting.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortunately, it was still summer vacation so Grace and I were left to our own devices as mom and dad left for the meeting in the park. I was right to assume they did not want us involved but I smelled a trap and I had a feeling so did my dad. Grace had somehow found dad's outfit from when he was fighting crime as a teenager. I found it strange that he had kept it all these years but I put it on as I found it ironic. The cargo pants and T-shirt fit perfectly as did the long cowboy style jacket. I buckled the special sheath into place across my chest and slid the famous iron rod staff into place. After getting into my own steel toe boots and dark shades, I gazed into a full length mirror. \"I look just like Tex the mighty from the graphic novel.\" Whispering, I commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" Stepping up, Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to find Grace wearing loose fitting black pants, black shirt, a sleeveless black jacket, and knee high black boots. On her face was a light but cleverly applied mask of makeup that made her look like a living doll. \"You look like something out of my nightmares.\" Smirking, I retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace grunted, smiling herself. \"Good. Caitlin should be here soon to take us all to the park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, we stepped out just as a black van with tinted windows pulled up. I could hear the power of the engine as it came to a stop. The side door opened and we jumped in to find Megan at the wheel. She was wearing blue jeans, white T-shirt, blue jeans jacket, and hiking boots. She was not wearing anything that hid her face. \"That's not much of a disguise.\" Wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan smiled as several pieces of metal and wiring quickly onto her body until she was completely covered, looking like a robot from a sci-fi horror movie. \"Is this better?\" Her voice sounding artificial, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Whispering, Grace muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to move.\" Urgently, Alyssa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded as Grace closed the side door of the van. Alyssa was wearing a black spandex yoga body suit with tight blue jeans shorts, a bluejeans hooded jacket, expensive looking running shoes, soccer shin guards. under the hood, she wore a doll face masquerade mask. On her wrists were large metal bracelets which completed the look. Her sister, Beth was wearing loose fitting cargo pants with various pockets, a tank top shirt, and a black sleeveless jacket which also have several pockets. She wore hiking boots, finger-less gloves, and dark sunglasses. Around her waist was a utility belt with a number of pouches holding unknown objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to the others to find Susan wearing black pants, a black shirt, and a long black jacket with a similar makeup mask Grace was wearing. Seeing my concerned look, she smiled before vanishing into thin air. A gasp escaped my lips before Susan reappeared, grinning at me. \"Invisibility is the best disguise of all.\" Calmly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And arrogance is the greatest weakness.\" Firmly, Beth countered. \"Let's not be too proud of our powers; we are just getting started here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite right.\" Nodding, Clem said. \"We are just going to back up our parents in case they are walking into a trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClem did not look at all like himself. His skin was changing tone every few seconds and his eyes were constantly changing color along with that of his hair. Seeing my shock, he calmly stated, \"I'm a shape-shifter; I can change anything about my appearance including my gender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got that part.\" Frowning, I said. \"It's what you said before... all of our parents are going to this meeting with Stalker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClem nodded, a heavy frown on his face. \"I had to bring Rhea along; she threatened to squeal if I didn't take her with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Rhea who was wearing a 'red riding-hood' costume with black tights, black tennis shoes, and a white mask over her eyes and button nose. She looked more cute than frightful; I could not help but smile a little. Rhea pouted in response. \"Don't laugh.\" Defending herself, she demanded. \"It's all I could think of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great, Rhea.\" Chiming in, Caitlin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin was wearing what looked like a horror story schoolgirl uniform. It was a black pleated skirt, a black blouse with a blood red vest and a long black hooded coat over it all with black shoes, black gloves, and what looked like a force field over her face, hiding its features. Rhea smiled at her comment. \"You look good too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus, everyone.\" Serious, Lilith ordered. \"We're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith was wearing a blood red and black dress, a blood red bandana with a black eye mask and elbow length black gloves. I noticed she was also wearing black knee-high boots. With her Gothic makeup, she looked like something out of a nightmare. \"Anyone have a plan?\" Darkly, she demanded. \"I have to admit, this came too quick for me to think of anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We surround the area and observe.\" Serious, Beth said. \"We stay in constant communication through Caitlin who we know has telepathy.\" She turned to Caitlin. \"That said, you will need to stay in the van with Megan who will be our way out in case things go sour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to sit this out?\" Insulted, Caitlin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just until we can piece together a radio system for us to use.\" Comforting her, Beth said. \"We will all be depending upon you to keep us all in contact; it just might save all of our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin sighed. \"Since you put it that way, you can count on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth nodded then turned to us. \"If any of us see or sense a trap, call it out in your thoughts and we will move in and do what we can to stop the bad guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded in agreement as the van came to a stop and we piled out to take our positions around the gazebo near the pond.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The scene at Nomad's park was quiet and peaceful; just another sunny morning, so it seemed. Only I could sense a heavy tension in the air. It was not something I was born with or had gained through my new found powers; it was something I had learned by being in situations that had escalated all too quickly. I looked around from my position, casually leaning against one of the many trees near the meeting site and spotted mom and dad waiting outside the gazebo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Is everyone in position?\"</i> Nervous, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone signaled that they were standing by near the meeting point. and I turned my attention back to the gazebo and spotted a black four door with tinted windows approaching the gazebo. What alerted me was that it was not slowing down. It was in fact speeding up! Fearing the worst, I made a mad dash to intercept the vehicle. My muscles swelled and hardened with each pounding blow of my feet as I raced to the street. I saw the rear window roll down with a man wearing dark sunglasses peering out with an assault rifle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's a trap!\"</i> Sounding an alarm, I thought out. <i>\"Everyone move in!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in the back of the black car opened fire, sending a hail of bullets at my parents! Dad was quick to respond and pulled mom behind the gazebo. I had no time to see if he or mom were safe, I was fully focused on stopping the car. I reached the street just as the car reached me and threw my fist down onto the hood as hard as I could. The force of the impact along with the speed of the car caused it to literally flip over me! It crashed onto the pavement on its wheels, the man in the back still holding the rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drop your weapons!\" Forcefully, I demanded. \"I mean now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man with the rifle came out and pointed his weapon at me. \"I don't know who you are, kid but you are obviously strong.\" Grinning, the man said. \"However, not even the real Tex the mighty could handle armor piercing rounds and I doubt you can either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he fired his weapon. At first, I thought that was it. One moment of hesitation had cost me my life just when I thought I was really going to be a hero. To my surprise and the man's horror, the bullets bounced off me, leaving nothing more than a light sting. It felt more like a hot shower than a hail of bullets. I quickly jumped in and grabbed the rifle from the man before breaking it in half over my knee. I didn't know why I did it; maybe I was angry that he tried to kill my parents. Still, it made the man turn pale white in horror as I tossed the remnants of the rifle aside, staring him down with a look of fury. \"What are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed the man by the collar and easily lifted him off the ground as my muscular form made me a good seven feet tall. \"Those bullets won't work on me!\" Angrily, I stated. \"I am Goliath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Caitlin's voice rang out in my head. <i>\"Gar! We have more company coming!\"</i> Urgently,she warned. <i>\"Four black four doors with armed men inside!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to see the cars coming down the street along with people fleeing in a panic due to the attempted hit. Turning back to the man I was holding, I saw that the car was speeding away even though it had all flat tires. I growled at the man i had then threw him at a nearby dumpster. The man let out a startled yell just before he hit the open lid and fell in with the lid closing on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Everyone stay sharp!\"</i> Firmly, Beth thought out. <i>\"These guys are no doubt professionals; they know our parents must be in the area.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Rodger that!\"</i> I thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four cars came to a screeching halt and four men in black business suits got out, each armed with automatic weapons. I was after the car I had originally stopped but I kept my eyes on the others, worried for their safety. Alyssa had taken on the first group, relieving them of the weapons in their hands in a blur. The men screamed in pain as the sheer speed of taking the guns must have broken at least one or more of their fingers. One moved to retrieve a sidearm from a holster at his side only to fall into convulsions as Alyssa kicked and punched him several hundred times in just a few seconds! Grace was at her side in a heart beat, using martial arts moves to assist. Within seconds, the first group was rendered unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Isa and Angel here.\"</i> Alyssa thought out. <i>\"The first group has been pacified.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second group was firing in a blind panic as cars with no drivers surrounded them while a frightening looking robot, Susan, slowly walked towards them. The bullets bounced harmlessly off her metallic armor. Just as the first man had ran out of bullets and was forced to reload, Megan appeared out of nowhere and brought a katana blade down, literally cutting the rifle in half! The man screamed and turned but Megan had already vanished only to reappear behind him with a karate chop to the back of his neck, knocking him out. Susan simply threw a fist into the second man, instantly rendering him unconscious. The two then made swift work of the other two before tying them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mecha and Yurei here.\"</i> Reporting in, Susan thought. <i>\"Second group is pacified.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned at the two reports. Isa was what Alyssa's toddler brother called her with his lisp. Grace, although not quite an angel, the two words related to each other. Mecha fit Susan's powers well and Yurei was Japanese for ghost, which suited Megan's ghost like powers nicely. I then focused on the car I was chasing, hoping to catch it before the goons inside got away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to me, Clem had confronted the third group with Rhea right behind him. At first, they laughed at Rheas in her cute red ridding hood costume but jumped back as an energy form of a six foot muscular woman appeared around her. They opened fire only to find their bullets literally bouncing off the energy form. Clem transformed into something out of a horror movie with tentacles and eye stalks, causing the men to scream. They trained their weapons on him but Clem was ready and grabbed the weapons out of their grasp before grabbing them with a powerful tentacle and throwing them against a building. Rhea, in her adult energy form made short work of the other two. As the two returned to their normal states, they exchanged a kind smile along with a quick high five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Morpheus and Amazon here.\"</i> Clem reported. <i>\"Third group has been pacified.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a chance to look back at the park to see the fourth group making a run for their vehicle. Whatever plan they had was falling apart in seconds and they knew it. Lilith appeared in their path with a puff of smoke just before they reached the car. \"Your destiny is about to change!\" Darkly, she announced. \"Drop your weapons before I draw my card!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four men hesitated which was all Lilith needed. She drew a card and tossed it at the group just as it began to glow. Instantly, to the shock of the four men, they were surrounded by a circular wall on all sides. To my perspective, a tall tower of stone had appeared where the men once stood. I felt the ground shake before the tower vanished, revealing the four men, all unharmed but unconscious on the sidewalk. <i>\"Soothsayer here.\"</i> she reported. <i>\"The last group has been pacified.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm still in pursuit of the lead vehicle!\"</i> Panting, I thought. <i>\"I need some assistance!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I had called for help in my thoughts, I heard a crash and saw that vehicle had stopped dead with smoke bellowing out of the destroyed front end. I stumbled to come to a stop to see dad standing in front of the car in his hulk mode. He did not look happy at all. \"I have called for back up.\" Returning to his normal form, he said. \"You and your group better get out of here before they arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly nodded as Beth's voice called out. <i>\"The police are en route to our position! Everyone back to the van, we're done here!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all swiftly returned to the van and sped off just as the first of many squad cars were arriving on the scene. I felt great knowing that we had saved my parents and possibly the parents of our friends as well. I don't know what came over us but, as we sped passed the first squad car, we all yelled out, \"Problem Child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly the next morning, dad called me to the dinning room where he ordered me to sit down along with Grace. We exchanged worried looks as we both knew we were in trouble or at least in for the lecture of our lives. Dad took a breath and said, \"I do not know what possessed you and the others to do what you did but that can't be undone. However, there is one thing I must do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, he...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Finally, mom gave a slow nod and dad sighed, turning back to Grace and I. \"How were you and the others communicating?\" Softly, he asked. \"What radio signal did you use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were talking to each other through a member with telepathy.\" Honestly, you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad grunted. \"You will need a radio back up.\" Serious, he said. \"If your enemies figure out you are using a telepath to talk to each other, they will target that member to hinder your efforts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the names of your group?\" Firmly, mom demanded. \"Do they effectively hide the identity of the members?\" She turned to Grace. \"Also, I need to talk to you about your choice of mask, young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have Goliath and Angel.\" Motioning to myself and Grace I said. \"The super fast Isa, Mecha the telemechanic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Telemechanic?\" Confused, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The supernatural ability to talk to and control any machine.\" Serious, Grace said. \"It's an extremely rare gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have Yurei the ghost warrior, Morpheus the shape-shifter, the little Amazon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw that.\" Smiling slightly, mom commented. \"A cute little girl in a red ridding hood costume suddenly becomes a powerful adult woman.\" She giggled slightly. \"Talk about going from perfect innocence to holly shit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace and I chuckled at that then turned serious as dad spoke. \"What of the other members?\" Firmly, he demanded. \"What do they call themselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soothsayer, the magic wielder; Giri, the advanced; and Mystic, the clairvoyant.\" Serious, I said. \"Mystic is our leader, for the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you call this Giri the advanced?\" Curious, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit hard to explain.\" Wincing, I said. \"It's as if her mind is working at nearly full capacity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Sighing, mom said. \"Also, why did you say Mystic is your leader for the moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we really have not discussed who is in charge of the group yet.\" Wincing, Grace admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will need to get that straightened out fast.\" Serious, dad said. \"You don't want to fail a mission over petty arguments of who has the right to give the orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make a pot of tea.\" Sighing, mom said. \"I can already see we have a lot to talk about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"Quite right.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, real estate expenses are too much for anyone to allow such a big space to be vacant.

Dad and a few of my friends' parents stepped up and carried the casket to the grave site and lowered it into the ground. Alyssa's mother, who was wheelchair bound, sang a beautiful hymnal as the grave was covered with Earth and everyone witnessing the funeral left a single rose at the grave. I noticed that all of the adults were hit hard by Mrs D's death, dad especially. I saw him looking out at a young girl who was standing next to Zack Davenport, a new kid at school. I only knew her as Melissa, Zack's blind little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, dad?\" Worried, I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad slowly shook his head. \"I just have a gut feeling, Garth.\" Flatly, he said. \"Mrs D had taken Zack's sister, Melissa, under her wing. She might have heard something or Mrs D might have told her something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you suspect foul play?\" Wincing, Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, dad slowly shook his head. \"I owe Mrs D my life.\" Cryptically, he replied. \"I have to at least look into the matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want some help?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The police are looking for you and your friends as it is.\" Serious, dad whispered. \"Don't press your luck, not this early. Case two, book one; 'good cop, bad cop'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded at that but remained silent. The second case of the original problem child gang lead dad, who had called himself Tex, to be arrested and interrogated by a cop who was determined to pin the unusual robberies on him to close the case quickly. Tex escaped before his identity was revealed. Fortunately, he and his fellow members were not only able to prove their innocence but find enough evidence to prove the bad cop played a part of the string of thefts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Grace better head home with mom.\" Placing his hat on, dad said. \"I have a duty and a promise to uphold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Grace and I followed mom back to the car as dad walked to his squad car. There was not a dry eye among the adults who had attended the funeral. All of them were the parents of the members of the new problem child gang. It was obvious that she had somehow helped the original gang back in the day. \"I have a feeling that if there was foul play, dad and his friends will tear the city apart to find Mrs D's killer.\" Worried, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace nodded. \"Then lets find out what had happened.\" Serious, she said. \"Carefully, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two stay out of this one.\" Sternly, mom said. \"It's very personal to your father and many others; let them deal with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning home, Grace and I talked regarding what to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was the same ringtone I had heard on Dad's phone before I learned of his secret past. We listened and heard mom's voice. \"Steve...?\" Surprised, she asked. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked out into thew hall and found mom standing outside our room. She growled slightly, hearing the response of a man named Steve. \"Hang on a minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom entered my room with the cellphone in her hand. She had a cross look on her face. \"What's wrong, mom?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to hear this.\" Sternly, mom said. She then turned to the phone. \"You are on speaker, Tinker; repeat what you said to my children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Grace, stunned. Tinker was among the youngest members of the old gang. He was a child prodigy when it came to building gadgets. He was the one who fitted the group with the toys they used on their cases. We turned to mom and listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we all agreed to keep our children out of this if Sykes or the Agency ever returned.\" Annoyed, Steve said. \"I am a sketch artist for the police department now, among other things. One of the witnesses described your daughter, Grace to every detail! Care to explain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what you are talking about... officer Steve.\" Defiantly, I responded. \"We were at the park that day but my sister and I were among the bystanders running away from the action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a witness to verify your claim?\" Unimpressed, Steve demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just watch the news footage.\" Simply, Grace countered. \"The witness you spoke to obviously was frightened and confused.\" She smiled. \"It was a rather alarming scene...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get cute with me, kid!\" Irritable, Steve snapped. \"These people are not like the stereotype villains you see on Saturday morning cartoons! They will not hesitate to kill you... or worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are scaring my sister, officer Steve!\" Forceful, I snapped back. \"Also, you are harassing the son and daughter of the chief of police! I certainly hope you have more proof than a vague sketch from a single panicked eyewitness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gasped slightly as Steve paused on the other line. Only she released a breath when we all heard him chuckle. \"Well played, young man.\" More softly, he said. \"Still, we have a massive amount of damage control to do. I am not the only one working this case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suggest?\" Curious, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personally, I would rather them lay low and allow this to blow over.\" Darkly, Steve replied. He let out a weary sigh. \"However, if they are serious about becoming the new defenders of this small city, they are going to need training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of training?\" Raising an eyebrow, Grace demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need more than a mask and an attitude to fight crime, young lady.\" Sternly, Steve explained. \"I'm certain you believe you have <i>wonderful</i> powers. However, they don't mean shit if you can't use them to their fullest potential. Even then, there is a chance of meeting up with someone better or stronger or one who can outwit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are trying to better ourselves every day.\" Irritated, I stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve sighed. \"Just remember that the police did not smile upon the efforts of the original gang; they will be less tolerant of the new gang.\" Sternly, he said. \"It's their job to catch the bad guys! They do not like any vigilantes stepping on their toes or worse making them look like fools on their own turf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They tried to kill our parents.\" Softly, Grace argued. \"We will not stand idle...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor will the police department.\" Serious, Steve countered. \"They will use everything at their disposal to figure out who you are.\" He again sighed. \"You must use everything at your disposal to stay one step ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Steve ended the call. Mom placed the cellphone back in her jeans pocket. \"We had to deal with this and many other issues.\" Darkly, mom said. \"I can only pray you and the other kids know what you are getting yourselves into.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Upon closing the door, the man, Geo turned to Grace and I with a steel hard look.

If nearly half of all those born in this city develops special abilities...\" Startled, I began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some joined the problem child gang, others helped them while the rest kept their gifts a secret.\" Serious, Geo said. \"Many moved out, fearing for their future children.\" He sighed. \"The point is, we can't allow word of this to get out. It's not the police I fear, its the press.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are afraid that if news of a new problem child gang reaches the ears of the government they might reopen their investigation.\" Turning pale, Grace said. \"What can we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay as many steps ahead of the police and the press as you can.\" Sternly, Geo replied. \"Do not allow your 'growing fame' to get to your heads. Remain as much a mystery as you can; don't stick around after you stop the bad guys and don't waste your time on ordinary criminals unless there is no other choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work from the shadows and vanish as fast as we appear.\" Nodding, I said. \"I think I get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thought we had it at first too.\" Darkly, Geo said. \"Don't allow your emotions to drive your decisions; we have seen the press place themselves in serious danger just to drive us out into the open for an interview.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace and I winced at that before I asked, \"Can we call upon any of you for advice or gain pointers from your experience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeo smiled. \"You can count on it.\" Kindly, he said. \"Just don't repeat our mistakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, he quietly left the house.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was indeed personal to him, to a lot of people in Waterfront City. I decided to help out any way I could. A quick nod from Grace told me she felt the same way.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I had a feeling Grace knew she was coming. I had learned to sense someone coming through painful experience growing up dealing with bullies. Melissa seemed to sense her as well and did not bat an eye as Grace quickly changed the subject of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are very sorry for your loss, Melissa.\" Sadly, Grace said. \"She was a dear friend of our father; she had helped him out of a few jams when he was around our age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He mentioned that.\" Nodding, Melissa replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you three are getting along well.\" Smiling, Mrs Davenport said as she approached. \"Melissa will be going to your school once summer vacation is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack told us all about it.\" Politely, I said. \"He's already informing everyone that he would be protecting her from any type of bullying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Davenport giggled at that. \"Zack has always been protective of her.\" Smiling, she said. \"Although I'm certain it drives Melissa crazy at times, he does mean well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of normal conversation, Grace and I said our farewells and left in good spirits. \"So what now?\" After we were safely away, Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned. \"Now we search for clues.\" Serious, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where, exactly?\" Worried, Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My recently discovered superstrength seemed to disappear in the next hours as I could not lift the SUV anymore. I decided to forget it, maybe it was just some secondary effects of my strange transformation.<br>\r\nMom decided that I was already completely healed and I could go to school again next day. I thought I would be able to enjoy some more days at home and skip school, but maybe mom was right after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo next day I went to school. Everything seemed to go alright... until the P.E. class. I started to feel a bit weird during the warm up exercises. I felt how every part of my body were tingling, but I was not feeling any pain fortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Richards... I'm not feeling very well.\" I said to my teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I already noticed it...\" he seemed to notice something weird on me too, \"Go to the restroom if you need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, I entered the school building. The tingling seemed to stop slowly when I was inside, but I wasn't sure about what was happening. I started running faster to the restroom, I had a very bad feeling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped. My body felt that weird tingling again. Suddenly, everything started to shrink. Or at least that was what I thought in that moment, but quickly I discovered that my body was growing again. There was no pain this time, so I decided to run even faster to the restroom. Everyone was in class in that moment, so I was safe because no one saw me. In that moment I was like a little kid turning into the Hulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was very near... In less than ten seconds, I reached the restroom door. I put my hand on the knob, but before I could open the door I heard a loud sound. I broke the knob with my hand! I was very scared. Did my superstrength return? I left a hole in the door and I wasn't going to be safe inside if anyone near there noticed the broken door. I couldn't stay there, so I went to the teachers' restroom. I knew I wasn't allowed to enter there, but I remembered it was the only restroom door that could be locked from inside. I opened the door softly, trying not to break it again. I entered and locked the door. I was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked scared to the mirror, I was not sure what I was going to see. I opened the eyes and saw something incredible. I was huge. All my body was big, I looked bigger than dad who was very muscular. I was bigger than him with no doubt. My body was full of muscle and maybe had a bit of fat, like a weightlifter somehow. Not only that, but I also looked older, like a 25 years old or something like that. My clothes were completely ruined, but fortunately my boxers were still intact (they looked very tight but curiously I didn't feel any pain).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I heard a sound. Someone was trying to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O... Occupied!\" I said. Wow! My voice also sounded like an adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... It's going to take a while...\" I said. I was smiling in that moment, I liked my new voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go upstairs then, sorry.\" a female voice sounded behind the door. I heard some footsteps, the woman left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took off all what was left of my clothes. They were useless now. I stared again at the mirror. I couldn't resist to do some poses.</span></div></div>",

I even dreamed I was seeing heat images.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up, it felt like something was off. Not as bad as when I was sick, but I definitely felt strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter my shower, I felt a little better.

It triggered the home security system to sound alarms all over the house but it allowed John to get to me. He quickly knelled down and pulled me into a warm hug, gently rocking me. \"I'm here, Megan.\" cooing, he said. \"I'm right here, calm down. I won't let anything hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally snapping out of my fear induced trance, I realized John was there and returned his embrace, sobbing. \"John, I'm so scared!\" I wailed. \"What's happening to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what we're going to find out.\" said Max, slowly approaching me. \"Right now, however, I need to sedate you so you will stay calm, is that fine with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to John, uncertain. He nodded and I agreed. Max prepared a syringe from his bag then injected me with a sedative once it was ready. Less than a minute later, I was unconscious and all of the electronic equipment fell silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is creepy, doc.\" shaken, John said. \"What do you make of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I can't discuss that with you without her mother's written permission, young man.\" serious, Max replied. \"Once I examine her, I will give my report to her mother and she will decide weather or not to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Max pulled out his cellphone and dialed a number. \"This is Dr Max Hagen, i need an ambulance at this address immediately....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, I woke up...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their engines purred at me, creating a bizarre but calming scene, I felt safe. When I eventually woke up from the sedative, I heard the beep beep beep of a vitals signs monitor. As my eyes fluttered open, I saw my mom looking at me with a tear stained face. \"The entire neighborhood is worried about you, honey.\" softly, she said. \"Somehow, your screams carried nearly a hundred yards in all directions.\" pausing, she asked, \"How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tired, I'm hurting, and I'm hungry.\" wincing, I replied. \"What happened to me, mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doctors ran more tests than I could count while you were passed out.\" looking worried, mom replied. \"They found a few things out place but its beyond me.\" she turned to another person in the room. \"Dr Hagen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax came into view and sat down on the other side of the bed. \"Yes, well we found that your body has been producing a <i>massive</i> amounts of minerals.\" looking curiously excited, Max said. \"You have been getting gall stones, kidney stones, bone spurs...\" he paused, seeing me becoming alarmed. \"Normally, such an unlikely scenario would kill a grown man within days but your body is somehow making use of this bizarre condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You- You're scaring me, doctor.\" trembling, I said. \"Wha-What are you-you getting at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax sighed. \"Your body is taking all those minerals to strengthen your entire body.\" looking at me, he said. \"Right now, your teeth are as hard as titanium steel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say I was shocked would have been an understatement. \"Do you know how my voice carried so far?\" still fearful, I asked. \"Do you have any idea why all the machines in my house went crazy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is were it gets interesting.\" his excitement returning. \"We have no idea. However I believe it has to do with a tumor we found at the base of your brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tumor!?\" shocked, mom asked. \"Can you remove it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax shook his head. \"It's too close to the vital parts of her brain to safely remove.\" seriously, he replied. \"The good news is that I believe it is that tumor that is making all of this happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think that?\" thinking Dr Hagen was mad, I asked. \"Have you seen this before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A young man came into this hospital about a week ago.\" smiling, Max said. \"I can not tell you his name but he had grown from five feet and four inches to eight feet and ten inches in less than five minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my.\" stunned, mom said. \"Is he still alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax nodded. \"He changed back within an hour of losing consciousness.\" still smiling, he replied. \"The point is, he had the same curious tumor your daughter has within her.\" he pushed his chair closer, not noticing a camera following his movements. \"I was pulled off of the case by his family doctor. I know I am not your family doctor either but I am hoping you and your mother will allow me to study your condition further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not like the idea of being poked and prodded like some science experiment and turned to mom, uncertain who shrugged her shoulders. \"We really don't have a family doctor at this time.\" wincing, she said. \"We're waiting for a call back from a Dr Stone to see if he will take Megan on as a new client.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least allow me to try to get as many answers as I can before you leave the hospital.\" pleading, Max said. \"I promise I'll be as gentle as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, I said...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wanted to see what he saw but nothing came. <i>\"Maybe I'm trying to hard.\"</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned back to Travis and saw him near the door, open just a crack, listening. Then, he eased the door closed and turned to me, looking worried. \"Travis....Travis what's wrong?\" feeling very frightened, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a sharp image filled my mind, causing me to gasp. I saw a mysterious black van, idling in the parking lot and I caught a glimpse of a blurry man in a suit, looking at me with a pair of binoculars! \"Travis...there's a black van outside watching us.\" startled, I announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis cautiously walked to the window and peeked out the corner. As I watched him, shaking, I saw his face move slightly, as if it had slightly changed somehow. Only, as he turned back to me, his face looked normal so i shrugged it off as my imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan...your right\" turning back to me, Travis said. \"How did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have control of machines, right?\" I asked. \"Well, when I just thought of the outside I could suddenly see the hospital parking lot. It must have been the security camera. But what do we do? What did you hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems as if this 'good' Dr Hagen has an agenda of his own.\" looking at me Travis replied. \"Also, the guys in the black van are watching this room with binoculars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to shake more as I had seen that as well. \"What- what do they want with us?\" frightened, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say Hagen wants you for your ability to control machines.\" guessing, Travis replied. \"I don't know if those guys in the van are working with that quack or with someone else but I do know that you're vulnerable here alone.\" he knotted his jaws in decision. \"I'm staying here with you, just in case either one tries something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis, are you sure?\" looking concerned, I asked. \"They might come after you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a few surprises of my own.\" smiling, Travis said. \"Don't worry, I won't let you out of my sight, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed slightly, a small grin forming onto my face. \"Thanks, Travis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis blushed with me, though I knew he tried to hide it. \"You're welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, before things got too uncomfortable, mom and Dr Stone returned to the room and I shouted, \"There's someone watching this room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas ran to the window and looked out to see the black van before it casually pulled away, out of the parking lot, before he turned back to me. \"Whoever they were, they're gone now.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just in case, I'd like to stay with Megan tonight.\" offering, Travis said. \"She and I have been friends since kindergarten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine with me, so long as you mom doesn't mind .\" smiling, mom replied. \"I'd feel safer, knowing a strong guy like you was with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis blushed more at that, making him look really cute.

Now, why are you calling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan is getting some unwanted attention from this weird doctor and these men in a black van. I'm telling you that I'm staying over to watch over her.\" There was a dead silence on the other line. I was worried, \"Mom...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis...oh yes....it's fine honey. I have to go now, bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe call ended before he could say goodbye. <i>\"Something must have spooked his mom.\"</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis put his cellphone away and turned. Mom and I both looked at him, worried. Although mom had only heard part of the conversation, I heard it all. I think he realized we suspected something was wrong. He blushed and quickly left the room. \"I think he really likes you.\" teasing, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, really?\" I asked. \"Now is not the time to play cupid, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Dr. Stone entered the room with a team of nurses rolling in another patient bed. \"I said I didn't need to be 'admitted',\" timidly, Travis said, \"Dr Stone insisted, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Megan is being watched, as you two described, Travis will likely be watched as well.\" said Stone. \"I will be contacting your mother tonight and alert her of the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, finally, alone, I turned to the camera. <i>\"Please turn off.\"</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my surprise, the camera obeyed, the recoding light going off immediately. \"I think we can talk now. I want to tell you what happened when you heard, or rather, read my screams on my chat page.\" I said, turning to Travis. \"I had just woken up from a rough night, having a splitting headache, and saw that my teeth were covered in metal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a scary wake up call.\" wincing, Travis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"I screamed, terrified, then became more frightened as every phone in the house started ringing and someone began to pound onto the front door. I did not know then that my screams were echoing over every electronic device within a hundred yards of my home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis winced again. \"I'd be terrified in that situation too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe then began to tell each other about our lives only I sensed that Travis was holding something back, something that was troubling him. He seemed relieved that I was able to turn off the camera. I didn't tell him but it was creeping me out seeing it follow my every move. Nightfall soon came and Travis became exhausted and was soon asleep. As I watched him sleep, I turned to the camera. \"Please help me look after my friend.\" I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, in the middle of the night, I woke up to hear Travis crying in his sleep, tossing and turning as if to escape an unknown threat. I became worried when I saw the tears in his eyes and the pain on his face. Then I saw it, his hands had become more like paws and on his head... were a pair of cat ears!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis...Travis!\" I called, lightly shaking him. \"Travis wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis opened his eyes and saw me. \"Travis...what happened to you?\" concerned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis looked at his hands, or rather, paws then reached up to his head and felt his new ears. With an expression of fear, he grabbed a mirror and looked into it, he was an anthro-cat. Crying, he dropped the mirror and pushed me away as if he feared his own reflection. I watched him quickly hide behind the bed in the corner. I was clear to me that he was in panic. <i>\"So... he has a power of his own.\"</i> I thought. <i>\"Just like me, he fears it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis...who did this to you...?\" I asked, drawing closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents...my parents sort of...made me...\" not looking at me, Travis stammered, crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Made...you...?\" I asked, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis shook his head. \"I don't want to explain it...you would only...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed and I approached him, making my footfalls heard so not to frighten him more. \"What would I do...?\" I asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would think I'm a freak.\" replied Travis, shaking. \"I'm nothing but a freak...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis....you feel like an alien...like me...\" I said, trying to be comforting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis turned around, slightly surprised. I guess he was surprised more by the fact that I was not running away or screaming, rather, I was staying and moving closer to him. \"But Megan...I don't think your a freak.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor do I.\" smiling, I replied. I began to scratch his head, between his new cat like ears. \"You look cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis seemed to calm right down. In fact, he seemed to really enjoy my scratching. He leaned his head closer to me as a small purr escaped his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He's just like a big kitten.\"</i> I thought, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis, hearing me giggle, covered his mouth and pulled his head back. \"I didn't mean to do that!\" he said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admit it Travis\" I said with a smirk, \"You enjoyed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis blushed before he nodded, admitting that he did enjoy it. We stood up together and he gave me a warm hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Megan...I should have told you earlier.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"His furry body... so warm...\"</i> realizing what I was thinking, I blushed brightly as I felt his tail starting to wrap around my leg. <i>\"Oh... wow...\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy senses were exploding and I think Travis noticed it as he quickly changed back to his human form. When we broke the hug, I felt a bit sad, almost robbed. Without thinking, I said, \"Aw....did you have to change back so soon? You looked so cute! Could you change back for me... please?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only, before I could react, I started to change again. Pointed ears formed onto my head as my face formed cat like features and a tail grew from my lower back and my hands took on a more paw like form before the 'liquid' receded back into my pours. Within seconds, a stunned cat like girl was staring back at me in the mirror. Other than feeling exhausted, I seemed to be perfectly fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... happened?\" touching my new face, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Travis to find him back in his cat like form, looking at me with a surprised look on his face.

He chuckled, giving Travis a knowing smile. \"I was Sam, the ace driver of the Problem Child Gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf my eyes had widened any further, they would have popped out of my head. \"What!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled, turning to Travis. \"Your mother was Crystal, our mysterious informant.\" looking at him, he said. \"We did not know she was an unwilling worker for the Agency but we always considered her a member of the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I get these powers, dad?\" confused, I asked. \"I don't remember reading about you having... this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple.\" turning back to me, dad said. he changed into the liquid metal form I had become earlier. \"I'm an alien.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth mine and Travis' jaws dropped as I returned to my normal form and fainted.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I don't remember being placed onto the bed but I was awakened by the sound of an animal growling. I opened my eyes, startled to see four men enter the dark room. I froze, terrified as three of them had guns and the fourth had a long needle on a syringe! The four men froze as well, hearing the growl, I hoped was coming from Travis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that, a growl?\" asked one man, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There isn't any animals in here...is there?\" asked the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like a wolf...\" remarked the third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO MAN! Don't say that! I'm terrified of wolves...\" stated the fourth, shaking slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it together, you morons.\" snapped the one who seemed to be the leader. \"It's just the pipes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I saw Travis charge from the closet, ripping the door off its hinges in a wolf like form. He pounced onto the one holding the needle, knocking it out of his grasp. I winced, hearing the man's rip crack under the blow as he passed out from the wind being knocked out of him. Before the others could react, Travis jumped up onto his two feet and quickly punched out the other two then pinned the fourth, the leader, against the wall, forcing him to drop his weapon. Growling in his face, he demanded, \"Who sent you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man spat in Travis' face, \"There's my answer, fleabag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Big mistake.\"</i> wincing, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis wiped the spit away from his face and then bared his teeth. He loudly roared in his face, snapping his teeth an inch from his eyes. The sound sent chills down my spine, making me very much afraid. Only it apparently had the same effect on the man as Travis then easily lifted him off the floor with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen and listen good... human.\" he growled, \"You tell your boss that Megan Connors is off limits.\" with a wolf like growl, he added, \"LEAVE THE GIRL ALONE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then threw him away from out of the room like a rag doll. His body flew out the door, slamming into the outside hall, cracking the wall. By this time, I was sitting up and I watched the man slide to the floor unconscious just as Travis let out a wolf like howl. It was a haunting howl, making me want to run for my very life but I reminded myself that Travis most likely saved my life. He then turned to find me awake. I was sitting on the bed, against the wall, shivering. I was scared of him, due to his display of power, but I was more frightened of the men who tried to take me away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still me inside, Megan.\" assuring me, he said. \"I would never hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was afraid of the men... not you.\" still shaking, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Travis paused, his ears twitching as he were listening to something. Suddenly, he quickly took me into his arms and held me tight. \"We need to go, now!\" frantic, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning to the open window, he jumped through. As we fell, he became human again, for a second, then changed into a human like eagle. He held onto me with his talon like feet, being very gentle, and landed on the sidewalk after carefully dropping me. Once he was back in human form again, I gasped inside, seeing how very pale he appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That shape-shifting must take a lot out of him.\"</i> I thought. <i>\"Maybe that's why I feel so weak too.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a gray, futuristic looking car pulled up. The doors automatically opened and Mr. Connors voice echoed from within. \"Megan, Travis, get in!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We both let out a yelp as the seat belts crossed over us on their own before the car took off on its own. I was tempted to hang on to the door but hesitated. Dad's laughter echoed through the radio speakers. \"You're not touching any part of me, sweetie.\" amused, he said. \"This is the family car, I simply added my own essence to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're possessing the car?\" morbidly impressed, Travis asked. \"Nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a crude way of putting it, Travis.\" chuckling, dad said. \"As accurate as any, I guess.\" he then turned serious as the car screamed around a corner. \"Listen you two, things are heating up faster than I had feared. Sykes is back in town and the Agency has resurfaced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped. \"That organization existed!?\" stunned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything in that story existed, Megan.\" flatly, dad replied. \"I'm guessing those who tried to kidnap you were hired thugs from Sykes or someone else. Most likely to test your powers, search for weaknesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think it wasn't this agency?\" curious, Travis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it was the Agency, both of you would be unconscious, bound and gagged, on your way to parts unknown.\" seriously, Sam replied. \"They are ruthless professionals in the field of espionage and assassination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped at that. \"What are we to do?\" frightened, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The original members of the gang are holding a meeting.\" the car speeding onto the freeway, dad replied. \"With a little luck, we'll get there before it ends and we can formulate a plan.\" he paused. \"Travis, you and I need to have a serious talk about your power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my power?\" turning to the radio, Travis asked. \"I saved Megan's life back there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am grateful for that, believe me.\" quickly, dad replied. \"Look at your face in the mirror, though. You are white as a sheet and you were not changed for all that long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI became worried for Travis, noticing how pale he seemed. \"What's wrong with him, dad?\" fearful, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you, Travis is just discovering his power, honey.\" gently, dad replied. \"You both need to learn how to control it so you do not push yourselves beyond your normal limits.\" pausing, he added, \"Megan, I would not shape shift too often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The human body is not designed for it and you are half human.\" morbidly serious, dad replied. \"Each time you change, you risk injuring yourself. After you you fainted, I did a quick scan with a med-wand, an alien device.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you find?\" nervous, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had pulled every muscle and tendon in your body.\" darkly, dad replied. \"I's refrain from changing shapes unless absolutely necessary, young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you suggesting we do?\" curious, Travis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can offer you a learning tool, used by my people to learn control.\" kindly, dad replied. \"However, it was not built with humans in mind so it may 'misfire' from time to time, giving you a form you do not have in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the middle compartment opened and an odd bracelet rose from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may appear simple in design but, I assure you, it is more complex than you can imagine.\" seriously, dad said. \"Travis, I urge you to trust me and wear the bracelet. Still, as it was not designed for humans, I will not force you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched, uncertain as Travis made his decision...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think I will see how training on my own goes first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understandable... but just promise me you will not lose it.\" firmly, dad said. \"If the Agency gets that device and learns from it, they could produce a device that would allow them to control your forms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis nodded. \"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the car suddenly stopped. \"We're here, get out\" dad demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis and I got out at the same time and met on the sidewalk. We took notice to the front of the car and saw a silver liquid-like substance flow out of the grill. It flowed into a puddle that started to rise. As it rose, features like arms and legs appeared. Then, his head along with clothing features appeared as well. Lastly, the silver color drained from his body. The puddle formed into Megan's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is so cool!\" smiling, Travis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I got a lot of that the first time\" he replied. \"But... Travis, do you have any other clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis was confused for a second but looked down. His shirt and shorts were still clinging to his body, but they were in shreds. Most of his upper body was revealed, showing a surprisingly amount of muscle. He turned from me, catching me staring at his muscular frame. I guess it was to hide the fact he was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but no\" he replied, \"I left my pack at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I grabbed his arm, \"Don't worry Travis, you look fine to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed at that while we headed to the door.

There was Garth and Grace, Alyssa, Caitlin was even there! I wondered why they had invited Caitlin Spencer but I decided it best not to mention it.  Two adults approached us, the one who approached Travis seemed to be Mexican in ethnicity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman who walked up to me gently grasped my arm. \"Easy, Megan\" she said, \"You better sit down a bit, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine\" trying to sound confident, Travis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Typical boy.\"</i> sighing, I thought. <i>\"Always trying to play the tough guy.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell you are, Chico\" the woman with Travis said, sternly. \"You look like a ghost, sit down and rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm fine.

Megan did the same only it was from her powers going a bit nuts on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like mine did at the beginning, turning into a behemoth.\" Garth said slightly shaken. \"My power is super strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like your father.\" dad said smiling. then he turned serious, \"We need a plan and time is something we don't have a lot of, we need to act, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you suggest?\" asked a woman.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Our last mission was against a man named Sykes who we believed was the bottom of a drug and weapon running cartel.\" Geo sighed. \"Unfortunately, he turned out to be just the opposite. He was a war monger drug lord, the top dog of the cartel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face and Travis' paled, hearing that. \"Was it this Sykes who caused you to stop crime fighting?\" whispering, I asked. \"Or was it the Agency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Agency was after Sykes, just as we were.\" seriously Ted replied. \"Sykes knew they were there and that we were hunting him down.

We thought this was behind us... its been chasing us all along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone managed to stay calm we were able to learn most of everyone's name. \"We need to get everyone started on training the sooner the better\" said Geo. \"I know of such a place, the original group headquarters near the coast. It's only about twenty miles from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought our headquarters were destroyed by the Agency days after we escaped Sykes' death trap in Rome\" confused, Sarah said. \"They completely burned the summer home mansion to the ground, trying to get to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the sister mansion in England\" countered Geo. \"I'm talking about the original headquarters, here in the States, where we first starting training to hone our skills while not gallivanting around the world. It's old but its still standing and we can go there in a second's notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kids will still need individual training\" Sarah said worried. \"Also, their skills are far more advanced than ours were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will get individual training. You see, I had a feeling we had not seen the last of the Agency so I had an underground... err... vacation village constructed in a cave system for all of us to run to with our families, just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Creepy...</i> wincing, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of the training facilities we need are there?\" asked a Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeo nodded, \"It has everything we need to live and train for as long as it takes. We can live there or commute there. Its just an option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll commute there\" said Ted. \"The Agency will know we're onto them if we all suddenly vanish. Still, we must be on our toes at all times, understood!?\" Everyone nodded and he turned back to Geo, \"I will check the mansion and training facility to ensure its safe and secure. We can take two along with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was both glad and sad that we were splitting up. I was happy because if one of us gets caught, the others can be notified.

'chuckle'... out of this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Drool, dad, really drool.\"</i> rolling my eyes, I thought. then I asked, \"Really, dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jokes aside, you also need training, both of you.\" turning serious, dad said. \"Travis, you are far too slow in your animal transformations which makes you vulnerable. Megan, your ability to control machines is wild, unfocused, you need to work on that and fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to ask how but Steve was already pushing us out of Mr Jones' house to the car. \"I will drive you all the normal way to conserve energy.\" opening the driver's side door, he said. \"Get in, we have little time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain, I stepped into the back seat as Travis did the same. We blushed, meeting each other as dad chuckled. \"Normally, you fight over sitting up front, Megan.\" buckling himself in, he said. \"Interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, blushing with Travis. \"Someone has to warn him who he is up against.\" teasing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad laughed as he started the engine and pulled away from the Jones residence. \"Your training will start in the rumble room at the house.\" looking at Travis through the rear view, he said. \"It's sort of like an arena where I privately train.\" he smiled, adding, \"I am anxious to see what you two have on the ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, we arrived home where dad immediately escorted us to his 'rumble room'. It was large with heavily padded walls, floor, and ceiling. Inside, I saw mom waiting for us with Mr and Mrs. Greenway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna, could you please escort our guests to the observation room?\" politely, dad asked. \"This training could get intense and I don't want anyone getting injured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded and led Mr and Mrs Greenway out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the door closed with a soft click, Travis turned only to scream, seeing dad coming at him, his form quickly changing to that of a humanoid bear. Travis  rose his arms to defend himself. I did the same only I was poised to jump between him and dad, not knowing my hands were glowing. Suddenly, dad stopped his advancement, a smile on his face as he chuckled. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s going to scare a bear away.\u201d Sarcastically, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled not to giggle, in spite of myself, as Travis blushed brightly. Then, dad said, \u201cYou need to learn how to think on your feet, young man.\u201d He then pointed to me, my hands still raised; glowing. \u201cFollow my daughter\u2019s example.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-Is this mom\u2019s power?\u201d seeing my hands glow for the first time, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour mother is a descendant of a legendary tribe of Amazon Women who possessed incredible strength, speed, and agility.\" returning to his human form, dad replied. \u201cShe did not gain those abilities but she has a certain worldly clairvoyance, allowing her to learn virtually anything very quickly. However, those Amazonian traits seemed to have trickled down to you, giving you short bursts of speed.\" he smiled. \"Look at your hands, they are not glowing, they are creating heat from vibrating at high velocity; you could leave a person a very nasty burn by merely touching him right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped and focused on relaxing myself, eventually getting my hands to stop vibrating. \u201cDad, I could have hurt you.\u201d Tearing up, I said. \u201cI- I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \u201cYou forget my power, Megan.\u201d smiling, he said. \u201cYou would not have harmed me in the slightest as I can withstand a lot more than you might think.\u201d turning serious, he said, \"Strange, but that power seems to only be focused in your hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an Amazonian fighting technique.\" came mom's voice through a speaker. we all looked up to see mom and Mr and Mrs Greenway watching us through an observation window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying, mom?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are part alien, thus the ability to become living metal and shape shift for a short time.\" smiling, mom replied. \"Then, you have a power from me, allowing you short bursts of speed.\" she sighed. \"However, your true unique power seems to be a psychic link with machines, 'communicating' with them in a way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*I have no control over what powers you develop.*</i> reminded the voice of Zoe. <i>Just as your mother's symbiont, Beta can not. I can only guess that the two powers together, made something truly unique.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Mom has a symbiont in her too?* surprised, I thought. *Why haven't I heard from her?*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*She speaks only when she feels the need is there.*</i> serious, Zoe replied. <i>*We usually always remain silent unless out host is in peril, your mother can handle herself.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled then turned back to Travis. \u201cShall we continue with your training?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready for you this time.\u201d confident, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad laughed. \u201cWill you now?\u201d amused, he asked. \u201cWe\u2019ll see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore another move could be made, a television in the room turned itself on, revealing a test screen as a voice declared, 'Pueri Problementa!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProblem child in Latin.\u201d Surprised, Travis said. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt means someone has placed a note in the \u2018blind post office\u2019.\u201d surprised as well, dad replied. \u201cI\u2019m surprised it\u2019s still working after all this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt could be a trap.\u201d serious, I mussed. \u201cI mean, who would use the \u2018blind post office\u2019? Most people believe the group is just a legend.\u201d then I thought, <i>\"A legend we are now living.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat and the kidnap attempt earlier.\u201d frowning, dad said. \u201cYou two are not ready to jump into anything right now.\u201d he shook his head. \u201cForget you saw that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut dad\u2026\u201d softly, I protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not ready, Megan!\u201d sternly, dad said. \u201cYou both just discovered your powers and barely have a grasp as to how to control them!\u201d he sighed. \u201cBesides, if anything happens to either of you, I will never hear the end of it from either of your mothers. Let\u2019s continue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can handle myself, sir.\u201d with a sigh, Travis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise you are not ready, young man.\u201d firmly, dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he changed into a humanoid wolf before charging me. This time, Travis had his guard up and quickly changed to that of a humanoid wolf to match him. Only dad changed into a humanoid bear in a heartbeat and threw him like a rag doll into one of the padded walls. Travis moaned as I rushed over to him. I watched as his body reverted back to human before he looked up to to see dad standing over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I make my point?\u201d returning to human form, dad asked. \u201cYou must be focused at all times, in all situations if you want to stay alive, Travis. I learned this the hard way and it almost cost me my life. I will not allow you two to make the same mistake.\u201d he then threw me a 'you too' look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what do we do?\" uncertain, Travis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed. \"We keep training.\" softly, he said. \"Relax. You'll get your chance to bust a few bad guys soon enough.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dad did not move, he instead motioned to the next room, the door opening on its own. He walked out, but he stopped just before to motion us to follow him. \"A thought came to me\" turning to Travis, he said. \"Your transformations seem very limited. You could have changed into something else to defeat me, but you went as a wolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis blushed. \"Yeah...\" he replied, \"That was one of the ones I remember...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. I think that before we start training, and you decide to go out on your own, I believe that we should expand your Anthro profile to increase your capabilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the next room, we found a large indoor pool. I was confused to see a small control panel against the wall where there was not one the other day. Travis eyed the pool, surprised by its size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled, seeing his expression. \"It can be made larger as well as deeper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hit a button on the control panel and I watched, shocked, as the pool widened. \"How can you build this stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're aliens Megan...this would be something easy.\" smiling, dad replied. \"But the Greenways helped us with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore another word could be said, dad snapped a spherical weight onto Travis' leg. He paused to look down at it before dad shoved him into the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI screamed Travis' name before turning to dad, angry. \"How could you!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's fine, Megan.\" lightly, dad said. \"Don't panic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned back to the pool and watched the bubbles on the surface but got scared as they stopped. I was about to dive in after him when he suddenly broke the surface and climbed out, glaring at dad who gave me a 'I told you' look before I ran to him and pulled him into a warm hug. \"Travis! When I saw the last air bubble, I thought....\" my voice trailed off when I suddenly noticed that he had gills on the sides of his neck. <i>\"What...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis felt his neck then turned to dad who seemed only slightly shocked. \"Travis, could you always change parts of your body?\" softly, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had these gills the first day.\" shaking his head, Travis replied. \"I guess they just showed up because I needed them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad was quiet for a while, making Travis and I concerned, even scared. \"Megan take Travis on a tour of the house.\" smiling again, he said. \"Take the rest of the day to relax, I have...an errand to run...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way dad said that worried me even more but I knew he had our best interests in mind and grabbed a towel to dry off a bit before turning to Travis. \"So what should we do?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you pick?\" suggested Travis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pondered for a bit before smiling. \"I would like to...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We needed to stop a few times to navigate through the maze of hallways and rooms but we soon reached the house gym. I smiled, seeing Travis' reaction to how big our house was. We walked into the large gym where I pointed out a properly sized indoor track. I smiled and ran over to it. \"Come on Travis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis smiled, shifting his form into an Anthro cheetah before walking up onto the track. We both stood ready to run. \"Are you sure you want to race me?\" he asked, \"I ran miles without even trying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure\" focusing, I replied. \"3...2...1...GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raced forward, trying not to let on that I was struggling as speed was really not my thing. Surprisingly, I was half way around the track before Travis caught up with me. Seeing him, I dug deep and I saw a slight glow before I punched into high speed and won the race in a heart beat! Although I felt like passing out, I still cheered, happy that I had won the race and hoped it would get Travis to train harder. Travis had fallen under the wake of my sudden burst of speed but he got up and ran over to me, blushing slightly.  \"I told you I would win!\" happily, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis sighed. \"Yeah...you did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at him, worried. \"Hey, shouldn't you change back? Remember how your body was drained?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if I'm going to get used to changing, I should at least remain in a form for a while. Besides...\" he bent down a bit so his face met mine, \"I thought you liked me as an animal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that then began to scratch his head between his cat like ears. Travis instantly relaxed and began to purr. This made me giggle even more. \"Different species...same result.\" I continued to scratch him between the ears, not knowing that I was getting him aroused. Had I know I was having that effect on him, I would have stopped a lot sooner but some lessons are learned the hard way....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His purrs grew loud, making me laugh but my laughter died in my throat as he suddenly growled at me. I had not expected that but I felt slightly relieved when he rubbed his head against mine, as if wanting more. I did not know exactly what it meant so I didn't do anything about it until Travis then advanced his entire cat like body towards me. \"What is he trying to do!?\" startled, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pushed him away, saying, \"Okay Travis, that's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis growled at me again, more deeply this time, startling me. <i>\"What's gotten into him!?\"</i> worried, I thought. <i>\"He's acting more like an animal than a man.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked into his eyes and began to slowly back away, seeing only animalistic lust, he was no longer thinking but moving on instinct alone! His growls became deeper as he fell onto all fours, approaching me with, I believed, all intentions to make love. I now regretted petting and scratching him in the first place as I had apparently sent him the wrong signals. \"Travis please...it's me...\" backing away, I pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis roared as if to silence me then pounced onto me in a way to force himself onto me. I feared getting raped by him, something he would greatly regret later as he was obviously not in his right mind. He took a quick swipe with his paw, tearing my tank top apart, revealing my bra underneath. I looked at him in fear, knowing I would have to stop him. \"Travis...\" fearful, I warned. \"I-I don't want t-to hurt you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis swiped at me again, this time making a set of deep wounds into my shoulder. I let out a low scream of pain and, through instinct alone, threw my fist into him again and again, not knowing I was hitting him over a hundred times a second, sending him into convulsions. I only stopped when he stopped moving and slipped into unconscious. He was still in anthro form but no longer a threat to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner I pushed Travis off of me, dad ran into the room and immediately examined my wounds; they were not serious but enough to make dad worry. \"Megan! Are you okay?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't answer him, my mind was on Travis who had just attacked me, falling victim to the instincts of the animals he becomes. I teared up, looking at the deep bruises on his shoulder and realized that I must have caused them. <i>\"I guess we're even.\"</i> shaking, I thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then took a clean cloth from another pocket and wiped away the blood, revealing scars rather than gashes. \"Better?\" softly, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better.\" nodding, I said. \"Thank you.\" I then turned to Travis. \"I believe he fell victim to the instincts of the animal he had become. It's not all his fault, I gave him mixed signals by scratching his ears and chin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps.\" sighing, dad said. \"Still, he needs a good scare or rather a good scar to remind him of his place when around my little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hurt him.\" tearing up, I begged. \"Please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Travis jolted up and turned to me, looking worried. His worry turned to horror as he saw the scars on my shoulder. my bloody shoulder. Then, I saw the scars. I....I did those...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't get myself to answer as I was worried what my father was about to do to him. Once Travis took notice of him, I could tell he was worried as well. Any father would be furious if someone attacked their daughter, regardless of the situation behind it. I watched in horror as dad flexed his hand before long steel claws grew from his fingernails. Before either I or Travis could react to this, dad slashed part of his face and dug deep wounds into his chest! Travis yelled out in pain before returning to his human form. Dad then quickly waved the same strange device over the wounds, healing them instantly. I do not think Travis noticed but, like myself, he was left with the scars from the attack. This sent a slight feeling of relief through me as dad showed compassion by sparing him from any lasting pain or suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked him in the eye, anger clear on his face. \"If you can't control yourself, find another girlfriend!\" growling, dad said. \"Let those scars on your chest be a reminder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked away right after that and I ran to him, worried for him. Only he turned away from me as if frightened of me, or rather, my father. This hurt me more than the slash to my shoulder but I stayed near him.. I loved him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan...I-I'm dangerous...\" tearfully, Travis said. \"You're not safe around me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, trying to get away from me but I quickly moved to face him. \"Travis, your not dangerous...\" softly, I said. \"Your just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Megan, listen! I made scars on your shoulder! And that was all from an ear scratch!\" tears falling, Travis cried. He shifted quickly back into a cheetah, turning from me. \"I know we weren't dating, but we can't be together if this is what's going to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then ran out of the room, sobbing. This broke my heart but it also filled my mind with resolve. I started to run after him but stopped to find dad standing in my way. \"Consider carefully what you might face if you go after him, Megan.\" calmly, he said. \"You got hurt once, I do not wish you to get hurt again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis has a power that is hard to control. dad,\" patiently, I said, \"just like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can teach you how to control your power, Megan.\" looking at me, dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can teach Travis too.\" annoyed, I fired back. \"I love him dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad and I both fell silent to that as I had just confessed my feelings for him. I stared at dad, blushing but, to my surprise, he slowly nodded. \"If you feel that way, go after him.\" softly, he said. \"However, I will not tolerate any further loss of control, he must learn to hold back his animal instincts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he stepped aside and I ran out to search for him. It did not take long as I was able to see through the 'eyes' of the security cameras throughout the house. I reached the room he was hiding in and the door instantly unlocked for me, allowing me to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I locked the door for a reason...\" coldly, Travis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but these are electronic locks.\" smiling, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a few steps closer then stopped, remembering dad's words before I searched for him. \"What's wrong...?\" softly, Travis asked. \"Afraid I will attack again...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, I'm afraid dad will attack you again.\"</i> darkly, I thought. \"Travis...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan...just...just...\" Travis started to cry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I knelt down and wrapped my arms around him. Travis managed to turn, \"Megan...what are you...?\" his words froze in his mouth as I smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis listen to me\" kindly, I said. \"You are not a monster. You may be dangerous, but you are not a monster. You are a sweet boy that will protect me from everything. There will be a few scrapes and bruises along the way, but that is what makes a relationship strong. I...I like you...and I don't want to lose you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then began to cry myself, frustrated that I could not speak how I truly felt. Soon, Travis cried with me, returning the hug. I loved him with all my heart and I hoped he felt the same way, though I sensed he was just as reluctant to confess...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Travis, as if to appease any anger, quickly shifted from that to a wolf, going into human form for a second first. Again, dad just stood there, staring at him. \"Why are you in anthro form?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis gulped, nervous, but stood his ground. \"Uh...I figured that...uh...if I stay like this from time to time, my body could be used to it.

Only, as the school came into view, he slammed on the breaks, startling us both. Before either of us could say a word, dad sharply ordered, \"Megan... binoculars, NOW!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrightened by dad's sudden urgency, I obeyed immediately and got the small binoculars out of the glove box and handed them to him who brought them to his eyes, looking out the windshield. A moment later, a deep growl emitted from deep in his throat, making both Travis and I shiver. \"That's Clarence Mayweather on that roof top!\" anger in his voice, dad said. \"He's the bastard who put Sarah Vance into a wheelchair!\" he growled again, adding, \"He has a rifle in his hands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Travis and I gasped, wondering if there was anything we could do to help. Then dad turned to us both sharply. \"We need to make whoever he is targeting harder to zero in on.\" quickly, he said. \"Travis, Megan, follow my lead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis and I nodded and scrambled out of the car before we all followed dad as he changed into a wolf. Travis followed suit with me right behind only I was having a hard time keeping my form together. Although I was dad's daughter, shift shaping was not my strong suit, it hurt to keep any form for too long. Still, we needed to provide a distraction so I followed Travis and dad as we charged the students, growling and howling at their heels. The students screamed and scattered in all directions as we ran about at random, trying to disperse the crowd. <i>\"This is getting harder by the second.\"</i> gasping for air, I thought. <i>\"I'd better find a hiding place so I can change back and fast.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not see the drama that unfolded between Garth Jones and Travis as I found myself unable to move for a short time after becoming human again. \"No more changing shapes for me.\" panting, I muttered. \"It takes too much out of me.\" I turned to find that I had hidden behind a vending machine. \"I could use a snack, maybe a chocolate bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine responded by dropping a chocolate bar into the vending tray and I slowly accepted it. \"Thank you, kind machine.\" smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were advantages to being able to 'talk' to machines....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first, I thought that the gunman we saw had shot it out. Seeing Dad jump through the window, I feared someone might have gotten hurt and hurried over to see Travis standing face to face with Garth Jones. Both had impatient looks on their faces. \"Garth Jones, the defender of the underdog.\" shaking my head, I muttered. \"He must have gone after the 'big bad wolf' only to find out it was Travis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an emergency, Garth,\" as I stepped through the window, dad explained. \"Clarence Mayweather is going to kill somebody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI expected Garth to react but I surprised to see him relax, returning to normal size. \"It's okay, Mr. Connors.\" taking a breath, he said. \"It's being taken care of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" surprised, dad asked. we all turned to look at Mayweather's perch, where he was now being taken into custody. \"How'd that happen so quickly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can thank Cait,\" Garth explained. \"She got a vision warning of the attack, and alerted us. At least, she alerted the kids she'd already made mental contact with. Once Dad heard about it, he got a team ready to take him down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad was still upset. \"Why didn't I hear about this? And why would he send you kids to school, knowing what was going to happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad wanted him to think his plan was still going smoothly.\" calmly, Gar replied. \"And we only had an hour's warning. Dad couldn't contact everybody, and still draw up a counterstrike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad began to advisably relax. \"I guess that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said Mayweather is the gunman?\" curious, Gar asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"We'd had run-ins with him as the Problem Child Gang. More recently, he tried to kill Sarah Vance, but only succeeded in putting her in a wheelchair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGar grinned. \"Dad's been looking for him since he escaped. He may want to conduct that interrogation personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody else started to calm down, but I heard another voice, saying, <i>Don't give him the chance. Run him down. Finish him off.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shivered slightly, hearing the voice and wondered where it was coming from. <i>\"Something tells me this is just the beginning.\"</i> worried, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I walked into the school with the other students and I reported to my homeroom. I found it ironic that all the other kids involved in the new Problem Child Gang were there only I did not see Travis, making me worry...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I explained the situation and dad promised to be at the school within five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took my time <br>\r\nto walk down to the office, hoping to buy dad enough time to reach the school before something happened. When I finally walked in, I immediately noticed two tall, well built men in black suits with black jackets over them and dark sunglasses covering their eyes. Alarms went off in my mind as I suspected they might be from the Agency. Reacting to those emotions, the cameras in the room all turned to our direction while every piece of equipment, copiers, the PA mic, everything electronic turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Miss Connors.\" politely, the first man said with a slight nod. \"I am special agent Turner and this is special agent Stonewall.\" the two briefly flashed a badge for me to see. \"I'm sure you are wondering why we have asked to see you but rest assured you are not in any legal trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly why are you here to see me?\" nervous, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand you are nervous.\" discretely eying the room, Stonewall said. \"I would be too in your position. However, we would rather discuss this in private. There is an empty room right across the hall and we have been given permission to use it for our talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that the room across the hall was bare, except for a few tables and chairs. There were no cameras or any piece of electronic equipment, no way to call for help if I fall into trouble. \"I'm not going anywhere with anyone who does not properly identify who they are and who the represent.\" firmly, I replied. \"You claim to be special agents with flashy badges but are you FBI? CIA... the Agency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurner sighed. \"We work for an American government organization that works hand in hand with both the FBI and CIA.\" patiently, he said. \"We would like to talk to you about your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not talk to me in person, rather than harass my daughter?\" entering the room, dad asked. \"What business do you have with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are a number of people who are interested in her, shall we say, unique skills, Mr Connors.\" looking at dad, Stonewall said. \"Did you seriously think you could keep those gifts of hers hidden forever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious and worried looks were forming on the secretary and principal's faces as dad's face slowly turned red with impatience. Dad was well known in town for his many connections. \"You will write a hall pass for my daughter to return to her studies.\" sternly, dad said to the office secretary. \"I will be having a talk with these two gentlemen outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be best if we discuss this in the room across the hall.\" patiently, Turner said. \"While there is still time to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy...\" fearful, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" an icy anger in his voice, dad said. \"We'll talk in the room across the hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad ushered me out of the room then opened the door. \"After you, gentlemen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men walked inside the room and dad...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

One minute passed, then two, then three before the door finally opened and dad walked out, looking somewhat pale. \"Sweetie, we are going to have to go with these gentlemen.\" softly, he said. \"It seems that Sykes has acquired a number of alien technology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" shocked, I whispered. \"How? When?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Megan.\" touching my shoulder, dad replied. \"Regardless, if this is true, we are ill equipped to deal with such a threat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes them think they would fair any better?\" eying the two agents, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would not fair any better.\" honestly, Turner replied. \"We need each other to deal with this.\" pausing, he added, \"The original group opened the government's eyes to a threat we did not see. Let us work together to stop them once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to dad, worried. \"Are you sure about this, dad?\" wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were nearly killed the last time we locked horns with both Sykes and the Agency.\" serious, dad replied. \"If Sykes did get his hands on alien tech, we are going to need all the help we can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit reluctantly, I nodded. \"Alright, I'll go with you but be warned,\" sternly, I said, \"I am never alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you and our commander will have a lot in common.\" cryptically, Stonewall replied. the then pulled a two way radio from his jacket. \"We have convinced Miss Connors; any luck with Mr. Greenway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negative.\" came a disappointed reply. \"However, if he sees Megan leaving with you, he may follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" with a nod, Stonewall said. \"We are leaving with Miss Connors and her father now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You- You are going to use me to trap Travis!?\" stunned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt any trap will hold your friend for long.\" serious, Turner replied. \"He is reluctant; perhaps because our associates used a tactic he did not take kindly to.\" he shrugged. \"We are only hoping he will follow so he can see with his own eyes what we are trying to accomplish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, hearing that. \"Okay...\" ice in my voice, I said. \"Only, if this is a trick or a trap, my boyfriend and I will make you regret it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurner nodded. \"I have no doubt you will.\" he said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first, I was startled, even disturbed, knowing that my dad was literally all over me. Then, I heard his voice in my head. \"I am surrounding you in the form of living energy.\" telepathically, he said. \"My body is not physically touching you in any way, shape, or form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that made me feel a little better but I was still worried as the two men each took hold of one of my wrists and escorted me towards the exit. If either of them were to suddenly try anything, dad could get hurt. What was worse, we walked right into Travis' path. I threw him a pleading look, hoping he would not jump into 'hero' mode, making things hard for him. Only, he seemed to take my look as a call for help and quickly jumped into our path. \"Stop right there!\" with a growl in his voice, Travis commanded. \"Where are you taking my girlfriend!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my mouth to speak but Stonewall gave my wrist a slight twist. It was not enough to hurt me but more than enough to get my attention. \"Say nothing, Miss Connors.\" quickly, he warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This does not concern you, kid.\" sternly, Turner said. \"Step aside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not happening!\" fangs growing into place, Travis growled. \"Let her go... NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have time for this.\" flatly, Stonewall said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he nodded to Turner who quickly drew a strange gun like device and fired it at Travis before he could react. A flash of light hit Travis, throwing him off his feet and through the exit door, throwing it clean off its hinges! I screamed his name, worried that he was seriously hurt. Seconds later, as Turner and Stonewall dragged me out, cars were racing towards the school from all directions. They were reacting to my fear and anger, rushing to my aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm yourself, Miss Connors.\" firmly, Turner said. \"The weapon we used is nonlethal, your boyfriend is only stunned, he will be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, I mentally gave the stand down command and the cars that were racing to the school came to a halt in the streets. Only their engines were still running, I was not born a fool. Once the cars had stopped, Turner and Stonewall half dragged and half carried me towards a strange helicopter that did not seem to make any noise. They forced me inside then buckled me up before Turner gave the pilot the command to take off immediately. As the helicopter rose off the ground, I looked out the window at Travis. I cried, fearful for him as he staggered to his feet. He looked up and caught my eye before the helicopter turned and flew away from the school. \"He's going to give chase.\" turning to Turner, I said. \"You might not be glad he did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurner responded with a smile and nothing more, making me nervous. <i>\"Dad, I'm scared.\"</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You are in no danger with me at your side.\"</i> came dad's telepathic response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a streak of fire shot across the left side of the helicopter before I saw something that turned my blood cold with fear. It was a human like dragon, straight out of Anime comics! As it circled to throw a stream of fire from its mouth on our right side, I knew who that dragon was. \"Travis...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's trying to force us down, sir!\" a twinge of fear in his voice, the pilot said. \"What are your orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boy just wants to get his hands on us.\" calmly, Turner said. \"Climb up into the clouds, we'll take him straight to the Singularity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what!?\" startled, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our base of operations, Miss Connors.\" simply, Stonewall replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearful, the pilot quickly climbed as he was ordered. I looked forward, trying to see where we were going, but gasped in surprise as we cleared the clouds. Ahead of us was what could only be described as a massive flying wing!  The ship looked to be the size of two Nimitz class aircraft carriers, fused together in a 'V' formation, with twin control towers in the middle where the two halves met! As we climbed higher, over the ship, I looked out the window next to me to see that the engines were in a huge, triangular shaped piece that filled the space between the two wings. It was an impressive, if not, intimidating sight that sent a chill down my spine. \"Is- Is that the Singularity?\" turning to Stonewall, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStonewall nodded. \"Miss Connors, welcome to CHILD.\" firmly but kindly, he said. \"We are the Central Headquarters of Intelligence, Logistics, and Defense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Singularity, this is Kilo India Delta.\" radioing the ship, the pilot said. \"We have two invites on board and a hostile friendly in tow. We are requesting permission to land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kilo India Delta, you have permission to land.\" came a firm feminine voice. \"We will be ready to receive your two invites and hostile friendly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rodger that, Singularity.\" replied the pilot. \"Be aware the hostile friendly is a shape shifter. Repeat, the hostile friendly is a shape shifter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" came the feminine voice. \"You are clear to land on pad three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I saw the helicopter drawing closer to the ship, I became more and more worried. \"If this was indeed a trap, how would we be able to escape....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A man in a doctors lab coat was administering something into the UVs of sleeping children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what are you doing\" I called as I stepped into the room. The Doctor turned around and gave me a glare of hatred. \"I'm sorry you had to see this\" He took a step towards me, taking a small needle out of a case on his side. I stepped back bumping into a wall \"Let's not be hasty\" He moved closer smiling widely, \"good night young one\" The man rushed forward grabbing me and forcing my head up so that my neck was exposed. With one quick motion he jammed the needle forward. I  closed my eyse expecting a sharp pain, instead I just heard a sharp snap, then the doctor let go of me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes to look at the doctor, he was reaching for his pack again, I could see the needle on the floor, the metal part snapped off. I raised my knee up into the doctor's stomache driving him back a couple steps, then with my foot I kicked his hands, the bag flying across the room, needles spilling forth . \"How dare you?\" the doctor yelled, much more loudly now than before. He rushed forth, but instinctively My fist flew forth into his jaw. A metal hand was now where mine should have been. The doctor flew back, falling into his own needles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor tried to stand up but only made it to his knees before he fell onto his front, needles sticking out of his back. I looked back at my hand which was slowly becoming the fleshy tone it normally was. The kids around the room were now all awake and cheering.</span></div></div>",

She is athletic but has little interest in sports, though her friends try to convince her to try out for them. She will back up her friends in a pinch but prefers to handle her own problems unless they prove to be too much for her. It is believed by some that everything has an aura, a spirit; cities, towns, and machines are no exception. Megan has the power to 'connect' with these auras and influence them. Machines react to her emotional state, protect her within the confines of their predesignated abilities. Cars move on their own to block pursuers, their auras giving them a 'life' of their own as an example. She also has the power of incredible speed when fighting but this does not affect her running speed, just her movements. Megan gained these two  powers from a female symbiotic alien, named Zoe, transferred from her mother, Anna. Megan has a crush on a mysterious boy named Travis Greenway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the main thread, Megan's father, she discovers, is an alien from a world of shape shifters. Being  half alien, she too has this shape shifting ability only, being half human, it hurts her to use it more than a few minutes so she resides to only change part of her body to form shields or stabbing weapons as a defense when needed. Also, in the main thread, Megan's mother, she discovers, possesses a form of worldly clairvoyance, making her highly knowledgeable about the world. This is due to her own symbiont, named Beta, anchored within her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve Connors<br>\r\n33 years old<br>\r\n5'8'' 197 lbs.<br>\r\npowerfully built with brown hair and brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve is a kind, fun loving man who is never too busy to spend time with his family. However, he can be very serious and protective when the situation demands it. He is a top technician at Tanner Technologies, a research company on the outskirts of Waterfront City, where his family lives. In the main thread, it is revealed that Sam is an alien from a race of shape shifters who came to Earth. In the same thread, he was known as Sam, the ace driver and gadget building member of the Problem Child Gang who fought crime twenty years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna Connors<br>\r\n30 years old<br>\r\n5'4'' 136lbs.<br>\r\ntall and slender, average strength with long blond hair and blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna is a kind and knowledgeable woman with great patience. She is a stay at home mom who spends her time raising her daughter while studying to expand her knowledge. In the main thread, Anna can literally work any job, speak any language without study due to a form of worldly clairvoyance she gained from a symbiotic alien named Beta who was passed on from her own mother upon her birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Travis Greenway</b><br>\r\n(Revised)<br>\r\n14 years old<br>\r\n6' 0'' 190lbs.<br>\r\nVery tall and well built for his age with jet black hair and green 'cat' eyes (the pupils are a slit instead of round.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis is a unique character and he likes it that way. He is kind and loyal to his friends and will stand up to anyone who threatens them. His friends call him 'splice' due to his strange characteristics. Shortly before high school, Travis was told he had two extra organs within him the doctors had never seen before. Shortly after, he discovered that he had developed the ability to transform into any creature he could perfectly visualize in his head, including Anthros and mythical creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith such a bizarre mystery to unfold, Travis turned to his parents to receive a startling confession. Travis was genetically engineered, a 'pet project' of his mother, a former member of a group known only as The Agency. This was a group mentioned in his favorite graphic novel series, The Problem Child Gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The main thread splits with this character....</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one, it is revealed that Travis is an Earth born human/alien hybrid with shape shifting abilities, that favored animals and creatures, not an 'experiment' as previously told.  In the other thread, Travis is the genetically engineered human with shape-shifting abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn either case, Travis is an Animancer, a master of animal shape-shifting; he can change his form into almost any animal or creature by becoming one with nature itself.  He has a crush on one Megan Connors who can 'communicate' with machines. Through her, he discovered that the Problem Child Gang existed and thus, so did the Agency. After one attempt to take him and Megan by force, Travis he realized he would have to fight to keep all he held dear to him.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I woke up and headed for the shower, like I did every morning before. Certainly, I had no idea anything strange was about to happen. I was really enjoying the shower, until three things caught my attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first strange thing was that I was suddenly looking into the showerhead. I tried to close my eyes, before any soap got in, but I just couldn't. Then, I realized: My eyes were already closed. I could see through my eyelids!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was wrapping my head around that, I realized something else was amiss. Even though I was standing under the showerhead, I couldn't feel the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down to see where the water was going, and the third weird thing hit me. I couldn't see myself.

Instead a low yelp escaped my lips and I touched my side to see if I was still there. To my relief, I could feel my own body with my hands but, apparently, nothing else could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Have I suddenly died?\"</i> I thought, trying to reason things out. <i>\"Am I a ghost?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slapped myself, it stung and I could hear the slap and then I could feel the water again. Looking down, I saw my naked body once more and breathed a half hearted sigh of relief as i felt myself shaking. \"I wonder what happened?\" I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing my shower, I began to towel myself dry and found I was falling into a bit of a trance. When one does the same routine every morning, it becomes almost automatic and can can do it in one's sleep. That was the type of trace I was falling into and, suddenly, my body was gone again! Only this time, I could feel the towel against me. Curious, I whipped the towel so that a piece of it my hand was not touching would hit me, it went through me as if I was not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems only objects I am directly touching can touch me.\" I mussed. \"Interesting but how did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill more curious than afraid, I decided to try slapping myself again to make myself solid so I could get dressed and try to reason everything out on paper. SLAP! I became visible again but made a mental note to find a less painful way to 'break the spell' making me like a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curiouser and Curiouser.\" I said, getting dressed. \"Welcome to Wonderland, Susan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally out of the shower, I retreated to my bedroom and sat behind my desk before grabbing a pen and began to collect my thoughts about the strange incident. I had surmised that my... condition was triggered by a mild trance like state and 'deactivated' by coming out of that trance. However, it was beyond my ability to even speculate what had caused it in the first place as it was the first time this had ever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sadly, the only disappearances I could find had routine explanations, elopements and the like. If there was someone like me before, it didn't seem to be on that side of the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan.\" I heard my mother calling. \"Come on down here.\" I put Grandma's diaries aside and headed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad were waiting for me. \"What's up?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have an important announcement,\" Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"We'll be keeping it secret for another couple months, but we'll tell you, now.\" The two of them joined hands, and Mom said, \"I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations,\" I said, hugging them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked at my mother, my vision seemed to go blurry for a moment.

It was a thick, old and faded book on the large book shelf that grandpa had kept his documented works as a private investigator. It was grandpa's passion to solve crimes that inspired you to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I've seen this book before.\" I mussed, pulling it from the shelf. \"I remembered always seeing a space...\" I then froze, my heart beginning to race. \"There was always a space here... an invisible book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, as I looked at the cover, it seemed blank but then words slowly began to appear as I, unknown to me, began to disappear from view. The book had the title, 'Journey into the unseen'. I was too wrapped up with finding this book that I had not taken notice that I was invisible and read the first page, it was addressed to me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'To my dearest granddaughter, if you are reading this, it means that I have finally passed on to the next world but do not grieve, I have lived a long and happy life. Also, I am now free to tell you who you truly are..'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI teared up, not wanting to think that my grandfather was gone but I continued to read as what he had written down must have been important to only tell me after his passing. That and I was curious by what he had meant 'who I truly am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'By now, you have discovered that you have the ability to vanish like a ghost. This power is usually only passed on to the first born son but, for some reason, fate had chosen you, the first born daughter, to have the power instead.

You were a part of the Problem Child Gang as well!?\" stunned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled at me gently. \"I was not a member, though I wanted to be.\" she replied. \"I worked in the background, keeping my little brother, 'Tex' out of trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped, picking up the first addition. \"You were the unknown Amazon!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom blushed at that. \"I called myself Adrea.\" she replied, opening the first addition. \"It was our first official case as we had before merely solved cold cases, we wanted more action.\" she sighed. \"We got it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather was out to buy film for her camera and she spotted two known drug dealers, loading a van.\" beginning the story, mom said. \"She decided to take photographic evidence of their stash and the van's license plate before radioing the rest of the group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember that, she was caught while talking to Greg on the two way.\" filled with a renewed wonder, I said. \"She was tied up, gagged, and tossed into the van with the drugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Greg knew she was in trouble and screamed into his radio.\" smiling, she said. \"Tex heard it loud and clear on his own radio and ran from the house with me following.\" she sighed. \"Sam picked each of us up and tore after the van, using a crude tracking device Sam had built into Heather's belt buckle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all got into position and sprang into action.\" my eyes dancing, I said. \"Greg threw a Molotov cocktail onto the hood of the van, causing the driver of the van to hit the breaks. Once he had stopped, Tex and Sam came running out and clobbered the driver and passenger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg then handcuffed them where they lied on the side of the road while Tex tore the rear doors of the van open with Sam opening the side door.\" thinking back to the real case, mom said. \"There was someone inside, with Heather, and he was ready for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only so were you.\" smiling, I said. \"A fist sized rock came flying in from no where and hit the man in the head, sending him to the floor of the van, out cold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shrugged. \"I was looking after my little brother.\" smiling, she said. \"When the police arrived, they found the three men handcuffed to the rear bumper of the van with a note that stated...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Courtesy of the Problem Child Gang!\" excited, I finished. sighing, I then added, \"Dad said you and the others made real enemies, solving those crimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded, turning serious. \"As we solved one dangerous case after another, we began to think we were invincible.\" looking at me sadly, she said. \"We learned the hard way that we were not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your last case.\" whispering, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"I will tell you of your second power and the story of your ancestors.\" shedding a tear, she said. \"Only I must first have your word that you consider your path in life carefully. We headed out blindly and were nearly lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only before I could do anything to try to shake out of it, a dream entered my mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho, sisters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew of the Amazonian fishing boat all responded to the lookout's cry. They took positions, expecting nothing, ready for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could have been anything, from a shark to an enemy vessel. What it was, however, was a raft, ill-suited for a voyage as long as was needed for it to reach this far. The Amazons approached the raft, and, peering over their own ship's rail, studied the raft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the raft was a young boy, burned by the sun, weak from hunger and thirst. Strangely, he was clad in the robes of a female. Why should a man dress as a woman? Moved by empathy and curiosity, they brought the boy onto their boat. Back on their island, the Amazons began nursing him back to health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had recovered enough to speak, the Amazon queen herself went to speak to him. \"Greetings, young traveler,\" she said. \"I am Antiope, Queen of the Amazons. Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy bowed his head. \"I am Iolaus, Your Majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well met, Iolaus. We found you adrift on the sea, and in a woman's robes. How came you into such dire straits, and why were you dressed so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I scarce can explain myself, Your Majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Iolaus, try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I like to wear such things. I know not why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. What put you on that raft?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The people of my city. My... dress offended them greatly. Some of them wanted to kill me outright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What stayed their hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They feared that the gods might think me an offering. If that happened, the gods would discover my true nature, and might be angered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear not, Iolaus. I have given the command that you are not to be harmed. I will direct my people to see if there is a way that we might help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Iolaus could walk again, he was brought to the temple. There, he was bound to the altar, as the Amazon priestesses performed a strange ritual over him. Finally, the chief priestess unbound Iolaus, and led the traveler out of the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Amazons, even Queen Antiope, were stunned. Iolaus was now a young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sisters,\" cried the chief priestess, \"I give you Iole, our new sister.\" And so Iole became known as the Twice-Named.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Iole settled into life as an Amazon, it became clear that she had found favor with the gods. She could run faster than the eye could follow. She could outdistance any prey she chose. And, in the heat of battle, she could pluck an arrow in flight, as easily as fruit from a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, she bore fourteen daughters and sons. When the time came for her to go to the Elysian Fields, at the end of her life, all the Amazons mourned her passing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I came out of the trance, mom blew out the candle. \"You were originally born a boy named Stan.\" looking at me, mom explained. \"Hence, the powers that were passed from father to son became yours.\" she sighed, adding, \"Only due to reasons still unknown, you slowly became a girl shortly after you were born and I renamed you Susan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was named twice, just like Iole.\" whispering, I said. \"Do I have great speed, like Iole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does mom say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(*Credit to BeeJay who wrote most this chapter in another thread.*)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked worried but I decided not to ask. Uncle Ted, who was the chief of police, lived on the other side of town in a quiet neighborhood. As we arrived, it looked as if everyone was already heading into the house. They paused, seeing us pull up to the curb and we all jumped out to join them. \"Are we late?\" walking up to uncle Ted, dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, Geo.\" shaking his hand, Ted said. \"Good to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" releasing dad, Geo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed then hugged mom. \"Thank you for coming over, sis.\" smiling, he said. \"I just wish it was under much better circumstances.\" he sighed. \"Any word from Steve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom winced. \"His daughter is in the hospital.\" sadly, she replied. \"She's not well, from what I hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed shook his head, looking worried. \"We'll have to hold the meeting without him then.\" wincing, he said. \"Everyone inside, we have a lot of ground to cover and, I fear, very little time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone was inside and sitting down, a girl, I recognized as Caitlin Spencer, turned to Sarah. \"I know this is not the place but... why were you called the black sheep of the family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah giggled slightly. \"When I was your age, the Spencer family liked to play by their own rules.\" looking at her, she explained. \"They did not care for the police or for lawyers unless it worked in their favor. That said, they wanted me to marry into the Tanner family, to increase the family's wealth.\" she motioned to mom then added, \"Only my friend had eyes for Geo and I had eyes for Frank Vance... a lawyer who worked for the police department.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine your parents didn't take it well.\" wincing, Caitlin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shook her head. \"My dad walked me down the aisle to give me away.\" sadly, she replied. \"Only he did not stay for the reception.\" she sighed. \"He and my mother accepted my husband but not until they were on their death bed, wanting to make peace before they left this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cold.\" tearing up, Caitlin said. \"I'm so sorry, aunt Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault, sweetie.\" said Sarah. \"Believe me, my parents they deeply cared for my husband and I.\" she then smiled. \"They wanted to make man who put me in this chair vanish of the face of the Earth. If Mr Jones had not gotten to him first, they would have made it happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get started.\" interrupting Caitlin's conversation, dad said with a cold tone. \"As you all know, most of us were members of the Problem Child Gang you kids like to read about. Our last mission was against a man named Sykes who we believed was the bottom of a drug and weapon running cartel.\" he sighed. \"Unfortunately, he turned out to be just the opposite. He was a war monger drug lord, the top dog of the cartel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face and those of my friends paled, hearing that. \"Was it this Sykes and his men who nearly killed you all?\" almost whispering, asked Garth. \"Or was it the Agency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Agency was after Sykes, just as we were.\" seriously Ted replied. \"Sykes knew they were there and that we were hunting him down. He blew the building he was held up in, just as he made his escape.\" he shook his head. \"We barely escaped with our lives only to find the Agency became... interested in us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean interested in you?\" shaking, Lyssa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I explained earlier, we had our talents.\" looking at Lyssa, Sarah said. \"The Agency was in the business of brainwashing children with such talents to use them, make them do their dirty work so to gain wealth and power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only were we forced to flee for our lives from an exploding building, we had to escape the clutches of an underground terrorist organization.\" tearing up, dad said. \"We thought we were invincible, we were not. We thought this was behind us... its been chasing us all along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You- You think this cartel or this Agency may have interest in us.\" as if reading dad's mind, Caitlin said, turning pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"That is why we are holding this meeting, my dear.\" he said. \"The Agency has resurfaced and from what I have heard from Ted, many of you are already being watched by someone.\" he clinched a fist. \"We can not take any chances or make any assumptions, we already made that mistake once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Caitlin gasped, her lips trembling. \"No... they're outside of my house!\" hoarsely, she screamed. she threw her hands against her temples. \"Marisol, you are in danger!

Except Brad looked kind of funny, and it looked like he'd gotten dressed in a hurry. Then I noticed the hospital ID bracelet on his wrist, and remembered Cait had said he'd been recovering from plutonium exposure from that recalled body wash.<br>\r\n\"You guys OK?\" concerned, Garth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting better,\" Brad replied. Even his voice was different. \"I... had quite an experience in the hospital. Please don't ask me to describe it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Heather asked. \"Why did you come here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cait told me she'd picked up something,\" Trish answered, \"and I should grab Brad and his mom and get in her limo. Whatever it was, it had her freaked worse than the shooting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all turned to Cait again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I read Brad's doctor's mind,\" she explained. \"He's connected to the Agency, and he wanted his hands on Brad and Trish. That's why I brought them here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed shook his head. \"Sykes, the Agency, and the kids of the Problem Child Gang. This is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get everyone started on training the sooner the better.\" said dad. \"I know of such a place, the original group headquarters near the coast. It's only about twenty miles from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought our headquarters were destroyed by the Agency days after we escaped Sykes' death trap in Rome.\" confused, Heather said. \"They completely burned the summer home mansion to the ground, trying to get to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the sister mansion in England.\" countered dad. \"I'm talking about the original headquarters, here in the States, where we first starting training to hone our skills while not gallivanting around the world.\" he smiled. \"It's old but its still standing and we can go there in a second's notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kids will still need individual training.\" worried, Sarah said. \"Also, their skills are far more advanced than ours were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will get individual training.\" said dad. \"You see, I had a feeling we had not seen the last of the Agency so I had an underground... err... vacation village constructed in a cave system for all of us to run to with our families, just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a bit creepy.\" wincing, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of the training facilities we need are there?\" asked Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"It has everything we need to live and train for as long as it takes.\" serious, he said. \"We can live there or commute there.\" he paused. \"Its just an option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll commute there.\" said dad. \"The Agency will know we're onto them if we all suddenly vanish. Still, we must be on our toes at all times, understood!?\" everyone nodded and dad turned back to dad. \"I will check the mansion and training facility to ensure its safe and secure. We can take two along with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's our cue, honey.\" whispering, mom said. \"We need to get back, to train.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and I took mom's hand. To my surprise, she vanished with me the two of us causally walked out of the house, though the wall. \"That was weird but fun.\" as we became visible, I said. \"Where will we be starting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At home, reading that book grandpa left you.\" serious, mom replied. \"After that, the real work begins. I'm going to make an Amazon warrior out of you and later, dad will make you a Kage Yurei like him and his father before him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what an Amazon is  but what's a  Kage Yurei?\" confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Japanese for 'ghost shadow'.\" frowning, mom replied. \"Our family was part of an elite ninja clan.\" she then smiled. \"Your father will explain more when its his turn to train you. Right now, its my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not find the words to say so I merely nodded as dad ushered me into the car.

It explained the origin of the family's power. It read...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Centuries ago, The Tanner family, then known as the Yoru family of Japan, was a part of an elite Ninja group known as the Kage Yurei, or 'ghost shadows'. There were five members, each of them were blessed with a powerful Eien ni (forever) Jiujitsu that would be passed from father to son without need for training as it was magically placed into their very being (DNA). Each had the ability to become like ghosts with all the powers that came with that form, defending the secrets and riches of the ruling dynasty.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So dad's power is magical in origin as well as mom's.\" mussing, I whispered. \"That's interesting.\" I paused, noticing that the book was typed but grandpa's notes were hand written before realizing that he somehow sensed I would have the power after it was written. His note stated,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Dearest granddaughter, the Kage Yurei were both feared and respected. I had defended many a Japanese lord, earning many rewards for my heroics. However, no job is perfect and I found a reason to leave it all behind. I fell in love with an American woman.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma.\" fighting my tears, I whispered. \"She was quite a woman, never backing down from anyone or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, I continued to read...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'The one who had created the Eien ni Jiujitsu never produced a son so its secret died with him. Those who were blessed with the Jiujitsu passed its power to their first born son and they continued to protect the secrets and riches of each dynasty. However, that all changed when fate eventually hit each family with a first born daughter, ending their service in the Kage Yurei, with the exception of one. The Yoru family carried the burden alone until, in 1932, the first born son, Neo Yoru suddenly fled to America with an outsider woman and changed their name to Tanner to avoid those who would to hunt them down to be killed or returned to Japan. The Tanner family started a new life in America, using their Eien ni Jiujitsu to make a difference in the world around them.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hence dad became a member of the Problem Child Gang.\" smiling, I whispered. \"What a legacy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to daydream, visualizing dad fighting crime with his powers but quickly pulled myself out of it and finished reading the page...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then fate struck the Tanner family as the first born son, due to his wife's bizarre Amazonian ancestry, changed into a girl, gaining a new power. However, the Eien ni Jiujitsu remained within her. It is only a matter of time before one power wins over the other....'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is creepy.\" shivering slightly, I said. \"I have two powers but I'll lose one of them in the end.\" I gulped, not liking the thought of disappointing mom or dad. \"The only question is, which one will win out?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I closed my eyes, spinning the Sais in my hands. I sensed rather than saw dad's position and turned, thrusting one of the points at that location.

Only this is just the start, let's take it up a notch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad became visible then jumped, vanishing again, as he flew up into the trees. As I watched him, I couldn't help thinking that he looked like a genie as his feet and legs did not seem to turn visible before he jumped.

Most women in your condition prefer to take things easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and I  turned to Lilith, surprised. \"You know that I'm pregnant?\" looking at her, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith tapped her nose. \"I can smell the changes in your hormones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Well, we're trying to keep it a secret for two more months.\" blushing, mom said. \"So, please don't spread it beyond these walls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one will hear it from me.\" serious, Lilith replied. she then turned to me. \"So, what other powers are in our group?\" she asked. \"I know that Garth can make himself muscular, and you saw some of my magick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can turn invisible and intangible,\" serious, I replied. \"Mom says I've probably inherited her Amazon muscles, but I haven't found the trigger yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll come, dear,\" gently, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyssa has super-speed,\" turning back to Lilith, I said. \"I heard that Clem inherited some powers from his parents, but it left him as bald as those kids who used Plutonium products. And you know Megan Conners and Travis Greenway? They can change themselves into other things. They were those wolves who prowled around the schoolyard this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they do that?\" taken back, lilith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They spotted some guy on a roof across from the schoolyard, getting ready to shoot some kids.\" frowning, I replied. \"Fortunately, the rest of us knew about it already, so the police were ready to take him down before he could fire a shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith's eyes grew wide at the news of a foiled school shooting. \"How did you find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From Cait. She's got telepathy, and she can see a little bit into the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not as far as your Tarot cards,\" with a knowledgeable nod, mom added, \"but she can see with greater clarity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got quite the group,\" looking impressed, Lilith said. \"How about our homeroom teacher? You said she was a part of this, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's got a history with the original PCG,\" sadly, I explained. \"When she was just a little kid, the Agency kidnapped her and turned her into this pint-sized assassin. But she broke free of them. Since then, she can make herself bigger or smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Madame Vague said, \"it was good seeing you again, Amanda, but I should probably get Lilith back in bed. We wouldn't want her to be bleary-eyed on her second day of school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Lilith went back outside and, after a goodbye hug from mom (and a loving hug and kiss from me), they flew back home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

More may be added as the story continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Susan Tanner</b><br>\r\n14 years old<br>\r\n5'4'' 118 lbs.<br>\r\nTall and slender with a well- toned body; long sand blond hair and blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan is a kind, caring, and curious young lady who loves a good mystery and is very good at finding clues to solve them. She is the daughter of the wealthy technology tycoon, Geo Tanner. Susan was considered a 'problem child' due to the fact she blew the whistle on a teacher who was purposely failing students merely because their parents were her old classmates. Although the teacher was in the wrong, other teachers felt threatened by her curious nature. She discovers that she has the ability to become completely invisible and intangible when in a trance like state. While investigating this, she learned that her grandfather and father also had this power, a gift passed on from father to son. This intrigued her more and she soon discovered that she was born a boy but, due to a genetic condition in her mother's ancestry, she changed into a girl while still in infancy. Susan's grandfather left her a book, explaining how her power works and who to use it wisely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Geo Tanner</b>   <br>\r\n36 years old<br>\r\n5'10'' 175lbs.<br>\r\nTall, well built with short black hair and brown eyes.<br>\r\nGeo is a wealthy technology tycoon and the owner and operator of Tanner Tech Enterprises. He is a serious man when it comes to business but a warm and loving person when it comes to his family. He is patient but firm and will use his wealth and technology to protect what he holds dear to his heart. He gained a power from his father to become invisible and intangible while in a trance like state and has aided his father in his exploits to better the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the main thread, Geo's father was originally of the Yoru family of Japan. They had changed their name to Tanner to avoid persecution as Geo's father, Hero Yoru was part of an elite Ninja group known as the Kage Yurei, ('ghost shadows') Each member of this group was blessed with a powerful Eien ni (forever) Jiujitsu that would be passed from father to son without need for training as it was magically placed into their very being (DNA). Each had the ability to become like ghosts with all the powers that came with that form, defending the secrets and riches of the ruling dynasty.'<br>\r\nAs time passed, Hero became the last surviving member only he fell in love with an American woman and left Japan behind to start a new life. The Eien ni Jiujitsu was passed on to Geo who, in turn, passed it on to his son Sam who became his daughter, Susan. (See Susan Tanner above)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the main thread, Geo was the leader of a group known as the Problem Child Gang. This group consisted of four main members, each with unique skills or gifts. Together, with other members adding to their numbers, they worked to fight crime in Waterfront City like many a super team in the comic books they had read. Sadly, the entire group was nearly killed on their last mission, forcing them to give up crime fighting. Now, twenty years later, Geo's daughter gains the powers of a ghost and he fears a repeat of history as fate forces the Problem Child Gang to emerge once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amanda Tanner</b><br>\r\n36 years old<br>\r\n5\u20199\u2019\u2019 136lbs.<br>\r\nTall and muscular with long sand blond hair and blue eyes.<br>\r\nAmanda is a kind and patient woman who loves being a stay at home mother to her daughter, Susan. She works with the maids and butlers inside her mansion home as well as organizes charities to keep herself busy.  She has sharp senses and reflexes and is well versed in self-defense.  Her maiden name is Jones, she is Ted Jones older sister (See Ted Jones under chapter one \u2018Garth Jones\u2019)<br>\r\nIn the main thread, she had the ability to transform into a seven foot muscular woman; she called herself Anna, the unknown Amazon while following and protecting her little brother as he lead The Problem Child Gang.  This group consisted of four main members, each with unique skills or gifts. Together, with other members adding to their numbers, they worked to fight crime in Waterfront City like many a super team in the comic books they had read. Sadly, the entire group was nearly killed on their last mission, forcing them to give up crime fighting. Now, twenty years later, Amanda\u2019s daughter has developed a powerful gift of her own, making her fearing a repeat of history. She and her husband (see above) reveal their past and try to detour her from making the same mistakes they did as fate calls for the Problem Child Gang to rise again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seriously, I never knew what it was like not to get what I wanted. As a result, I guess, I developed an attitude that there must be something wrong with those less fortunate. I hardly gave anybody the time of day at school, just my boyfriend, Brad, and my best friend, Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened to change my outlook? Simple. I turned into a freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called alopecia,\" Dr. Stone said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree days before, I noticed my hairbrush was picking up way more hairs than before. A quick check of my scalp confirmed that I now had a few bald spots. I quickly made an appointment to see what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the three days between then and my appointment, I lost all my hair. I had stuck on false eyelashes, drew on new eyebrows, and threw a scarf over my head, hoping nobody I knew would see me like this. \"So what's causing it?\" I asked. \"And how soon can we undo it? School starts in, like, a week, I can't let anybody see me like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been under any stress recently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm under stress! I've lost all my hair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before that, I mean,\" he said. \"There seems to be nothing wrong with you, physically, that would cause such rapid hair loss. Since you don't go playing around with radiation, that would seem to leave stress as the cause. So, I ask again: Have you been under any stress recently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"My folks are out of town, but that's nothing new. They left me the credit cards, and Marisol drives me wherever I need to go. I've got a great boyfriend. I've really got nothing to be stressed about. At least, I didn't, until all this started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Dr. Stone said, \"unless we can find a physical cause, I'm afraid there's not much I can do. The only treatment is cosmetic: There's a discreet shop, where you can obtain wigs and false eyebrows. I can send you there. Hopefully, your hair will grow back. If it does, call me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I turned to leave, I heard Dr. Stone say, \"I think I'll have tuna for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you want,\" I said. I didn't really care what he wanted to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to face him again. \"I thought you said something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. \"Nobody said anything, until you said, \"Whatever you want.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat puzzled me. Sure, it was strange that he told me he wanted tuna. But it was just as strange that he would deny something so innocuous.</span></div></div>",

Wait here, and I'll bring it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Hopefully,* she thought, *before the Styrofoam heads start giving her orders.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left, I turned my attention to Marisol. I guess I've always thought of her as a second mother, since she's done most of the work raising me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was a surprise when I caught her thinking, *That girl's been spoiled rotten since she was five. It's about time something took her down a peg.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I realized... I was reading her thoughts. Not just hers, but those of anyone around me. And it was painting a picture of me that I didn't recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried on the wig, and it looked good, almost my usual style.

I found her in the kitchen, getting a start on dinner while watching her novelas. \"Marisol?\" I asked. \"C-can I talk to you for a second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Right in the middle of my stories,* she thought. \"What is it, child?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know if I've ever told you,\" I said, \"but I'm really grateful for all you've done for me. I've come to think of you as like a second mother to me. After all, you've been there for me, even when my folks spend all their time out of town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is my job, Caitlin,\" she said, adding in her thoughts, *while your parents do God knows what.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to tear up. \"I... I've come to realize that... maybe I've been taking too many things for granted. But I don't want to take you for granted, Marisol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood there, saying nothing, thinking nothing, I hugged her. \"Thank you, Marisol. I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stood there for a while, just hugging. I could tell that Marisol loved me, too. How strange it suddenly seemed, that I was closer emotionally to someone my parents considered the hired help than I was to my own flesh and blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI broke off the hug, and left Marisol to return to fixing dinner. Another time, I promised myself, I'd help her. For now, I wanted to think of how many people I'd wronged with my insensitivity, and figure out how best to make things right.</span></div></div>",

I realized that, apart from Marisol, I'd been closest to Trish. Perhaps i could trust her with my secret? \"Trish,\" I asked, \"can I let you in on the biggest secret of your life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Cait,\" she replied. \"We grew up together. You could always tell me everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a deep breath. \"Well, for a start, you know I used to dye my hair, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. But what do you mean, you used to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... kinda don't need to, anymore.\" I lifted the wig from my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cait!\" She gingerly touched my scalp, as if afraid she might damage it. \"What happened? Did the chemicals in that 'Plutonium' stuff do this to you? If they did, you could sue them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the main part of the secret.\" I decided to try something. Locking eyes with her, I tried to send the thought, *Can you 'hear' me?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened. \"How... how did you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \"I just found out that I can read minds. You're the first one I tried sharing my own thoughts with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you can read minds? What are you findig out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a start,\" I answered, \"I've found out that i've been kind of a jerk. If I ever treated you like that, Trish, I apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need,\" she said. \"What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused. \"You know your boyfriend, Brad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you... oh, wait, you can read minds. Of course. What about him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been two-timing. While he's been sleeping with you,... he and I have been dating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We never did anything physical,\" I said. \"When I first found out what he was up to, I wondered if you were in on it. But his thoughts told me that you were being played, just like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cait,\" she said, \"if I'd known, for a second, that he was seeing you, I never would've given him a second look. I want you to know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, Trish. I don't need to read your mind to know that.\" The two of us embraced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we hugged, I saw something amazing. It was like I was there, but I wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was looking inside Trish's bathroom. Trish was there. She was holding a pregnancy test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't see the results. But, if her deer-in-the headlights expression was any clue, I could guess what it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind snapped back to the present, and I reeled. Telepathy, and now seeing the future. What do I do with this?</span></div></div>",

Arrgh!*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, I will get you front row seats to the big wrestling match tonight if you can help me with one small problem.\" I said, firmly. \"My boy friend as been two timing on me with my best friend, she did not know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nodded, though I knew he was cheering inside, anxious to get the tickets he was after. <i>*Front row seats!? Those are near impossible to get! She must really want me to rough this kid up. or at least give him a good scare.*</i> I heard him think before he asked, \"What do want me to do with young Brad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"Just make sure he doesn't do anything stupid while I confront him.\" I replied. \"He got Trish pregnant, she got the results just before he text her, saying that he was dumping her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*That insensitive jerk!*</i> came Jon's thoughts. \"He will make no move against you or your friend, my dear.\" he said. \"Shall I drive you to his location, I have a GPS signal on him, there is no where he can hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, you and Trish were sitting down with Brad at the food court inside Our Founders Mall with Jon watching him like a hawk. \"What is this all about?\" asked Brad. \"I dumped you both, get over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*They just can't let me go.*</i> I heard him think. <i>*What a bunch of love deprived losers!*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned red at that thought, tempted to hit him with something but I decided to give him a chance to take responsibility and accept his child. \"Brad, there is something important you must know.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish took a breath and added, \"I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad's eyes bugged out as the look of horror was clear on his face. <i>*Oh, crap!*</i> then he composed himself, clearing this throat. <i>*Think fast, you idiot!*</i> I heard him think to himself. <i>*There has to be a way out of this mess!*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he sighed. \"I highly doubt you are carrying my baby.\" he said to her despair. \"If you can cheat on your best friend, what makes me believe you never cheated on me with someone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish began to cry. \"You are the only one I slept with.\" she said, honestly. \"No one else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that she was telling the truth and I also knew that Brad was in sheer desperate panic. \"You're a liar!\" he screamed. \"You got banged by some other guy and now you're trying to throw it all on me!?

At first, I thought she was going to be angry but, to my surprise, she smiled. \"Why don't we keep an eye on him for a while, using your powers.\" she suggested. \"If anything goes seriously wrong, we can get him to a hospital or try to undo what you had done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI released a breath, not realizing that I had been holding it since Trish took a step away from me. \"That sounds good, Trish, we'll do that.\" I said. \"Maybe this experience will teach Brad a lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" agreed Trish. \"Can I see Brad again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled and lightly touched her head again, revealing Brad, still in his bathroom. We both giggled as we saw him still staring at his swollen nipples. <i>*It's only the beginning, handsome.*</i> I heard Trish think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He is so going to freak out as the week progresses.\"</i> I thought to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish blushed, remembering that I could read minds, then giggled with me until...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If I can make this happen to Brad, maybe I could force someone to do things they don't want to do.

I did my best to get myself clean as Marisol usually always bathed me. <i>\"I can't believe how lazy I had been before this... change.\"</i> I thought, embarrassed. <i>\"Well, that all changes today, I am going to make Marisol proud of me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I thought about what I had heard from Marisol's mind. It was a shock to me that, after all these years, my family had not pushed to make her a citizen. As I toweled myself dry and placed on an even coat of baby powder to the inside my panties, so to ensure freshness, I decided to make that happen for her. I grabbed my cellphone from the sink counter and dialed a number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hank, this is Caitlin.\" I said sternly. \"Why has Marisol not been made a citizen yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response I received shocked me. \"Because your parents wanted her to stay, watching you for as long as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned red, angry with my parents for doing such a thing but instead of lashing out with my mind, I leaned towards defiance. \"I do not care what my parents instructed, you are <i>my</i> lawyer, under <i>my pay!!</i>, you will do I as say!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" came an immediate response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will push the paperwork to make Marisol Martino Sanchez a citizen of this nation! Make it happen by the end of this week or start typing your resume!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, I smacked my cellphone shut just before i heard Marisol's thoughts. This caused me to swallow hard as I sensed she was right outside the bathroom door, she had heard everything I had said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*She's pushing to make me a citizen.*</i> I heard her think. <i>*At long last, I going to be a citizen!*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I heard her starting to cry and I opened the door, still looking pale. \"I... I just found out from my lawyer what mom and dad had been doing to you, Marisol.\" I said, crying myself. \"It's not right... so I'm fixing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisol cried freely as she gave me a warm hug. <i>*Now I know I've been raising her right.*</i> I heard her think. <i>*She's doing what feels is right to her heart, not her wallet.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Marisol, could you help me apply for this job?\" I asked. \"I'm a little nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisol smiled, looking at the way I had dressed for the interview. \"Well, first you need to understand that, to an employer, you need them not the other way around as they can hire anyone so a good first impression is needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense.\" I said. \"Am I dressed right to make that good impression?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisol giggled. <i>*At least she's trying.*</i> \"A mini skirt and tank top will get a boy's attention but not that of an employer.\" she said, smiling. \"Come with me, I have a few outfits that might work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Marisol to her bedroom where she opened her closet to reveal a small wardrobe of clothing. \"You have so little clothing.\" I said, raising a hand to my mouth. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisol shrugged. \"I rarely get out so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing up again, I made a decision and took Marisol by the hand, surprising her. \"You are like a mother to me, Marisol, my real mom and dad have been totally unfair to you.\" I paused, smiling at her. \"It's time I make them pay up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisol turned white, pulling away from me. \"Caitlin, I could get fired over this....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"Not after my lawyer reminds them that they can get sued for everything they own by denying your right to citizenship after all these years.\" I said, confidently. \"Can we say P.R. nightmare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisol grinned, tears forming once again. \"In that case, I wouldn't mind some new clothes....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled and again took Marisol's hand. \"Let's get Trish and make this a girls day out!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No! Why would you think that? And what does that have to do with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying,\" Dr. Hansen explained, \"that your symptoms match what we call a sympathetic pregnancy. Usually, the explanation is that a father-to-be's emotional investment in his partner's pregnancy is so great, that he shares many of the symptoms of pregnancy. He experiences morning sickness, he starts putting on weight around the midsection, he may even find himself lactating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However,\" the doctor continued, \"if there's no mother-to-be in the picture, there must be another explanation for your symptoms. We'll take some blood and run it through the lab, see what we can find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, after the samples were taken, Brad began thinking about Trish.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following morning, my first day of work at Macy's, I got up early and showered before getting dressed. Once I was ready, I checked the clock and found I had an hour before I had to be at work so I walked to Trish's room to find the door open and her already dressed. \"didn't you sleep at all?\" I asked, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I slept.\" said Trish, looking drained. \"But I kept getting woken up by the sounds of a baby crying and cooing in my head.\" she yawned. \"I think the stress is starting to get to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*It's not the stress*</i> came Amara's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish jumped, looking about. \"Who said that!?\" she asked, knowing it was not your thought voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I am Amara, the sentinel that lives within Caitlin.* replied Amara, calmly. <i>*The sentinel within your unborn child is named Tamera, all sentinels are female. What you were hearing was Tamera learning to talk, through your mental connection to her, a connection that will help you keep your daughter safe.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish sighed. \"Well, at least I now know what to shop for.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara giggled. <i>*We came from another world, one that is no longer there.*</i> she said. <i>*Very long story short, the women are the intellectuals, the males are the brawn. Our spacecraft crash landed on your planet centuries ago, all the men died to preserve ours but their efforts were not enough.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" asked Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*In a desperate effort to survive, we each basically reduced ourselves to living energy and teleported ourselves into random people throughout the globe.*</i> replied Amara. <i>*Our species lives up to ten thousand years or more but we are not immortal, our lives are directly linked to our host so we reproduce with them.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In return for their 'room and board', they provide wisdom and protection to their host.\" I added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish nodded, looking more relaxed. \"I do not fear you.\" she said. \"I was just concerned about my child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Your daughter is safe and will be kept that way.*</i> said Amara. <i>*I must rest now, good day.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Trish and smiled. \"At least now you know your baby will come out healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish smiled. \"That takes a lot of worry off my shoulders.\" she said, honestly. \"We better get you to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later, I was standing on a display mount, frozen in a casual pose, wearing a bikini swim suit. Through self training, I no longer blushed, thinking about the fact I was standing in front of people in a store wearing a bikini as it was my job to be a living mannequin. <i>\"This is actually fun.\"</i> I thought to myself. <i>\"The things that people think in this town.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne boy, no older than twelve, walked passed with his older sister and looked up at me. I heard the girl's thoughts and nearly laughed but I remained perfectly still and silent. <i>\"If Jason makes one more joke about girls' clothes, I swear he'll be wearing them!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hours passed, I gained much practice in shutting out all thoughts, focusing on one person's thoughts, and just allowing all thoughts to pour in without giving me a headache. Then, just before my lunch break, I saw Alyssa Vance walk into the lingerie department with her older sister, Beth and their mom. I innerly winced, knowing her mom was confined to a wheel chair due to a car accident. I discretely looked within her and was pleased to find she was healthy but sad that I could nothing to help her regain her mobility to walk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I watched them, I noticed that Alyssa, formerly, Gary, looked far more feminine than the last time I saw him/her and my curiosity rose. Still, I focused on keeping their thoughts out of my mind for the moment and I listened to them talk about swimsuits. Suddenly, Beth turned to me and nudged Alyssa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lyssa, check this out.\" said Beth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa walked over from the swimsuits she was looking at and looked at me as well for a moment before blurting out, \"Holy cow! It looks like Cait Spenser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except she's got hair,\" Beth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa nodded. \"And she keeps her nose higher in the air.\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all I had to stop myself from wincing as I had teased Alyssa in the past but then, she surprised me..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, girls,\" lectured their mom. \"I thought I raised you two better than to say mean things about people, behind their backs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they stopped, I saw a dream like smile form on Alyssa's facer as I heard her think, <i>*I wonder what Cait would say, if she knew I had finally turned into a real girl?*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that thought, my curiosity got the best of me and I looked inside of her. I was stunned to find that she was indeed a real, true girl! Somehow, she had actually managed to completely change her gender. I inwardly smiled, very happy for her.  Wanting to make up for, at least, some teasing, I thought back, <i>*Congratulations.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa stopped in her tracks and looked around. Seeing no one, she left to pay for her selections. It was not for another hour before I was finally allowed to clock out for lunch. \"So, how is your first day? asked my manage, Mr. Erwin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was... educational.\" I replied, to his confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went smoothly and I returned home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He now looked to be about five months along. Other changes troubled him more. His cheekbones were more pronounced, and his lips were fuller. His eyes were changing color, from green to brown. His hair was getting longer and darker, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your 'condition' keeps proceeding at this rate,\" the doctor continued, \"it looks like you'll be full-term by the end of the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows?\" his mom added. \"Maybe you can go back to school, right on schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assuming I want to.\" Brad flinched as his voice cracked. Would his voice get higher, too, to match the rest of his changes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I can say for sure,\" said the doctor, \"is that whatever's happening to Brad looks like pregnancy. However, ultrasound shows that there is no fetus. I can't say what's caused his condition, or the accompanying transformation. We'll keep him here, under observation, until this process completes itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother and doctor left the room. Brad got out of bed, and walked over to the bathroom mirror. Looking at his changing face, he saw a distinct resemblance to Trish. <i>Trish,</i> he thought, <i>what did you do to me? How?</i></span></div></div>",

How did this happen? Calm down, Clem. It's not like she's going to talk to you.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't resist seeing how he'd react, so I walked up to where he was sitting, and took an empty seat. \"Hi, Clem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, uh, hi,\" he sputtered. \"What, uh what brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heading home,\" I replied. \"I picked up a job here, for after school and weekends.

However it happened, she's got her lifelong dream, in a better way than she could have done it otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad for her, too.

He's a great guy, but I don't know how he'd react, if he found out about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you said, he's a great guy. Give him the benefit of the doubt, before you write him off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. On the other hand, I just broke up with Brad.

We-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA burst of gunfire took out the skylight, interrupting the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all grabbed what cover we could under the tables. I reached out for the mind of the gunman, and received, *<i>Now what/Kill them/Kill them all/You must kill them</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to contact him telepathically. *<i>Who are you? Why are you doing this?</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response came, *<i>I'm Jeremy/Ignore her/Silence her/Kill her/Find her and kill her</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had never encountered a mind like this. It seemed as if he was listening to voices, but who besides me could be talking to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI needed help to figure this out. Remembering how well Grace did in school, I grabbed her head, to let her in on what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace's eyes flew wide as she began hearing Jeremy's thoughts. *<i>What's going on? Why is this happening?</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>It's a long story,</i>* I replied. *<i>We can hear his thoughts, but I'm having trouble understanding him. Can you help?</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace tried, but we kept getting the voices telling Jeremy to kill us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I remembered that Beth did well in school, too. I'd never tried linking four minds before, but I had nothing to lose by trying, so I grabbed her, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, we had no better luck. Then, an unexpected voice came through. *<i>The voices he hears are not true, daughters. There is something wrong inside his brain, and it is producing the voices he hears telling him to kill.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth seemed to recognize and trust the voice, so she \"spoke\" to Jeremy. *<i>Jeremy, you're not well. There's something wrong with you, and it's producing the voices telling you to kill.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy responded, *<i>They say they'll go away once I do this/Shut up/Stop talking to her/Kill her</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>They won't. They're inside your mind, and they'll just keep telling you to do things like these, over and over. If you surrender, the authorities can give you medication to help you, and stop the voices.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, Jeremy just stood there, with the voices constantly telling him to kill. I realized I could understand why he had done this. If I constantly heard voices drowning out my own thoughts, telling me to kill, I might think about it, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jeremy placed his guns on the ground, and kicked them away. Grace, Beth, and I breathed the same sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mall security took control of the situation, I released my grip on the girls. Garth asked, \"What just happened?\"</span></div></div>",

I tried to reason with him, but I had trouble getting him to distinguish my 'voice' from all the others. So I needed Grace and Beth to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you can do that?\" Lyssa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a few days now,\" I replied. \"I found out what the people around me really thought about me, and I've been working to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" I said, looking at the others, \"I've got a question for you: Do you guys really have these powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*We granted our hosts great power in exchange for 'room and board'.*</i> calmly, said an unfamiliar voice in my mind. <i>*Elder symbionts do not do this unless necessary, as in your case, Caitlin.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened as I somehow knew the voice came from Garth and I heard the voice again, speaking in Garth's mind now. <i>*Are you ready, Garth?*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth smiled then suddenly grew in size to that of an Olympian weight lifter. My surprised expression turned to shock, looking at his new form, but I relaxed when I quickly returned to normal. \"I can get a lot bigger, if I wanted.\" he said, blushing. \"Only, I'm afraid of losing control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here.\" nodding, I said. \"I don't want to hurt anyone with a 'bad thought'.\" I then turned to Grace. \"I got a feel of yours and Beth's power when we connected, a type of super total recall, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that.\" smiling, Grace replied. \"Basically, I can learn anything in minutes rather than days and master anything in hours rather than years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have something similar.\" agreeing, Beth added. she blushed. \"So far, I seem to be able to find anything I am looking for and instantly know how to use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is impressive.\" I said, smiling. \"What of you Alyssa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa smiled then seemed to vanish from sight. Startled, I looked around then jumped to find Lyssa standing right behind me. \"Teleportation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheer speed.\" sighing, Lyssa replied. \"That's what got me into trouble, I tracked boulevard bon-bons up the side of Garth's house when I went to visit him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled slightly, hearing that. \"You went passed old man Crane's house, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa blinked. \"How did you?\" she shook her head, remembering my power to read minds. \"What does that have to do with what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been illegally using his Saint Bearnard's droppings to fertilize his lawn.\" I explained, wincing. \"Its been seeping onto the sidewalks, giving anyone who walks or runs passed real dung covered shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that explains how it was tracked all the way home.\" said Lyssa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, I looked around, nervous before seeing that Grace and Beth were doing the same. We were being watched and what was worse, I could not pin point where they were. \"We'd better get what we need and leave.\" her voice quivering slightly, Beth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm calling off for the rest of the day.\" quickly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Garth seemed confused but it soon hit him. A nagging feeling we were all being watched by someone, hiding somewhere. Grace came close to Garth, worried. \"All of us getting this feeling at the same time can't be a coincidence.\" fearful, she said. \"My vote is to forget what we came for and leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Security is tight, since that kid went on a mini rampage.\" serious, Garth said. \"Whoever we're sensing, they won't try anything now but I say we leave as a group.\" he then turned to me. \"That means you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded then pulled out my cellphone. \"James, I need to be picked up.\" my voice fearful, I said. \"I'm bringing four friends along...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to all, two blurry men were watching us from a distance. \"That's them, Butch.\" said one. \"At least the kids of two of the original members.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch grunted. \"They know we are here, Hank.\" he muttered. \"That friend of theirs seems to have some type of mental radar, we will have to get imaginative to obtain our targets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men watched as...</span></div></div>",

I nodded to confirm the orders, adding, \"Evasive maneuvers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fasten your seat belts,\" James replied as he closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I closed the partition between the driver and the passenger area, we were underway. James could make the limo go faster than most people could imagine. I knew from personal experience that he would be able to hide from any pursuers, even with such a large vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we trust the driver?\" Garth asked. I couldn't tell if he was nervous from being spied on, of if James' driving skills had him scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the most part,\" I assured them. \"I haven't told him about my powers. But he's been working for my family for years. He was originally hired to keep an eye on my Aunt Liv.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Liv?\" Grace asked. \"Why did she need to be watched?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what little they tell me,\" I replied, \"she was something of a black sheep in the family. Hung out with the wrong crowd, married beneath her, that sort of thing. Of course, we're old money, so those terms could mean anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we brushed debris off of ourselves, I took off my wig to inspect it. As I did so, I noticed something that hadn't occurred to me before. Lyssa had been right to say that I'd looked down my nose at them before. Now that I was looking them in the face, they looked somehow familiar, though I couldn't place it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did that happen?\" Beth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered that Grace and Beth hadn't been with Garth and Lyssa when I showed them my hair loss earlier. \"A few days before I became telepathic. Brad and I got accidentally dosed with plutonium. I lost my hair and started reading minds. Brad... he's recovering, but it's taken him longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ironic, too.

Did you hear what happened at the mall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"I know about what happened. At least I wasn't the first one to interrupt your <i>novelas</i> today.\" We both chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, dear? Did you get hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. Nobody got hurt, and the gunman is in custody. However, something else came up, and I'll be spending some time with some other kids my age. I'll be back by supper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so long as you're not hurt, little one, I'm glad for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hasta luego</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I hung up, I knew I should let Trish know what was going on. However, the phone could cause problems in the hospital. Luckily, I had another way to contact her. \"Give me a few minutes,\" I said, and closed my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got tuned in to Trish's brainwaves quickly. *<i>Change of plans, girlfriend. I had to get away from the mall There was a shooting, and I think some of us may be watched.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>Thanks for the tip,</i>* Trish replied. *<i>Brad's in \"labor\" right now.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis I had to see, if not for myself, then through someone else's eyes. I tuned in Dr. Hagen's mind and \"hopped\" over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite a sight, as Trish was assisting what looked for all the world like a nine months' pregnant version of herself in a process that must have felt like actually giving birth. Even from this distance, I could hear Brad thinking, *<i>I'm sorry I treated Trish so bad. If this is what she'll be going through, I wish I'd been better to her.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I picked up Dr. Hagen's thoughts, and they weren't funny or pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>I </i>must <i>find out what has caused this boy's condition.

Garth, Grace, your cousin, Susan, is on the way with her parents, as well. Caitlin, is there someone you'd like me to call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James will be back later,\" I replied, \"and Marisol knows where I am. My folks are away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that I no longer regarded these kids as my social inferiors, I felt a different wall beginning to form: Envy. I was jealous of the close-knit relationship they all had with their parents. Half the time, when my folks were off on their pleasure trips, I had no idea where they were. When they were home, my mom wasn't really there, anyway. She'd long ago figured out that she wouldn't get a hangover if she drank enough that she was still drunk when she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a question,\" Grace said, pulling me out of my own thoughts. \"Who was that woman who spoke to us, when we were linked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Beatriz,\" Beth replied. \"She's something of a spirit guide. Sometimes, when I'm looking for something, she gives me an idea of where to look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why'd she call us her daughters?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth shrugged. \"Maybe we're related. Iole, Lyssa's and my distant ancestor, had 14 children, so there's bound to be a healthy representation of her in the gene pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense,\" Grace replied. \"I read that 1 in 200 people can trace their ancestry to Genghis Khan.\" She turned to me. \"How much do you know about your Aunt Liv?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much,\" I answered. \"I once had my lawyer try to track her down through her share of the inheritance, but she's hardly touched it. What could she be saving it for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave some to an old friend,\" a voice responded. \"The kids are going to college. And I had planned to pay for Lyssa's surgery, but it turned out she didn't need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all turned. The Vances had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I realized what was so familiar about Beth and Lyssa. If I'd let my hair grow its natural color, I would look a lot like them. They were my cousins. \"You... <i>You're</i> Aunt Liv?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah,\" she replied. \"I never liked the name Liv.\"</span></div></div>",

Once it had parked by the road, A tall, slender man with sand brown hair and blue eyes stepped out. With him was an equally tall but muscular woman with long auburn hair and green eyes. Almost immediately, my mind told me she was Ted's sister, Amanda Tanner. Coming out of the back was a small girl with long brown hair and blue eyes, I recognized as Susan from school. \"Are we late?\" walking up to us, Susan's dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, Geo.\" shaking his hand, Ted said. \"Good to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" releasing Ted, Geo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed then hugged Amanda. \"Thank you for coming over, sis.\" smiling, he said. \"I just wish it was under much better circumstances.\" he sighed. \"Any word from Steve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda winced. \"His daughter is in the hospital.\" sadly, she replied. \"She's not well, from what I hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shook his head, looking worried. \"We'll have to hold the meeting without him then.\" wincing, he said. \"Everyone inside, we have a lot of ground to cover and, I fear, very little time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone was inside and sitting down, I turned to Sarah. \"I know this is not the place but... why were you called the black sheep of the family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah giggled slightly. \"When I was your age, the Spencer family liked to play by their own rules.\" looking at me, she explained. \"They did not care for the police or for lawyers unless it worked in their favor. That said, they wanted me to marry into the Tanner family, to increase the family's wealth.\" she motioned to Amanda then added, \"Only my friend had eyes for Geo and I had eyes for Frank Vance... a lawyer who worked for the police department.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine your parents didn't take it well.\" wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shook her head. \"My dad walked me down the aisle to give me away.\" sadly, she replied. \"Only he did not stay for the reception.\" she sighed. \"He and my mother accepted my husband but not until they were on their death bed, wanting to make peace before they left this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cold.\" tearing up, I said. \"I'm so sorry, aunt Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault, sweetie.\" said Sarah. \"Believe me, my parents, they deeply cared for my husband and I.\" she then smiled. \"They wanted to make the man who put me in this chair vanish of the face of the Earth. If Mr Jones had not gotten to him first, they would have made it happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get started.\" interrupting my conversation, Geo said with a cold tone. \"As you all know, most of us were members of the Problem Child Gang you kids like to read about. Our last mission was against a man named Sykes who we believed was the bottom of a drug and weapon running cartel.\" he sighed. \"Unfortunately, he turned out to be just the opposite. He was a war monger drug lord, the top dog of the cartel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face and those of my friends paled, hearing that. \"Was it this Sykes and his men who nearly killed you all?\" almost whispering, Garth asked. \"Or was it the Agency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Agency was after Sykes, just as we were.\" seriously Ted replied. \"Sykes knew they were there and that we were hunting him down. He blew the building he was held up in, just as he made his escape.\" he shook his head. \"We barely escaped with our lives only to find the Agency became... interested in us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean interested in you?\" shaking, Lyssa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I explained earlier, we had our talents.\" looking at Lyssa, Sarah said. \"The Agency was in the business of brainwashing children with such talents to use them, make them do their dirty work so to gain wealth and power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only were we forced to flee for our lives from an exploding building, we had to escape the clutches of an underground terrorist organization.\" tearing up, Geo said. \"We thought we were invincible, we were not. We thought this was behind us... its been chasing us all along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You- You think this cartel or this Agency may have interest in us.\" piecing things together, I said, turning pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeo nodded. \"That is why we are holding this meeting, my dear.\" he said. \"The Agency has resurfaced and from what I have heard, many of you are already being watched by someone.\" he clinched a fist. \"We can not take any chances or make any assumptions, we already made that mistake once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I gasped, getting a vision like I received at the mall. My lips trembled, seeing a number of armed men charging into the estate. \"No... they're outside of my house!\" hoarsely, I screamed. Panicked and worried for Marisol's safety, I threw my hands against my temples and sent her a desperate mental warning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marisol, you are in danger! RUN...

There is an underground organization, known as The Agency, that forcibly makes use of such talented children like Caitlin Spencer and my children, Garth and Grace.\" he sighed. \"It's a long story, which we will explain but in short, I believe those men were after Caitlin and they would have used you to get her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I see...\" said Marisol. she turned to Caitlin. \"You- You summoned me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking very pale, I nodded. \"You're like a mother to me.\" feeling weak, I said. \"I- I couldn't let anyone hurt you. I... I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the world around me vanished as I felt myself fall out of my seat. The last I heard was Marisol. \"Caitlin!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have one of her friends with me, we need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed cautiously opened the door and peered out before allowing a tall and muscular man with short sand blond hair and blue eyes to enter with Travis Greenway and Megan from school following behind. Travis was a tall and muscular boy with jet black hair and blue eyes. Megan was a shy petite girl with blond hair and green eyes. Both seemed white as a sheet and they staggered slightly as they entered.

I did not have to be a mind reader to know Marisol was not going to put up with male pride. \"Sit... down.\" with a firm tone, Marisol said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis sat down, his expression softening. Seeing him blush slightly, I surmised that he was not used to anyone being so forceful with him. \"Yes, ma'am.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you again, old friend.\" returning his sidearm to its holster, Ted said. \"Any idea who tried to kidnap your daughter and her friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They weren't professionals.\" quickly, Steve said. \"I'm guessing they were sent by Sykes. he motioned to Megan and Travis. \"These two are just now discovering their 'gifts'.

The house itself was a three story home with sparse windows and heavy double doors in the front and back. My mom had it built shortly after aunt Sarah was attacked, leaving her in a wheel chair for the rest of her life.

You and Caitlin always did make such a cute couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not a couple anymore,\" I replied. \"I found out Brian was cheating on me with Trish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned her newfound steely gaze to Brian. \"Is this true, young man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" he replied, hanging his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The situation's been resolved,\" Ms. Hawk added. \"We're going to look after Trish and her baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Mom regained some of her composure. \"Will you all excuse us? I'd like to speak with my daughter, on a private matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they left the room, Mom said, \"You said you've been hearing voices, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"The plutonium opened part of my mind. I can now communicate telepathically. Sometimes, I can see a little bit into the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive. There was an incident at the mall earlier today. With the help of some new friends, I put a stop to it.\" I paused. \"I know what's behind the voice you hear, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI directed my thoughts to Amatra. *<i>Perhaps you should tell her.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>Hello, Mrs. Spencer,</i>* Amatra called. *<i>You are the host of my mother. I'm trying to communicate with her, but she's very weak. Do you know of anything that could be affecting her?</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was almost floored. \"I-I heard that! What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>She's a symbiont,</i>* I explained telepathically. *<i>Her name's Amatra. She speaks to me, just like your symbiont speaks to you. Only you've been responding by drinking. I think the residual effects are dulling her abilities.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next took me completely by surprise. I'd never seen my mother this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe collapsed into my arms, sobbing. \"Cait... Baby, I don't want to drink any more. But I-I don't know how to be sober.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hugged her as tightly as I could. \"I'll contact Aunt Sarah. She'll know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Aunt Sarah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister.\"</span></div></div>",

Dad was always gallivanting, but I just chalked it up to my parents' hard-partying lifestyle. Now, it looked as though my dad had a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis problem, though, was that secrets were no longer necessarily safe from me.</span></div></div>",

What do you need to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much about you as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Barns gave me a guided tour of her memories, with stops at the mystery pregnancy she experienced, her reunion with her daughter, and the accident that gave her her shrinking powers. \"It's nice to know I've got something in common with you, Ms. Barns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"My aunt's name is Sarah.

Moving through Sarah's memories of her childhood, I hoped to find a happy memory to 'cut', remold and 'paste' over the programming memories and cure her. While searching, I came across a strong memory of her meeting Ted, face to face in an alley in the city of Rome. At the time, Ted had used the name Tex 'the mighty' to hide his true identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily distracted, I focused on it and found that, as it was Sarah's memories, I saw the events through her eyes. The only problem was, because I was experiencing her memory, I found myself actually feeling the past world around me as if I were actually there. Unknown to me, it was a trap, set up to stop any deprogramming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Careful, Cait!*</i> came Amatra's voice in warning. <i>*Don't get lost in Sarah's head!*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI barely heard Amatra's warning as the memory engulfed me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We meet again, my mysterious friend.\" staring Sarah down, Tex said. \"I'm sad to see you working for the bad guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad guys?\" tilting her head to the side, Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this was happening, I felt my own head tilt, not knowing that the brainwashing affecting Sarah was starting its work on my own mind. Fortunately, my powers were strong enough to hold it at bay, for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This boy is of no use to us, Kayo.\" stepping up behind Sarah, a tall man in a business suit said. \"Kill him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my surprise, I felt myself raising a rifle in my hands. I could feel its weight as I pulled back the safety and touched the trigger, leveling it with Tex's heart. Only, I did not fire, I could not get myself to pull the trigger as Tex looked at me with an unfamiliar fear in his eyes. \"I- I'm trying to obey, Jon.\" apologetically, I heard myself say. \"I want to obey but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kayo, kill him, now!\" sternly, Jon ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to him!\" regaining his composure, Tex said. \"You are better than this, better than him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my hands beginning to shake, a feeling of uncertainty filling my mind. \"I- I must obey.\" stammering, I said. \"Jon is my master, I am his slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are <i>not</i> a slave!\" roared Tex, startling me. \"You are a confused little girl being toyed with by a sick man who uses you to murder people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut him up!\" pointing at Tex, Jon yelled. \"He is trying to turn us on each other!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, I felt my hands shake. \"Mommy... daddy....\" tears forming, I whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Jon kill them to get you?\" taking a step forward, Tex asked. \"Drop the rifle and I'll <i>rattle</i> his bones for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my hands rise up again, my finger on the rifle trigger. \"I must defend Jon!\" blankly, I yelled. \"Do not come closer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't win, boy.\" smirking, Jon said. \"Kayo is ours and nothing you can say will turn her against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex's eyes narrowed to angry slits. \"Nothing, huh?\" hissing, he asked. \"Kayo, who killed mommy and daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, I felt my hands quiver only I too felt tears running down my face. \"Jon... did.\" slowly, tearfully, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why protect someone who killed those you love the most?\" taking another step closer, Tex asked. \"Drop the rifle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kayo, for the last time, kill the boy or I will kill you both!\" impatient, Jon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room, Garth and Grace exchanged concerned looks. \"What's gotten into Cait?\" asked Grace. \"She's acting more and more like she's reliving a painful memory in Sarah's mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're asking me?\" shrugging, Garth asked. \"You're the one with the supercharged brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a handgun materialized into my hand and I turned to Garth, leveling it at his left shoulder. Everyone in the room froze as a sad smile formed onto my face. With a glassy look in my eyes, I said, \"I am sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I pulled the trigger...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Good thing the gun you teleported wasn't loaded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right,\" I said. \"Ms. Barns still has her programming. I took her back through her memories, and stumbled onto it.

The feedback loop from her unloaded gun knocked her out and freed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to be gentle with her, Chief,\" I begged. \"She's as much a victim as you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to remember that, Cait. Thank you for the attempt. What do you want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go a few blocks away, and arrange for my driver to pick me up. See you guys at school tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you wouldn't rather spend the night here?\" Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"I've got some personal stuff to check up on. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace smiled. \"You did what you could.\" sounding positive, she said. \"And the old Caitlin Spencer wouldn't have done half as much for us. See you at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed unlocked the handcuffs. As Cait stood up and rubbed her wrists, Ted asked, \"What was her trigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was 'Kiss Kiss, my dear',\" I replied. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea,\" was his answer. \"I'll have the kids tell you about it tomorrow, if it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even a hint?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"Let's just say Hagen wouldn't be the first person I've dealt with who turned out to be too clever for his own good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you leave, Cait,\" now smiling, Lyssa said. \"There is something about Jess, err, Clem you need to know about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clem?\" curious, I asked. \"What about him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a shape shifter.\" beaming, Lyssa replied. \"He also has a crush on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know about the crush but...\" downhearted, I said. \"Why would he date a hairless cue-ball like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa giggled, confusing me, as she quickly lead me to Jess, who was now Clem again. \"You two have the same secret.\" standing between him and I, Lyssa said. \"I think it will help you both to know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either of us could react, she tore off our wigs, revealing both of our flawless bald heads. Both Clem and I gasped, seeing each other then smiled. After a moment, Clem seemed to snap out of his trance and quickly took out a notepad, scribbling down a telephone number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... call me later?\" offering me the piece of paper, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso snapping out of my trance, I shyly accepted the phone number and jotted down my own, offering it as well. \"Um... you call me, okay?

Any half-brothers or half-sisters who might turn up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been quite careful,\" he replied. \"As for Harrison Blackwell,... that name used to be mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing working for the Sykes operation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not important. Before I met your mother, I decided to skim some money from payments I was supposed to be collecting. I figured I could pass it off as skimming done by one of the guys I was reporting to, either Mayweather or Sykes. I picked Sykes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't know he was the boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until after I'd done it. Needless to say, I needed a new identity, quickly, and your mother's insistence that I take her last name fit in perfectly.\" He paused. \"Are there any other questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"Ripping off Sykes was a stupid move, but I won't turn you in. However, you should consider cooperating with the authorities. Just avoid any dealings with a group called the Agency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was my turn to collect my thoughts. \"I can't advise you on what to tell Mom. I don't know how she'll take it. But I do know that you need to call off your relationships with these women. Even if Mom should miss it, I'll know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. And, Daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made sure I had eye contact with him. *<i>I'm a lot harder to keep secrets from, since the plutonium.</i>* With that, I went up to bed.</span></div></div>",

Normally, I would have had my entire wardrobe planned out for the fall by a week before school started. With all that had happened to me, however, such things as fashion had almost slipped my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a while, but I got an outfit together. Then I put my hair on and went downstairs to breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I got downstairs, Trish was helping Marisol fix breakfast. \"Morning, Cait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Trish,\" I replied. \"Sorry I wasn't down earlier, Marisol. I lost track of time getting dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, <i>chica</i>,\" Marisol replied. \"You're excited about the first day of school, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I was talking to Garth, Lyssa, and the others outside the school, when I heard a loud noise. Suddenly, Lyssa fell over, with a hole in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth looked up, there was another noise, and he fell down dead, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the realization of what was happening sank in, panic filled the schoolyard, as more of my friends dropped like flies. I chanced a look across the street, and saw a man on the roof of a nearby building. Flashes of light matched up to the shots, and I realized that he was the one shooting.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cait, what is it?\" Trish asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of Trish's voice, I realized I was back at the breakfast table. No, that's not right: I hadn't left the table. I had had a vision of an attack at the school, one that would kill my friends. I immediately sent out a telepathic warning to Garth, Grace, Lyssa, Beth, and Sue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cait,\" Trish asked, \"what is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a vision,\" I explained. \"Somebody's going to do some shooting at the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy smartphone went off, so I answered it. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cait, it's Chief Jones. Is what my kids are telling me true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, someone will be on the roof of the apartment building across from the school, the one with the coffee shop on the ground floor, and that person is going to shoot a whole bunch of kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have less than 59 minutes. Make them count.\" As I hung up, I realized that all the dead kids in my vision were the children of the Problem Child Gang. Was that a coincidence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about that, Cait?\" Trish asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's what I saw.\" I suppose I couldn't blame her. After all, now I was seeing two wolves in the schoolyard, snarling at kids. That didn't seem likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should stay home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"The chief will have it under control, now that he knows where to be. We'll be fine. We weren't even among the injured.\"</span></div></div>",

And why did I now keep seeing wolves prowling the schoolyard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got to the schoolyard, we were met by Lyssa and Garth. \"It's okay,\" Garth said. \"Dad's got a team in position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just act like everything's normal,\" added Lyssa, \"and the other kids won't have any reason to believe otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were soon approached by a young boy I'd seen at the clubhouse. As he got closer, a scan of his mind revealed that he was really an adult. \"Hi, guys,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cocked an eyebrow. \"Aren't you a little old to be hanging out at the schoolyard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did... oh, yeah, Sarah told me about you,\" he said. \"My name's Todd. I'm Sarah's fiance. We heard on the scanner that there was something going on here today, so I came to keep an eye on things. I figured a teenage boy wouldn't attract as much attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of Sarah, how is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fine,\" Garth said. \"Once you were gone, they used the trigger phrase against itself. Hagen will never control her again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Trish screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we looked to see why, we saw a pair of wolves, snarling and snapping at every student they approached. My second vision had somehow come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we tried to figure out what was going on, I started to pick up something strange. I was reading thoughts, but I wasn't sure whose. With a start, I realized I was reading the wolves' minds. *<i>Garth,</i>* I warned, *<i>these wolves... They're</i> human!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get everybody inside,\" he said. \"I'll handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we herded the panicked students into the building, I began thinking about the wolf=people's thoughts.

I had originally dyed my hair because I didn't like the light brown I was born with. Now that I had learned about my family, I started giving serious thought to getting a wig in my natural color. <i>If nothing else,</i> I thought, <i>it might cheer Lyssa up when I see her after work.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was dressed again, James drove me to Macy's. \"I'm going to visit a store when I'm done,\" I told him. \"I'll call you when I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I reached the office where I'd leave my belongings, Clem was already there. \"I hope I'm not late, Clem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right on time,\" said the manager. \"Let me tell you what we're looking for from you. You'll be modeling our late fall looks. As you stand on the display, do not look at each other or touch each other. Remember, parents will be making the decisions on what to buy, and we want them to be able to see you as stand-ins for their own children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we got into our separate changing areas, I caught Clem thinking, *<i>I wish she hadn't said that.

And, for the record, I feel the same way about you.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe took our places at the display. Clem thought, *<i>Cool.

To my surprise, though, he seemed as interested in the wigs for girls as for boys. *<i>Wonder how this would look on Jennifer?</i>* he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>Who's Jennifer?</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped in surprise, then explained, *<i>I'm a shape-shifter.

She wants me to be her a little more often.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at the thought of Clem wrapped around his little sister's finger. When the clerk returned, I pointed out a wig closer to Clem's hair and said, \"I think I'd like one of those, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and said, \"Just let me see to your friend, and I can pick up both.\" Then she thought, *<i>Great, a wig for every personality.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClem got his new wig, and we paid for our purchases. Once we were out of the store, I gave him the second wig I picked out. \"Jennifer should look lovely in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.

Does she think you own the store, and she'll be fired if she screws up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed, wondering how to explain it. \"Imagine that you didn't know what telepathy was, and a girl my age walked in and started arguing with nobody. What would you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe implications sank in, and Clem gingerly touched my hand. \"She thinks you're... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, and took his hand. \"And I can't tell her she's wrong, 'cause I don't know who she'd tell. We've got enough problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrived at Lyssa's house. Mrs. Vance opened the door for us. \"Cait, good to see you.

I was surprised to see Lyssa's two year old little brother waddling on the ceiling. \"I have fun,\" the kid replied. \"I wike this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Typical boy.\"</i> smiling, I thought. <i>\"Trying to get away with everything he can.\"</i> \"Sam,\" gently, I said, \"you don't look so good. How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked to her to reply, but started shaking his head instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll feel better on the ground,\" holding my arms under him, I said. \"Come down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam floated down into my arms. \"You had too much blood going to your head,\" smiling, I explained to him. \"It was making you dizzy. Don't do that again. You might get hurt, and we don't want that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI placed Sam into Mrs. Vance's lap, just as Lyssa came downstairs. \"Hey, guys,\" she said. \"Wow, Cait. With that new color, you look a lot like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that. \"That's why I picked it out. How you doing, cuz?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot better,\" she said, hugging me. Turning to Clem, she said, \"I had quite a day today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I hear,\" Clem replied. \"What all happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief Jones and his men took down that guy who was going to shoot at us. Turns out he was Clarence Mayweather, one of the guys the original Problem Child Gang tangled with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have quite the history,\" Mrs. Vance said. \"He was the one who put me in this chair, trying to kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that,\" Lyssa continued, \"I got my first kiss from Garth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations,\" Clem said. \"But you didn't get sent home because of a kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa's expression turned serious. \"A couple girls at school got jealous of all the attention I was getting, so they pulled my pants down in P.E.

I saw a man with longish brown hair and wild green eyes standing on what could only be described as a large floating platform. I recognized him from the graphic novels as Sykes, 'the immortal one'. He was wearing an odd all leather armor than made him look like an actor from some medieval reenactment. Standing behind him, on the floating platform were a number of masked men with others behind him on four other platforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart jumped upon seeing the platforms were flying towards the mansion headquarters of the original Problem Child Gang. I wanted to yell out a warning, do anything to stop what was happening but I could do nothing but watch in horror as Sykes took what looked like a rocket launcher from one of his followers and fired a strange laser beam at the mansion. The second the laser hit, the entire mansion exploded into flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSykes then laughed maniacally as he yelled, \"Burn, you little brats! Feel the wrath of the immortal one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up screaming, bolting up in bed. Sweat poured off of me as I trembled, struggling to catch my breath. Marisol ran in and saw me crying into my hands. \"What is it, child!?\" quickly sitting beside me, she asked. \"Tell me what happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to wail as I pulled Marisol into a hug. \"Oh, Marisol, it was horrible!\" crying, I said. \"I'm praying it was only a nightmare!\" I then explained the dream I had to her. \"If its not a dream, Sykes is back and he's stronger than ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisol gulped. \"I read those novels.\" softly, she whispered. \"If Sykes is back.... I have to call Chief Jones!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mar- Marisol, should I go to school today?\" shaken, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see what Chief Jones says.\" breaking the hug, Marisol said. \"Wait here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisol left the room, grabbing a telephone. I tried to hear what was being said but, in my emotional state, I found that I could not access my telepathic powers. <i>\"Calm down.\"</i> desperately, I thought to myself. <i>\"Calm down.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Marisol entered the room with a small suitcase. \"Start packing, Caitlin.\" firmly but kindly, she said. \"We are moving to the substation, police orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- What about school?\" still shaken, I asked. \"I- I can't calm do-down enough to warn the- the others with my- my telepathy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be going to school today.\" serious, Marisol replied. \"But first, you need to tell Chief Jones exactly what you saw in your dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed and took the phone from Marisol and relayed the entire dream between shaken tears. When I was done, Ted spoke. \"I must ask you not to speak a word of this to anyone while at school.\" serious, he said. \"Let it wait until we can all regroup, is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" still crying, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to be brave, Miss Spencer.\" firmly but kindly, Ted said. \"You are no use to yourself or others if you can not get a grip and focus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I know, Mr Jones.\" sobbing, I said. \"I'm just... just scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be worried if you weren't.\" gently, Ted said. \"Please pull yourself together, I promise you everything will be alright, we beat Sykes before and we will again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ted ended the call and I gave the phone back to Marisol. \"I'll pack right now.\" shaking, I said. \"Can- Can you stay with me? I'll help you pack when I'm done... I just don't want to be alone right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisol nodded and began to help me pack while I desperately tried to calm myself....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I considered going to Principal Hendrick for advice but I was under 'police orders' not to talk to anyone about it at school. It was almost maddening, not being able to hear anyone's thoughts while I was still feeling extremely on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What am I going to do?\"</i> tearful, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*There is nothing you can do to stop what has been done.*</i> came Amatra's voice in my head. <i>*Focus your energies on what can be done.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's good to hear a voice in my head.\"</i> grinning slightly, I thought. <i>\"You've been silent lately.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*I don't like to be a 'chatter box'.*</i> with a giggle, Amatra replied. <i>*But, if spoken to, I do answer.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made me feel more comfortable and I was able to relax more. Slowly, people's thoughts began to trickle into my mind again. I blocked out most of them but, to a telepath, not hearing voices is disturbing, it made me feel very alone. I managed to make it to lunch, though I was still worried about the dream, and saw Lyssa talking to Lilith and her two Goth friends. In the beginning, I could not stand them but I slowly realized that I really knew nothing about them other than they were different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really should get to know them better.\" wincing, I whispered. \"After all, Lilith proved to be a good friend and I thought she was even creepier than them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, my phone rang and I quickly answered. It was Amber McReady, one of the girls who has attacked Lyssa the other day. \"Cait, I hope we are still on good terms because I really need you right now.\" shaken, Amber said. \"Something happened this morning, I- I can't explain it, you'll think I'm lying or crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately knew that Amber was genuinely scared and confused, which worried me, she was normally emotionally solid. \"I've heard and seen a lot of crazy things in the past few days, Amber.\" patiently, I replied. \"What is this about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not over the phone.\" her voice cracking, Amber replied. \"Can you come to my house? If its possible, please bring Lyssa with you... she might know something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" worried, I said. \"We'll be over shortly after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I ended the call and walked over to Lyssa, who was still with Lilith and her friends. As I came closer, I heard Mel speak. \"When Mom found out she was pregnant, my dad said he was heading out for a carton of cigarettes. That's the last anyone saw or heard from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced. <i>\"Ouch.\"</i>  Mel had never talked about her home life. It made me feel bad as I never knew she had it so rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Mel.\" wincing, Lilith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel sighed. \"It really hurt with the cancer. Mom said my college fund was eaten up by my medical bills. I don't know what I'm going to do when I finish high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, I remembered what Amatra had said to me earlier today. 'focus on what you can do...' I then knotted my jaws in decision and asked, \"How much do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone at the table turned to me, surprised as Mel asked, \"What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of schooling did you want after high school?\" serious, I asked. \"Find out how much it'll cost, and I'll pay for it. I didn't mean to interrupt, but I came to tell Lyssa something, and I couldn't help overhearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't do that,\" Mel said. \"I'd never be able to pay you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" rolling my eyes, I said. \"Do you know how many millions I'd have to give you before I started to feel it?\" I giggled slightly. \"Don't worry about the money. I've learned it's like fertilizer: Spread it around, and beautiful things come to light. Keep it in one place, and everyone knows where you live, but everybody thinks you stink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone at the table was floored by my generosity. The silence was almost killing me. Finally, Lyssa was the next to speak. \"What did you want to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. You're not going to believe this,\" looking at her, I said, \"but Amber McReady wants to see both of us after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" surprised, Lyssa asked. \"What does she want to see me for? Did she say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't say. Don't worry, though.\" confident, I replied. \"She knows we're cousins, and she knows I won't let anything happen to you, if I can stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa gave me a questioning look. I knew that her women's intuition was strong, she sensed trouble at Amber's house, which was what I suspected as well. A quick glance at Lilith told me that she suspected this as well.<i> \"Perhaps it would be best if we brought her along.\"</i> biting my lip, I thought. <i>\"Her magic powers may come in handy if we find trouble.\"</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After school, I had James drive Lilith, Lyssa and I to Amber's house. Even before we came near to the house, I sensed something was wrong so, upon getting out, I turned to the driver. \"Please wait here in case I need you.\" firmly but kindly, I ordered. \"I have a bad feeling about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\" fingering his sidearm, James replied. \"I will be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you had a bad feeling about this, why are we here?\" curious, Lyssa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a bad feeling Amber is in trouble, not us.\" frowning, I replied. then I thought, <i>\"Not yet, at least.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a feeling of dread fell over me. I turned to Lilith in time to see her shiver. \"I'm feeling it now.\" producing her Tarot card deck, she said. \"I have a bad feeling Amber is not alone in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a scream was heard from inside, it was Amber's but it seemed strange somehow. I ran ran forward and thrust my hand forward. It was a new mental power I discovered while working as a 'living mannequin' with Clem at Macy's. I remembered how it knocked those two crooks for a loop and I used that same invisible force to reduce the front door to splinters. We all ran inside to find a man kicking and punching Amber all around the living room with her vainly struggling against him. Acting quickly, Lilith pulled a card from her deck and tossed it into the air, declaring, \"Knight of Swords, defend Amber McReady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a puff of smoke and a knight on a horse appeared on the front lawn before it took off after a black van with tinted windows. \"What...\" puzzled, she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was surprised as well, seeing the knight on horseback racing after the van but then I scanned the man's mind, along with Amber's and I realized it was a trap! \"You commanded the knight to defend Amber McReady!\" my eyes widening, I said. \"That's not her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the man stopped attacking the girl and landed a punch into my gut, forcing me to stumble back a few steps. Then the girl suddenly went after Lyssa, throwing kicks and chops in too quick of succession for her to use her speed. All she could do was dodge and back away, looking for room to move. I barely caught a glimpse of Lilith reaching for her deck when someone grabbed her from behind and pulled her out the front door with a cloth over her mouth and nose! <i>\"I have to help them!\"</i> concerned, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, I had problems of my own as the man gets lunging at me, trying to land a blow. Strangely, he seemed to be completely avoiding my head. That was when I realized they wanted us alive with little to no damage to our powers. Fortunately, being a telepath, I was able to read what move he was going to make before he made them and effortlessly dodged each blow. <i>\"I need to pacify this guy fast.\"</i> worried for Lilith and Lyssa, I thought. <i>\"I think I know just the thing...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sent out a powerful mental command to the man's subconscious mind, <i>\"You are a baby!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, he crumbled to the floor and began to babble like a happy baby. I giggled slightly, seeing him drooling. \"Now, my little one, you are going to be a good baby and stay right where you are.\" cooing the man, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was transfixed on the man I had mentally regressed into infancy until Lilith ran in. Snapping out of my momentary trance, I turned to see Lyssa delivering super speed kicks to every part of the girl's body, keeping her pinned against the wall, shaking from convolutions from the rapid blows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyssa, that's enough!\" touching her deck, Lilith yelled. \"She's had it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, I feared that Lyssa had gone crazy with rage and I was about to push her away with my mind when she suddenly stopped, allowing the girl to slide to the floor, moaning. \"I wasn't hitting her hard.\" limping towards Lilith, she protested. \"The first thing she attacked was my legs, I couldn't kick with my full strength if I tried right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their trying to weaken us.\" fearful, Lilith mussed. \"I had to use two cards at once to protect Amber and myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded in agreement then turned to see a boy walk in behind Lilith. Seeing her as well, Lyssa's jaw dropped in shock. \"Is that... Amber!?\" stunned, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so.\" wincing, Lilith replied. \"She's hoping we can help her figure out what's causing this.\" she then quickly added, \"There's more, James was not our driver. It was someone else and he managed to get close, too close, without any of us realizing it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not good.\" shaking my head, I said. \"We can't stay here.\" I then turned to Amber. \"I'm afraid you will have to come with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we going to get to... where ever we are going?\" curious, Amber asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she moaned slightly then sighed as her body changed back into a girl before our eyes. \"I'm back...\" relief in her voice, she said. \"I'm beautiful again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed then pulled out my cellphone and dialed a number. A moment later, someone picked up. As it was on speakerphone, we all heard James' voice. \"James here...\" in a strained voice, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James. are you okay, you're not injured or anything?\" urgently, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a bump on the head.\" after a moan, James replied. \"Where are you, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fine but we need pick up, bring the fastest car you can snag.\" I gave the address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I ended the call, Lilith turned to Amber. \"This is not over.\" firmly but kindly, she said as Lyssa called Garth's father, the police chief. \"Those goons will be back and, for whatever reason, they want you as badly as they want us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber gulped. \"But why!?\" trembling, she asked. \"What do I have anyone could possibly want!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what we have to figure out.\" seriously, Lilith replied.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing Chief Ted Jones step out greatly surprised me. \"I thought James was a fast driver, Chief.\" impressed, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he is.\" serious, Ted replied. \"But this car goes much faster than anything else on the street.\" he walked up to us. \"What's going on, girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Agency came after Amber McReady,\" Lilith said. \"They had agents disguised as Amber and James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they be after you, Miss McReady?\" turning to her, Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" she replied. \"But that's not the weirdest thing to happen to me today.\" She took a deep breath and swallowed. \"For a few hours, I was a boy. I was hoping Lyssa could explain it, but I'm me again, so I guess I don't need to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess again.\" ruefully, Lyssa said. \"When I started changing, I changed back and forth, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked worried. \"But... that doesn't mean it'll happen to me. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amber,\" turning to her, I said, \"how's your bra feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber was puzzled by the question, then looked down and grabbed her breasts. \"What's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your breasts are smaller,\" sighing, Lyssa said. \"As I became a girl, my breasts grew. The opposite seems to be happening to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is this happening?\" tearing up, Amber asked. \"What did you do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of us did anything,\" serious, Lilith said. \"The seeds for this were sown long ago, and I don't know how to find the answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Beth can,\" after a thought, Lyssa said. \"I'll ask her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will have to wait,\" Ted inserted. \"If Amber is at risk, we need to take action to protect her.\" turning to Amber, he said, \"Call your parents, collect anything you'll need. I'll need to bring you to the S.U.B. Station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs other police officers arrived on the scene, Ted urged Amber to call her parents. \"They are not going to believe me.\" frowning, she muttered. \"What am I going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned, sensing a presence, and silently sighed, seeing Madam Vague appear behind the rest of the group as if she had just turned a corner. <i>\"She always seemed to appear when she was most needed.\"</i> quoting a line from the graphic novels, I thought. <i>\"Maybe, someday, I'll be able to do that too.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave that to me.\" calmly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others turned to find Madame Vague. She approached Amber and gently took her phone. \"May I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber nodded, dumbfounded as Vague then dialed a number. A few rings later, a woman answered. \"Amber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blessed be, sister Tonya.\" gently, mom said. \"Our mutual enemies have targeted Amber and tried to kidnap her; my daughter and her friends foiled the attempt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled response came from the phone. I could not hear what was said but Amber's mother sounded understandably upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be at peace, Tonya.\" calmly, Vague said. \"Amber is just fine but Tex feels we should move her to the substation for her own protection.\" after a pause, she added, \"She is showing the signs of becoming a guardian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"A guardian?\"</i> curious, I thought. <i>\"What is that? A male Amazon, perhaps?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just started, from what I can see.\" eying Amber, Vague said to a muffled response. she then gave Lilith a glance and began to talk in a language I did not recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to use my telepathic powers to try to translate the words but Madame Vague seemed ready for that as all I got was static. <i>\"She's more powerful than she lets on.\"</i> impressed, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ending the call, Vague turned to Ted who was returning from the house. From the look on his face, I knew that the three who had attacked us were already long gone. \"It was Vendetta and Psyche.\" with a growl, he said. \"They both got away but we have their flunky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered the two characters names were mentioned a few times in the graphic novels. \"The had tangled with the original group in the past.\" disturbed, I thought. \"Only why did they look so young?\" then I realized that they must have had powers similar to our own and suppressed a shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't talk, Ted.\" softly, Vague warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Madame Vague.\" frowning deeper, Ted replied. \"Its not like the old days where we can scare what we want out of those we catch, I have to follow the letter of the law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, we all arrived at the substation with Amber, who was still shaken by the sudden darkness when Lilith used the moon card to get us there. \"It took me by surprise as well.\" urging Amber out of mom's car, she said. \"Welcome to the Subterranean Urban Base station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really existed!?\" startled, Amber asked. \"Does that mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief Jones was Tex the mighty.\" serious, Lilith replied. \"All of it was real, including the Agency, who attacked you today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did your mom know my mother?\" still rattled, Amber asked. \"Is there anything else I should know about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, there is.\" walking into view, Mrs Jones said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to find her walking towards us with Garth and Grace following, leading a short and thin thirteen year old boy with longish sand blond hair and green eyes. Upon seeing him, the boy's entire life flashed before my eyes. It was not because I had scanned his mind but because his mind was still innocent, an open book for any telepath to read. <i>\"Poor kid.\"</i> wincing, I thought. <i>\"He's had it rough...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blessed be, Mrs Jones and family.\" kindly, Lilith said. \"Who is your new friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather smiled. \"Everyone, I'd like you to meet the newest member of our family.\" motioning to the small boy, she said. \"This is Tim Jones, he was an orphan from Europe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense you were in the hands of the Agency.\" serious, Lilith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was but he was not brainwashed.\" cutting in, I said. \"His mind is free.\" then I thought, <i>\"Free but very afraid. I guess that's why we haven't seen him before today.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and I have already met him.\" smiling, Mrs Vance said. \"He has the strange power to make anything he draws come to life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't we meet him earlier?\" confused, Lilith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, child,\" patiently, Vague replied, \"he was too scared to come out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We convinced him you were all cool.\" placing a firm hand onto his shoulder, Garth chimed in. \"These are my friends, little bro, you couldn't be in safer hands.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That sounds similar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly,\" Tim replied. \"My drawings actually move on the page. And I can actually become them. Want a demonstration?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all nodded eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his sketchbook and stopped on one page. \"Say hello to... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving powerful mental abilities somehow allowed me to see things moving fast with greater ease. I was surprised and impressed to see dozens of pieces of paper surrounding and reforming Tim's body into a different form. In what was the blink of an eye to others, A tall woman appeared where Tim once stood. \"... Amazona, Princess of Power!\" finishing his line, the woman said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned, shaking my head. This Amazon Tim had created around himself proved he knew very little about women in general. The figure was six feet tall, with breasts that were completely too big for her body under a skin tight costume. \"He has a lot to learn.\" amused, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith snorted. \"Yeah, you came up with that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" confused, the 'woman' asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you try moving around off the printed page,\" Lilith explained, \"those bazongas are going to be more of a hindrance than a help. They block your field of vision, they'll restrict your arm movement, and they'll make you fall over the second your back isn't straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya, Tim.\" smiling, Grace added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame Vague, I noticed, did well to stifle a giggle of her own. She caught Lyssa's eye and winked at her. <i>\"This child has little to no experience with real women.\"</i> I heard her carefully whisper to Lyssa. <i>\"He will need guidance.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, Amazona, tried moving around, and quickly saw that we weren't joking. \"I see your point, younglings,\" she said. \"I am sure the artist sees it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" confused, Lyssa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim doesn't just change physically,\" Garth explained. \"The characters he creates come alive as he envisions them. So you're really talking to a character in a comic book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazona touched the paper again, and all the papers that made her form flipped back into his notebook in a blink of an eye, reattaching themselves to the glue that held them there. In an instant, a sheepish Tim stood before us. \"Thanks for the advice,\" he said. \"I'll definitely redesign her before I call on her again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do that,\" Grace said. \"And, please, stop making her costume rip in strategic places in battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, hearing Lyssa giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could tell he was hurt, thinking he did not impress everyone as he had hoped to. <i>\"Poor kid.\"</i> sighing, I thought. <i>\"At least he now has a brighter future ahead of him.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There, there, Tim.\" cooing him, Lyssa said. \"No one is mad at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" roughing Tim's hair, Grace said. \"Just give the female characters you make some dignity, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim sniffed at little but managed a smile. \"O- Okay.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy.\" smiling, Vague said. she turned to the others. \"Lilith and I need to have a word with Amber before her mother arrives with her husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lilith and Madame Vague walked off to another room with Amber, a strong vision filled my mind. I saw my cousins, Annette, Damien, and Amadeus running from a number of me who were invading their home while my uncle Crecatous, dad's bother, fighting another group of the same men. I rose a hand to my head, as the vision vanished, worried for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" concerned, Lyssa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got a vision.\" worried, I replied. \"It's my uncle Crecatous, dad's bother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about him?\" worried, Lyssa asked. \"Is he okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to cry, something I tried very hard not to do in front of others. \"They attacked his house....\" tearfully, I said. \"The Agency... they invaded his home, his kids are on the run...\" then, I got another vision and saw them exiting an RV in front of my mansion home, which was currently vacant. \"I have to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I teleported out of the Substation and reappeared, feeling drained, inside the front foyer of my mansion home. I staggered slightly then moved to the pantry and quickly grabbed an energy bar from the cupboard before eating it. \"That's a little better.\" my dizziness fading slightly, I breathed. \"I have to work on building my strength before doing that too many times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then returned to the foyer and looked out the window, waiting. The RV soon parked in front of the mansion and saw Annette step out first. Immediately, I knew she and Damien had gained the ability to shrink and grow, much like Sarah Barns, our home room teacher. I winced slightly, sensing that she was tempted to become a giantess and stomp my home to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Damien is tempted to turn into a giant and stomp on my home too.\"</i> sadly, I thought. <i>\"I truly had been a total bitch to everyone.\"</i> I sighed then whispered, \"Well, that has all changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, Amadeus, knocked on the door. I paused, sensing that he had somehow gained peak human abilities in everything. Attributes, intelligence, memory... it was a simple but powerful ability. <i>\"No wonder the Agency was after them.\"</i> gulping, I thought. Summoning my courage, I opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Caitlin. Its been awhile.\" calmly, Amadeus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amadeus. You and the twins are the last people I would have expected here.\" acting surprised, I said. \"Where's your dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is actually why we are here.\" wincing, Amadeus replied. \"May we come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By all means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they entered, Amadeus explained everything that had happened in the past weeks. Of course, I could have gained the entire story in an instant but I feared that Amadeus may sense it and become fearful, or worse, become offended. I did not interrupt but asked a few questions to confirm the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's the story.\" sighing, Amadeus said. \"We were hoping we could stay here for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love to have you, Amadeus.\" serious, I said. \"However, Agency could track you back here.\" I then smiled. \"Fear not, though, I know where you can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" raising an eyebrow, Amadeus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember the Problem Child Gang your dad would always tell us about?\" still smiling, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" confused, Amadeus replied. \"Why?\" then it seemed to hit him and I heard him think, <i>\"It was all real... I should have guessed!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its starting back up again.\" turning serious, I replied. \"Apparently, several of the kids from school have powers like me and you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! You have powers?\" surprised, Annette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I can read minds, among other things.\" ruefully, I said. \"So I hope your not still planning to stomp my house down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette gave a slight nervous giggle as Damien did the same. Only Amadeus broke the silence by speaking up again. \"That would be an ideal place for us.\" serious, he said. \"They might even be able to help my siblings gain control of their size changing powers.\" he then frowned. \"However, I would need to know where this base is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take you there.\" nodding, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" quickly, Amadeus said. \"Come on! We're going back into the RV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we really taking her with us?\" causing me to wince, Damien complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No complaining, Damien.\" annoyed, Amadeus hissed. \"We need her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe then went back into the RV and drove off and Amadeus drove. \"Head out of town.\" serious, I instructed. \"None of you will stand a chance against the Agency without training and you are about to get a lot of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could sense that Annette and Damien were worried as they knew so little about the Agency and what they did but I had no time to deal with it then. Amadeus followed my instructions and quickly drove out of town. \"Now what?\" as we left the city limits, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"We go down.\" simply she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I pulled out a 'door opener' Ted Jones had given me earlier and hit a button. To my cousins' surprise, a section of the road lowered in front of us like a ramp and Amadeus drove down it into an underground garage as the secret entrance closed behind us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" as the RV stopped in a parking space, Annette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the substation.\" smiling, I said. \"This is the headquarters of the new Problem Child Gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You trust us enough to take us directly here?\" suspicious, Amadeus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could not read minds and see over an hour into the future, no.\" serious, I replied. \"However, I can and I know that you three are legit and that you will be needed very soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean needed?\" worried, Damien asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sykes is about to make his move.\" serious, I said. \"I confirmed this through Madam Vague and Lilith Nightshade, our in team advisers.\" she held back a shudder. \"Something big is on the horizon and we all have to be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it you need us to do?\" rising from the driver's seat, Amadeus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"We need to see what you can do then teach you how to use it and fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho goes first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Size changing powers.\" smiling politely, I said. \"These could be useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, they could but, there is a problem.\" wincing, Amadeus explained. \"Currently, their powers are linked to emotions.\" he sighed. \"I've tried to get them to master those powers, but I have had no luck. I was hoping you and your friends could help them through that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we can do that.\" as Annette and Damien returned to their normal size, I said. \"So, Amadeus. Care to demonstrate that special talent of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be glad to.\" nodding, Amadeus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Special talent? What does she mean, big brother?\" Damien asked in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see in just a minute.\" serious, Amadeus said. \"Its something I was born with. Hope you enjoy.\" he then turned to me. \"I saw that this place has some automated defense systems, can you activate them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure about activating the automatic defenses.\" worried, I said. \"True, they are twenty years old and designed not to kill but they are still really intense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a waste of time to try to explain everything to you as you obviously already read my mind.\" calmly, Amadeus said. \"Still, I am asking you to trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"Sorry, I normally make it a rule not to read anyone's mind without their permission.\" looking at him, I said. \"Are you sure you can handle this?\" Amadeus nodded and I turned to Damien and Annette. \"You two come with me, we can watch your brother from behind the security glass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what their brother had in mind, the two followed me to a room where I closed a heavy steel door before turning to a control panel that had a microphone. \"What is he going to do?\" worried, Annette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wave around his man card.\" frowning, I replied. I then hit an intercom button. \"Get ready, I'm activating the defense systems.\" warning him, I said. \"To shut them down, you will have to get to the control room on the other side of the station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I hit a small series of buttons and a number of trash receptacles rose at the lids, revealing automatic weapons that began to fire darts at Amadeus! Annette screamed, seeing this, but paused as we all saw Amadeus almost effortlessly dodge the line of fire, running right at them! I watched, nervous, seeing him get hit a total of eight times before finally reaching the second control room where he soon shut down the defense systems. <i>\"You reckless, impulsive...\"</i> scolding him I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Incredible....\" whispered Annette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He got hit eight times.\" frowning, I said. \"Had those been bullets, he would have been severely injured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, that's damn impressive.\" stunned, Damien said. \"I didn't know Amadeus had that in him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is my power, Cait.\" walking into the room, Amadeus said. \"I can do anything I try as if I have done it all my life. I'm far from invincible but I'm really hard to take down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"You are reckless.\" scolding, I said. \"The people we are up against are monsters, they will not hesitate to use any weakness you have against you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to see you still care.\" with a slight smile, Amadeus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI returned the smile before....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Get in the car; NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all rushed out through the front entrance of the mall to find Chief Ted outside a strange looking grey four door car. Right behind him, Alyssa's mom, who I called aunt Liv, stopped with a strange car of her own; calling for her and Beth. \"Hurry, kids!\" Urgency in her voice, she screamed. \"Run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed behind the others and sighed in relief seeing a black limousine with James, my trusted driver in his security detail body armor.

She was the 'black sheep' of the family because she married a private detective rather than to a wealthy man her parents tried to arrange for her.  I giggled catching what James said about being mom's 'go to guy'. \"You were the post boy for the Problem Child Gang!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames chuckled. \"I didn't see half of the action the Problem Child Gang got into but I had my share of bouts with Sykes and his merry men.\" Smiling, he said. \"I got caught and tied up a few times only to be saved by 'Heather'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled inside seeing one of James' memories of him as a scrappy young  boy being rescued by a spunky little girl. <i>*Those misadventures must have inspired him to become so strong today.*</i> Smiling, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Where is he taking us?* I heard Trish think, frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, I need to know where we are going.\" Firmly but kindly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was silent for a moment before he replied. \"We are going to the clubhouse. It is the safest place right now as its true location was kept out of the graphic novel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly nodded, knowing he was telling the truth. \"When we get to the clubhouse, I want a full briefing, James.\" Sternly, I said. \"You understand that my friends and I have many concerns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will tell you what I can before I must be off again.\" Equally as stern, James said. \"This is not a game or a fantasy, this is real life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then remained silent but I picked up one thought that startled me. <i>*Our old enemies are after the kids to get revenge on us.

Upon reaching the bottom, we realized we were in a small parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The clubhouse took approximately twenty million dollars to construct.\" Serious, James said. \"Your mother contributed five million while the rest of the funds came from the other wealthy members of the group.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hi. My name's Alyssa Vance. You can call me Lyssa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm 14 years old, and I've made about an A- average as I get ready for high school. I enjoy running, and I've recently gotten into tennis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat makes me a \"problem child\"? Call it an accident of birth. I was born in the body of a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was seven when my older sister, Bethany, caught me in her room, wearing one of her dresses. \"Greg? What the heck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave you ever tried to explain something that even you don't fully understand? That's how I felt, explaining to Beth why I was wearing her clothes. By the time I finished, I was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth surprised me with her reaction. While she was plenty mad when she first caught me, she calmed down as I spoke. When I started crying, she hugged me until the tears stopped. Then she had me wash my face, so my eyes wouldn't be puffy. Then the two of us went downstairs, to explain all this to Mom and Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea how they'd take it. Dad always loved taking me out to the backyard to play catch, and Mom had just recently recovered from the car accident that left her in a wheelchair for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, they reacted a lot like Beth. They told me they loved me, and they wanted me to be happy. \"If that means you want to wear dresses,\" Dad said, \"then I guess you'll need to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later, on my eighth birthday, came the next step. It was after my birthday party, and all my friends had gone home. I went up to my room to watch TV. Before long, though, Beth knocked on my door and said, \"Come on downstairs. Your birthday isn't over yet.\" I followed her, puzzled at what her words meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was in the family room, I saw more presents waiting for me. Only, these were wrapped in pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I unwrapped them, I found dresses, skirts, and blouses. All girl's clothes, even panties and girl's shoes. In one box was a wig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your own clothes,\" Mom said. \"You don't need to borrow Beth's, anymore. Why don't you try something on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI picked out some clothes and brought them upstairs. Back in my room, I took off all the clothes I'd been wearing, then tried out the panties. I didn't like the bulge in the front, and figured out I should tuck my stuff between my legs. Once I was fully dressed, I went back downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice, Greg,\" Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not much of a Greg,\" Dad said. \"I think somebody's going to need a new name, to go with the new wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so I began my double life. During the day, I was Greg. However, I was usually Alyssa by dinnertime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few years of that, however, I got tired of it. So, one day, sometime after Mom had announced she was pregnant again, I made the announcement that I wanted to be Alyssa full-time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a hunch this was coming,\" Dad said. \"For your last birthday and Christmas lists, most of the things you really wanted were for Alyssa.\" So, as of my twelfth birthday, I was no longer Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Dad was an attorney, there was very little trouble getting me into junior high as Alyssa. The first jock who broke my nose got suspended, and the second was expelled. I've gotten philosophical about it; it's just one more thing to take care of, when the time comes for the full enchilada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got me on hormone therapy, so some of my features have slowly feminized, I'm not growing facial hair or thick body hair, and my breasts are slowly taking shape. Mom says they'll be fine, but I keep thinking I'll need to add implants to the full enchilada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've got a bit of a crush on one boy, Garth Jones, but I don't know if he shares my feelings. I haven't pressed him. We were friends back when I was living as a boy, so it might be strange for him. In any case, I'm still biologically male, so dating could get awkward for both of us.</span></div></div>",

The pills seemed to be affecting my privates, as they were smaller than they'd been when I started on this journey. <i>Who knows</i>, I thought, <i>maybe I'll luck out and get the full enchilada early?</i> Soon, I was ready for my morning run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, though, I had to hug and kiss my baby brother, Sam. Maybe I shouldn't call him baby, since he's 18 months old, but Mom and Dad still call him their baby, so I guess it's okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stuck my earphones in, turned on my mp3player, and set off. Once Lady Gaga started playing, I zoned out, looking only to make sure I didn't accidentally head into traffic, as I ran alongside the highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike I said, I found it pretty easy to lose track of the world around me as I ran, but one sign caught my attention. I ran in place, trying to decipher it. I'd never seen it before, and with good reason: It was miles from my house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the sign. Then I looked at my watch. Then I looked back at the sign. Then, I dug out my phone, to doublecheck the time, in case my watch was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone confirmed it. I had somehow run 60 miles in half an hour.</span></div></div>",

My budding breasts were not so budding anymore, they felt much larger. I looked down at myself and found that the bra I was wearing was now full with more than just a pair enhancement pads, I actually had breasts! <i>\"What is this!?\"</i> I whispered hoarsely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it was my dream to truly become female, I was shocked to discover that I had grown B cup breasts in the time I had somehow ran 60 miles in a half hour. Part of me wanted to scream in horror while another part wanted to scream with delight but logic won out in the end and I quickly looked about to find a restaurant nearby. I jogged over to the eatery and entered the ladies restroom where I hurried into a stall and locked the door. \"Is this a dream?\" I wondered quietly, pulling down my gray and pink jogging pants and white panties. \"Did everything change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down and gulped, again feeling conflicted emotions as I discovered I now had a girl's vagina. It was like a sequence in a dream, my long sought after dream had come true. I teared up, wanting to shout for joy but became depressed as the changes reversed before my eyes, leaving me feeling drained. \"What's happening to me!?\" I cried. \"This is too weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me several minutes to calm myself down before I pulled my panties and jogging pants back up and left the bathroom. As I left the restaurant, still crying, I pulled out my cellphone again and dialed home. \"Daddy, I need you!\" I sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyssa?\" asked Dad's voice. \"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, you were being driven home by dad who tried to get you to tell him what had happened. Only I was  still too shocked and confused to put it into words. Upon arriving home, dad had a short conversation with mom and Bethany before they walked up to me with mom rolling closer in her chair. Even Sam, my baby brother, seemed concerned as he looked at me with his bright blue eyes. \"Honey, please tell us what happened.\" said mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat can I do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You should know better than to accept rides from strangers, or to go off with friends without telling us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't get a ride from anyone,\" I said, \"until after I called you. I... I ran that far, all on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Es Issa okay?\" looking up at mom, Sam asked. \"She wok scar'd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're trying to figure that out, sweetie.\" patiently, mom replied as she held him in her lap. \"It'll be fine, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lady,\" Dad said, \"you'll need to make your story a little more plausible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the truth, Daddy. I was running, listening to my mp3 player, just zoning out. When I realized where I was, I found out I'd run that far, in just half an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you could run that far, that fast,\" Dad asked, \"why didn't you run back home again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't sure if I could do it again. I didn't want whatever it was to conk out on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's certainly strange,\" Mom said. \"Well, for today, I'm ordering you not to go running. I think one such adventure today is enough. And I don't want you running along the highway again. Just do a few laps around the park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It be okay, Issa.\" worried, Sam said. \"Don't cwy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they left my room.

They really freaked after they got your phone call. Even Sam was worried and he's just learning to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was pretty freaked, too.\" In a hushed voice, I added, \"The running wasn't all that happened to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth's eyes went wide. \"You didn't say anything about getting hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't,\" I said, still whispering. \"But, after I stopped running,... something else happened to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't last long,... but I turned into a girl.\"</span></div></div>",

She moved from one side of me to the other, watching and recording the changes as they accelerated. My body became more slender before my sister's eyes and she nearly screamed as she witnessed a certain bulge in my sweats fall completely flat. Within seconds, there was no doubt in Beth's mind, I was telling the truth, I had transformed into a real girl.  Excited and happy for me, she was about to call my attention when my legs suddenly picked up the pace, increasing my speed on the treadmill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the other part of her story.\" whispered Beth. \"Her high speed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaster and faster I ran, not even paying any attention, as the speed monitor kept climbing. Soon, I had reached a hundred miles an hour, still humming to the music, showing no signs of fatigue. \"Incredible!\" whispered Beth. \"She's nearing 120mph, this is insane!\" finally, Beth yelled out, \"Hey, Alyssa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI came to a stop as if I was only in a light jog then turned to Beth, removing my headphones. \"What is it?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth smiled. \"You changed while you were zoning out.\" she replied. \"Then you went into super turbo mode and blew away all the track records, look at the speed monitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the monitor and nearly fell off the treadmill, letting out a girlish scream before composing myself and looking down at my body. \"I'm a girl again.\" I said, smiling. \"Only it might not last long, just like the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My concern is more with this super speed you've developed.\" said Beth. \"It's got to be wrecking havoc with your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rubbed my arm, feeling uncomfortable, as I knew what she was going to say next. \"Alyssa, we have to...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was surprised to find that I was slightly more developed than my older sister but pleased that there was no trace of my male form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look... beautiful.\" I whispered, tearing up at my naked body. \"This is the real me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile taking a shower, I discovered that my private areas were more sensitive than I had imagined them to be plus the weight of my breasts was slightly uncomfortable. I made a mental note to have a talk to mom about it later. <i>\"Well, now I know why girls wear bras.\"</i> I thought, blushing. <i>\"It's to keep these babies from feeling too heavy.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I toweled dry, dad knocked on the bathroom door. \"I made an emergency appointment with your doctor.\" he called. \"Be ready to leave in about an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, dad.\" I called back. \"I'll be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to the clothes I had set out and sighed. \"I promised myself to wear a dress the day I became a real girl.\" I whispered, looking at the strapless peach formal gown. \"Here's hoping the change will last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, I had returned to the kitchen to make myself a quick snack, I was still hungry. While I was enjoying a miniature Dagwood, mom wheeled in and pulled along side me, smiling. \"It's not polite for a young lady to eat with her elbows on the table, dear.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, young wady.\" in a scolding tone, Sam said, riding in mom's lap. \"Min yo manors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed slightly and picked up my arms before swallowing. \"Sorry, mom.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"I'm glad that your wish came true, sweetie.\" she said. \"We only want you to go see the doctor so you don't risk injuring yourself and ending up like me... a cripple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy said the 'C' word.\" raising a hand to his mouth, Sam whispered. \"Pwease, mommy, don't say dat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to mom, surprised, then dropped my sandwich to give her a warm hug. \"You are not a cripple, mom.\" I said, firmly. \"With the things you do here and at your work, you run circles around everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, mommy, you da bestest.\" added, Sam, hugging her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, honey.\" said mom, tearing up. she turned to Sam. \"You too, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome.\" smiling again, Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMon smiled then turned back to me. \"Still, I do not want to see you end up in a wheelchair,\" serious, she said, \"please promise me that you will tell the doctor everything when you see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise, mom.\" I replied, giving her a kiss on the cheek. \"I just hope I'm a real girl for good this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if it were some sick game of fate, I felt my blouse suddenly become more loose and looked down to find I was quickly becoming flat again. \"No!\" I yelled, distraught. \"Not again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fell into tears and mom pulled me into a hug. \"We'll get to the bottom of this, Alyssa.\" she told me. \"I promise you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated and confused, I continued to cry on mom's shoulder as she gently rocked me back and forth. I had not yet realized that the transformation had lasted a half an hour longer than the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It okay, Issa.\" touching my cheek, Sam said. \"You still pwetty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, bro.\" managing a grateful smile, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, reluctantly wearing a pair of shorts and T-shirt, I entered the hospital where I was greeted by our family physician, Dr. Sarah Hal. She was a young doctor, in her late twenties, with a lean but powerful body, long brown hair and green eyes. she shook mom and dad's hands before turning to me. \"Your parents sent the video of your unusual experience to my phone, Alyssa.\" she said, gently. \"I promise you I will do all I can to get to the bottom of this mystery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"Thank you, Dr. Hal.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled. \"Please, Sarah.\" she said. \"Come on, I'll run you through some tests and we'll see what we can find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and her nursing staff sent me through a seemingly endless array of tests, drawing samples of my bodily fluids, taking my blood pressure at least a dozen times, having me run a treadmill with vital monitors stuck everywhere on me, it seemed to take forever. Finally, after nearly eight hours, I was sent to a room with my family following. I was a girl again, having transformed on the treadmill, but I id not want to get my hopes up of it lasting too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel, honey?\" asked mom, wheeling into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like a lab rat, mom.\" I replied honestly. \"I think they ran just about every test there is to run on me.\" I sighed sadly. \"At least I'm a real girl again... for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You not a girl.\" looking at me, Sam said. \"You a sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my frustrations, I could not help giggle. \"Same thing, Sam.\" smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just wait and see what Dr. Hal says when the test results come in.\" said dad. \"We'll take this one step at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, which seemed like an eternity to me, Sarah returned with a curios look on her face. \"Well, the results are in but I'm baffled by how this could happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is is, doctor?\" demanded dad. \"What is happening to our Alyssa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighed. \"Well, your Alyssa...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After I completed my first lap, however, I felt my chest starting to bounce. <i>It's happening again,</i> I thought. <i>I don't need to zone out to trigger it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I figured I was fully female again, I noticed I was starting to pick up speed. I didn't want to start racing around the park, though, so I made a conscious effort to keep my speed at reasonable levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I came around a bend, though, I spotted two guys getting ready to rough somebody up. Two aluminum baseball bats against an unarmed homeless man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd seen the aftermath of that kind of thing before, and had wished that someone could have done something. Today, I realized that there was somebody who could do something - me! I ran in place to build up speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one tough guy raised his bat to strike, I made my move. Running over to him, I pulled the bat from his hands. Then, I raced around, and did the same to his partner. I dumped the bats in a trash can and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, the thugs began to swing, only to realize they weren't holding their weapons anymore. \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they looked for their bats, the second guy spotted a police officer patrolling the area. \"Cops. No chance now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat homeless man wouldn't have to go to the hospital today. My super-speed had done some good.

They took positions, expecting nothing, ready for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could have been anything, from a shark to an enemy vessel. What it was, however, was a raft, ill-suited for a voyage as long as was needed for it to reach this far. The Amazons approached the raft, and, peering over their own ship's rail, studied the raft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the raft was a young boy, burned by the sun, weak from hunger and thirst. Strangely, he was clad in the robes of a female. Why should a man dress as a woman? Moved by empathy and curiosity, they brought the boy onto their boat. Back on their island, the Amazons began nursing him back to health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had recovered enough to speak, the Amazon queen herself went to speak to him. \"Greetings, young traveler,\" she said. \"I am Antiope, Queen of the Amazons. Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy bowed his head. \"I am Iolaus, Your Majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well met, Iolaus. We found you adrift on the sea, and in a woman's robes. How came you into such dire straits, and why were you dressed so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I scarce can explain myself, Your Majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Iolaus, try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I like to wear such things. I know not why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. What put you on that raft?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The people of my city. My... dress offended them greatly. Some of them wanted to kill me outright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What stayed their hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They feared that the gods might think me an offering. If that happened, the gods would discover my true nature, and might be angered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear not, Iolaus. I have given the command that you are not to be harmed. I will direct my people to see if there is a way that we might help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Iolaus could walk again, he was brought to the temple. There, he was bound to the altar, as the Amazon priestesses performed a strange ritual over him. Finally, the chief priestess unbound Iolaus, and led the traveler out of the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Amazons, even Queen Antiope, were stunned. Iolaus was now a young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sisters,\" cried the chief priestess, \"I give you Iole, our new sister.\" And so Iole became known as the Twice-Named.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Iole settled into life as an Amazon, it became clear that she had found favor with the gods. She could run faster than the eye could follow. She could outdistance any prey she chose. And, in the heat of battle, she could pluck an arrow in flight, as easily as fruit from a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, she bore fourteen daughters and sons. When the time came for her to go to the Elysian Fields, at the end of her life, all the Amazons mourned her passing.</span></div></div>",

I let out a low laugh as the song was 'I'm so excited' by the Pointer Sisters. <i>\"It's fitting.\"</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moved my feet up and down in place in beat with the music then off I was, like a shot, painting the walls as if I were in on video, being fast scanned. Within a minute, the entire room was painted with two coats. \"That was fun.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off to the next room.\" said Beth. \"Let's go.\" she paused, looking guilty. \"I'm sorry I'm not much help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave my sister a warm hug. \"Not much help, really?\" I asked. \"You've helped me in ways I still don't know how to repay, ever since I started down this road to my dream of becoming a real girl. You've defended me against bullies, taught me girls' fashion, how to wear makeup, pulled an all nighter to research our family history to find Iole....\" I shook my head. \"You are more help than you'll ever know, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Lyssa.\" said Beth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI released Beth and gave her a light punch in the arm. \"Come on, sis, let's bet back to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth nodded and took the radio to the next room, following me. Thirty minutes later, every wall inside the house had been painted in the colors that had been requested. As we cleaned up, Beth and i admired our work. \"They're going to think we slaved all day to paint this house.\" giggled Beth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it were not for my power, we would have.\" I said, smiling. \"I thank Iole and God every day for these gifts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth tiled her head, confused. \"Gifts?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"Super speed and becoming a real girl.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I watched the hours pass, in my feminine body, my excitement growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's starting to look like you might've finally stabilized,\" Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly hope so,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, when I went to bed, I slept naked, instead of putting on my nightgown. I didn't want anything to come between my eyes and hands, and the body of Alyssa Vance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, when I woke up, I still hadn't changed. I was glad. The face in the mirror gave no hint that the person it belonged to had once been a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that meant I had to go shopping yet again. This time, since it was Saturday, Mom drove Beth and me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Our Founders Mall, near the center of the city, I picked out enough new clothes to hold me over until a reasonable amount of time had passed, then said, \"Let's look at the swimsuits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyssa,\" Beth said, \"it's almost the end of beach season. Why get a suit now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I won't spend a lot of time at the beach,\" I replied, \"but we've still got a swimming pool. C'mon, let's see what they've got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked at the styles, Beth caught my attention. \"Hey, Lyssa, check this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to where she was standing. At first, I thought she was looking at the swimsuit on the mannequin. Then, the mannequin's features caught my eye. \"Holy cow! It looks like Cait Spenser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except she's got hair,\" Beth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"And she keeps her nose higher in the air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, girls,\" Mom lectured. \"I thought I raised you better than to say mean things about people, behind their backs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we shopped, I thought, <i>I wonder what Cait would say, if she knew I had finally turned into a girl?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>Congratulations.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around. Did I just hear Cait speak to me? I couldn't see her anywhere. Besides, I hadn't spoken aloud, so how could she have heard me? I chalked it up to low blood sugar.</span></div></div>",

This deeply concerned her as I had been all smiles up to this point during the day. \"Honey, what's wrong?\" she asked. \"Are you changing back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"No, mom, I'm still a girl.\" I replied, tearing up. \"I'm just worried that some might not accept me, once they learn that I'm a real girl now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ridiculous!\" said Beth, looking at me from the front seat. \"Garth accepted you for who you are, he even said you looked cute! Where are you getting this idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just worried, that's all.\" I said, tears forming. \"I'm really glad and grateful that I am a girl. It's just... you know how some people are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Those</i> people you need not worry about, young lady.\" said mom, firmly but kindly. \"We had this discussion when you first started down this path. Do what feels right to you and ignore those who would taunt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that. \"Thanks mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more depressing thoughts, okay.\" said Beth, smiling. \"This is what you had been praying for all your life and now you have it, enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy happiness returning, I let out a giggle. \"I guess I had my first mood swing.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth mom and Beth laughed, causing me to blush. Only the laughter died when a loud bang was heard and mom began to struggle with the wheel as the car swerved violently. \"Everyone hang on!\" yelled mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, mom managed to regain control and parked the car at the curb, hitting the hazard lights. \"Are you two okay?\" she asked. \"We had a blow out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fine.\" said Beth to my nod. \"Just a little shaken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do now?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'll have to call in a tow.\" said mom, pulling out her cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, as she did, another car pulled up behind us and a familiar man exited the driver's seat. It was Ted Jones, followed by Garth, who was sitting in the front passenger seat. \"Having a little trouble, Mrs Vance?\" asked Ted, reaching the driver's window. \"Could you use a hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be wonderful.\" said mom, smiling. she pulled a handle, popping the trunk. \"The jack is not the best in the world, I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay.\" said Garth, smiling. \"I think I can work with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting dad's old work gloves on the floor by my feet, I picked them up and stepped out. \"These might help.\" I said, offering them to Garth. \"I don't want you to cut yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth turned to me and took a step back, surprised. He was blushing!  \"Wow, you're hot.\" he whispered, causing me to blush with him. \"Um... nice dress, it accents your figure well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed smacked Garth in the back of the head. \"Behave yourself.\" he scolded, lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled. \"Thank you for the compliment.\" I said, smiling. \"I'm a real girl now... the whole enchilada.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed turned to me, surprised. It looked as if he wanted to ask me something but he dismissed it and smiled politely. \"Congratulations, Alyssa.\" he said. \"I know that was your dream, I'm glad it came true for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Jones.\" I said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone sit tight.\" said Garth. \"This won't take but a minute or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no one around, son.\" said Ted. \"Let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, I was confused, wondering what the two were talking about. Then I was in for a surprise as Garth lifted the entire front end of the car with one hand and began to screw the lug nuts off with the other! Seeing my reaction, Ted chuckled. \"You are not the only one who had gone through some changes.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the car, Beth and mom were startled, seeing Garth lift the front end of the car. Only Beth heard Beatriz' voice state... <i>\"Iole bore fourteen daughters and sons.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth smiled at this. <i>\"I guess Lole has smiled upon Garth as well.\"</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin two minutes, the spare tire was on the car and the flat tire was in the trunk. \"You're all set to go, Mrs. Vance.\" said Ted, smiling. \"I'm happy for your daughter.\" he then whispered, \"So is my son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled, knowing of the crush I had on Garth. \"I'll be sure to pass that along.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your help, Garth.\" I said, blushing. \"I really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, I gave him a quick kiss on the cheek, causing him to blush brightly. \"You're.... welcome.\" he said, slowly, rubbing his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what I did, I blushed even more and quickly got back into the car as mom thanked Ted and was soon driving off as Garth and Ted got back into their car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you just confessed your crush on him.\" said Beth, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled as well. \"I think he confessed his with the way he was blushing and rubbing that cheek.\" she added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth mom and Beth giggled as I smiled, still blushing. \"Do- Do you really think he likes me?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not call him and ask?\" suggested Beth. \"You're a real girl now, what's stopping you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first, I did not have the heart to tell him that I was not a real girl but as our relationship grew, I could not bear the guilt and finally told him the truth. To my surprise, Garth still genuinely liked me. <i>\"What a great guy..\"</i> Dreamily, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped when Garth answered the phone. \"Hey, tomboy.\" Kindly, he said. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle escaped my lips as tomboy was a nickname Garth had given me since I confessed to him years ago. \"I just wanted to call and say Hi.\" Blushing, I said. \"You got real strong over the summer, tough guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth chuckled on the other line. \"Yeah... about that.\" Nervous, he said. \"I got this tumor that is causing me to have huge growth spurts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tumor?!\" Startled, I asked. \"Garth, are you going to be okay?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine.\" Calmly, Garth replied. \"It seems my dad has the same condition but I'm not allowed to really talk about it; something to do with our ancestry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that, remembering my own ancestry. Then I blushed, remembering why I had called. \"Um... Garth... I really, really like you.\" Stumbling on my words, I said. \"Now that I'm, well, a real girl now do you... do you, well you know...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited nervously, my hands shaking and sweating as I waited for Garth to respond. He was silent for only a brief moment but, at the time, it seemed like an eternity. \"Alyssa, I have had a crush on you since I first laid eyes on you.\" Serious, Garth replied. \"When I heard you had become a real girl, I mean the real deal, I was frantic thinking I would not summon the nerve to ask you out before someone else did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed brightly, hearing that then smiled. \"Garth Jones, are you asking me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another pause and I held back the urge to giggle as I could almost seeing him blushing on the other line. \"Yeah... I- I guess I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to cheer as I had a huge crush on Garth for a while. It was more than because he supported me, protected me, he genuinely liked me for who I was and who I wanted to become. He was a true friend and now I knew he had a crush on me as well. \"Tomorrow is Saturday.\" Smiling, I said. \"What do you say we go out then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me.\" Kindly, Garth said. \"It's a date, I'll see you around noon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you then.\" Blushing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon ending the call, I let out a happy cheer then turned suddenly hearing...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I heard a crash, like the sound of a window breaking. It was immediately followed by mom letting out a startled scream. I ran out of my room in a blur to the second floor landing to find a man a in prison orange jumper! He was short but muscular with short messy black hair and green eyes. There was a deep scar along his right cheek as he faced mom in her wheelchair with a gun in his hand and a hunting knife in a sheath at his side. \"Did you seriously think you could hide from me forever, Heather?\" Scornful, the man demanded. \"You little bitch! Because of you and your damned photographic memory, I rotted in prison for fifteen years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clarence Mayweather, you hurt dozens of people! Ruined many lives!\" Defiant, mom countered. \"People who didn't do anything other than be in the wrong place at the wrong time! All in the name of your <i>master</i>, Sykes the immortal thief!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low gasp escaped my lips as I heard mom facing the intruder. Did I hear her right, she fought the immortal thief, Sykes? The lead villain in the Teen Detectives graphic novel series? There was no time for me to think about it. Mom was in danger; she needed help quick and quick was now my specialty only I did not want this jerk to know who I was. Thinking quickly, I returned to my room and changed clothes in the blink of an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a second later, I came running out in a black spandex yoga body suit with tight blue jeans shorts, a bluejeans jacket, my favorite running shoes with my soccer shin guards, and a full face masquerade mask. I had also put on a large pair of bracelets I had found in the attic that I somehow thought might come in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weave mommy awone!\" Shaking, Sam yelled. \"Go away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarence laughed. \"Take a long look at your 'mommy', toddler.\" Taunting, he ordered. \"She is about to go bye bye and not come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, he pushed the hammer down on his gun and fired one round. Only I was there and managed to deflect the bullet with my metal bracelet. It stung a bit but I saved mom and that was worth it. Not wasting time, I swung my leg up and knocked the gun clear out of Clarence's hand. The man yelled in pain, shocked to suddenly see me standing between him and mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only place you're going is back to prison!\" Sternly, you yelled. \"Give it up, Mayweather!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't play time, kid!\" Pulling his knife, Clarence demanded. \"I'm going to give you your last wake up call!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarence lunged at you with the knife! Only, to you, he was moving in slow motion and you easily dodged him and delivered a punch to his gut at nearly a hundred miles an hour. Clarence buckled over and coughed, the knife falling from his grasp. I was furious for many reasons. Mom never told me that she was a part of the teen superhero group I loved so much or that this Clarence Mayweather was real and a real threat to the family. I began to hit the man with a barrage of high speed punches and kicks that sent him literally into convulsions! After a second, I ended my attack with a single punch to the man's jaw that sent him to the floor, unmoving. Worried that I might have killed him, I quickly checked him out to find that he was wearing body armor under his prison uniform. He was alive, just unconscious and likely heavily bruised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the threat neutralized, I turned to mom, panting. \"Are you alright... Mrs Vance?\" In a forced calm, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom winced. \"I'm fine...um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief pause, I replied, \"Isa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was what Sam called me with his cute lisp. It seemed to fit and I couldn't think of anything else at the time. Mom frowned at me. \"Well, 'Isa'; I thank you for the rescue but I suggest you change back into your regular clothes before the police show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, I had changed into normal clothing and helped mom tie up Clarence. Once we had a chance to catch our breaths, I turned to mom. \"Why didn't you tell me you a part of the Problem Child Gang?\" Hurt, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed, looking at Clarence, still unconscious on the floor. \"Make a pot of tea, dear.\" Softly, she said. \"It's a long story.\" She then gave me a sad smile. \"Welcome to the club.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We all met at the table where mom began her story. \"We were all talented in our own way.\" Serious, mom explained. \"When we started the group, there were only four of us but it slowly grew into greater numbers including secret allies,  informants, and old pros guiding us on the side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old pros?\" Confused, Beth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were not the first group of kids to fight crime.\" Ruefully, mom replied. \"Other groups inspired the comic book superheroes that have all been blown out of proportions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that. \"Only in Teen Detectives, the heroes are kept down to Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lead the fight to keep it that way.\" Smiling, mom said. \"I and a few others own the exclusive rights to those stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stories that are apparently true.\" Serious, Beth said. \"According to the graphic novel series, Clarence was Sykes' right hand man. He worked to cover his boss's tracks and detour anyone who got too close, including the Problem Child Gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded as she took a sip of tea. \"Correct. He was also a highly trained mercenary, an expert in hand to hand combat, military planning, and a marksman.\" She sighed. \"I called myself Heather; I was the thinker of the group, their strategist. I too was a marksman, a martial arts prodigy, a talented escape artist, and a natural at strategic planning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were basically Clarence's equal.\" Surprised, I said. \"That's impressive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not impressive enough.\" patting the wheel of her chair, mom said. \"I can't count the number of times some lowlife got the better of me and tied me up.\" She smiled slightly. \"I was always able to get out easily and give them the surprise of their life but still... Clarence ended up getting the last laugh in the end, leaving me forever tied to a wheelchair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the one who rammed your car?!\" Angry, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He paid the price for attacking me and will pay the price for invading our home.\" Serious, mom countered. \"While I agree jail time is too good for him, I do not pass judgement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you all get started?\" Changing the subject, Beth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed sadly. \"We were the children of parents who were either too busy or too rich to care about what we did or where we went.\" Softly, she explained. \"My parents were rich indeed and they left servants to watch after my sister and I. At first, I wanted nothing to do with crime fighting but one kidnapping later, I was all in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were kidnapped as a child?\" Worried, I asked. \"By who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else?\" Frowning, mom replied. \"Clarence Mayweather. I was to be the first of his many child followers in Sykes' evil schemes.\" She let out a low chuckle. \"Only it backfired on him big time and gave birth to the Problem Child Gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth and I were hanging on every word, listening to mom's story of her involvement in our favorite superhero group of all time. \"What can you tell us about the other main members?\" Curious, I asked. \"Tex the mighty, Greg the chemist, and Sam the machine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Tex the mighty was a piece of work.\" Bemused, she said. \"He was impulsive, cocky, and sarcastic but he also had a big heart. He was incredibly strong and nearly bullet proof; a living tank so to speak.\" She sighed, her smile vanishing. \"This made him feel invincible but he was powerless against armor piercing rounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He got hurt?!\" Stunned, Beth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"I take it you have not finished the last published graphic novel.\" Softly, she said. \"Sorry... Yes, Tex was hurt but he wasn't killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was dad a part of the gang?\" Wincing, Beth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"No, he wasn't.\" Honestly, she said. \"However, soon after we were married I learned that he had carefully followed our exploits through his local newspaper and saved all of the articles.\" She winked at me, adding, \"It was my alter ego who inspired him to become a master of martial arts, escape artistry, and marksmanship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth and I smiled at that. \"Being an attorney, he is also a strategist of sorts.\" Impressed, Beth commented. \"He tried to be just like 'Heather'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom laughed, nodding. \"Why do you think we fell in love so quickly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he know you were a member of the Problem Child Gang?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"I told him shortly after we were married which was when he showed me his collection of newspaper clippings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pause, Beth asked, \"What caused you and the others to give it all up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed, a sad look forming onto her face. \"We were all nearly killed in our last fight with Sykes and his followers.\" Almost whispering, she said. \"We discovered that Sykes was plotting to overthrow the leader of a terrorist cell known as the Hard Line. Back then, we only knew them as 'The Agency'. He was making his move just as we were finally closing in on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Beth and I turned pale. \"When you confronted Sykes in Europe, you crossed paths with this Hard Line.\" Whispering, I said. \"Are they still after you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They think we're dead.\" Sadly, mom replied. \"Most of the world thinks we died along with Sykes in our last battle; which is why they did not continue the graphic novel beyond that point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom took another sip of her tea and fell silent. I realized that it was a difficult subject for her and fell silent myself. Only Sam spoke up. \"Mommy... is Issa gonna be membar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed before turning to Beth and I with a sad look in her eyes. \"I don't know...

For me, its super strength, endurance, and healing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say I was shocked would have been an understatement but I managed to ask, \"How did... she get there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth chuckled. \"My mom gave it to me and Grace.\" he said. \"You see, Amara is the offspring of the alien mother inside my mom.

Seeing this, Beth giggled giggled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alyssa, you look great!\" taking my hand, Grace said. \"I overheard your conversation with Garth, you're one hundred percent girl now, congratulations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" still blushing, I said. \"I'm really happy this way.\" I then pouted slightly. \"Only I'm grounded... no dates until the side of Gar's house is cleaned up and no going anywhere alone until the two weeks is up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an idea struck Garth. \"We might still have that date as you will be with me and I'll be with you, we won't be going anywhere alone.\" smiling, he said. He then made a victory sign to Grace. \"Loophole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace and Bethany looked at each other then shook their heads. \"It won't work.\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might.\" hopeful, I said. \"We could try, the worst they'll say is no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we have two hours.\" said Beth, looking at her watch. \"It'll only take us a few minutes to get what we need so if you two lovebirds want to hang out somewhere, you have an hour.\" she smiled. \"Meet us at the food court and don't be late, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth and I nodded and walked off, holding hands while Beth and Grace watched us leave. \"You had a talk with your dad too, huh?\" smiling, Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth nodded, smiling. \"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace giggled. \"Come on, I'm dying to get myself a new dress for the homecoming prom.\"</span></div></div>",

They looked at the modern trends then parted company before meeting again in a cos-play section an aisle from the dresses. Both of them blushed, seeing the other then asked, in unison, \"Why are you looking through these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, both girls blushed. \"It seems as if my mom and dad were both a part of the Problem Child Gang story Garth and I like so much.\" looking at me, Grace said. \"After discovering what we could do, they warned us not to repeat their mistakes so we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too!?\" interrupting her, Beth asked, shocked. \"My mom was a part of that group as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, you're trying to find costumes to disguise yourselves,\" smiling, Grace whispered,. \"just as I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth nodded. \"Lyssa and I want to continue helping people but, I fear what might happen unless we're both disguised somehow to hide our identities.\" looking worried, she said. \"For what I heard, both our parents made some real enemies when they were a part of that little group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I heard.\" wincing Grace said. \"Garth told me what he knew, including about your mom... I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to track down the guy who did that to her but he's already in jail for a long time to come.\" sternly, Beth said. \"I hope they keep him there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't Garth tell Lyssa?\" surprised Grace blurted out. \"That guy escaped from prison a few days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" stunned and shaken, Beth asked. \"No, he didn't mention that. If he did, Lyssa didn't tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best we don't tell Lyssa for now.\" whispering, Grace said. \"I'm guessing Garth didn't want to upset her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's possible.\" nodding, Beth agreed. \"What costume do you think we should pick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not here to buy a costume but to get ideas to make one.\" turning back to the costumes, Grace said. \"Just as Garth has super strength and endurance, I seem to have this power of total recall. I can learn any skill, art, or trade in minutes rather than days.\" smiling, she added in her thoughts, <i>\"I also seem to have telepathy.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth smiled, hearing Cate's voice in her head. <i>\"Same here.\"</i> she thought back. <i>\"Only mine is from a strange ancestry, not a tiny alien.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Grace and Beth smiled, hearing a third voice state, <i>*I resent that 'tiny' remark.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She meant no harm, Rheta.\"</i> smiling, Grace thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then continued to shop, turning back to the prom dresses then, as time passed, they decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA burst of gunfire took out the skylight, interrupting the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all grabbed what cover we could under the tables. I watched Garth take a peek, he seemed scared, a rarity for him, making me more frightened still but I doubted even my speed were a match for bullets. I turned to Caitlin to find her pressing her fingers against her temples with a look of heavy concentration on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Cait doing?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth turned to look but before he could utter a word, Caitlin grabbed Grace's forehead, like a pro wrestler putting the claw hold on an opponent. Grace's eyes flew wide, and she got the same expression that Cait had before we left for the food court. She next put the claw on Beth, who also spaced out. I guessed Cait was trying to get through to the young gunman but needed extra brain power to do it. Taking a chance, I peeked to see the  boy was shaking his head, as if he was drowsy, but he was wide awake. We still didn't dare to move a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth looked out with me to see the boy put his guns on the ground and kick them away. Mall security grabbed him, and he didn't resist as they took him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cait released the girls, Garth asked, \"What just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That boy was an undiagnosed schizophrenic,\" Grace explained. \"The voices in his head were telling him to kill everybody here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a psychic vision,\" Cait added, \"warning me of what was about to happen. I tried to reason with him, but I had trouble getting him to distinguish my 'voice' from all the others. So I needed Grace and Beth to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you can do that?\" stunned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a few days now,\" Cait replied. \"I found out what the people around me really thought about me, and I've been working to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she added, \"I've got a question for you: Do you guys really have these powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Caitlin's eyes widened as if she had heard something. By the way Garth smiled, I figured it was Amara talking telepathically to Caitlin. Suddenly, Garth grew in size to that of an Olympian weight lifter. I watched Caitlin's surprise turn to shock, looking at his new form. She relaxed when he quickly returned to normal. \"I can get a lot bigger, if I wanted.\" he said, blushing. \"Only, I'm afraid of losing control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here.\" nodding, Caitlin said. \"I don't want to hurt anyone with a 'bad thought'.\" she then turned to Grace. \"I got a feel of yours and Beth's power when we connected, a type of super total recall, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that.\" smiling, Grace replied. \"Basically, I can learn anything in minutes rather than days and master anything in hours rather than years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have something similar.\" agreeing, Beth added. she blushed. \"So far, I seem to be able to find anything I am looking for and instantly know how to use it... a sort of spiritual guide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is impressive.\" smiling, Caitlin said. \"What of you Alyssa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled then ran from the group with such a speed, I seemed to vanish from sight. Startled, Caitlin looked around then jumped to find me standing right behind her. \"Teleportation?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheer speed.\" sighing, I replied. \"That's what got me into trouble, I tracked boulevard bon-bons up the side of Garth's house when I went to visit him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin giggled slightly, hearing that. \"You went passed old man Crane's house, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked. \"How did you?\" I shook her head, remembering my power to read minds. \"What does that have to do with what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been illegally using his Saint Bearnard's droppings to fertilize his lawn.\" Caitlin explained, wincing. \"Its been seeping onto the sidewalks, giving anyone who walks or runs passed real dung covered shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that explains how it was tracked all the way home.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Caitlin looked around, nervous before seeing that Grace and Beth were doing the same. It hit me soon after, a strong sense that we were being watched. \"We'd better get what we need and leave.\" her voice quivering slightly, Beth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm calling off for the rest of the day.\" quickly, Caitlin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Garth seemed confused but a protective look forming on his face told me that he began to feel it too. Grace came close to Garth, worried. \"All of us getting this feeling at the same time can't be a coincidence.\" fearful, she said. \"My vote is to forget what we came for and leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Security is tight, since that kid went on a mini rampage.\" serious, Garth said. \"Whoever we're sensing, they won't try anything now but I say we leave as a group.\" he then turned to Cait. \"That means you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin nodded then pulled out her cellphone, hitting a speed dial button. \"James, I need to be picked up.\" her voice fearful, she said. \"I'm bringing four friends along...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to all, two blurry men were watching us from a distance. \"That's them, Butch.\" said one. \"At least the kids of two of the original members.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch grunted. \"They know we are here, Hank.\" he muttered. \"That friend of theirs seems to have some type of mental radar, we will have to get imaginative to obtain our targets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men watched as...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, we're old money, so those terms could mean anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we drove along, Cait took off her wig to brush debris out of it. This surprised Grace and Beth, as they weren't with us when she did it before. \"When did that happen?\" Beth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few days before I became telepathic. Brad and I got accidentally dosed with plutonium. I lost my hair and started reading minds. Brad... he's recovering, but it's taken him longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ironic, too,\" Cait said. \"Plutonium was the brand name of the hair dye I used.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait then whipped out her smartphone. \"Hola, Marisol,\" she said. \"Yes, I know about what happened. At least I wasn't the first one to interrupt your novelas today.\" She chuckled. \"I'm fine. Nobody got hurt, and the gunman is in custody. However, something else came up, and I'll be spending some time with some other kids my age. I'll be back by supper.

Once it had parked by the road, A tall, slender man with sand brown hair and blue eyes stepped out. With him was an equally tall but muscular woman with long auburn hair and green eyes. I recognized her as Garth's aunt Amanda and her husband, Geo. Coming out of the back was a small girl with long brown hair and blue eyes, their daughter, Susan. \"Are we late?\" walking up to us, Geo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, Geo.\" shaking his hand, Ted said. \"Good to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" releasing Ted, Geo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed then hugged Amanda. \"Thank you for coming over, sis.\" smiling, he said. \"I just wish it was under much better circumstances.\" he sighed. \"Any word from Steve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda winced. \"His daughter is in the hospital.\" sadly, she replied. \"She's not well, from what I hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed shook his head, looking worried. \"We'll have to hold the meeting without him then.\" wincing, he said. \"Everyone inside, we have a lot of ground to cover and, I fear, very little time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone was inside and sitting down, Caitlin turned to Sarah. \"I know this is not the place but... why were you called the black sheep of the family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah giggled slightly. \"When I was your age, the Spencer family liked to play by their own rules.\" looking at her, she explained. \"They did not care for the police or for lawyers unless it worked in their favor.

If Mr Jones had not gotten to him first, they would have made it happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get started.\" interrupting Caitlin's conversation, Geo said with a cold tone. \"As you all know, most of us were members of the Problem Child Gang you kids like to read about. Our last mission was against a man named Sykes who we believed was the bottom of a drug and weapon running cartel.\" he sighed. \"Unfortunately, he turned out to be just the opposite. He was a war monger drug lord, the top dog of the cartel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face and those of my friends paled, hearing that. <i>\"That had to be a shock to learn.\"</i> wincing, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Was it this Sykes and his men who nearly killed you all?\" almost whispering, Garth asked. \"Or was it the Agency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Agency was after Sykes, just as we were.\" seriously Ted replied. \"Sykes knew they were there and that we were hunting him down. He blew the building he was held up in, just as he made his escape.\" he shook his head. \"We barely escaped with our lives only to find the Agency became... interested in us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean interested in you?\" shaking, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I explained earlier, we had our talents.\" looking at me, mom said. \"The Agency was in the business of brainwashing children with such talents to use them, make them do their dirty work so to gain wealth and power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only were we forced to flee for our lives from an exploding building, we had to escape the clutches of an underground terrorist organization.\" tearing up, Geo said. \"We thought we were invincible, we were not. We thought this was behind us... its been chasing us all along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You- You think this cartel or this Agency may have interest in us.\" as if reading Geo's mind, Caitlin said, turning pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeo nodded. \"That is why we are holding this meeting, my dear.\" he said. \"The Agency has resurfaced and from what I have heard, many of you are already being watched by someone.\" he clinched a fist. \"We can not take any chances or make any assumptions, we already made that mistake once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Caitlin gasped, her lips trembling. \"No... they're outside of my house!\" hoarsely, she screamed. she threw her hands against her temples. \"Marisol, you are in danger!

Ted hurried over top the door, motioning everyone to stay clear from the door, as he brought his sidearm to bear. I stayed near Beth though I wanted to be near Garth at the moment. \"Who is it!\" firmly, Ted demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve Connors and company.\" replied Steve's voice. \"Someone tried to take my daughter, Ted. I have one of her friends with me, we need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed cautiously opened the door and peered out before allowing a tall and muscular man with short sand blond hair and blue eyes to enter with Travis Greenway and Megan from school following behind. Travis was a tall and muscular boy with jet black hair and blue eyes. Megan was a shy petite girl with blond hair and green eyes. Both seemed white as a sheet and they staggered slightly as they entered. Heather gasped seeing them and ran forward with Marisol helping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Megan.\" said Heather, gently taking her arm. \"You better sit down a bit, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'm fine.\" said Travis, blushing slightly as Marisol took his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell you are, Chico.\" sternly Marisol said. \"You look like a ghost, sit down and rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm fine.\" stubbornly but politely, Travis said. \"I just need to catch my breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled seeing Caitlin and Grace smiling as well. One did not need to read minds to know the look Marisol was giving Travis, she was not about to put up with any male pride. \"Sit... down.\" with a firm tone, Marisol said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis sat down, his expression softening. The tone of Marisol's voice made me shiver slightly and I I guessed it had the same effect on Travis. \"Yes, ma'am.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you again, old friend.\" returning his sidearm to its holster, dad said. \"Any idea who tried to kidnap your daughter and her friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They weren't professionals.\" quickly, Steve said. \"I'm guessing they were sent by Sykes. he motioned to Megan and Travis. \"These two are just now discovering their 'gifts'. Megan's gift left her a bit shaken, same with Travis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can you do?\" lying on the couch, Caitlin asked. \"Mine is mental powers.\" she moaned. \"Though I kind of over did it a few minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan can control machines and transform to some extent.\" motioning Megan to remain quiet, said Steve. \"Travis has the ability to become an Anthro of various animals.\" pausing, he added, \"I know you two have a voice of your own but you are both seriously drained from the kidnap attempt, rest all you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were they hurt?\" concerned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis pushed himself to save Megan from being taken.\" with a grateful look, Steve said. \"Megan did the same only it was from her powers going a bit nuts on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like mine did at the beginning, turning into a behemoth.\" shaken slightly, Garth said. \"My power is super strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like your dad and aunt.\" smiling, Steve said. then he turned serious. \"We need a plan and time is something we don't have a lot of, we need to act, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you suggest?\" asked Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Steve could answer, there was another knock at the door. \"Who could that be?\" Ted asked. \"We're all here.\" Drawing his sidearm again, he asked, \"Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tr-Trish Wilson, sir,\" came the reply. \"Cait sent for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe turned to Cait. \"Something came up during the ride here,\" she said. \"I sent my driver to pick them up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed opened the door, and in came Trish, Brad, and an older lady, probably Brad's mom. Except Brad looked kind of funny, and it looked like he'd gotten dressed in a hurry. Then I noticed the hospital ID bracelet on his wrist, and remembered Cait had said he'd been recovering from plutonium exposure. \"You guys OK?\" asked Garth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting better,\" Brad replied. Even his voice was different. \"I... had quite an experience in the hospital. Please don't ask me to describe it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Heather asked. \"Why did you come here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cait told me she'd picked up something,\" Trish answered, \"and I should grab Brad and his mom and get in her limo. Whatever it was, it had her freaked worse than the shooting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all turned to Cait again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I read Brad's doctor's mind,\" she explained. \"He's connected to the Agency, and he wanted his hands on Brad and Trish. That's why I brought them here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed shook his head. \"Sykes, the Agency, and the kids of the Problem Child Gang. This is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Call again if you need me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she ended the call and turned to us. \"That was my niece, Caitlin.\" sighing, she said. \"I have a feeling she will be needing me to help her mother very soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she does, go.\" nodding, dad said. \"I can start training Beth while Lyssa takes a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly an hour later, mom got the call and was picked up by two security guards. One gave dad a weary look before escorting mom out to the waiting limousine. \"What was that all about?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that?\" blushing, dad asked. \"He was part of the security detail Cait had sent us without warning. I thought he was an intruder and gave him a few lumps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth and I merely shook our heads only I stepped out of the way as dad threw Beth a bamboo pole. \"Think fast!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What I'd taken for a doll was actually a tiny woman, and she was terrified. As I looked at her face, I could see a distinct resemblance to Rhea. Was this her birth mother? How did she get so small?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting those thoughts aside for the moment, I finished collecting the guns and piled them in front of us. I figured that we could maybe analyze them later, to see what we were dealing with. \"Too slow,\" I said, after I was through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader's eyes narrowed. \"You kids don't know what you're in the middle of. You need guidance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got guidance,\" Garth replied. \"And it's you who doesn't know what he's doing. Drop this, before it gets dropped on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the goons said, \"Looks like Blue team wasn't kidding. Your orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got all the information we need,\" the man said. \"We can easily pick up Sarah and her fiance at our leisure. Ta-ta.\" With that, they all touched devices on their wrists, and they and their weapons disappeared. So much for analyzing them.</span></div></div>",

As we exited the van, Garth said, \"Welcome to the clubhouse of the Problem Child Gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again,\" the boy, who introduced himself as Todd said. \"It's a lucky thing you kids showed up when you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh,\" said Rhea, who was still carrying Sarah. \"Andromeda told Tobi where to find you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Andromeda?\"</i> curious, I thought. <i>\"Tobi?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Andromeda?\" having the same thought, Garth asked. \"And who's Tobi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andromeda,\" Sarah explained, \"is an alien symbiont who lives inside me. Tobi is her offspring. And Rhea is a clone of me, created to save Tobi's life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were about to walk through the garage door, when it opened, revealing Ted's muscular form. \"She's not coming in here!\" firmly, he declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she's my mommy!\" Rhea protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey,\" Todd asked, \"what is he talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was Rhea's age,\" Sarah explained, \"Dr. Hagen had me shadow the Problem Child Gang. Then, he wanted them dealt with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The one who shot Mr Jones in the shoulder.\"</i> eying Sarah, I thought. <i>\"Oh, boy...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed shook his head. \"You have such a pretty way of describing shooting someone in the shoulder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that I shot you in the shoulder. It's that I didn't shoot you in the head or heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded. \"Hagen ordered me to kill you, but I didn't want to. I deliberately shot you in the shoulder, instead. Then, I went into hiding, using the last name Barns. If it weren't for Cain Chemical, Hagen still wouldn't know where I was living.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed shook his head again. \"Sykes again. These names just keep turning up, don't they?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were both the size of teenagers, wearing teen clothes. <i>\"It looks like Mr Jones wants to keep them at a more controllable age.\"</i> wincing, I thought. <i>\"I guess he doesn't want to take any chances.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided it wise not to say anything on the subject. Instead, I took my turn as we all sat around them, explaining the events surrounding our brief encounter with Hagen and his men on the streets near the hospital. In turn, we listened as dad and Geo explained who Sykes was and how their group came to lock horns with the Agency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had thought that the Agency wanted us as part of their army of brainwashed soldiers.\" finishing his explanation, Ted said. \"Apparently, we were wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Agency had considered it but, with half your group was related to the most wealthy families on the planet, it was too much of a security risk.\" looking at dad, Sarah said. \"Believe me, Mr Jones, you will never know how lucky you and your team was.\" she teared up, adding, \"They killed my family to claim me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's a small wonder why mom and dad wanted us to stay away from crime fighting.\"</i> with a low sigh, I thought. <i>\"Too late now, I guess, since Hagen is one of the bad guys.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess placed a reassuring hand onto Sarah's shoulder. \"They won't get you a second time, not if we can help it.\" smiling, she said. \"Rhea is my adopted sister, I won't let anything happen to her birth mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica is really my brother, Clem, mommy.\" smiling, Rhea said. \"He can change into almost anything.\" giggling, she added, \"Even an older sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah could not help giggle at that as Jessica blushed. \"Thank you for taking care of my little girl.. Jessica.\" pecking her on the cheek, Sarah said. \"Do you all have powers like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do.\" seriously, I replied. \"However, I think its more important that we focus the issue at hand... The Agency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, we need to place all we know on the table now.\" equally as serious, Geo said. \"We don't want to be caught off guard a second time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know that Dr Hagen knows about all of us, perhaps even that Travis kid.\" speaking up, I said. \"Only I'm guessing you didn't know him back then, Mr Jones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed shook his head. \"No, we didn't.\" with a hint of regret, Ted replied. \"Had I known who Dr Hagen was, I would not have allowed him anywhere near my children.\" then a thought occurred to him. \"He told us that he had removed the 'tumor' that caused Garth's body to build up, yet the symbiont...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amara said that Hagen only took a piece of her, stunning her enough to return me to normal.\" after a pause, Garth said. \"That can only mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He knows about the symbionts.\" his face turning white, Ted said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As I thought about it, I realized that it was not because she was necessarily untrustworthy but because she had been brainwashed with no proof that it had ever been undone. <i>\"I was right, Mr Jones is not taking any chances.\"</i> frowning slightly, I thought. <i>\"Still, I feel sorry for them. Sarah is as much a victim as any of us.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her disappointed expression, Garth nodded and explained, \"Dad wants you to know just enough to stay here for a while as a guest. It's not because you are not trustworthy, its because you were brainwashed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was twenty years ago.\" sighing, Sarah argued. \"I suffered countless nightmares from my year under their thumb, I still do but I managed to move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do anything to try to undo that brainwashing?\" serious, Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking surprised, Sarah slowly shook my head. \"No...

What've you been up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday was pretty wild.\" a bit shaken, I said. taking a breath, I explained, \"We got a signal from the old blind post office, and it turned out to be some old friends. Then we met some lady who had some problems with our folks, and now she's in a jam. That's why we called you. They're worried that there might be some brainwashing involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, since it involves the brain, you thought of me?\" chuckling, Cait asked. \"Well, let's check her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI led Cait inside, through the clubhouse to a room where we were holding Sarah Barns and her husband, Todd. Both of them were still in the form of teenagers. With them, the rest of the group was waiting. \"Ms. Barns,\" motioning to my cousin, I said, \"this is Cait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do?\" calmly, Cait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Barns shrugged. \"My life's turned upside-down and inside-out in the past week, but I'm holding together.\" looking shaken, she said. \"Ted says you can help me unravel my past?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try.\" stepping in front of Sarah, Cait replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that work?\" curious, Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax, and trust me.\" her voice almost echoing, Cait replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two made eye contact, both of their eyes fell half open as they stood, unmoving. <i>\"That's the same look Cait had when he was in that kid's head at the mall.\"</i> mussing, I thought. <i>\"She must be in Mrs Barns' head.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed with the two unmoving as we could only watch, and hope. Then, Cait turned her head to the side, as if she were suddenly confused. \"Bad guys?\" in a flat tone, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused then rose her hands as if she were holding a rifle at Mrs Barns. <i>\"She's acting weird.\"</i> unnerved, I thought. <i>\"I wonder what's going on in their heads.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'm trying to obey, Jon.\" apologetically, Cait said. \"I want to obey but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh crap!\"</i> startled, I thought. <i>\"She's acting like she's been possessed!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I dared not say anything out loud in fear of breaking the connection and making things worse. Still, I tried to be ready for anything. Only I began to worry more as Cait's hands began to shake with a look of uncertainty on her face. \"I- I must obey.\" stammering, she said. \"Jon is my master, I am his slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Not good!\"</i> worried, I thought. <i>\"I wonder if I should try to snap her out of it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to do just that but Garth stepped forward only to pause as Cait spoke again, her hands still shaking. \"Mommy... daddy....\" tears forming, she whimpered. she then rose her hands, barely still as she blankly yelled, \"I must defend Jon! Do not come closer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what to do, Garth turned to dad to see he was just as concerned before Cait once again, quivered, crying. \"Jon... did.\" slowly, tearfully, she said, as if answering a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's gotten into Cait?\" concerned, Grace asked Garth. \"She's acting more and more like she's reliving a painful memory in Sarah's mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth turned to her and shrugged. \"You're asking me? You're the one with the supercharged brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a handgun materialized into Cait's hand and she turned to Garth, leveling it at his left shoulder. Everyone in the room froze as a sad smile formed onto her face. With a glassy look in her eyes, Cait said, \"I am sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she pulled the trigger...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Good thing the gun you teleported wasn't loaded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right,\" sighing, Cait said. \"Ms. Barns still has her programming. I took her back through her memories, and stumbled onto it. When I tried to undo it, I got trapped in the programming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed nodded. \"So we'll need to be careful around her. Rhea's not going to like that, but we can't take chances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Garth spoke up with me right behind him, \"Is she back to normal yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still bald and telepathic,\" Cait called back, \"but not homicidal. Is that close enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth stepped into the room, relieved to see Cait acting normally again. \"I'll take it.\" smiling slightly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI entered right behind Garth, almost shadowing him in fear of something else happening. I could not bear the thought of losing him.  <i>\"Had that gun been loaded,\"</i> tearful, I thought. <i>\"I don't know what I would have done.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hagen was too clever for us,\" Ted explained. \"Cait's attempt to undo Barns' programming got her into a trap. The feedback loop from her unloaded gun knocked her out and freed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to be gentle with her, Chief,\" begging, Cait said. \"She's as much a victim as you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to remember that, Cait.\" nodding, dad said. \"Thank you for the attempt. What do you want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go a few blocks away, and arrange for my driver to pick me up.\" with a rueful smile, Cait replied. \"See you guys at school tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you wouldn't rather spend the night here?\" Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait shook her head. \"I've got some personal stuff to check up on.

See you at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed unlocked the handcuffs. As Cait stood up and rubbed her wrists, Ted asked, \"What was her trigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was 'Kiss Kiss, my dear',\" I replied. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea,\" was his answer. \"I'll have the kids tell you about it tomorrow, if it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even a hint?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"Let's just say Hagen wouldn't be the first person I've dealt with who turned out to be too clever for his own good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you leave, Cait...\" smiling, I said. \"There is something about Jess, err, Clem you need to know about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clem?\" curious, Cait asked. \"What about him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a shape shifter.\" beaming, I replied. \"He also has a crush on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know about the crush but...\" downhearted, Cait said. \"Why would he date a hairless cue-ball like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled, confusing Cait, as I quickly lead her to Jess, who was now Clem again. \"You two have the same secret.\" standing between them, I said. \"I think it will help you both to know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either of them could react, I tore off their wigs, revealing both of their flawless bald heads. Both Cait and Clem gasped, seeing each other then smiled. After a moment, Clem seemed to snap out of his trance and quickly took out a notepad, scribbling down a telephone number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... call me later?\" offering the piece of paper, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait, also snapping out of her trance, shyly accepted the phone number and jotted down her own, offering it as well. \"Um... you call me, okay? I have to go to work after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mall?\" smiling, Clem asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" blushing, Cait said. \"I'm working as a living mannequin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I.\" to Cait's surprise, Clem replied. \"A salesgirl named Tracy Flynn suggested that I apply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you interviewed by a Mrs. Rachel Waite?\" looking at me, Cait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClem nodded. \"Yes, I was.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy.\" smiling, I said. \"You two are likely to end up on the same display.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Cait and Clem blushed at that as I gave them back their wigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cait later left, I wondered what Mr Jones had in mind to help Mrs Barns.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Geo opened the door and entered, closing the door behind him as we all waited. Minutes past with nothing alarming being heard before Ted knocked and peeked his head inside. \"How'd it go?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked like a charm,\" Geo replied. \"your hunch paid off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What hunch?\" confused, Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had a trigger phrase,\" Geo explained, \"which Hagen used to control you. Cait told us what it was, and we used it to shut down the mind-control system. Hagen won't be able to control you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you told me to kiss you?\" disturbed, Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeo nodded. \"That was your trigger. When I said it the first time, you went into a trance, ready for orders. If Hagen tries it again, he'll get a much different response from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded, looking relieved. \"So I'm good to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed smiled. \"We'll let you see more of the place, but they're still looking for you at your apartment. By the way, somebody's waiting to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door wider, and Rhea came in, accompanied by Clem. \"Hi, Mommy,\" she said, giving Sarah a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, sweetheart,\" Sarah replied. \"Who's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Clem,\" he said. \"Rhea's brother. This is what I usually look like. Jessica was... something of a punishment. I called Lyssa by the wrong name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, hearing that. <i>\"At least he can admit his mistakes.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk, tsk. You shouldn't have done that.\" shaking a finger, Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am. Yesterday gave me some insight into what she went through all those years. It won't happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like Jessica,\" Rhea said, pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClem chuckled. \"I meant that I won't call Alyssa the wrong name again. Maybe sometimes, I'll let Jessica out to play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He still has a good heart.\"</i> holding back a giggle, I thought. <i>\"Maybe we can let 'Jessica' out sometime.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all laughed, and Rhea told Sarah about the years since the Rodgers family adopted her. As she did, dad tapped my shoulder and pointed to the door. Getting the hint, we all walked out, allowing Sarah and her husband to have a private moment with their Rhea and Clem.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We have to be ready!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next breath, I ran out with Garth and Grace doing the same. \"DAD!!\" in unison, we screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed was up the stairs in the next breath with Geo following. \"What's wrong!?\" concerned, he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe relayed Cait's message to him and he was about to grab his smartphone when a panicked scream was heard, it was Rhea and, seeing her abilities, I guessed she got the same vision as Cait. I was in Rhea's room in a heart beat with the rest quickly following to find Rhea siting on her bed. She was shaking, wide eyed, and terrified as she looked out into the distance, crying. \"It's going to be okay, Rhea.\" as dad quickly walked off, dialing a number on his phone, Garth said. \"My dad is the chief of police, he will stop this before it happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- What about the wolves?\" still shaking, Rhea asked. \"Who will deal with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to make Rhea feel better, Garth increased in size to the size of an Olympian and made a 'muscle' pose. \"Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?\" using a bad Arnold Schwarzenegger imitation, he asked. \"I will pump him up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Rhea looked at Garth as if he was insane then giggled, seeing Clem behind him, making the same poses but with his significantly smaller body. I and the others soon giggled as well, seeing him before Garth turned to see him smiling. \"I couldn't resist.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth shook his head and smiled only it vanished when Ted walked back into the room. \"Okay, everyone, listen up.\" sternly, he said. \"I want all of you to act as if nothing is going on when you go to school but be ready for anything, understood!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all nodded then got ready for school.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Natalie was Grace's height and just as fit with long auburn hair and wild green eyes. She gave Grace a loving kiss then looked at her crossly. \"Where have you been the past couple of days!?\" worried she asked. \"It was as if you had suddenly dropped off the planet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story, Nat.\" sighing, Grace said. \"Garth was in the hospital..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" startled, Natalie said. \"Garth, are you alright!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" focusing on keeping a look out, Garth replied. \"Just a little rattled, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie frowned. \"There is more to this.\" stepping in front of Garth, she said. \"Garth, what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth sighed, turning to her. \"It would take too long to explain everything.\" quickly, he replied. \"Do you remember the Problem Child Gang mystery book series?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie nodded. \"Yeah, Grace and I love to read them together.\" confused, she said. \"What does that have to do with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jaw dropped as Garth increased to an adult size in front of her. \"The characters in that book were based on real people; Tex the mighty was our dad, Natalie.\" returning to normal size, he said. \"Grace and I... inherited those powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their enemies are real as well and we suspect they are after us.\" adding Grace. \"We needed to train so to be better prepared when they make their big push.\" tearing up, Grace added, \"Please don't think differently of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie gave Grace a passionate kiss. \"Never.\" touching her forehead onto Grace's. \"I love you, no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace smiled, grateful and kissed her before breaking away and we continued walking towards school. On the way, I quickly explained the situation to Natalie and assured her that everything would be fine. Upon entering the schoolyard, we were met by Cait Trish. \"It's okay,\" seeing their worried looks, Garth said. \"Dad's got a team in position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just act like everything's normal,\" I added, \"and the other kids won't have any reason to believe otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were soon approached by a young boy I'd seen at the clubhouse. As he got closer, a knowledgeable smile formed onto Cait's face. \"Hi, guys,\" the boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocking an eyebrow, Cait asked, \"Aren't you a little old to be hanging out at the schoolyard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did... oh, yeah, Sarah told me about you,\" he said. \"My name's Todd. I'm Sarah's fiance. We heard on the scanner that there was something going on here today, so I came to keep an eye on things. I figured a teenage boy wouldn't attract as much attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah Barns, our homeroom teacher this year.\" whispering carefully, Garth said to Natalie. \"She and her husband have certain powers as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garth is not mentioning me or the others.\" carefully, I whispered to Beth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's trying to protect us by only telling Natalie what she needs to know at the moment.\" whispering back, Beth replied. \"With the enemies our parents had, the less she knows, the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of Sarah, how is she?\" curious, Cait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fine,\" smiling, Garth said. \"Once you were gone, they used the trigger phrase against itself. Hagen will never control her again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore another word could be said, Trish screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we looked to see why, we saw a pair of wolves, snarling and snapping at every student they approached. What Rhea had explained was coming to life, wolves at the school! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get everybody inside,\" running towards the wolves, Garth said. \"I'll handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped into action, yelling to the students to get inside quickly. The panicked crowd obeyed without hesitation and I took a chance to see if Garth was okay to he him grow to Olympian size and scoop his arm under the first wolf to reach him and heaved it into the air. The animal let out a loud yelp as it crashed through the window then I yelped as I saw him jump in after him. \"Garth, be careful!\" crying out, I yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to run to his aid but I paused, curious, seeing Mr Sam Connors hurry through the window with Megan following. \"What's going on over there?\" watching, I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, I saw Garth walk out with Travis and remembered Mr Connors saying that he could transform into various animals, including Anthros. Both he and Garth were normal again and I glanced up to watch a man being taken into custody by uncle Ted and a number of policemen. I smiled before hearing someone's thoughts. Don't give him the chance. Run him down. Finish him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I ran over to Garth, full speed, hoping he was unharmed. Garth jumped, seeing me suddenly 'appear' in front of him and I wrapped my arms around his waist, relieved he was not hurt. \"Garth, I was so worried for you!\" almost in tears, I said. \"When I saw you go after that wolf, I... I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as I ran to him, Garth pulled me into a long, passionate kiss. Cheers from fellow students rose around us but I could only hear my own low moan as fireworks went off in my mind. I had wanted this moment to come forever; I slowly closed my eyes, not wanting the kiss to ever end. When we finally broke the kiss, I sighed, a dream like look forming on my face. \"Never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth chuckled and kissed me again, this time I heard the students cheering. \"I was officially Garth's girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Life doesn't get much sweeter than this.\"</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was almost sorry when we parted to go to our lockers. Only, as I was placing my purse into my locker, I heard Cait's voice in my head. <i>*We need to talk, Lyssa.*</i> she said. <i>*Take the first hall to your right, I'm in the third room to your left.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Cait's mental directions and entered an empty class room where I found her. \"What's up?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all,\" smiling, Cait said, \"congratulations on your first kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, almost blushing, touching my lips. \"You saw that, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What with that disturbance this morning, most of the school saw it.\" still smiling, Cait said. \"Congratulations, again. I hope it's the first of many.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't get over it.\" dreamily, I said. \"My lips are still tingling from it.\" I took a breath, to focus my thoughts. \"You said there was something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait nodded, turning serious. \"Some of my old friends - ex-friends, I should say - are plotting against you.\" looking at Lyssa, I said. \"They're figuring out some way to expose you in front of the whole school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Expose me?\" curious, I asked. \"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For getting a kiss from the strongest guy in the school, even though you were born the way you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding what she meant, I nodded. \"Greg,\" I muttered. \"Well,\" I said in my normal voice, \"if they try, they'll be the ones in for a surprise. But thanks for the heads-up. Now I can't wait for PE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you figure?\" curious, Cait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before, I had to dress and undress off in some corner away from the other girls.\" smiling, I replied. \"If do they try something soon, it might just put me in with the others that much faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait gave me a hug. \"Sorry for the way I acted before, cousin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not just cousins, Cait,\" hugging her back, I replied. \"We're members of the new Problem Child Gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hugging for a moment, we hurried to homeroom where I noticed all of the members of the new gang were seated together with Sarah Barns our homeroom teacher. As I sat down, I noticed a goth girl named Lilith Nightshade. She and I were not exactly friends but I admired her for the courage she always showed, not caring what others thought of her. I wondered how she would react to the news I was now a real girl. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw her look at me with a bit of surprise before a thin smile formed onto her face. <i>\"I guess she saw that kiss too.\"</i> blushing a little, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to East Shore High School, class.\" smiling, Sarah said. \"For those who had not yet met me, I am Sarah Barns and I will be your homeroom teacher.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then I whispered in his ear, \"I had hoped that, when you saw me naked, we'd be the only ones in the room.\"</span></div></div>",

Once done, they were all shown face down, no matter which side you looked at, ready to be read and shown to all. Everyone's jaws dropped in shock, including my own. Lilith, looking more shocked than the rest of us, lost her grip on the deck she was holding and they fell from her hands.

Once she was before them, staring into the camp fire, the young woman walked up and placed her hands onto Madeline's shoulders, staring into her eyes as the others formed a circle around them. They all began to chant with Madeline reciting it with them, though she had never heard it before. As they did, a light, glowing mist bellowed from the woman's mouth and entered Madeline's mouth, causing them both to glow with an eerie light. Madeline stared in horror as the woman became older and older before her eyes. Finally, the chanting stopped and the once young woman was not nothing more than dust, blowing in the light wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... happened?\" trembling with terror, Madeline asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our sister has passed to the next realm.\" solemnly, one of the cloaked figures replied. \"She had no children to pass her power onto so she has chosen and entrusted you to to be that daughter she never had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her knowledge, her wisdom, and her power is now your own.\" added a second hooded figure. \"Use your gifts wisely.\" she then smiled. \"Welcome to the coven sisterhood.\"<br>\r\n.............................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVague wiped the tears from her eye. \"I had lost my mother when I was young and watched a woman who had chosen me as a daughter she never had die before my eyes.\" emotionally, she said. \"I had vowed make her proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" awestruck, I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVague nodded. \"My first husband, Darren, and I fell in love quickly and did not consult the cards before marrying him.\" looking slightly ashamed, she said. \"That brings us to Dr Thomas Vague.\" she paused to force a smile. \"He was our family doctor and always defended me when he could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, mom.\" taking in every word, Lilith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One night, Darren had beat me senseless and left to get even more drunk. I called Dr Vague and he came over to tend to my wounds.\" her smile vanishing, Vague replied. \"As he was treating me, Darren returned, found the two of us together, and went into a rage. He mortally wounded Dr Vague with his hunting knife.\" she cried freely. \"That was when I had enough and used my magick on him. One punch sent him through the closed door, across the hall, and through the wall into the room beyond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom... one punch!?\" her eyes widening to saucers, Lilith asked. \"That could have killed him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I learned that magick can not kill.\" almost regretful, Vague said. \"Still, to this day, he fears me when I become angry.\" she sighed. \"I then turned my attention onto Dr Vague and consulted the cards to find a way to save him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't find a way, though.\" sadly, Lilith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't.\" shaking her head, Vague replied. \"But I did find a way to help him carry on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made love to him as he died?\" stunned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honored his last request as a debt of honor, Lilith.\" sternly, mom replied. \"He wanted... a family.

Finally, a small smile slowly formed onto Lilith's face. \"My dad sounds like an incredible man.\" dreamily, she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVague smiled. \"He was.\" she then turned to mom. \"The Agency may be after my daughter and I for my involvement with the Problem Child Gang twenty years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible.\" admitted mom. \"You did help us in your own mysterious ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to join the new gang?\" offering my hand to Lilith, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith turned to the cards, causing me to frown slightly, before she turned back to me. \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With that new color, you look a lot like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait smiled. \"That's why I picked it out. How you doing, cuz?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot better,\" hugging her, I replied. Turning to Clem, I added, \"I had quite a day today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I hear,\" Clem replied. \"What all happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief Jones and his men took down that guy who was going to shoot at us. Turns out he was Clarence Mayweather, one of the guys the original Problem Child Gang tangled with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have quite the history,\" sighing, mom said. \"He was the one who put me in this chair, trying to kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that,\" blushing slightly, I continued, \"I got my first kiss from Garth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations,\" Clem said. \"But you didn't get sent home because of a kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy expression turned serious. \"A couple girls at school got jealous of all the attention I was getting, so they pulled my pants down in P.E. Don't worry, they've been punished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning, mom seemed very quiet. She only did this when something was seriously wrong. I asked her about it but she told me that it was nothing for me to worry about. I asked Beth if she knew anything but she was just as much in the dark as I was. \"Something happened, Beth.\" worried, I said. \"Did you ask your spirit guide, Beatriz if she knew anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did but Beatriz would only say that history repeats when no one listens.\" shaking her head, Beth replied. \"With the history of our family and the rest of the gang, that could mean anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd better keep our eyes open for anything, then.\" trying to sound confident, I said. \"Two of our houses have already been attacked and we know two others are being watched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth nodded. \"Clem said that he saw a black van outside his house.\" softly, she said. \"Then Megan mentioned that she saw a black van in the parking lot of the hospital while she was there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting serious, sis.\" gulping, I said. \"Watch yourself at school, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too.\" fearful, Beth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and I exchanged a quick hug before we headed out for school. \"See you this afternoon, mom.\" giving her a kiss, I said. \"Is Sam still in bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed and pointed up. I looked and giggled, seeing Sam sleeping on the ceiling. Beth saw him as well and laughed. \"Hey, Sammy!\" loudly, she called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam let out a small shriek for fright before falling down into mom's arms. \"Morning, sleepy head.\" cooing, mom said. \"You can't be sleeping on the ceiling, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It comfy.\" rubbing his eyes, Sam protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed then turned to Beth and I. \"Be careful going to school, girls.\" softly, she said. \"We will be packing when you get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, packing?\" worried, I asked. \"Mom, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not taking any chances, Alyssa.\" serious, mom replied. \"We are all moving to the SUB station until further notice, end of discussion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken back by mom's tone, I asked. \"What about the mansion headquarters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom teared up and rolled away from us, taking Sam with her. It was then, I had a feeling what had happened and it was hitting mom hard. I took a step to comfort her but Beth pulled me back. \"I have a feeling she needs her space right now.\" sadly, she said. \"We'll dig for answers at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In homeroom at school, I noticed that Gar seemed on edge about something. That was proof enough for me that something drastic had happened. Judging by how upset mom got when I mentioned the old mansion headquarters, I deduced that it was the mansion was hit. Thus the need to move to the SUB station as it was not mentioned in the graphic novels. <i>\"The Agency is getting bolder.\"</i> worried, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first two classes went remarkably smooth and I gradually began to relax. When third period P.E. came around, all the girls in the class piled into the girls' locker room. I was about to head around the corner, as I always had, but one of the girls stopped me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got extra lockers here, Lyssa.\" smiling, she said. \"Why not join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" surprised, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" pulling me out of the corner, the girl countered. \"After all, you're as much a girl as any of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said another, greeting me. \"And if Bitch one and Bitch two don't like it when they get back...\" she placed a hand onto her hip. \"...that's their problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, feeling my confidence rising, and found a vacant locker. \"I suppose none of us are going to see anything we don't already have.\" looking at the other girls, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't go that far,\" Lilith replied. \"I mean, so far, I'm the only girl in the locker room with a third nipple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever tension there was left in the room dissipated in the laughter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch, still worried about what was going on, I decided to visit Lilith's table where she was talking to her two goth friends, Julie and Mel. \"Hi, Lilith. Can I ask you something?\" nervous, I asked. \"I mean, private?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Lyssa. It's okay, you can trust Julie and Mel.\" motioning to her two friends, Lilith said. \"They've been my friends forever. They introduced me to goth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down next to Lilith. \"Can you really see the future with your cards?\" looking at her, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've never steered me wrong,\" confidently, Lilith replied. \"I've misinterpreted once or twice, but they've never lied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do they see for me and Garth?\" trying not to sound like I was fishing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith smiled then shuffled her cards under the table. I guessed it was so nobody would see the cards flying around on their own. \"I'll do a three-card spread,\" bringing up the cards, she explained. \"This first card will represent you.\" she turned the card over. \"The Empress. She symbolizes abundance, creation, and fertility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed hard. \"My ancestor had 14 children. I seem to be taking after her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith nodded. \"Well, this card means you probably won't need medical help when you decide to have children.\" smiling, she said. \"However, if you don't want to get pregnant, you'll need to take matters into your own hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Lilith then turned over a card, she stated was for Garth. \"Strength. The big cats symbolize the practical, assertive, or even aggressive side of his nature.\" pointing at the card, Lilith explained. \"The woman signifies a strong feminine influence. Under her guidance, he finds a peace and power he's never imagined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last card, I guessed, represented Garth and my future together. \"The Ten of Cups. The dog and cat symbolize unconditional love.\" looking at me, Lilith said. \"The blazing hearth symbolizes warmth, comfort, and safety. The ten chalices represent the emotions and relationships that will bring you to this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, feeling a sense of relief. \"So, things will work out between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what he wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all turned when Mel spoke. \"When Mom found out she was pregnant, my dad said he was heading out for a carton of cigarettes. That's the last anyone saw or heard from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith winced and I guessed she did not know that about her friend. \"I'm sorry, Mel.\" softly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel sighed. \"It's really hurt with the cancer.\" tearing up, she said. \"Mom said my college fund was eaten up by my medical bills. I don't know what I'm going to do when I finish high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you need?\" came a feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody expected Cait Spencer to show up at our table. \"What did you say?\" surprised, Mel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of schooling did you want after high school?\" Cait replied. \"Find out how much it'll cost, and I'll pay for it. I didn't mean to interrupt, but I came to tell Lyssa something, and I couldn't help overhearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't do that,\" Mel said. \"I'd never be able to pay you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" was Cait's reply. \"Do you know how many millions I'd have to give you before I started to feel it? Don't worry about the money. I've learned it's like fertilizer: Spread it around, and beautiful things come to light. Keep it in one place, and everyone knows where you live, but everybody thinks you stink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were all floored by Cait's generosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you want to tell me?\" breaking the silence, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. You're not going to believe this, but Amber McReady wants to see both of us after school.\" turning to me, Cait replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What does she want to see me for?\" surprised, I asked. \"Did she say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't say. Don't worry, though.\" serious, Cait replied. \"She knows we're cousins, and she knows I won't let anything happen to you, if I can stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith gave us both a questioning look then turned to her Tarot deck. I could tell she could sense something but it was impossible to tell what it was. Then I heard Beatriz whispering in my mind as she said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Amber is experiencing her ancestry.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, I had a good idea why Amber wanted to see us, I just hoped I was wrong. After school...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After school, Cait had James drive her, Lilith and I to Amber's house. \"Please wait here in case I need you.\" firmly but kindly, Cait said. \"I have a bad feeling about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\" fingering his sidearm, James replied. \"I will be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you had a bad feeling about this, why are we here?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a bad feeling Amber is in trouble, not us.\" frowning, Cait replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith shuddered. \"I'm feeling it now.\" producing her Tarot card deck, she said. \"I have a bad feeling Amber is not alone in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a scream was heard from inside, it was Amber's but it seemed strange somehow. Cait ran forward and thrust her hand outward; an invisible force reduced the door to splinters. We all ran inside to find a man kicking and punching Amber all around the living room with her vainly struggling against him. Acting quickly, Lilith pulled a card from her deck. \"Knight of Swords, defend Amber McReady!\" tossing the card into the air, she commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a puff of smoke and a knight on a horse appeared on the front lawn before it took off after a black van with tinted windows. \"What...\" puzzled, she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You commanded the knight to defend Amber McReady!\" her eyes widening, Cait said. \"That's not her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the man stopped attacking the girl and landed a punch onto Cait, sending her stumbling as the girl suddenly went after me!  She threw a series of fast kicks and chops, forcing me onto the defensive as his attacks were in too quick of succession for me to use my super speed. All I could do was dodge and back away, looking for room to move as the unknown girl kept kicking at my legs, getting a lot of hits in, making it hard to keep my balance. I made a mental note to thank dad for his martial arts lessons as, otherwise, I would not have had any chance at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was fighting the unknown girl, I was too preoccupied to notice Cait's driver turn onto Lilith with a wet cloth but I could smell chloroform, making me panic. <i>\"Shit, they must have hit Amber when she called!\"</i> frightened and angry, I thought. <i>\"They were expecting us and set a trap!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made me very worried for Amber as I struggled to save myself but then I noticed, through a window, a man in medieval armor walk into view with Amber and slam a heavy fist onto a man's head. He was wearing a chauffeur's uniform but he was not the man who had driven us to Amber's house. <i>\"It was a trap...\"</i> my blood boiling, I thought. <i>\"And this... girl is working for them!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I lost it and began to send a fury of kicks and punches of my own but at a speed much faster than the other girl could follow. My legs were bruised and sore from all the hits they got from her but I was still able to force her into the wall where I began to pummel her with enough rapid kicks to every part of her body, pinning her to the wall, literally sending her into convulsions. I was not using my full strength as I did not want to kill her but I kept her pinned to the wall with the sheer force of my mad counter attack as to send a clear message that this girl won't take getting attacked laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for only a few seconds before I head Lilith scream, \"Lyssa, that's enough! She's had it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped a few seconds after hearing her and watched as the girl slowly slumped to the floor, softly moaning in pain.  \"I wasn't hitting her hard.\" limping towards Lilith, I protested. \"The first thing she attacked was my legs, I couldn't kick with my full strength if I tried right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Cait, I smiled, shaking my head. She had a rueful smile on her face as she stood over the man who had attacked her. He was sitting on the floor, babbling happily like a newborn baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their trying to weaken us.\" fearful, Lilith mussed. \"I had to use two cards at once to protect Amber and myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to Lilith, my jaw dropped in shock. \"Is that... Amber!?\" stunned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so.\" wincing, Lilith replied. \"She's hoping we can help her figure out what's causing this.\" she then quickly added, \"There's more, James was not our driver. It was someone else and he managed to get close, too close, without any of us realizing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not good.\" shaking her head, Cait said. \"We can't stay here.\" she then turned to Amber. \"I'm afraid you will have to come with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we going to get to... where ever we are going?\" curious, Amber asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she moaned slightly then sighed as her body changed back into a girl before their eyes. \"I'm back...\" relief in her voice, she said. \"I'm beautiful again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait sighed then pulled out her cellphone and dialed a number. A moment later, someone picked up. As it was on speakerphone, we all heard James' voice. \"James here...\" in a strained voice, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James. are you okay, you're not injured or anything?\" urgently, Cait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a bump on the head.\" after a moan, James replied. \"Where are you, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fine but we need pick up, bring the fastest car you can snag.\" she gave the address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she ended the call, Lilith turned to Amber. \"This is not over.\" firmly but kindly, she said as I pulled out my cellphone and dialed Ted Jones' number. \"Those goons will be back and, for whatever reason, they want you as badly as they want us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber gulped. \"But why!?\" trembling, she asked. \"What do I have anyone could possibly want!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what we have to figure out.\" seriously, Lilith replied.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The opposite seems to be happening to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is this happening?\" tearing up, Amber asked. \"What did you do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of us did anything,\" serious, Lilith said. \"The seeds for this were sown long ago, and I don't know how to find the answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Beth can,\" after a thought, I said. \"I'll ask her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will have to wait,\" Ted inserted. \"If Amber is at risk, we need to take action to protect her.\" turning to Amber, he said, \"Call your parents, collect anything you'll need. I'll need to bring you to the S.U.B. Station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs other police officers arrived on the scene, Ted urged Amber to call her parents. \"They are not going to believe me.\" frowning, she muttered. \"What am I going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave that to me.\" a familiar voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all turned to find Madame Vague. <i>\"Where did she come from!?\"</i>  Vague gently taking Amber's phone from her. \"May I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber nodded, dumbfounded as Vague then dialed a number. A few rings later, a woman answered. \"Amber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blessed be, sister Tonya.\" gently, mom said. \"Our mutual enemies have targeted Amber and tried to kidnap her; my daughter and her friends foiled the attempt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled response came from the phone. I could not hear what was said but Amber's mother sounded understandably upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be at peace, Tonya.\" calmly, Vague said. \"Amber is just fine but Tex feels we should move her to the substation for her own protection.\" after a pause, she added, \"She is showing the signs of becoming a guardian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what!?\" confused, I thought. \"What is a guardian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just started, from what I can see.\" eying Amber, Vague said to a muffled response. she then gave Lilith a glance and began to talk in a language I did not recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not very sporting of you, Madame Vague.\" frowning, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ending the call, Vague turned to Ted who was returning from the house. From the look on his face, I knew that the three who had attacked us were already long gone. \"It was Vendetta and Psyche.\" with a growl, he said. \"They both got away but we have their flunky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Vendetta and Psyche?\"</i> curious, I thought. then I remembered the two named were mentioned a few times in the graphic novels. <i>\"They must have powers like our own.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't talk, Ted.\" softly, Vague warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Madame Vague.\" frowning deeper, Ted replied. \"Its not like the old days where we can scare what we want out of those we catch, I have to follow the letter of the law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, we all arrived at the substation with Amber, who was still shaken by the sudden darkness when Lilith used the moon card to get us there. \"It took me by surprise as well.\" urging Amber out of mom's car, she said. \"Welcome to the Subterranean Urban Base station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really existed!?\" startled, Amber asked. \"Does that mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief Jones was Tex the mighty.\" serious, Lilith replied. \"All of it was real, including the Agency, who attacked you today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did your mom know my mother?\" still rattled, Amber asked. \"Is there anything else I should know about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, there is.\" walking into view, Mrs Jones said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to find her walking towards us with Garth and Grace following, leading a short and thin thirteen year old boy with longish sand blond hair and green eyes. <i>\"Who is this?\"</i> curious, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blessed be, Mrs Jones and family.\" kindly, Lilith said. \"Who is your new friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather smiled. \"Everyone, I'd like you to meet the newest member of our family.\" motioning to the small boy, she said. \"This is Tim Jones, he was an orphan from Europe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense you were in the hands of the Agency.\" serious, Lilith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was but he was not brainwashed.\" cutting in, Cait said. \"His mind is free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and I have already met him.\" smiling, mom said. \"He has the strange power to make anything he draws come to life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't we meet him earlier?\" confused, Lilith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I bet he was too shy or too nervous.\"</i> seeing the boy's sheepish smile, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, child,\" patiently, Vague replied, \"he was too scared to come out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We convinced him you were all cool.\" placing a firm hand onto his shoulder, Garth chimed in. \"These are my friends, little bro, you couldn't be in safer hands.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amazona, Princess of Power!\" finishing his line, the woman said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held back a giggle as this Amazon was six feet tall, with breasts that looked like she was smuggling basketballs under her skin tight costume. <i>\"Is he kidding?\"</i> amused, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith snorted. \"Yeah, you came up with that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" confused, the 'woman' asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you try moving around off the printed page,\" Lilith explained, \"those bazongas are going to be more of a hindrance than a help. They block your field of vision, they'll restrict your arm movement, and they'll make you fall over the second your back isn't straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya, Tim,\" Grace added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame Vague, I noticed as doing well to stifle a giggle of her own. She caught my eye and winked at me. \"This child has little to no experience with real women.\" carefully, she whispered. \"He will need guidance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, Amazona, tried moving around, and quickly saw that we weren't joking. \"I see your point, younglings,\" she said. \"I am sure the artist sees it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim doesn't just change physically,\" Garth explained. \"The characters he creates come alive as he envisions them. So you're really talking to a character in a comic book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazona touched the paper again, and a sheepish Tim stood before us. \"Thanks for the advice,\" he said. \"I'll definitely redesign her before I call on her again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do that,\" Grace said. \"And, please, stop making her costume rip in strategic places in battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled, hoping no one had heard me.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When the light faded, I was overjoyed to see my friends and Ted Jones standing in the living room with us. \"Everyone, pick an opponent,\" Ted commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the troublemaker from before,\" said one, closing in on Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stand still, missy,\" said the other. \"We'll make this short and painless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyssa!\" grabbing my arms, dad called. \"Machine gun kick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine gun kick was an attack dad dreamed up to make use of my super speed. I had used it on the girl who had attacked me earlier and, as dad swung me around the four men surrounding us, I used it again, kicking the bad guys dozens of times as I passed each person, sending them to the floor, moaning, unable to cause us any further trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Beth?\" looking around, I asked. \"What happened to her!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard a scream and turned just in time to see a man literally flying out of Beth's bedroom before slamming into the wall and slide to the floor unmoving. The ghostly figure of a tall and muscular woman stepped out behind him then turned in my direction. It was Beatriz, Beth's spirit guide! She smiled, winking at me, before vanishing from sight as a shaken Beth walked out into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, sis?\" worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Define okay.\" tearing up, Beth said. \"Our home is being invaded...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought some help.\" motioning to the fight in the living room, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick up brass!\" called one of the Agents. They all activated devices on their wrists and disappeared, leaving the house in shambles and a small pile of ruined weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was trying to help mom back into her wheel chair when Amber walked up and offered his hand. I accepted and the two of us managed to get mom Mom back into her seat while Sam came down. He was shaken, still crying, but otherwise unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody okay?\" Lilith called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks that way,\" Ted said. \"Hey, we scored a bonus. When these guns were chopped, it must have damaged whatever lets them teleport. We can finally get a look at their tech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sent someone disguised as me,\" rubbing my hand, I said. \"Her problem was, she moved too slowly. A few dozen punches per second, and she didn't see them coming.\" then I thought, <i>\"Thank goodness Sam can tell the real me from a faker.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then turned my attention to the former Amber. \"Thanks for the help, Amber. Though it sounds funny calling you that at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I'll think of something,\" shrugging, 'Amber' said. \"I guess I'm finding out what life was like for you, huh? Sorry I was such a pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like they say, what doesn't kill me makes me stronger,\" shrugging, I replied. I then gave Amber a hug. \"Thanks again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" smiling, Amber said. he paused. \"Boy, you smell nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks, but I already have a boyfriend.\" blushing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" breaking the hug, Amber said. \"Guess I've got a lot to get used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention, everyone,\" Ted called. \"Given the current situation, we think it's best that we all relocate to the S.U.B. Station until things blow over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got the phone tree started,\" serious, mom added. \"So, for those of you already at the station, you're all going to have company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's cell phone rang, and he checked it. \"Cassie,\" she said. \"We usually get together about this time, but I'm not at my house. And if she went there, she's probably seen what a wreck it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me talk to her,\" Ted said. \"Hello? Hello, Cassie, this is Chief Jones. Yes, we're aware of what happened at Amber's house. She and her family are safe, and they've been relocated. I'll see that she gets your call, and I'm sure that she'll return it as soon as possible. Just remember that she's going through a lot right now. More than you know. Alright. Goodbye.\" He returned Amber's phone to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Amber said. \"Now I just have to figure out how to explain all this to her. When I change back, it won't be all the way. Who knows what I'll look or sound like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe start with texting,\" Lilith suggested. \"Let her know as much as you're comfortable with. She will need to know what's happening to you, though. If you were to keep it secret from her, she'd want to know where her friend went, and where this guy came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Sam.\" cooing my little brother, I whispered. \"The bad guys are gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sniffled a little. \"De wuined my icecweam.\" pouting, she mumbled. \"Tupid bad guys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shared a smile with mom...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From what I've seen, we've got plenty of space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll need it,\" Susan said. \"You know that Asian girl who just started at our school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Narrow face, close-set eyes, high cheekbones, doesn't talk to anybody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan nodded. \"Her name's Mindy Saotome.

Then she got called to the principal's office.\" She started sniffling. \"Her grandpa died, and she had to hear about it from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad went to hug her. \"It'll be okay, hon,\" he said. \"Let's us go somewhere and talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they left, Beth asked, \"Did you know three people died digging this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dear,\" Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're still walking around down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the three of them went off, and I got to look after Sam.</span></div></div>",

Still, I managed to keep my cool and smiled at him. \"Stop crying and I will tell you.\" calmly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stopped crying for a moment and looked at me, curious. <i>\"At least I got his attention.\"</i> pausing, I thought. <i>\"I wonder how mom deals with him.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why won't you wet me see?\" pouting, Sam demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I have to keep you safe.\" calmly, I replied. \"That humming may be something bad and you don't want to go near anything bad, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam pouted more. \"No.\" reluctantly, he said. \"But the hum no stop, it a-no-yang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at Sam's attempt to say 'annoying'. \"Is it still humming?\" smiling, I asked. Sam nodded. \"Then it will not hurt you to wait until mom and dad get back and check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to me, Beth was sitting on a bench with mom and dad a few halls away when she suddenly lifted her head, startled. \"What was that!?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom listened carefully and gasped. \"It sounds like... machinery.\" whispering, she said. \"But it has a strange pitch, almost like a jet engine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad listened but shook his head. \"I don't hear anything.\" whispering himself, he said. he then placed a hand against the wall for a moment. \"The wall is shaking very slightly but that might be from the traffic high above us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hearing voices.\" shivering, Beth whispered. \"Their coming from the closed off area.\" she pointed to an unfinished tunnel, adding, \"Maybe twenty or thirty yards in but I don't see anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay here with your mother.\" serious, dad said. \"I'll check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You- You shouldn't go alone.\" frightened, Beth said. \"Let me go with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who will look after your mom?\" turning to Beth, dad asked. he managed a smile. \"Don't forget, I am very capable of defending myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth stepped forward to give dad a hug but screamed as the floor beneath her gave way, sending her falling into a vertical shaft! She heard dad yell her name before she broke though some dirt to find herself free falling in a much larger tunnel. She screamed again but gasped as something stopped her quick descent and slowly lowered her to the floor. \"Th-Thank you.\" not knowing who she was thanking, she said. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Xenophon.\" replied a deep voice. \"You may call me Zen, if you find it easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth looked around her, hoping to see her rescuer but froze in a stunned state of awe upon seeing what only could have been described as a massive alien ship! It was V shaped, heavily damaged from what she could see, but she could not determine its true size. Much of it was buried and she guessed it had slammed into the Earth centuries ago. \"Is... Was that your ship, Zen?\" gulping, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was.\" flatly, Zen replied. \"I am what you might call an artificial intelligence, the ships computer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thank you for saving me.\" shaking, Beth said. \"I better try to get back to my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no safe way for your frail form to return to the tunnels above you.\" in an even tone, Zen said. \"I suggest you make use of the teleportation unit two hundred and eighty feet ahead of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth look forward and saw what looked like a long open tube with glowing lights on the top and bottom of it, looking like something from a science fiction movie. Only, between her and the tube were literally hundreds of ghostly alien forms. She gulped, not knowing what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What do you need to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are bound here, my crewmates and I.

Perhaps what holds you here holds them, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you free us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I return to where I came from, I will tell others, and we will try to help all of you. However, it will take some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien sighed. \"Time, human, is one thing we have in great supply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Beth made her way to the teleporter. \"Energize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not understand,\" Zen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.

It came on, showing camera images all over the city. One showed a number of strange hovering platforms, moving into the center of the city. He hit another button, filling the screen with that image. What they saw was Sykes and a number of his followers on five strange floating platforms, firing what looked like sci-fi laser rifles at random buildings. Dad focused the camera image on a man on the lead platform before a low growl echoed from his throat. The man was tall with longish brown hair and piercing green eyes. He was wearing oddly ancient leather armor as he held a laser rifle of his own while holding the hilt of a sword at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sykes!\" anger in his voice, he said. \"He's returned and he is attacking the city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why!?\" angry as well, Garth asked. \"What could he possibly gain by...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bait.\" flatly, Geo said. \"He's trying to draw us into the open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- What are we going to do?\" worried, Lyssa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll handle this.\" serious, Ted said. \"Its us he wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not alone, you're not!\" firmly, Garth said. \"We are the new Problem Child Gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a bunch of kids with no real experience in taking down criminals!\" snapping, Ted countered. \"All of you will stay here!\" he then turned to Tim. \"I need you, however, to come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim gulped. \"Me?\" surprised, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"I'll explain on the way to the surface.\" serious, he said. he then turned to the other parents and nodded before leaving the room with them following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I watched them leave, I realized I was facing my first real command decision....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Get in the car; NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all rushed out through the front entrance of the mall to find Chief Jones outside a strange looking grey four door car. Right behind him, mom stopped with a strange white car! She honked her horn and frantically waved us to her! \"Hurry, kids!\" Urgency in her voice, she screamed. \"Run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all ran for our parent's cars with Caitlin behind us! She breathed a sigh of relief seeing a black limousine with a tall dark figure holding the back door open. \"Please, Miss Spencer!\" Firmly, he urged, time is short!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone knows where to go!\" Firmly, Chief Jones barked. \"Move! Move! Move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped into the front seat while Beth hopped into the back. The second the doors were closed, mom floored the accelerator and we were off like a rocket! Chief Jones drove towards the Forefather's bridge while mom raced towards Settler's Airport. Glancing in the passenger's rear view mirror, I saw Caitlin's limo racing down the old back roads behind Our Founder's mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on, mom?!\" Worried, Beth demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's what I, we all feared from the start, kids!\" Racing down the street, mom replied. \"The Agency has discovered your talents!\" She sobbed slightly. \"I will not lose you to them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth and I exchanged startled looks before Beth looked out the back window and gasped. \"We have company!\" Startled, she announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back to find an ominous black four door car chasing after us on the empty road leading to the airport. \"That's them!\" Her voice quivering, mom yelled. \"Everyone hang on! We'll be in the clear shortly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the clear?\" Confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled before saying, \"I was always good at escapes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, a plane swooped down over them and made heavy contact with the roof of the car! In the next breath, we were air-born, flying way out of the reach of the pursuing car!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled as she picked up a a CB mike. \"Nice timing, Frank!\" Calmly, she said. \"It's a good thing we all still keep in touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only wish I could have been there with you all in the beginning.\" Dad responded through the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are one of us now.\" Smiling, mom replied. \"You know where we have to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going, mom?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled at me. \"We are going to a place we called...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I watched in disbelief as a lift raised her into the plane holding the car. Shortly after, the lift came back down with Sam sleeping soundly in a car seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have two minutes to get into the driver's seat, young lady.\" Scolding, mom said. \"I hope you were paying attention when dad gave you those driving lessons last year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened as the roof of the car closed. Moving in a blur, I secured Sam into the front passenger seat then took my place behind the wheel of the car. \"Hang on, Beth!\" Frightened, I yelled, I think we're about to get dropped off, literally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth gripped the seat belt that was fastened around her as the plane swooped down towards Nowhere, an abandoned addition to Waterfront City that was standing over an abandoned coal mine. The plane came close to the ground before the car was released. Beth and I screamed as I struggled with the steering wheel before bringing the car to a stop right in front of the coal mine entrance. The plane flew back up heading towards the dense forests of New York state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a rush!\" Shaking, I breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to check if Sam was alright. He was still fast asleep; typical. I turned to look at Beth; she was unharmed but just as shaken as I felt. I jumped when my cellphone then rang and quickly answered. \"How could you just leave us here?!\" Distraught, I demanded. \"We want to help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a remote control in the glove compartment, Alyssa.\" Firmly, mom responded. \"Press the button; everything will become clear then.\" Dad then ended the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, I tossed my cellphone onto the dashboard and threw open the glove compartment. I found the remote; it was a garage opener. Curiosity raising above my anger, I pressed the button and found the boards covering the entrance to the coal mine open like a garage door. \"Woah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning on the headlights, I drove in with the door closing behind us. The road before us spiraled down into the mine but at a gentle slope. Upon reaching the bottom, we found ourselves in a small parking lot where we stopped the car. \"I don't believe it!\" Whispering, I said. \"The clubhouse was not a mansion in the woods like the comics depicted. The clubhouse is really...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I began hitting numbers at blinding speed, trying every combination I could think of. Within a minute, I hit the right code which was ironically my birth date. A beep was heard and a panel opened revealing a key lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Sarcastically, I said. I turned to Beth. \"Do you know how to pick a lock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth sighed. \"I can try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to hand Sam over to me when he woke up.

In his tiny hand was a key on a chain. \"She said it let you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took the key as Beth continued to hold him and pushed it into the lock. With one turn, the lock clicked and I pulled it out. The instant I did, a section of the wall moved and we walked into a large circular room with passageways leading in practically every direction. Upon looking at it, I recognized it from the graphic comic book series. \"This is the maze hall.\" Almost whispering, I said. \"Every passage leads to a different part of the clubhouse.\" I sighed, turning to Beth. \"I can either run through each passage and hope to get lucky and not get lost or we can rely on your clairvoyance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth winced. \"Either way its a gamble.\" Softly, she said. \"I have not really put my senses to the test outside of contacting our ancestors.

I live in a town near Los Angeles Calfifornia, around the San Franando Valley. I'm 13 years old and currently attending middle school with my friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the things that people have picked on me about is my rather odd appearance. I am male, I assure you that. However, my body frame is rather small, and my face is, for lack of a better word, \"delicate\" in appearance. Often at times, people will treat me like a girl, even though I don't act like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBullies often do it to me, and some girls get in on it as well. My friends and family, thankfully, support me. I'm very much grateful for their support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for my appearance, I have short strawberry-blonde hair, blue eyes, about 5'7 in height. I'm not a twig by any means, just a little underdeveloped for a male my age. Puberty has been a little slow for me, that's all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have a younger brother and sister, and two parents. All normal for a family. My siblings often tease me a bit on my appearance as well, but it's mostly just good fun and I can laugh with them about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, often one things disturbs me, my family, and friends. I often have these black-outs, and nobody knows why they happen. To the doctors, I'm perfectly healthy. It hasn't been a huge concern, but I often wonder. Another thing that the school has seemed to notice is that I somehow disappear when there's trouble around. This has also lead to some memory lapses for me. Kind of much to take in, I know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo I disappear? I'm not sure. It's kind of maddening when you think of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, little did I know what was to happen. A lot of the other students call me a 'problem child' as I seem to know a lot about their personal lives.. too much for comfort, so I hear. It never made sense to me. Nor did I realize that all of this would change me, both figuratively and literally, in a sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it all started with what I saw next:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today was September 15, just a few weeks after school started. Lunch had began and I ate my lunch with my friends at our usual table. However, after I finished, I excused myself, needing to clear my head. Luckily, my friends didn't judge me by how odd I acted. They accepted me, faults and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would I do without them,\" I laughed to myself, as I took a small walk around the school. Lunch time lasted quite a while so I was in good shape for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if only I could solve my memory issues,\" I whispered to ymself. Truth be told, there was something else that bugged me. I would often have these wierd dreams, knowing stuff about people that I shouldn't know. It was so wierd. For example, there was this one girl from a year back who still collects dolls at her age. I actually told her about that, and she was shocked at how someone would know this secret about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, I stayed away from her and neglected to tell mostly others about it. However, I sometimes had a tendency to speak out about something I learned. That's why most people find me a bit creepy, because I know things about them I shouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could it be?\" I asked myself. However, something grabbed my attention instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone!\" yelled a small feminine voice. I turned to my left and looked out over a corner, near the school doors. There was a little girl there, probably around 10 years old. With her, there was a big guy, possibly my age or older. However, he seemed to be picking on the poor girl, grabbing her hair and laughing it off. I really didn't like seeing such injustice. That girl likely had a parent nearby who was briefly busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that I should help her, but what can I do? I'm not very strong, but how can I leave this girl alone with a bully like him? My heart told me to go, but my brain had other ideas. However, the heart was winning. I couldn't just stand there and watch the girl get hurt. With some courage (and an odd force welling within me), I slowly approached them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both were too busy to notice or hear me as I approached. I began to extend my hand out, ready to tap the bully on the shoulder and tell him to back off. As I approached them, a small wave of dust seemed to swirl in front of me. Suddenly, I felt a little nauseated, and my vision began to blur. Bad time to come down with something, but I continued onward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached out and grabbed the bully's shoulder, before my world went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Change*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, back off my sister!\" I yelled at the bully and turned him around to face me. I was mad right now. How dare he pick on a little girl, let alone my sister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex!\" yelled Tania, and she ran behind me while I covered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we were just having some harmless fun\" said the boy, nonchalantly. I resisted the urge to kick him in his you-know-whats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay away. Don't come near her again\" I said as calmly as I could, moving a lock of my long blonde hair out of my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" said the boy and he walked away. I scowled at him, but my face softened as I looked at Tania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok? Why did you walk away from Mom?\" I asked her. By the way, my name is Alexandria Morrow, 17 years old and a high school senior. My school had a teacher work day today so myself and Mom brought Tania, who's in elementary school, here to see the sights. This also allowed Mom to talk to someone here about some urgent matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\" said Tania sincerely. I smiled and hugged my little sis. Right now, I'm currently wearing a blue tank top with regular jeans and shoes. My waist-length blonde hair felt down my back unhindered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. Let's go to the car. Mom's waiting for us\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed her hand and we began walking together.</span></div></div>",

Tania stuck her tongue out at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right. You eat more than I do and no one says you're fat\" retorted Tania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm an adult\" I said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when I'm older, I'm going to eat anything that I want\" declared Tania. I outright laughed at that, and gave her a small tickling for that. We both enjoyed a good laugh at how silly we were acting. It was so refrshing afer getting that mean bully away from her. A job well done, I'd say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I thought that, a brief flash of dust crossed my vision as I blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Change*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what happened?\" I said to myself as I woke to find myself on the grass outside the school. I slowly got up and looked myself over. I seemed to be my normal self as usual. Did I have another back out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I did\" I said to myself. I somehow blacked out and ended up in this patch of grass. Another odd chapter of my life. Suddenly, I heard a womanly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tania! Melissa! Let's go!\" yelled the woman. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw two girls walk up to the woman. One was an older girl who looked like a high school senior. Man, she was pretty! The other girl was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! That's the girl who I saw was...\" you muttered to yourself. It was the little girl who you was getting bullied. As you mulled this over, the two girls happened to glance at you and they smiled, to your confusion. Then, you saw the older girl motion for you to come over. You were confused but walked over anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the boy who saved Tania from that bully. The bully knocked him out pretty hard, but that distracted him enough for me to get Tania\" explained Melissa. The woman looked at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much for your help. Who knows what could have happened to Tania\" said the woman. You blushed at all the attention you were getting.  It felt nice, but a little embaressing. You then felt even more so when Melissa bent over and gave you a small peck on the check in thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I don't really have a clue as to what I did, but I guess I'm glad I did it'</i> you thought, feeling happy for the first time in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next?</span></div></div>",

It's easier to have them all see the truth and be told we changed reality to make Alex our son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense, I guess.\" shrugging, Clem said. he then turned to me. \"Want to grab some pizza?

It was the first time I'd ever been in that room, as Dad kept a strict rule about only going in if invited.

Maybe it was because their parents were always out, but he always seemed to be way out of it. I felt sorry for the guy.

It was an average girl's room- pictures of boy bands on the walls, a trumpet lay on top of a chest of drawers along with a few trophies from my school prize giving. I was about to flop down on my bed, when I heard a loud commotion outside. A boy was being pushed against a wall by another boy. I suspected he was being bullied. One thing was for sure, I was not just going to sit here and let that boy get beaten up. I got up and left the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I made for where the two boys were, I started to feel faint. \"I really have to do something about these blackouts,\" I thought as I reached out to pull the boy around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChange<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off my brother!\" angrily, I said. \"You don't want to make him mad, believe me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bully, an obvious coward, scarpered.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Are you all right, Clem?\" turning to my brother, I asked. then I whispered, \"I don't know why you don't use those alien shape shifting powers of yours to make yourself a harder target for idiots like him.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nClem sighed. \"Alexandria, you know very well why I don't.\" annoyed, he whispered back. \"Using my powers in public is like throwing matches at a tank of gasoline.\" pausing, he asked, \"Don't you think people might just notice if I change into a lion whenever I get jumped? Plus you are forgetting about mom and dad's enemies from 'out of town' and the Agency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know...\" sighing myself, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I wanted to smash him too.\" ruefully, Clem said. \"Only, If you do, you only descend to his level.\" he then smiled. \"Come on Alexandria, lets get back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I entered the house, I knew that I was Alexandria Rodgers, Alex to my friends. I have a brother, Clem, who's a couple of years older, and a sister, Rhea, who's a couple of years younger. Both Rhea and I were adopted; Rhea was taken in as a baby, I was adopted a few years later. It was just recently that we discovered that our parents were aliens and that Clem was an Earth born alien, all capable of changing into almost anything they wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea revealed to Clem and I that she can see things that are invisible or known to others, though she did not understand it herself. Mom and Dad figure she has super charged senses as she can see a dime on the side walk a block away. She also has some cool mental powers but they drain her something terrible. She faints after doing just one thing... As for me, well, I don't have any powers that I am aware of. Mom said she sensed something about me but could not put her finger on what. Coming from her, being an alien, that could mean anything... When we finally walked into the house... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I expected her to greet me in the same way she'd greeted Clem. I was about to tell her where I had been, when she said \"Who are you? And why are you dressed like a girl?\"<br>\r\nOf all the things I had expected to hear from my little sister, that was the last. Me and Rhea had been the best of friends a few days ago. I had protected her when we left the blind post office near the school. While I had no powers, I had compensated for that by improving my fighting skills with the help of one of my relatives, Geo Tanner. <br>\r\n\"Come on Rhea,\" said Clem, after sharing a confused glance with me \"You know full well she's a girl.\" <br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh,\" said Rhea \"He's a boy. And he doesn't live here.\" <br>\r\n\"Rhea,\" I said, with a sigh \"I've had enough of this foolishness, I'm your big sister, Alexandria.\" <br>\r\nRhea stood there for a while, just staring at her. I made a mental note to ask Mum and Dad to get her checked out for amnesia, we weren't sure what side effects her powers might have. Then, Rhea reached up, and touched me on the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I remembered that I was not Alexandria Rogers, I didn't live here, these weren't my siblings, and that my name was Alex Winters. \"Holy crap!\" I said \"Where am I?\" <br>\r\nClem seemed just as surprised as me \"Your in the Rogers family house. How did you get here?\" <br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" I said \"My-my name is Alexander Winters, I passed out and woke up here thinking I was your sister. How did this happen, and how do I change back to a guy?\" <br>\r\n\"I have no idea,\" Clem told me \"Maybe mom and dad can figure this out, if not, I know some other people who might be able to help you.\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For a full minute, nobody said anything. Then, unable to take it anymore, I blurted out: <br>\r\n\"Can you help me control it?\" I felt on the verge of tears \"Please...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Rogers, a woman I had known as 'Mom' a few minutes ago, pulled me into a hug. Even though I had never met her, I felt comfort in her arms. \"This has been driving you mad,\" she said, rocking me \"We will help you.\" <br>\r\n\"The first order of business is to contact the boys family,\" dad said, grabbing a telephone \"I can have the office track him down through his school records. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, I was talking to Rhea and Clem when Mr and Mrs Rogers entered \"We found your family, Alex,\" said Mr Rogers, flatly \"However...\" <br>\r\n\"However what?\" I asked, gulping. <br>\r\nIt was Mrs Rogers who answered, however. \"Honey, your family...\" </span></div></div>",

My memories of my life as Clem's adopted sibling vanished, replaced by memories of being part of another family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is real?\" I asked \"What is the real me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" said Cait, encouragingly \"Just a few more, now, I'm going to open the next door, are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, bracing myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait opened the door, and I, felt the pain of holding three sets of memories in my head. I was ready for it this time, I staggered through the door as Cait locked it. I now had memories of being part of yet another family. I wasn't even paying attention to the details anymore, I just wanted it all to end. Cait led me through a few more doors. The pain got easier to bear as we descended through the families. Eventually, we arrived at the bottom, the very last door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy name is Alex Winters, older brother to Tommy and Aura Winters. As the firstborn of the family, I've always tried to protect my siblings, but when the Agency came, I was powerless to stop them from taking both my siblings and me....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had just celebrated Tommy's twelfth birthday before our nightmare began, Tommy, Aura and I had come to Europe on vacation. Only, our bungalow was not yet ready so we had to find a hotel room to stay for the night. We had walked into a hotel, just inside the outskirts of Rome and approached the desk where dad politely cleared his throat. He was an average sized man, from what I remember, but he was very strong, always wearing a business suit....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I help you?\u201d asked the clerk, politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we are vacationing here in your beautiful nation.\" smiling, dad said. \"Unfortunately, our bungalow is not ready yet. We were hoping you had a room available for the four of us tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desk clerk looked down at some papers then turned back to dad, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re in luck, sir.\u201d he said. \u201cA gentleman, Mr. Kline, had reserved a two bedroom suite a few weeks ago but canceled at the last minute. He left instructions to give the room to someone who could use it. It\u2018s paid up until the end of next week\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \u201cNow, that\u2019s generosity.\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s known for that.\u201d he waved to someone behind them. \u201cIf you will be kind enough to sign in on the registry, I will have the bellhop carry your bags up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad signed his name in the book but I insisted that I could carry the bags and followed my family to the elevator, which took up up to the tenth floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is your room, sir.\" jokingly acting like a bellhop, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, kind sir.\u201d chuckling, dad replied. \u201cJust leave the bags here, my kids and I can carry them in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d giggling, I said. \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I placed the bags down so to carry them in one at a time dad unlocked the door and walked in with mom following close behind. Standing with Tommy and Aura in the hall, we had just gathered the smaller bags and were about to enter the room. Just as we reached the door, a powerful explosion rocked the room, sending all three of us to the floor. I looked up as Aura screamed to find, to my horror, that the room mom and dad had just walked into was completely engulfed in flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaddy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days afterward were a blur to me as Tommy, Aura, and I were taken away to a strange, frightening place were we were separated and I was given a number of injections, making my mind feel clouded and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will do exactly as you are told.\u201d one man had said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, we will beat your brother and sister until they stop moving. Is that clear, Alex?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't get away with this!\" angry, I snapped. \"I will find a way out of here and send the law right down your throats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughed. \"I'd love to see you try.\" leaning in close, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fumed in anger then... I passed out. I woke up what seemed like seconds later standing in an alley in a town I did not recognize. After a moment, I also realized that I could not remember much at all, just my name, Alex....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a year since then and I was just now remembering my brother and sister, still trapped with those monsters. Tears flowed down my face. Mom and dad were dead; my brother and sister were counting on me to get them help and I failed because I forgot everything. Only, if I remembered all of this from the bottom of all my repressed memories, maybe where they are being held is locked somewhere in my memory as well. It became important to me to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cait, can you freeze memories, like videos?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could try,\" said Cait \"What do you want me to freeze?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you when,\" I said, then started playing the dream/memory. When I instructed Cait to freeze it, the memory froze. I walked into the frozen memory, along with Cait. In my dream, and in my memory, I had not gotten a very good look at the room. Aside from the chair, where the younger version of me was tied up, I saw a table with various papers on it. I walked over to it, and turned the papers over, looking for anything that might tell me where the Agency had taken me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even my brother and sister would tease me about being a pushover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the confidence in me began to force my hand, and I brought my right hand up and clenched it. Without warning, my fist drew itself back and began to go forward. As it did, a flash of dust spread my vision, causing my sight to dim out. I could swear that my hand looked slimmer as my vision completely blacked out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Change*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy fist collided with the obnoxious boys' jaw and send him down to the ground. I huffed after drawing my fist back, making sure a lock of my long brown hair was tucked behind my ear. My name is Alexandria Hartford, and I'm a cheerleader at this school. However, in addition to that, I'm on the gymnastics team, and I'm considered to be perhaps the best despite being a freshman. As if that wasn't enough on my plate, I was on the karate team as well, hence how I was able to just knock a guy out cold right now. Oh well, he deserved it. These bozos were trying to gang up on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, his cronies didn't take it well and also charged at me. They weren't really all that good though. A little nimble dodging here and there and they were no problem. Needless to say, all these activities can really help with a girl's defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter kicking the tar out of the boys, I composed myself and straightened myself out. Due to this activity, I'm glad I actually chose suitable clothes today. Just a lavender hoodie over a violet tank top, with a pair of regular jeans and shoes. Good thing, I don't think I would have wanted to get so physical in a skirt. That would have been embarrasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, most people who saw that were amazed.

Much, much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I finished up my lunch, I spoke up again, \"I'm going to walk around\". Tom and Josh nodded in understanding and went back to their own lunches. I packed mine up and and walked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'So, what now?'</i> I thought to myself. Everyone walked around me, minding their own business. It's not like I was famous or anything, despite my small reputation. I did like being mostly ignored though. I never liked having too much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I looked to my left and saw a little boy wondering around. He looked to be about 6 years old or so, so he couldn't be a student. He looked lost and a little afraid. I couldn't resist helping the poor kid. However, I wondered what could I do. He obviously looked like he was looking for family, wherever it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'What do I do?'</i> I thought to myself anxiously. It was as if my blood pressure was rising. I was always easily riled up, so to speak. Suddenly, I started to feel dizzy, and it was like my head was spinning. My vision was getting hazier. It was like time was slowing down in front of me. However, everyone seemed to act normally around me. Then, I seemed to notice some dust around me as my vision turned completely dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Change*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, Billy, was looking around as his family seemed to have accidentily left him behind.

I found you, big sister!\" said Billy as he hugged me, slightly touching my breasts as he did. I smiled and hugged him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that Billy. Guess we got separated when moving through the students\" I told him. I'm Billy's 18-year old sister, Alexandria. Mom had taken him, along with me, to visit one of the concessions at this middle school, as this was where I went to a few years back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on\" I told him as I grabbed his hand and started walking his him, my hips swinging as I did. My feet felt a little odd on the floor through my flip flops, but it felt fine enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI needed to get him back to Mom.</span></div></div>",

I giggled slightly, as he was only 6 years old, so him going here would take some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe climbed into Mom's stationwagon together and she began to drive us home. While these schools were starting, the college that I would start going to didn't begin until next Monday. I would be leaving tomorrow for the college, as it was an hour or so out of town. I would probably be able to visit the family during the Winter break, maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will write, right Alex?\" asked Mom, with slight worry. I laughed slightly. Mom was always so worried about me leaving home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine Mom. You know I'm not the kind of girl to get herself in to trouble\" I told her. Mom smiled at me in return as we began to talk about more pleasant conversations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, we arrived back home. Mom, however, had to leave to go back to work. This left me virtually alone in the house, as Dad was at work too. Billy had been offered to walk over to the neighbors house to play with his friends upon our return. I had already packed and all for college, so I had nothing to do. I took my flip flops off and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was left alone, I looked outside at the other side of the road in the neighborhood. There was the Winter household, a family we got along very well with. They had 2 little children: Kevin, who was 10 years old, and Judith, who was 5 years old. They were good kids. I often thought of them as my own siblings when it was just me and them (I often babysitted them, it was good credit work). Oddly enough though, I very much thought of them as my brother and sister for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI honestly don't know where the feelings come from. Was I their sibling in a previous life?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Travis Greenway, or \"Splice\" to my friends. Why such the unusual nickname? Well, I'll explain that later. I'm fourteen years old and stand at an impressive 6 ft tall, weighing in around 200lbs, all muscle, not bad, eh? But, that's not why I'm a 'Problem Child'. Now, the reason I'm called Splice is because of my 'abilities.' I can't seem to help it, but some weird traits of mine people refer to some animals. It all started when I got in this fight my first year in Middle School. I stood up for a new friend of mine that was being bullied. Long story short, I won easily. And that was when I was a short kid! The bully was twice my size! But, some people pointed out a few things about me during the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne major thing was my body in general. I was punched several times in the chest, but I didn't feel a thing. Most kids survived with a few broken ribs, but I survived completely! They said I had like a turtle shell for a body. The next few reflected my battling style. Apparently, I was as flexible as a snake, fought like a lion and other large cats, appeared to be flying, and many other qualities. So, after that day, I was known as Splice. Tell you the truth, I enjoyed it. But, about a month later, things started to get weird. I was able to swim very well in the public pool. Not weird, try for about three hours underwater without even taking a breath! The weirdest part was that I never even noticed. My parents were worried so they decided to give me my check up early.<br>\r\n=============<br>\r\n\"I HAVE A WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom (Crystal) brought me in for the usual check up. Well, let's face it, its not every day you find a six foot teenager. Only, after a few routine tests, the results appeared....different. So, they recommended a full run of scans including a cat-scan and an MRI. The weird part was that they performed these tests three times. At first I thought was because of a mistake. They were reading over every one; each result was the same. Later on, we were taken to a private office where Dr Plak had a word with us. Now, despite his name, Dr. Plak is a very nice man. Somewhere in his thirties, he took the average appearance of any man. Black hair, brown eyes, six foot height; yep, completely average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm about to say is not an error, Mr. Greenway.\" said Dr. Plak.  \"It shows on your results that you have developed two unrecognizable organs. It also shows your windpipe has split into three different tubes; one the normal way but one leading to each side of your neck. We don't have much information on what these are, but we're looking into it. For all intents and purposes, your body has mutated. Normally, extra vital organs cause problems as there is only so much room in one's body. However, this rare case seems to be helpful to you, time will tell but we need you to come back for more tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just shrugged and walked out of his office. As we were leaving, I turned to him. \"Dr. Plak, I know it's strange but can you not tell my mother?\" I asked. \"She worried about me too much and I don't want her to fret even more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be our secret then\" he replied with a wink. \"But just in case...\" He handed me his business card. \"Call me if anything strange happens and I'll call you if anything else strange shows up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and tucked the card into my back pocket. We met with mom and Dr Plak told her everything was normal. This surprised me as Dr Plak never lied to mom before. Usually mom can tell when someone's lying but she believed him just fine. It was already an exhausting day and this made it even stranger. By the time we got home I just fell asleep. I don't know why or how, but I slept till my usual time in the morning, 6:20 am. I nearly had a twelve hour sleep. It was a Saturday, thank god, so I didn't need to be anywhere. But that doesn't give the excuse not to do anything. I got up, grabbed a clean pair of clothes, and headed for the shower. Once inside, I placed my clothes on the counter and started to undress. As I was doing that, I thought I saw something in the mirror. I finished taking off my shirt and looked at my reflection. What I saw made me scream. I saw...</span></div></div>",

My teeth were now slightly pointed, like every tooth was replaced with a canine tooth. My pupils were thin black slits and my iris was now yellow. Those I could live with, but the last new feature of mine definitely said freak. Gills...that's right, gills. I could feel them taking in air as they opened and closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis what happened?!\" shouted a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;i&gt;Oh man it's my mom! If she sees this she'll freak! But I need an excuse for the scream...uh.....&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't reply in time. The door swung open and my mom had her usual worried expression on her face. But this expression changed to complete shock. But it wasn't a first time shock, it was like the time I found my favorite toy when I was a kid hidden in my parents closet. She was hiding something from me, I could tell from her face. And it had to do with this. Tears began to fall from her eyes and she quickly left. I wanted to go after her, but I could tell she needed to do something alone. I just hope she would be alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Greenway walked down the stairs in tears. The one thing she \u00a0managed to hide from her son, and he finally found it. She mentally kicked herself from her mistake. She walked to the phone and dialed in a number. The tone rang twice before someone finally answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" asked a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...dear...\" she replied in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer....? What's wrong?! What happened...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...it's Travis...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to Travis?!\" A silence passed, Jennifer unable to say anything. \"Oh...he found out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harold...I don't know what to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Settle down dear....just make sure Travis doesn't go anywhere. I'll be home as soon as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Jennifer hung up and waited patiently for her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the experience with mom I took a long shower. But despite the hot water I couldn't get the fact my mom was hiding something. And, if it related, was she hiding this? After my shower, I dressed in comfortable shorts a a T-shirt. I chose a T-shirt because I was still curios about my new feature. Gills...that explains why my windpipe was splitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat leads to another thing, what were those other two glands? Before I could continue thinking, a knock on my door shook me out. \"Honey...it's mom\" she said. I could still hear her sadness. \"Could...could you come downstairs...your father and I want to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited a few seconds before finally leaving my room. From the upstairs I could hear small sobs from my mom. I walked down the stairs, seeing my mom with her hands against her face and crying. My dad was beside her, gently hugging her. Once I hit the last step, both of my parents were aware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello son\" said my father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a seat in the chair across from the couch my parents were in. \"What's going on?\" I asked calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's that...well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom suddenly burst into tears. \"We've been lying to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sensed it but I never knew it was true. \"Yes son...we have been lying to you. It's that....we are technically are not your parents...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't expecting that. \"...Then...who are you...? More importantly...who...or what am I...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your mother and I are scientists...as for you...your name is Travis...but you are...a lab experiment...\"</span></div></div>",

OH! Right! You're not even my father! So why am I even listening to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis...please...\" my mother said, \"Calm down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down? CALM DOWN?! THERE IS NO WAY IM GOING TO CALM DOWN!!!!\" I felt this weird sensation inside me, but I ignored it. My yelling sounded more like a growl, but I didn't care. \"All my life I was happy to be in a family with a mother and father. Fourteen years I felt like that, fourteen years. And now, now I'm told I wasn't even their son?! What?! Was it cheaper or easier to create me with chemicals?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man that claimed to be my father stood up and looked at me in the eye. \"Now listen here. You may have been created from a lab, but you are our son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you're just pulling that just so I can calm down. But NO! I'm not going to listen to you anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy \"mother\" stood up, but not from anger. \"Travis...your anger...it could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! What could my anger possibly do?! Cause you two to decide to throw me away like done old science fair project?! No! You're not my mother! You're not my father! AND I AM NOT YOU'RE.......!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy stomach suddenly felt like it was on fire. The pain was too great for me to handle, I fell to the floor. It felt like my spine was twisting inside my body. Parts of it began to push out on my back, and there were even some starting below my arms. Suddenly the pain spiked, causing me to scream. It felt like someone was trying to push a large metal pole through my body. I thought I heard a rip but couldn't exactly tell. The pain died down, the heat and cramps fading. I was panting hard, still trying to grip what just happened. I felt someone near me, don't know how, but someone was. I managed to glance up, seeing my \"mother.\" She seemed to be in tears by just looking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis...\" she slowly said. \"Please son...don't be mad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to get up but the pain was top great. But, to my surprise, my \"parents\" came to help me up. The didn't get under my arms, like there was something else there. There was, I could feel it. I also felt something on my back, three things actually. Once I was able to stand up, my \"parents\" backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI changed again, but this time more physically. I now had an extra set of arms, each finger ended with a small claw. I turned my head, seeing two new growths. They were wings, but they weren't the same. One was a large bat wing, with black leathery skin between the bones. The other was a bird wing, covered in dark blue feathers. I looked at all my arms; a few had a couple brown scales speckled across them. I was a freak....a hideous freak. I didn't even want to know what my face now looked like. But, in that dead of silence, I knew someone was still here. I raised my head, seeing my \"parents.\"</span></div></div>",

I was about to lunge at him, but all my energy seemed to drain right out of me. The last thing I saw was my \"mother\" crying. After that everything went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head felt like it got hit with a sledge hammer.

Two arms, no wings, no claws, nothing. I would have jumped for joy if wasn't in so much pain. There was a knock on my door, but no one came in. \"Come in.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy 'mother' stepped into the room. What was left of my cheery mood vanished as a low growl escaped my lips. I guess I still had some anger left in me. \"What do you want?\" I said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy voice seemed to make her tear up. Even if she wasn't my mother, I felt a little guilty. \"I...I wanted to see if you were alright son...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so now I am your son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always were...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped my attitude and just decided to listen. She walked over and sat beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis, you were always our son. You just were not born how most kids were.\" she explained. \"You see, I was once a member of the Agency. It was an underground organization in Europe that used kids with special and unique powers to do their dirty work. I had the gift of 'imaginative superior' intellect.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imaginative superior intellect?\" I asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"I had the power to literally convert imagination into reality, making me a target when I was but a child.\" she said, tearing up more. \"I was ten when I was abducted by the Agency. I was trapped and terrified but they taught many things and I was able to push my boundaries. The Agency wanted me to be a permanent worker, but I always dreamed of escape.\" she sighed. \"I was on my eighteenth birthday when that opportunity finally arose. It was the day I met and ran off with the Problem Child Gang...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were in the Problem Child Gang?!\" That was the last thing she could have said to catch my attention. I mean, I was listening, but I had no idea she would say THAT! \"Which one were you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was named Crystal but I was not a member of the group, not officially...\" said mom. she placed a light hand onto my shoulder. \"I did not come up here to talk about me, but rather to explain what you are. You are our son, just not in the way you expect. I am infertile, which means I can't give birth, a switch off for the power I have. Your father and I were devastated, but being scientists we found a solution. By getting one sperm cell from your father and a very rare egg cell capable of fertilization from me, it began to form you. Unfortunately an accident occurred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is probably why I have these different parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You see, normal test tube babies are fertilized in the lab then placed into the mother after a few days to allow nature to take its course.\" explained mom, her voice quivering. \"You were no different but... consider my power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" curious, I pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I was a few days pregnant with you, an assistant we thought we could trust, attacked me. It turns out he was from the Agency.\" said mom, tears falling. \"Several test tubes from another project were knocked off and shattered onto the floor during the struggle.\" she sighed, crying. \"Your father came in and fought the man off but I was thrown onto the shattered glass of the test tubes, sending some of their contents into my bloodstream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DNA samples of every animal on Earth.\" I whispered, putting two and two together. \"Is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From every animal group but yes.\" said mom, crying freely. \"Things went from bad to worse after that. Of course, we were very scared to see how you would turn out, but we decided to let you go to see what would happen. Just call it the scientist in us. Although we decided to leave you alone, another scientist thought otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" I asked, hanging on every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A love rival named Dr. Emily Long was jealous of me being with your father. When she heard I was pregnant with you, she got...creative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'creative'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She tried to force a miscarry by injecting me with a DNA bonding agent she had been working on, telling me it was a vitamin shot.\" said mom, anger in her voice. \"By the time we realized what she had done, you had the combined DNA of nearly every animal group on Earth due to the DNA samples already in my bloodstream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was mad...but strangely happy. I mean, I always wanted to do some stuff that animals could do, and now I can. But something never added up. \"Of I had all of that DNA, why do I remember being a human for years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember that shot you got every six months? We had a serum made that hid all of your animal features. We saw no change in you this year so we stopped for a bit. Sometimes when we skip it some features appear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that explains the two organs they found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extra organs...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap, I forgot that she never knew. I never was able to keep a secret. My mom was staring at me now. \"Travis...what extra organs are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The checkup yesterday showed I had two new unknown organs. I never told you because you worry too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed like she was going to protest but didn't. My mom told me to stay in the room and then gave me a goodbye kiss. Once she left I walked to my bathroom mirror. I took a look to see what I still had. My eyes seemed slightly thin, and I still had pointed teeth. I saw no gills, which I was slightly sad about. I really wanted to try breathing underwater. But, I guess I'll have to train or something. I mean, there's no way I have all of the powers now. I was alone for a few hours, so I needed to do something.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It frustrated me to no end as a mere tantrum leashed a horror show of several animals. It made me shudder to think that could be my true form but I kept trying until I fell onto my bed in exhaustion. \"Why can't I change?\" I asked myself, as I slowly drifted off. \"What am I doing wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up the next morning to find my mattress, my entire bed torn to shreds! I let out a yell and jumped up, startled, only to hit the ceiling seven feet above my bed. Letting out another yelp, I came crashing down in a heap, stunned and surprised as I rubbed my throbbing head. \"Ow! What happened!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, I saw that my bed was not the only thing that had been torn up. The entire room was trashed and I instinctively ran out of my room to check on mom and dad. <i>\"Were we attacked!?\"</i> I thought, frightened. <i>\"Did I somehow fight of whoever it was in my sleep!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching mom and dad's room, I found them missing and ran down to the kitchen to find them to be unharmed but visibly shaken. They turned to me as I entered the room and smiled sadly. \"You turned out better than we could have ever imagined, Travis.\" she said, teary eyed. \"Only I fear you will have a difficult time adjusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, frightened and disturbed then ran from the house in tears, trying to make sense of it all. \"I don't even know what I am anymore!\" you cried, running down a dirt road. \"What's happening to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nearly a half hour before I finally stopped, completely out of breath, and looked around. I was in the county wilderness preserve... 35 miles from home! \"How on Earth did I get here so fast?\" I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I noticed a small pond and, for some odd reason, I felt a great urge to drink form it. Deciding there would be no serious harm, a walked up to the pool. That was when I discovered that I had transformed. Only I had not exactly become an animal, I was now an Anthropomorphic version of a cheetah!  My face was cat like with slit eyes, ears on the top of my head, and a small black nose. As examined myself further, I found that I looked very much like a cross between a human and a cheetah in my clothes, I even had a tail! Only I had my same build and six foot height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is my power.\" I whispered. \"I'm an Anthro morph.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I stared at my reflection in the pond. Using my hands, I felt my face to make sure I wasn't dreaming. I pinched my cheek, feeling pain and my skin reacting to it. I was indeed an anthro cheetah. I could feel and control my new tail. If it wasn't for the torn bedsheets and my parents' reactions, this would be so cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what else I can change into\" I said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind me I heard laughter. I panicked and dove into thick bushes. I looked ahead, seeing a pair of kids and what appeared to be their parents. <i>Looks like I chose the wrong time to stay...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot many people went on the trails in the wilderness reserve due to the few animal attacks that happen. But there are that handful that enjoy walks completely surrounded by nature. I loved taking walks here, now I know why. The family began to pass but the little girl stopped. \"Mommy what's that yellow thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh crap! I forgot that I was still a cheetah! I need to change and fast! Whatever I did to change before better work now!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI concentrated on my form. I didn't care what I became, I just wanted something dark colored. I felt something happen in my body, but I heard the mother's footsteps approach the child, \"What yellow thing sweetheart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mentally sighed and cheered for my success. I opened my eyes to see the pair leave. I waited about five minutes before deciding to move out. But, I felt awkward now. I tried to move my legs, but I did not feel any legs. I reached my hand out to grab whatever was replacing it. I discovered two things; one was that I was now covered in scales, and two was that I had a large tail. My guess, I was a snake anthro, or under technical terms, a naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to walk...er...slither out of the bushes. I moved back to the pond to see my new look. My face was that identical to a snake's; yellow slit eyes, a brown scaly muzzle, small dents in the sides of my head(ears). My height seemed different but that was probably a result from my tail. My build seemed bigger than normal. I smiled my scaly smile but then two skin flaps shot out from my head. The insides held a very sinister but colorful design. I was a anthro cobra, not just a snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was possibly the coolest thing ever. I could tap into the multiple DNA inside my body and shapeshift into the animal while still keeping my human-like posture. If only I could show this to my friend Mech. Megan Connors or \"Mech\" as she is all known as was one of my best friends. She was incredibly good with technology and relatively athletic. But she never bothered to join a sports team. I also kind of had a crush on her. Okay, I still do. It's just that I can trust her with anything, why not this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to change back into either my human or cheetah form, but something stopped me. I know I could probably do more, but I guess I can only do these right now. But what stopped me was that I had no pants on. I guess my snake tail caused it to rip. There was no way I was going back half naked. I just needed to be careful when going back to the house. My parents are probably worried.</span></div></div>",

Luckily for me, a storm began to blow through. The roads were now dark and no one was outside. But the bad news was that it was raining. I couldn't go into the front door, I would track mud. I slithered to the back door and knocked on it. To my surprise, the door cracked when I just knocked. Any harder and I would have punched a hole straight through. The door opened, revealing my mom. Tears were in her eyes, but now they were streaming down her face now. Before I knew it, I was embraced into a super tight mother hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Travis, thank god your alright!\" she said. \"When you ran off and didn't come back I thought...I thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hugged her back, trying not to get her too wet. \"I'm sorry mom...I was just scared. But I have some control of my powers now. I don't blame you or dad what happened to me, I'm glad it happened. And I promise that I will never abuse what gift I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom tried to stop crying but her tears kept flowing out. My father came and needed to separate us. \"Oh, and mom, can you bring me some pants? I don't want to track mud in the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure honey, and thank you for thinking like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my mother left, my father approached me. \"So I was told that you knew about your mother and my past\" he said. \"We still have a few connections with the other members. They are our friends as well. Maybe we could spread the word, let them keep an eye on you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dad...and thank you mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom just came with my pants. Instead of going human, I decided to change into my cheetah form. After which I quickly put the pants on and walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis, why are you in that form?\" asked my mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm going to control it, I'm going to have to stay in certain forms.

Being an anthro morph was awesome, but I had to be human from time to time. The last thing I want to do is get stuck as an anthro and make the morning news worldwide. But, I needed to at least be able to perform daily stuff in these forms. I glanced over at my desk and saw my laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan should probably be online, she loves technology. I got up and sat down in my swivel chair. I booted the power on my laptop and waited for it to load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how I should tell her\" I said aloud. \"She can keep a secret, but I wonder how she would react. Probably one of those \"Prove it by coming over!\" moments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laptop finished loading and I went onto Facebook. I clicked on Megan Connors's page but something troubling popped up. It was her latest message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat... What happened to me!?! My teeth are... are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's going on!?! Mom, I'm scared!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some weird reason my laptop shut off after I read that. Something was wrong, and Megan was in trouble. I ran downstairs without even knowing how much speed I used. I grabbed the house phone, dialed Megan's house number, and waited for an answer. The ringing sounded funny, but someone picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" said a voice. It wasn't Megan, but it was her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Connors, it's Travis. Is Megan alright?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Travis, but we needed to send Megan to a hospital. Something went...wait, how did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone went dead before she could say another word. I slammed the phone down and began to run again but both my mother and father were at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong dear?\" asked my mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get to the hospital, Megan is there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that girl you like?\" asked my father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but I have no time to explain! I need to get there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll start the car and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm running there. I can get there fast and change before someone notices me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to practice right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let me pass and I took no time to hesitate. The ground was wet from the storm and the sky was still cloudy but I did not care. Megan was in trouble. I dashed down the sidewalk as fast as I could. Surprisingly no cars or anything were out, so I had a straight dash for the hospital. I stopped in the alley and changed back to human, using a puddle for confirmation. Lucky for me, I grabbed a pair of shoes before I left. I ran inside and stopped at the counter. I scared the woman at the desk a little when I stopped. \"What room is Megan Connors in?\" I asked.</span></div></div>",

I got up there with some of my energy, but then I made a mistake. \"End of the hall\" could relate to any single hallway on the third floor. I sighed and ran down the halls. Usually whenever the rooms are occupied, they have the names listed on the outside. I ran down each hallway, but no luck. I ducked and dodged some nervous nurses trying to find her name. But it did lead to one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it had to be the last hallway I look at\" I said to myself. I ran down as fast as I could with as much energy that I had left. I didn't know how I could see that far, but the name on the end was Megan Connors. A man just left looking pretty mad about something. Something seemed off about him, he just smelled like trouble. I quickly grabbed the door handle and barged in. I saw Megan, she was okay and resting on a bed. Her expression now seemed horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you were in trouble\" I said while trying to control my breathing, \"Are you okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears began to pool her eyes.\u00a0\"I'm not sure\" she replied, teary eyed. \"They found a tumor on my brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant she said that put my brain on overdrive in worry. I had a crush on her, there was no doubt there. But having a tumor on her brain was dangerous. Not many people survived a tumor on their brain! And even if they live after removal, they are never the same. I almost cried at the thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fear not, wild one, she is safe</i> said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't came from the room, it sounded like it came from my head, or my brain. Megan seemed scared too. I had no idea what happened, but if that voice said Megan was safe, Megan is safe.</span></div></div>",

Travis, who are you talking to?\" Megan's voice was shaky and nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*He is talking to me, little one.*</i> replied a voice. Both me and Megan were surprised by this voice. <i>*I am the 'tumor' attached to your brain.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's eyes went wide and her breathing sped up. It looked as if she would pass out soon. \"Okay, why are you inside her?\" I asked while walking towards her. \"Are you the one doing these things to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*I am Zoe, a... symbiont. We provide certain abilities in return for 'room and board'.

I closed the door but cracked it, putting my ear near the door. Surprisingly, I could hear the whole conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes boss what is it?\" said a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you and your boys to come to the hospital\" Dr. Hagen replied. \"There is a girl that needs...special attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped at that but stayed silent as he continued. \"There is also a boy in the room with the girl.

There was a black van out in the parking lot. It wasn't hard trying to find it because it was one of the only cars in that lot. My eyes started to feel weird. I focused more on the van, and I could see much better. I could see a man looking through binoculars through the tainted windows of the van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan...your right\" I said. \"How did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have control of machines, right?

I blushed and quickly left the room to talk to Dr. Stone for sleeping arrangements. He offered for me to sleep on a patient bed, but I said I shouldn't do that. But, he insisted. Before we started talking, Megan was able to shut off that camera. It was creeping me out how it always followed us. We just talked about what our lives were like. She also explained how she first discovered her powers. Tell you what, it was worse than my experience. I didn't tell her because I think she would find me a freak. Nightfall soon came and I was exhausted. My eyes closed quickly and I slipped into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was dark at first, but then things formed into a hallway from my high school.

I looked down and saw that I was in my cheetah form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis, your a freak!\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no!\" I replied quickly. \"I can be human again watch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI focused on being human and felt the changes happen. I looked down, but saw I was a wolf instead. Other people joined Megan and they all had a similar expression. I tried again and again, but every time I changed into a different animal. \"Megan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Stay away you freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart shattered. Megan would never say those words would she? \"But, I thought we were friends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends...? With a freak like YOU?! HA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone including Megan began to laugh. I tried to ignore it but their laughter just grew louder and louder. \"No...I'm not a freak. Please, stop...I'm not a freak...I'm not a freak...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis...Travis! Travis wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone was shaking me awake. I opened my eyes, seeing Megan. Her face had the recognizable expression of concern. \"Travis...what happened to you?\" I looked at my hands, they were paws. My arms were covered in fur. I reached up on my head, I had ears. I grabbed a small mirror and looked into it, I was an anthro cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly pushed her away and hid behind the bed in the corner. Okay, I know I panicked but I don't want her to see me. She will think of me as a freak. I could feel tears coming out of my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis...who did this to you...?\" asked Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not turn around. \"My parents...my parents sort of...made me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Made...you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to explain it...you would only...\" I could hear her approaching, her footsteps fully audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would I do...?\" she asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would think I'm a freak. I'm nothing but a freak...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis....you feel like an alien...like me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around, slightly surprised. She wasn't running or screaming. She was staying here. She kept coming closer, \"But Megan...I don't think your a freak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan smiled, \"Nor do I.\" Her hand reached my head and she began to scratch between my ears. \"You look cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scratching calmed me down, heck it felt great! Now I know why cats love it so much. It may have been instincts, but I leaned my head closer to her head. A small purr escaped my lips, which caused Megan to giggle. I covered my mouth and put my head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to do that!\" I said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admit it Travis\" she said with a smirk, \"You enjoyed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to blush and nod. I stood up along with her. I gave her a warm hug, \"Thanks Megan...I should have told you earlier.\" My tail started wrap around her leg, so I decided to change back. When we broke, Megan looked kinda sad, \"Aw....did you have to change back so soon? You looked so cute! Could you change back for me...? Please!\"</span></div></div>",

She must be trying to get me to change back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm changing! I'm changing!\" I said, \"Calm down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI changed into my cat form quickly so she would stop. But I finally noticed what she was screaming about. Her entire body looked like a metal mannequin straight off of the assembly line. She picked up the mirror I dropped, and screamed after looking into it. Before I could react, she started to change again. Pointed ears formed onto her head as well as her face forming cat like features. A tail grew from her lower back and her hands shifted into what looked more like paws. The gray color soaked back into her pores and in her place stood a stunned cat like girl. I had to admit, Megan looked really cute as a cat. \"What...happened?\" she asked, touching her new face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to me and seemed surprised to see my back as a cat. I couldn't help myself any longer, I smiled and felt my face flush. \"You look cute Megan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad yourself, Travis\" she said while blushing. \"But how did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can explain.\" entering the room, a man's voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to the door and saw Megan's father. He was a relatively tall and muscular man that was about 33 years old. He had short sand blond hair and blue eyes. \"Daddy!\" Megan exclaimed while crying. She ran to him quickly. \"You know what's happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded before he turned to face me. \"I can see you too are unique, Mr. Greenway\" he said. I nodded and he continued. \"You may stay but I urge you to keep what you hear silent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I dad?\" Megan was on the verge of tears. I wanted to comfort her, but I might make it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father knelled down to her level, smiling, \"You got one power from me, and another from your mother. Remember that series you like so much in Teen Detectives magazine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan nodded but remained silent. Neither she nor I knew where her father was going with his explanation. He chuckled, giving me a knowing smile, \"I was Sam, the ace driver of the Problem Child Gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the heck?! Who else was a member of the Problem Child Gang?! That jock Garth's father? That guy/girl Alyssa's parents?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled again, turning to me. \"Your mother was Crystal, our mysterious informant\" he said. \"We did not know she was an unwilling worker for the Agency but we always considered her a member of the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to thank him, but Megan was more important. \"How did I get these powers, dad?\" Megan asked confused. \"I don't remember reading about you having... this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't remember him having these powers either. I wasn't really complaining that Megan was a super attractive cat girl, but she did not seem to like it. \"Simple\" he said while turning back to Megan. His form shifted into that metal mannequin Megan shifted into before. \"I'm an alien.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's jaw dropped along with mine. Suddenly gray washed over her, her normal form returning. Then her eyes suddenly rolled into the back of her head and she fainted.</span></div></div>",

Her father smiled, \"A bit of a shock, I suppose.\" watching me he said. \"I am glad to see you are so kind to my daughter.\" returning to his human form, he added, \"A certain group may be after her soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will protect her, even if my life depended on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have no idea why I said that. It seemed it was almost on instinct. Mr Connors simply nodded. \"I trust you will protect her, Mr Greenway.\" serious, he said. then his cell phone rang. \"Excuse me a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded as he left, talking into his phone. He did not return so I stood over Megan, watching the door, listening for anything that may sound like a threat. The hours past, but I did not feel the urge of rest gnaw on me. I was wide awake with the task at hand. Then, I heard faint footsteps down the hall, it was multiple individuals. Seeing that I would need the element of surprise, I quickly and silently hid in a closet. With my eyes already adjusted to the darkness, I saw four men wearing black suits enter. Three had a gun and another had a large needle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this girl really as powerful as the boss says she is?\" asked the one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares....as long as we get paid what we've been promised.\" snapped the other. \"With what she offered, I'd  kidnap a little baby for all I care!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if she wakes up?\" asked the one holding the needle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We sedate her you <i>idiot!</i>\" whispered the first one who spoke. \"That's why you're holding the needle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll struggle.\" said the third man. \"Think the boss will care if the 'package' is damaged?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boss wants her alive, she never said anything about her getting injured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growl escaped my lips. Wanting to induce fear from the start, I didn't even try to muffle it, I let it out. The four men looked around, \"What is that, a growl?\" asked the fourth man, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There isn't any animals in here...is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like a wolf...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO MAN! Don't say that! I'm terrified of wolves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it together, you morons.\" snapped the one who seemed to be the leader. \"It's just the pipes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile crept on my face. I shifted into a Anthro wolf but then went onto all fours. In the dark, they would not see I was part human, just a wolf. The weirdest thing was that I could feel this strange new strength in my body, it was like I had a sudden surge of power. I charged through the door, ripping it off its hinges (not on purpose) and pounced onto the one holding the needle, knocking it out of his grasp. I think I felt his ribs crack under my blow, knocking the wind out of him. Only I had no time to deal with that. Before the others could react, I jumped up onto my two feet and quickly punched out the other two then pinned the fourth, the leader, against the wall, forcing his to drop his weapon. Growling in his face, I demanded, \"Who sent you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spat in my face, \"There's my answer, fleabag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wiped the spit away from my face and then bared my teeth. I loudly roared in his face, snapping my teeth an inch from his eyes. Now his face held an expression of fear and I easily lifted him off the floor with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen and listen good... <i>human.</i>\" I growled, \"You tell your boss that Megan Connors is off limits.\" with a wolk like growl, I added, \"<i>LEAVE THE GIRL ALONE!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then threw him away from me like I would an old rag doll. His body flew out the door, slamming into the outside hall, cracking the wall. I watched his slide to the floor unconscious. As if on instinct, I howled in triumph. It was a haunting howl, I frightened myself with it. I turned my gaze back to Megan to find her awake, pulled from her sleep from the sounds of the struggle. She was sitting on her bed, against the wall, shivering. I could tell she was very much afraid by my display of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still me inside, Megan.\" assuring her, I said. \"I would never hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was afraid of the men... not you.\" still shaking, Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I heard more footsteps approaching. Fearing there were reinforcements coming, I quickly took Megan into my arms and held her tight. \"We need to go, now!\" frantic, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning to the open window, I jumped through, thankful the camera was still offline. Falling from the fifth floor, I changed into a human (just for a second) then became a human like eagle. I had become something like a bird man, I suppose. I held onto Megan with my feet, without stabbing her, and landed on the sidewalk after carefully dropping her. I changed back into human form but found I was unable to change again, I was just too tired. Then, a gray, futuristic looking car pulled up. The doors automatically opened and Mr. Connors voice echoed from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan, Travis, get in!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We both let out a yelp as the seat belts crossed over us on their own before the car took off on its own. I was not expecting this at all, a self-driving car. Megan's dad's laughter echoed through the radio speakers. \"You're not touching any part of me, sweetie\" he said amused, \"This is the family car, I simply added my own essence to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're possessing the car?\" morbidly impressed, I asked. \"Nice.\" It was cool, taking over technology like that. If I had to change my powers to anything, that would have been my next choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a crude way of putting it, Travis\" chuckling, Steve said. \"As accurate as any, I guess.\" He seemed to turn serious as the car screamed around a corner. \"Listen you two, things are heating up faster than I had feared. Sykes is back in town and the Agency has resurfaced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan gasped, \"That organization existed!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was surprised too. I guess my mom was telling the truth after all. Everything in those comics were real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything in that story existed, Megan\" flatly, Steve replied. \"I'm guessing those who tried to kidnap you were hired thugs from Sykes or someone else. Most likely to test your powers, search for weaknesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think it wasn't this agency?\" I asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it was the Agency, both of you would be unconscious, bound and gagged, on your way to parts unknown.\" serious, Steve replied. \"They are ruthless professionals in the field of espionage and assassination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan gulped at that, \"What are we to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The original members of the gang are holding a meeting.\" The car sped onto the freeway quickly. \"With a little luck, we'll get there before it ends and we can formulate a plan. Travis, you and I need to talk about your power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my power?\" I asked while turning to the radio, \"I saved Megan's life back there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am grateful for that, believe me. Look at your face in the mirror, though. You are white as a sheet and you were not changed for all that long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did as he complied and found that he was telling the truth. My face was as white as a brand new plain T-shirt. I touched my face to make sure it was my skin.\u00a0\"What's wrong with him, dad?\" Megan asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you, Travis is just discovering his power, honey.\" gently, dad replied. \"You both need to learn how to control it so you do not push yourselves beyond your normal limits.\" pausing, he added, \"Megan, I would not shape shift too often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" curious, Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The human body is not designed for it and you are half human.\" morbidly serious, dad replied. \"Each time you change, you risk injuring yourself. After you you fainted, I did a quick scan with a med-wand, an alien device.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you find?\" nervous, Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had pulled every muscle and tendon in your body.\" darkly, dad replied. \"I'd refrain from changing shapes unless absolutely necessary, young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you suggesting we do?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can offer you a learning tool, used by my people to learn control. However, it was not built with humans in mind so it may 'misfire' from time to time, giving you a form you did not have in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the middle compartment opened and an odd bracelet rose from within. It looked like someone took apart a clock and built it into a piece of jewelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may appear simple in design but, I assure you, it is more complex than you can imagine\" he said seriously. \"Travis, I urge you to trust me and wear the bracelet. Still, as it was not designed for humans, I will not force you.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But, I placed it into my pocket. \"Thanks for the device, but I will not use it just yet. I think I will see how training on my own goes before I use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understandable... but just promise me you will not lose it. If the Agency gets that device and learns from it, they could produce a device that would allow them to control your forms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the car suddenly stopped. \"We're here, get out\" he demanded. Megan and I got out at the same time and met on the sidewalk. We took notice to the front of the car and saw a silver liquid-like substance flow out of the grill. It flowed into a puddle that started to rise. As it rose, features like arms and legs appeared. Then, his head along with clothing features appeared as well. Lastly, the silver color drained from his body. The puddle formed into Megan's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is so cool!\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I got a lot of that the first time\" he replied. \"But... Travis, do you have any other clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was confused for a sec but looked down. My shirt and shorts were still clinging to my body, but they were in shreds. Most of my upper body was revealed, showing a surprisingly amount of muscle. I guess this was a likely extra for my powers. But I'm not complaining, I saw Megan stare at me before she turned to hide a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but no\" I replied, \"I left my pack at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan grabbed my arm, \"Don't worry Travis, you look fine to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that while we headed to the door.

We can take two along with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was both glad and sad that we were splitting up. I was happy because if one of us gets caught, the others can be notified. I was sad because I may never see Megan again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Megan and Travis stay together?</span></div></div>",

'chuckle'... out of this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, dad?\" rolling her eyes, Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jokes aside, you also need training, both of you.\" turning serious, Steve said. \"Travis, you are far too slow in your Anthro transformations which makes you vulnerable. Megan, your ability to control machines is wild, unfocused, you need to work on that and fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to ask how but Steve was already pushing us out of Mr Jones' house to the car. \"I will drive you all the normal way to conserve energy.\" opening the driver's side door, he said. \"Get in, we have little time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain, I stepped into the back seat as Megan did the same. We blushed, meeting each other as Steve chuckled. \"Normally, you fight over sitting up front, Megan.\" buckling himself in, he said. \"Interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed more as Megan smiled, blushing as well. \"Someone has to warn him who he is up against.\" teasing, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve laughed as he started the engine and pulled away from the Jones residence. \"Your training will start in the rumble room at my house.\" looking at me through the rear view, he said. \"It's sort of like an arena where I privately train.\" he smiled, adding, \"I am anxious to see what you two have on the ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, we arrived at the Connor's house where Steve led us inside to a large room with heavily padded walls, floor, and ceiling. Inside, I saw mom and dad waiting for us with Mrs Connors. She was nearly Steve's height with a slender but well toned body and long blond hair and green eyes. Seeing her, I knew where Megan got her good looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna, could you please escort our guests to the observation room?\" politely, Steve asked. \"This training could get intense and I don't want anyone getting injured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna nodded and let mom and dad out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I rose my arms to defend myself then paused as Steve stopped his advancement, a smile on his face as he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s going to scare a bear away.\u201d sarcastically, he said. \u201cYou need to learn how to think on your feet, young man.\u201d He then pointed to Megan who had her hands raised; they were glowing. \u201cFollow my daughter\u2019s example.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-Is this mom\u2019s power?\u201d confused, Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour mother had the power to run at incredible speeds with little effort.\u201d returning to his human form, Steve replied. \u201cLook at your hands, they are not glowing, they are creating heat from vibrating at high velocity.\" smiling, he added, \"You could leave a person a very nasty burn by merely touching him right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan gasped and focused on relaxing herself, eventually getting her hands to stop vibrating. \u201cDad, I could have hurt you.\u201d Tearing up, she said. \u201cI- I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve smiled. \u201cYou forget my power, Megan.\u201d chuckling, he said. \u201cYou would not have harmed me in the slightest as I can withstand a lot more than you might think.\u201d turning serious, he said, \"Strange, but that power seems to only be focused in your hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an Amazonian fighting technique.\" came mom's voice through a speaker. we all looked up to see mom and Mr and Mrs Greenway watching us through an observation window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying, mom?\" curious, Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have some of your father's natural gifts and some of mine.\" smiling, mom replied. \"However, the two together have strangely given you the power to control machines with your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve smiled then turned back to Travis. \u201cShall we continue with your training?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready for you this time.\u201d Confident, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve laughed. \u201cWill you now?\u201d amused, he asked. \u201cWe\u2019ll see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore another move could be made, a television in the room turned itself on, revealing a test screen as a voice declared, 'Pueri Problementa!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProblem child in Latin.\u201d Surprised, I said. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt means someone has placed a note in the \u2018blind post office\u2019.\u201d Surprised as well, Steve replied. \u201cI\u2019m surprised it\u2019s still working after all this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt could be a trap.\u201d serious, Megan mussed. \u201cI mean, who would use the \u2018blind post office\u2019? Most people believe the group is just a legend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat and the kidnap attempt earlier.\u201d frowning, Steve said. \u201cYou two are not ready to jump into anything right now.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cForget you saw that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut dad\u2026\u201d softly, Megan protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not ready, Megan!\u201d sternly, Steve said. \u201cYou both just discovered your powers and barely have a grasp as to how to control them!\u201d he sighed. \u201cBesides, if anything happens to either of you, I will never hear the end of it from my wife. Let\u2019s continue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can handle myself, sir.\u201d with a sigh, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise you are not ready, young man.\u201d firmly, Steve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he changed into a humanoid wolf before charging me. This time, I had my guard up and quickly changed to that of a humanoid wolf to match him.  Only Steve changed into a humanoid bear in a heartbeat and threw me like a rag doll into one of the padded walls. I moaned, my body changing back to human form, and looked up to see him standing over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDid I make my point?\u201d returning to human form, Steve asked. \u201cYou must be focused at all times, in all situations if you want to stay alive, Travis. I learned this the hard way and it almost cost me my life. I will not allow you two to make the same mistake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what do we do?\" uncertain, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve sighed. \"We keep training.\" softly, he said. \"Relax.

Instead, he motioned to the safety room, the door opening. He walked out, but he stopped just before to motion us to walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A thought came to me\" he said. \"Your transformations are limited. You could have changed into something else to defeat me, but you went as a wolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt embarrassed. \"Yeah...\" I replied, \"That was one of the ones I remember...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. I think that before we start training, and you decide to go out on your own, I believe that we should expand your capabilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room we entered resembled a large indoor pool. I was confused to there was a small control panel against the wall, but I amazed by the size of it. It had to at least be 30 yards wide and 35 yards long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve chuckled, \"Yes I know it's size. But it can get bigger as well as deeper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pool widened, Megan looked shocked. \"How can you build this stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're aliens Megan...this would be something easy. But your mom helped us with this Travis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could ask, I felt something snap to my leg. I looked down, it was a spherical weight. Without hesitation, I was shoved into the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis!\" was the last thing I heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was not kidding when he said the pool could go deeper. I was at least in 20 feet of water! I struggled against the weight, hoping it would come loose. The air escaped my lungs, I couldn't focus. The last bit of air escaped, I needed to take a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy need for air did not come out of my mouth. Instead, I felt my breath returning. I had no idea what was happening, but it was cool. I could see clearly, I could breathe, it was almost like I was a fish. That was the strange thing, I had nothing like a fish; I was completely human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Megan returned to me, so I unlatched the weight and swam up. The chain could have been unlatched at any time; if Steve wasn't Megan's father I would punch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment I reached to surface and climbed out, I was hugged by Megan. \"Travis! When I saw the last air bubble, I thought....\" She trailed off when her gaze hit my neck. I felt that area, feeling the gills that I saw about a few days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was even shocked. \"Travis, could you always change parts of your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"I had these gills the first day. I guess they just showed up because I needed them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was quiet. Megan and I grew concerned, even scared. \"You two can explore and enjoy the rest of the day\" he said, \"I have...an errand to run...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choice of words were suspicious, but then again he only wants our protection. Megan grabbed a towel and dried off a bit. \"So what should we do?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you pick?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted her to pic because I wasn't sure she would like what I pick. She pondered for a bit before smiling and facing me. \"I would like to...\"</span></div></div>",

Then again, they're aliens, they could keep on building if they needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Megan into a large gym-like area. There was a properly sized indoor track. She smiled as she ran on, \"Come on Travis!\" She wanted to race, against me. My form shifted into a cheetah before I walked onto the track. We both stood ready to run. \"Are you sure you want to race me?\" I asked, \"I ran miles without even trying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure\" was all she said. \"3...2...1...GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sprinted forward, trying to run my hardest. Okay, I was slacking a bit. I mean, Megan was only a few feet out and I nearly completed one fourth of the track! When she hit halfway, I ran back beside her. But that was my mistake. Her entire body glowed before she zoomed off. I fell but stood up, only to find I already lost. I ran over as Megan started cheering, \"I told you I would win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, \"Yeah...you did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, shouldn't you change back? Remember how your body was drained?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if I'm going to get used to changing, I should at least remain in a form for a while. Besides...\" I bent down a bit so my face met her's, \"I thought you liked me as an animal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled before she started to scratch between my ears. On instinct, I relaxed and began to purr. This made Megan giggle even more. \"Different species...same result.\" The scratching continued, the feeling getting better and better.</span></div></div>",

But I could feel my mind slipping, like all I wanted was her to pet me. \"Megan...I think...\" My last attempt to stop this was ended short. Megan scratched underneath my chin, the feeling skyrocketed. I couldn't take it anymore, this urge was overcoming my consciousness. <i>\"Megan... stop.\"</i> feeling myself losing it, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan continued to scratch my chin and head and, driving my emotions wild. The cheetah side of me was quickly taking over, loud purrs filled the room. Megan laughed until she heard a deep growl, me wanting to move out of the foreplay and into something more serious.  I remember rubbing my head against hers; she allowed it so I moved to the next phase, thinking it was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she'll change into animal form too.\" wishfully thinking, I thought. \"That would be cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to get my entire body into it, which was when Megan realized what she had started and began to worry and pushed off, \"Okay Travis, that's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled at Megan before I could stop myself, I felt as if I had become more animal than man at this point and began to worry myself. <i>\"Megan, back off... slowly.\"</i> desperately, I thought. <i>\"Get away from me!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked into his eyes and began to slowly back away as if my eyes did not belong to me anymore. My growling became deeper as I actually came down onto all fours and approached her, the animal side of me getting stronger despite my mental protests to stop myself. I feared Megan now regretted scratching me like she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis please...it's me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was no longer in control, I roared fiercely to silence her, just before I pounced on her, driven wild by my own animal instincts and hormones. A quick swipe of my paw sliced part of the tank top she was wearing. She looked in fear, \"Travis...I-I don't want t-to hurt you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother swipe, but this time I got her skin. A set of deep wounds appeared on her shoulder. Megan let out a small scream of pain. That was when a blast of light emitted from her and she landed what felt like a hundred strong blows to my gut in less than a second, sending me into convulsions. The pain was intense, though it only lasted a few seconds, and I slumped to the floor unconscious from the shock but remained in anthro form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to me, Sam had rushed in when Megan screamed and saw her attack onto me before he rushed over to her, \"Megan!

He flexed his hand, but it wasn't into a fist. He came closer, and I was still wondering what he was doing. Suddenly, long silver claws grew from his fingertips. I didn't have the time to react, I was slashed right across my chest. The pain was so bad that I turned human again. There was a slight pain near my face, but most of it was on my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can't control yourself, find another girlfriend\" growling, Sam said. \"Let those scars on your chest be a reminder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked away right after that.

But she was already there. \"Travis, your not dangerous...your just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Megan listen! I made scars on your shoulder!

I gave up and just his in the room that they provided me with. I sat in the corner, tail wrapped around me and ears to the side. I locked the door so no one got in. I don't know how long I sat there crying, but I dozed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small click woke me up, along with the creak of the door opening. \"I locked the door for a reason...\" I said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but these are electrical locks\" she replied.

I managed to turn, \"Megan...what are you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis listen to me\" she said. \"You are not a monster. You may be dangerous, but you are not a monster. You are a sweet boy that will protect me from everything. There will be a few scrapes and bruises along the way, but that is what makes a relationship strong. I...I like you...and I don't want to lose you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer crying made me cry, but I embraced her fully. She did care, and even though I hurt her, she still cared.</span></div></div>",

A moment later, a deep growl emitted from deep in his throat, making both Megan and I to shiver. \"That's Clarence Mayweather on that roof top!\" anger in his voice, he said. \"He's the bastard who put Sarah Vance into a wheelchair!\" he growled again, adding, \"He has a rifle in his hands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Megan and I gasped, wondering if there was anything we could do. Then Sam turned to us both sharply. \"We need to make whoever he is targeting harder to zero in on.\" quickly, he said. \"Travis, Megan, follow my lead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan and I nodded and scrambled out of the car before we all followed Sam as we changed into complete wolf forms and charged the students, growling and howling. The students screamed and scattered in all directions as we snapped at their heels. <i>\"This is actually kind of fun.\"</i> darkly, I thought. <i>\"I just hope I don't bump into Garth or the others.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a powerful hand made contact with my underside and I felt myself being violently thrown through the air. Pain filled my frame as I crashed through a window, forcing my body to return to human form. I weakly looked up to find the rock carved form of Garth Jones. \"What the hell do you think you're doing!?\" impatiently, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly got up and replied...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I found it ironic that all of the kids involved in the 'new problem child gang' were there. Only, before I reached the classroom, a strong hand grabbed me from behind and pulled me into a dark and empty classroom. \"Relax, son.\" whispering, dad's voice said. \"We need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, dad?\" worried, I said. \"Is mom okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad took a step into the dim light, startling me as he was in the form of an Anthro wolf! \"I am what this world calls an Metamorphic humanoid, I can change into any creature by willing my DNA to rewrite itself.\" calmly, dad said. \"I come from a world where everyone is a shape shifter but, as we all look different, we all have a different type of shape shifting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious!?\" stunned again, I asked. \"Here I thought being a test tube baby was a wild explanation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a failure.\" firmly, dad replied. \"As far as your mother is concerned, however, it was a success.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed. \"Your mother was an operative, working for The Agency.\" urging me to sit down, he began. \"I was her latest acquisition target as her employers had learned of my abilities through my own exploits outside of the original Problem Child Gang. I did cross their paths here and there but I kept to my own work.. I was dubbed the 'unknown shadow'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened to saucers. \"So, I am connected to PCG.\" whispering, I said. composing myself, I asked, \"So, I'm a half alien human or something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your mother did not have the ability to 'bend' the rules of reality, you would not exist right now.\" serious, dad said. \"You see, our species is not compatible with humans. We have a... 'double plug' to coin a phrase.\" he sighed, adding, \"I'm not certain if she altered me or herself but we made love and, nine months later, you were born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about all that talk about the test tube project...\" I tried to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything your mother told you about that project was true only it was a complete failure.\" wincing, dad said. \"She made the attempt two months before we managed to have true intercourse.\" sadly, he said, \"She 'miscarried' in her sleep only a month after the experiment but there was no body, just fluids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A false pregnancy.\" wincing, I said. \"That must have torn her apart inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't know.\" showing a hint of shame, dad replied. \"I sedated her into a deep sleep and cleaned the mess, changing the sheets, before she awoke.\" turning back to me, he said, \"Your mom is never to know this as there is no death to mourn, just a failed experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me more about your world, dad.\" after a pause, I said. \"Why did you come here, how can I change forms quickly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a military coup on my old world.\" interrupting me, dad said. \"My mother and father were given the task of protecting the crown prince and his prearranged wife as they fled into exile; I was taken with them. Only we were forced to crash land on Earth... I and the royal couple were the only survivors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are they now?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They live in this very town, son.\" looking at me, dad replied. \"I never took the oath to protect them so I ended up becoming adopted by the Greenway family while they moved on to their prearranged lifestyle as 'live alone' kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And changing forms?\" hopeful, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"To change forms quickly, you must first learn how your body works and how to control it.\" he said. \"It's like learning gymnastics or martial arts, you have to train your body to work the way you want it to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you teach me?\" begging, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start by changing part of your body from animal to human all day.\" smiling, dad replied. \"Make certain it is a part no one will notice like your leg or arm, covered by your trousers and long sleeved uniform shirt. That alone will give you all the practice you need to change faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought about that.\" surprised, I said. I then showed dad the 'watch' Mr Connors gave me. \"What about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad took it and crushed it in his hands, destroying it. \"That's cheating.\" chuckling, he said. \"You know better than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled as dad then returned to his human form and quietly walked out of the room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ready for a face rearrangement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBradford Boss, local football jock and school bully. He's over six feet tall and well built. Blonde hair, blue eyes, and a few missing teeth. He's been held back a few years, but the only other reason he wasn't held back more was from his \"important\" role on the team. He's all brawn and no brains. And the worst part, he's the guy I beat up when I was younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed as I stood up straight. \"Come on Bradford, I don't want to be late on my first day back.\" I tried to go around him, but he kept pushing me behind his wall of muscle. \"Alright\" I sighed, \"What will it take for you to let me go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cracked his knuckles as he cracked a smile. \"One punch...that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled with an idea, but I made it fade. I acted scared, \"No Bradford...p-please don't p-punch my face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed as he reached back. He threw his fist forward, but I saw that coming. I ducked, making his fist hit the locker. He stepped back to soothe his hand, giving me my moment to escape. But once again, it was short-lived. Bradford grabbed my neck and pinned me against the lockers. \"You think you're so smart don't you freak?\" he asked. I smiled but that only made this worse. His massive hand clenched my neck tighter. I couldn't breathe and I couldn't transform, he would tell someone and there were cameras everywhere. I could only stay here and constantly get punched in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, as I was being punched, I felt something form. It was...in my stomach. But it quickly rose up my throat and in my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBradford held his fist back, \"Any last words?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no control, I spat the contents of my mouth. I heard the bully scream as he let go of me. I dropped to the ground while regaining my breath. Whatever I spat out was green, and worse it was corrosive. Bradford was screaming like his face was on fire, which he probably wanted less. I couldn't let the guy suffer. There was the janitor's cart so I quickly ran over. I grabbed the bucket of mop water, rushed over, and splashed his face with it. Good news, it wiped off. Even more good news, the gunk did not do much damage. Bad news, Bradford was okay. I found myself once again in a chokehold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you did ya freak, but this time I'll-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Boss, drop him this instant.\" We both turned, seeing the principal of the school. Bradford was shocked, shocked enough to let me get free. \"Both of you, to my office, now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let Bradford ahead of me as I hung back. <i>Great, my first day here and I already got in trouble. But what was that green stuff? Why couldn't I have done that before? I cant believe i already lost control of my powers. And how am I going to explain THAT to the principal?</i></span></div></div>",

Only I knew that a fight here would result in others getting hurt so I decided to play things cool for the moment. \"What exactly do you want with me?\" ice in my voice, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are in the process of recruiting young people with talents such as yours to help us against a criminal organization, calling themselves the Agency.\" to my surprise, Holmes said. \"We know all about your mother's involvement with the Agency twenty years ago and would like to offer you a chance to earn her a clean slate and a fresh new beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are the good guys?\" raising an eyebrow, I asked. then I caught what they had said about my mom and turned red with anger.

Only they were each firmly holding Megan by the wrist as they urged her along! Megan threw me a pleading look as they passed, telling me she was in trouble! With my adrenaline at an all time high, I ran passed the men and barred the exit with my body. \"Stop right there!\" with a growl in my voice, I commanded. \"Where are you taking my girlfriend!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say nothing, Miss Connors.\" quickly, the first man warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This does not concern you, kid.\" sternly, the second man said. \"Step aside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not happening!\" fangs growing into place, I growled. \"Let her go... NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have time for this.\" flatly, the first man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded to the second man who drew a strange gun like device and fired before I could react. A flash of light and heavy wave of pain later, I found myself being thrown out the door. I landed in a heap, shaking from a sort of electric shock as the two men half carried, half dragged Megan passed me to an awaiting helicopter that seemed to make no noise at all. I struggled to my feet just in time to see the helicopter fly off with Megan looking out a window at me. There was a fearful look on her face and tears in her eyes which was all I needed to ignore the pain I was in. \"Megan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had considered calling for the others but I knew that the helicopter would be long gone before they could come running; I was on my own. With a roar of anger, I summoned all the strength I had and leaped into the air, becoming the most powerful flying creature I could think of, the classic dragon. Unfortunately, there was no time for me to worry about anyone seeing me as I took to the air. My only thought was to save Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No one kidnaps my girlfriend!\"</i> closing on the helicopter, I thought. <i>\"Those punks will dread the day they ever crossed our path!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fired a blast of fire across the helicopter's left side before passing it and firing another blast across its right side from the front, circling it. I could see fear on the pilot's face as he took evasive action. He pulled on the stick, sending the helicopter climbing into the clouds above so, I thought, to lose me in the haze. I followed right behind, intending to chase it down. <i>\"Hiding from me won't help you!\"</i> fuming, I thought. <i>\"I can see the heat from your engines!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, as I cleared the clouds, I saw what could only have been described as a massive flying wing! The ship was the size of two Nimitz class aircraft carriers, fused together in a 'V' formation, with twin control towers in the middle where the two halves met!  As I climbed higher, following the helicopter, I saw that the engines were in a huge, triangular shaped piece that filled the space between the two wings. It was an intimidating and impressive sight that sent a chill down my spine. <i>\"What the hell!\"</i> startled, I thought. <i>\"Who are these people and what do they want with Megan!?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched, almost helplessly as the helicopter came to a landing on the ship and was lowered inside with the landing pad sinking down inside. I had only seconds to decide what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ignoring the danger I was likely placing myself into, I dived down at an angle so to miss the helicopter's primary rotary blades and flew inside to a large hangar. There was little room to fly about so I landed, hoping to keep my dragon form long enough to pull Megan to safety. I immediately noticed a small army of armed men in military uniforms running my way and fired off a stream of fire as a stern warning to keep their distance. The soldiers stopped in their tracks but remained close enough to deliver a hail of bullets, which worried me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand down!\" a stern voice commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander on the deck!\" announced a soldier. the men saluted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, I turned to see a tall and muscular man, in all black and a long black coat, causally approaching me as I stood in front of the helicopter. He had black hair and brown eyes with a face that seemed to have been carved out of stone with strong features that gave him a commanding presence. \"Your girlfriend is in no danger, Mr Greenway.\" standing directly in front of my dragon form, he said. \"Stand down, return to your human form, or I will pin you down until you run out of energy to maintain your dragon form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough I was exhausted, I could not help chuckle at the man's demand. \"You? Pin me down?\" a hiss to my voice, I asked. \"That's a laugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy smile quickly vanished as I noticed the guards suddenly back away from the man. I turned back to him and gasped, seeing a hundred of him standing before me! \"Last chance, Mr Greenway.\" darkly, the man said in a hundred voices. \"Stand down or be taken down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to the helicopter to see Megan still looking fearful then turned back to the man. If this was a trap, standing down could prove to be a big mistake. On the other hand, I was near exhaustion, I would not last long if I was forced to fight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They are now forcing me to surrender for their trap. I got ready for what would come next, \"I said LET HER GO!\" I exhaled as massive as a stream of flames as I could. But even though, all it managed to do it burn the ground and a few soldiers behind him. The next thing I knew, I was being pummeled by the hundred men. I tried to thrash them off, but they simply multiplied. Their weight was getting heavier and heavier. My mouth was forced shut as I hit the ground, several men holding it shut. One looked to me, \"We warned you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes went to Megan, who was watching in mortal terror. I couldn't let her suffer my fate. \"Megan duck!\" With the last bit of freedom I had, I swung my tail to the two guards holding her. Thankfully she did as she was told, and ducked before my tail hit the two. They fell unconscious, and my efforts blocked more from coming. \"Megan go! Leave now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But...Travis...\" She looked absolutely terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mouth was forced shut before I could respond to her. All I saw was the man. He smiled at me, \"It is only a matter of time.\" More came into view, \"Soon you will both be part of our organization.\" The sound of an engine whirling was suddenly heard. I also heard some crackles of electricity. Some of the men on my head looked back and looked terrified, \"M-Men take her down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anything else could happen, streaks of electricity seemed to bolt to the soldiers. The copies of the man began to loosen, so I took advantage. As soon as they were off my line of sight, I turned back to see the horror. Megan was in her silver mannequin-like state, only this time I saw her eyes. They were glowing and filled to the brim with rage. The floor panels below her were broken off, wiring entangled her legs. Electricity flowed through her like she was a part of the ship herself. The helicopter behind her was airborne, their propellers spinning at high speeds to where it could finally be heard. \"Leave. My boyfriend. ALONE!\" The helicopter suddenly flew in my direction. Most of the clones fled off, but only some were knocked off by the powerful air currents. Megan directed the helicopter to where the man was separated from me. Sadly I did not have the strength anymore, my form turning human. And once again, I was in tathers for clothes, mainly pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a second look to Megan. Although I was safe, she remained her current state. Her eyes were still filled with rage as she eyed the man and his soldiers. The helicopter's tail rotor soon broke off, intentional or not, and it flew straight towards the clones. I was shocked by the amount of aggression she was showing. It was like it was not even Megan anymore. The helicopter continued to get more and more pieces off of its hull. \"Megan, we need to get out of here! We need that helicopter intact!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spoke as loud as I could, hoping my words would go into her mind after piercing through all of the screams. Her eyes looked to me, so she did hear me. \"We will leave...\" Her voice seemed to take to a new tone, \"After their blood paints the walls of this ship...\" Her response horrified me. She directed the attention to the troopers, to where now wires were bursting through the floor panels and electrocuting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't stand seeing my girl like this. I needed to get her and me off the ship and get her disconnected from those wires. But she became supercharged with electricity from them. Then, my mind clicked with an idea. It was a longshot, possibly with a greater chance at death than life. But I couldn't let my girlfriend became a killer. With the last bit of energy I had left, I charged straight towards her while transforming. I took the form of the only animal I could have thought of that could  withstand electricity, an electric eel. I crashed straight into her, thankfully disconnecting her from the floor. Sadly, that was out only connection. My tackle caused us both to fall out of the open hangar doors, plummeting to the ground miles below. Even more, I felt my energy sap away as I could hardly stay awake anymore. My eyes closed from the lack of energy.</span></div></div>",

I slowly sat up to find that I was inside a large round glass cage. Outside of the cage was the tall man in all black with Megan at his side. She looked at me sadly but managed a smile. The man, however, remained serious as he approached the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you're finally awake, Mr Greenway.\" politely, he said. \"Your little tantrum stirred quite a ruckus on my ship.\" he then turned to Megan. \"Your loss of control didn't help matters any, Miss Connors but I'll let you help explain things to your boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan walked up to the glass, placing her hand onto the door. I stood uneasily and walked over, placing my hand against the glass. \"How did we get back on the ship?\" worried, I asked. \"Did they hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Travis.\" calmly, Megan said. \"I came with these people willingly. My father is with us too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" surprised, I asked. \"Then what was with your attack on the soldiers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those were energy clones, not living people.\" serious, Megan said. \"However, they are just as solid and as heavy as real people.\" she cringed. \"I feared they might crush you so I cried to the ship for help only something happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was some kind of feed back.\" wincing, Megan replied. \"I completely lost control of myself.\" she moaned then added, \"Blitzkrieg said that my power was likely incomparable with the ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what Mr multiple personality calls himself?\" scoffing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are the Central Headquarters of Intelligence, Logistics, and Defense; CHILD.\" stepping forward, Blitzkrieg said. \"The idea was to entice you to follow Megan in since those sent to recruit you used a less desirable approach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why us?\" focusing on Blitzkrieg, I asked. \"How did you save us from falling to Earth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't fall anywhere, Travis.\" wincing, Megan replied. \"We both passed out on inner deck.\" pausing, she added, \"You must have dreamed that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We work to protect and maintain efforts towards a world balance and peace.\" serious, Blitzkrieg said. \"The Agency is threatening that balance by building a small army of super powered individuals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you need super powered people of your own to correct that balance.\" guessing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Specifically, they need super powered individuals who've had experience in dealing with the Agency.\" chiming in, Megan said. \"My dad thinks both they and we can use all the help we can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its only a matter of time, Mr Greenway.\" looking at me, Blitzkrieg said. \"You and your girlfriend will both be a part of our organization.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think we will ever join you?\" annoyed, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitzkrieg walked away from the cage, He then hit a button on a control panel, opening the cage door. \"I never said anything about you joining us.\" simply, he said. \"We need you and I can guarantee you will be needing us.\" he walked back to face me. \"The Agency is gearing up for something huge and we need to be ready for when they strike!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Megan who winced before giving me a nod. \"Alright, you got my attention.\" softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitzkrieg nodded. \"Let's get straight down to business.\" he said. \"Follow me to the conference room.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But that was not the worst thing I heard. I heard a loud shrill scream, a very familiar one. My heart sank as the color ran from Garth's face. \"Someone got shot!\" stating the obvious, he said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, I jumped out the same window I was thrown through and ran to the front of the school but stopped. What I saw was devastating, Megan was lying on the ground!  I ran to her and began to check for signs of life, I heard little heartbeat and small breathing, her body felt cold. Sam had vanished into an alley, only to shortly return, now back to normal. Garth showed had immediately followed me, also back to normal, not that I cared at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Megan...?\" I asked while trembling. She had a deep wound in her chest, the sound of her heartbeat left me and I could not tell if she was breathing or not. <i>\"That man, he did this!\"</i> My mind was running wild only this time I did not fight it. I ran away from the group, towards the building we saw the man Sam called Mayweather, wanting to tear him limb from limb. My power rose with my anger and sorrow. As I entered an alley to climb the fire escape to the building roof, I felt my body shift into a new form, it was that of a tiger. I felt more muscle in this form. Growls escaped my mouth, and I did nothing to stop them. Unknown to me, Garth and Sam were on my tail, looking worried, but did I care? Not really. My anger spiked as I saw the man, coming down the same fire escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dead!\" I shouted towards the rooftop. The man, climbing down, seemed surprised as he looked down at my feline form. A thin smile formed on my face as I caught the scent of his fear. \"You heard me, YOU ARE DEAD, MAYWEATHER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man scrambled back up, sweat dripping from his forehead, giving me another smile. <i>Silly prey...he believes he can outrun me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lurched for the first rung of the ladder to climb up but I was suddenly grabbed my two massive hands. Garth held me tightly, causing me to struggle to get free. \"Let me go!\" I shouted. \"That human must pay for his deed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis, control yourself.\" Sam said calmly. \"He's long gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE KILLED MY MATE AND YOU WANT ME TO CALM DOWN?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lies! They just want him for themselves! Fight them!</i> came a voice in my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>No dear wild one, she is fine. Her father is correct, she is still alive.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that voice. I heard her before in the hospital room. \"...Zoe...?\" I said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't listen to her! She's trying to trick you! Kill the man who killed your mate!</i> came the mad voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>Travis...please be at peace. If Megan were to be deceased, I would be gone too, no? I am her symbiont, when she dies I die...</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No! No...no...</i> the voice in my head died down to complete silence as logic began to prevail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my senses coming back to me and I stopped struggling.  Sam and Garth were looking at me with concern. \"Travis...are you okay?\" Garth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah...\" I managed to spill out. \"Y-You....can let me go now...\" Garth put me down and shrank down a bit. I held my head, \"Uh...that was brutal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...I think I'm losing it. For a second there, I heard someone else in my head. Only it wasn't me, I had a fight my feral instincts again....\" I stood up a bit, \"But this time...I won, thanks to Zoe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like that boy at the mall.\" whispering, Garth said. \"It can't be a coincidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope you can keep doing that.\" firmly, Sam said. \"You are staying home today, IO want to run a full number of tests on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we returned to the school, I saw Megan, awake again, though barely, being loaded into an ambulance.\u00a0I ran to her and took her hand, happy she was still alive. \"I called for this ambulance but its going to the clubhouse.\" whispering carefully, Sam said. \"The hospital is not safe for any of us right now.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What was weird was that the bullet seemed flat; like it hit a wall or something. The other thing that was weird was that her skin already seemed to start closing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned away, I couldn't stand looking at her anymore. I promised to protect her, and all I did was make her an easier target. I caused her pain, I made her an easy target, how could I ever be called even her boyfriend?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis...?\" I turned to the voice, surprisingly I saw my mother. \"Travis...it's okay dear...\" She sat next to me and gently hugged me. \"You cannot blame yourself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it was me!\" I shouted at her. I made sure she saw my face, \"See my scar? Sam gave me a few of them to remind myself that I cannot hurt Megan! At the school, me running around scaring the others away only opened her up for a clear shot! I'm a failure as a friend, and an even bigger failure if I was her boyfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mother gasped, and I knew why. I quickly forgot about my scar. This morning I hid it from her. But the cover washed off. Sam walked through the door, I got up. \"How is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Travis...\" he said quickly. \"She's half alien. Megan's unconscious at the moment, but she will be fine. Now...I would like for you to come with me for your own tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as my mom walked up to him before slapping him across the face. \"You better fix what's wrong with my son. We'll talk later about those scars...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked away mad, leaving Sam to stare at me confused. I shrugged, \"It's a long story...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI entered a separate room to where Megan was. It was all white, like a common hospital room. In the middle was what looked like an MRI. \"Lay on this and I'll scan your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did as he asked and approached the machine. But he stopped me. \"To get better results, I believe you should change into the animal from before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, shifting my form into a tiger. Sam looked...it wasn't surprised but more like intrigued. \"Is there...something wrong...?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This form...\" he started, \"You're...taller. Yes, you seem to have increased in height and in muscle build. But let's fix one problem at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laid on the bed just as he instructed. I slowly moved into the machine, seeing a couple of lights flash on me and scan. What I couldn't get over was his comment. Was I really different? The machine stopped and I was let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The results will be in soon. I believe Megan should be well enough for you to see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took no time into running over. I opened the door into the next room. I hoped Megan wasn't to upset.</span></div></div>",

I...\" I tried to hold a tear back but it fell, \"I'm so sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not want to see her face. I broke a promise. If she wasn't alien then she would have died. Even more so I lost control of myself again. I shouldn't even deserve to be with her. However she thought otherwise.

If you never did anything, you or maybe even an innocent kid could have been killed. I'm tougher than I look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"Besides...\" Megan gently scratched behind my ear, a purr escaped from the good feeling. \"I don't mind seeing you wild. But we just have to play it safe.\" She stopped after a bit. Sure I was sad the feeling was gone, but I understood why. She rubbed her head on my arm, \"Your fur is so soft...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled, \"So are your hands...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter our little make up, I helped Megan up. She was still shaky so I helped her walk. Her father was worried about this, but she convinced him otherwise. Today we were able to stay another day. School apparently was still happening. Megan and I just decided to play a simple card game. If I lost, I would have to change into an animal of her choice and do something. If I won, well I didn't decide right on then. But, she allowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dealt the cards, we were playing Blackjack. The game was always still fun even if you weren't gambling. I smiled as I laid down a flush. I was still in tiger form but she didn't mind. \"Beat that Mech...\" I said slyly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Megan's pokerface disappeared into a big smile. She laid down her cards, royal flush. I couldn't believe it, the one hand that could beat mine. I sighed, \"A deal is a deal\" I changed back to human, \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at me slyly. \"I think I know what...\" I grew nervous; who knew what she had planned. \"I want you to turn into...an Anthro Arachnid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a bit shocked, but mostly confused. Why did she want me to become a human/spider hybrid? \"Megan...I'm not so sure about that\" uncertain, I said. \"I can't really change into anything else but mammal forms; I don't think my body is ready for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said that you would try to improve right?\" pressing, Megan asked. \"Plus you were going to try to expand your capabilities. And from what I heard, you changed into a cobra AND an eagle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a male version of a Naga and a Garuda.\" correcting her, I said. \"An Anthro Arachnid is a far cry from either of those. Do you know what the difference is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan pouted but she suddenly frowned. Her eyes welled up and tears began to form. I panicked, it was the puppy dog face. I wanted to turn and walk away but I couldn't. She looked so...helpless. Unknown to me, Megan was a reluctant participant in a test on me by her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, \"Alright, I'll do it...\" to her smile, I said. \"But I need to remove some clothing, I don't want to ruin my pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan nodded in agreement. I walked into the bathroom, took off my pants and undergarments, and then focused on becoming a humanoid spider. At first, nothing happened but then, I could feel my skeleton changing, almost breaking. It hurt, it hurt along and I was forced to grit my teeth as my buttocks grew outward and another pair of legs and feet shot out before my torso stretched and another pair of arms and hands shot out, giving me eight limbs! The pain was bad but it subsided and I felt a warmth coursing through me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that wasn't so...\" I was unable to finish my thought as a new pain hit my entire face. It felt like I was hit with a concrete block. I couldn't contain it, I screamed in anguish. The pain stopped just as fast as it came and I took a few deep breaths to steady myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis?\" knocking on the door, Megan asked. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI managed to stand, having four legs now, I really needed to reestablish my balance. I took a look in the mirror to get a first look at myself. The first thing I noticed was the hard shell-like plates that ran across my body. Next thing, I had eight eyes. Two were my own, turned red within red, with three smaller eyes in a triangular formation around each one. Lastly, I noticed that my canine teeth had grown into large fangs that looked like pincers. I slowly twisted the doorknob to get out. I was greeted by Megan's worried face. But it changed to one of shock mixed with slight...excitement, at least I hoped. \"So...how do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan led me to a full body mirror. I followed without question; I wanted to see what I look like. As I moved, I felt the significant change in my walk. Spiders have a very good sense of balance; my body barely moved compared to a human. I stood before in mirror in awe. My lower body was an entire spider abdomen but with only four legs as I had four arms, eight limbs total. By my coloration, it was hard to tell what kind of spider it was. But I looked exotic, truly a sight to behold. \"Whoa...\" is all I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan hugged me, \"You look perfect for Halloween!\" She separated and focused on my legs, \"Hey, do you think you can do all a spider can?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped away from her, \"To be honest, I don't know.\" I gently approached the wall. I raised my leg and placed it against the wall. Strangely, I felt it stick. I placed another, the same thing happened. Soon, my entire body was vertical with the wall. The world looked strange sideways. I continued to the ceiling. The world looked even weirder upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourself?\" Megan joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laugh all you want\" I said. I scurried across the ceiling, \"I'm loving being a spider.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad your liking that, because that's what you'll be doing.\" okay, now I was confused. The only reason she asked me to be a spider, was to crawl on the ceiling? I crawled closer to her as her smile widened. \"I want you to prank my dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, \"Uh...what...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, I want to prank my dad. And this is the perfect way to do it. When your above him, spray him with your silk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crawled back down to the floor. I approached her, \"Megan, you expect me to pull a prank on your dad? I'm not even sure if I can-\" she suddenly jabbed me in the throat. It hurt, bad. I began to cough, but something else came up. On the ground, was white webbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't do it?\" Megan looked at me slyly. \"A deal is a deal right?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once again, I sighed with defeat. The ceilings were pretty high, so I should be able to do it without trouble. \"Fine...I'll...I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan embraced me with a smile but that only lasted for a few seconds. I made my way back to the ceiling and made my way to the next room. Megan helped me with the first door but she stopped after that. I was alone on this mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing upside down wasn't as weird as you think. It's kind of nice actually, however I was also half arachnid so it could have been that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I knew where he was...\" I said. I went through a lot of common rooms, but I have not even found a trace of him. The ceilings were pretty high, enabling me to move without detection. But I was beginning to get bored, so I changed tactics. I crawled to the corner of the ceiling and waited. It felt odd, but something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was spitting silk. It was like I was fine one moment, but then next thing I knew I was stringing yet another web. I stopped entirely. It was weird, but now the corner had a decent sized web in the corner. I sat down on it, and it suddenly became very comfortable. No wonder spiders always made webs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it occurred to me, how did I know how to make a web? My instincts seemed to be overtaking me or something. I shouldn't be learning that fast. <i>Maybe I should use that device. I mean, yeah I have some control but if I'm going to perform an instinct is going to happen every new form I have, I might even loose myself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA click of a door opening hit my ears (if I had any). I then took notice of the room; it was the kitchen. Megan's father entered in a humming tune. <i>Ah man...I can't ruin his good mood.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever what came next was unprepared for both me and him. A stray stream of silk must have trailed off, because his hand caught onto it. He tugged and pulled, trying to get it off. That's when it happened, instincts took over. I could feel my body beginning to move. <i>No! Not again! Mr Connors look out!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I couldn't speak. I could only watch helplessly. I pounced on him, pinning his arms and legs to the ground using my limbs. I immediately spat silk to hold him down. \"Travis?! What's the meaning of this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in my web...silly little pest...\" That voice, it was not mine in the slightest. I leaned down closer to his neck. The prey was moving to much. My fangs, they were ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis NO!\" I stood up and turned, but I only met a silver light. In one hit peas knocked off of Sam and knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I came to, I was lying on the kitchen floor. Megan, her parents, and my parents were all looking at me. Each one had a different emotion; Megan with sadness, my parents with concern, Megan's mom with worry, but I couldn't tell Sam's emotion. I hate to bet against him; his poker face was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What...happened?\" I slowly sat up, rubbing my head. The headache was bad. I was rushed into a hug from Megan and my mom. The pain went away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis...we need to talk.\" My attention was now on Sam Connors. \"These actions have occurred more than once, and your body cannot take another one.\" I was handed the makeup mirror my mother had. My skin, it was paler than ever before. It could almost be called snow white. \"You're focusing on getting more forms than to practice and control what you already have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed in defeat. \"Mom...you still have that device I gave you?\" She quickly reached into her purse and handed me the device. It was the device Megan's father gave me. I instantly put it over my left wrist. Hopefully when I go out in public people will just think it's some weird watch. \"Your right...my body is losing it. And I know that I'm not ready for it. I'm not instantly going to be a superhero, especially if I'm training like this. So, I'm going to wear this from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good decision...now then, let us eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan helped me up, \"You made dinner while I was unconscious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only giggled, answering my question. What was weird was that my body felt different. No idea why, but I couldn't do it on an empty stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal was delicious, although I could not think that they never truly \"cooked\" the meal. It was simply spaghetti and meatballs. And whatever was in it made me tired. It was either that or my body finally giving out. With a few finals hugs from my mom, I retired to my room. I slipped into my sleepwear and quickly fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When I awoke, I felt terrible. I felt dirty and sore like I was sleeping on a filthy metal floor. Light poured onto my eyes, blinding me for a bit. I shot up and shielded my eyes. That's when I noticed, once my vision cleared I saw scales. I could feel it, my long tail and the hood on my head; I was in my cobra naga form. I tried to shift back, but I could barely change at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bright flash of light blinded me for a few seconds. \"No flash photography, it could startle the beast\" a voice spoke. I rubbed my eyes to look. First thing, I was in a cage. A full metal, filthy, cage. Second, I was at the zoo. Thirdly, I was huge! I mean, I was coiled up and it seemed like I could almost touch the edges of my cage. Another flash, <i>This is getting really annoying...</i> \"Mam, I'm going to have to ask you to remove the camera from your daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked out, seeing three people. One zookeeper, one woman, and one little girl. I was completely confused to why I was here. \"Uh...hello?\" I attempted to ask. But the only thing that came out \u00a0was a hiss. The little girl backed up in fear. \"What's going on?\" again, all that came out was a hiss. I grabbed the bars and tried to pull them a bit. Suddenly, a painful shock was delivered through my body. I released the bars and fell back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would think this thing would have learned by now...\" the zookeeper mumbled.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe this, I was a animal in the zoo. This...this had to be a nightmare. The three left the cage, but someone else came. It was Megan! \"Megan!\" I slithered to the edge and grabbed the bars. \"You have to help me! Please!\" But sadly, all that came out were hisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at me horribly, \"Hiss all you want Travis, you're not getting out.\" I couldn't believe it, why was I even here? \"We're done with you, all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe direction she gestured I followed. The rest of the Problem Child Gang were there. They all stared at me in anger. <i>What did I do...?</i> I knew I couldn't talk, but I just hissed instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan turned away in response. She seemed to be trembling, but that was just my imagination probably. She started to walk away, but I couldn't let her. I threw my tail and got her leg. She stared at me in horror, \"Help! Someone please help!\" I've never seen that much fear in her eyes before. The same shock was delivered, but this one was three times as strong. Not only that, I felt like I was being jabbed by something sharp. The pain forced my eyes shut, it was too much, I had to retreat. Although it hurt, nothing hurt more than seeing Megan walk away; with her hand as a knife covered in blood. <i>She...she stabbed me...and she took control of the cage...M-Megan...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't tell what hurt worst, my tail or my heart. Megan left me, the gang left me, and I think I saw my parents in that group. Moist tears fell from my eyes as I sat there, lying on my own body. I heard the laughs, I heard the names, I felt whatever was thrown, but I didn't care. It felt like hours, thats when I felt a sinister presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...Travis...\" I turned and saw a man wearing a suit and coat. The hat was tipped to hide his face. Something about him seemed, evil. \"I'm a traveling representative for the Agency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of the name, I turned my head. This weird feeling passed through my mind, the world went blurry for a few seconds, but I pushed it aside. \"I'm not interested.\" I do not know why I spoke, but I really didn't care about that anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never gave me a chance to explain...\" I gasped, \u00a0\"Yes, I can understand you. You would be surprised what we can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean kidnap kids, kill their parents, and force them for your own tasks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that seems so good compared to what they did to you.\" I couldn't help it, but he sound convincing. He kept urging me to listen to him. \"Instead of helping you return to normal, they set you aside like an animal. Especially the one you held dear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI...I couldn't let him into my head; something wasn't right. \"W-Why do you care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear Travis, I care for you. You have more power than you know.\" I turned to him, slightly interested. \"You can change to any animal you want, but deep inside of you is your true form, a form that can best all of them. And besides, don't you want to meet your other relative?\" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. \"If you cone and join us, I'll be to assure you that we can make your life better.\" The man stuck his hand out to me, \"You have my word. Do we have a deal?\"\u00a0I looked at his hand carefully. Before anything else happened, it all went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up in a startle. I was back in the room they provided for me. The clock read 3am. Truly I was shocked. I didn't know if that was a nightmare, a dream, a vision, or all three. But that man, he spoke things that I could not get out of. My true form, did I really have one? Plus the mentioning of a relative, did I have one? The worst part of it was, I felt like accepting his deal.</span></div></div>",

I had the same dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, hearing that. \"In my dream, you said you were done with me and walked away, leaving me alone until a man in a business suit came to me with an offer.\" crying slightly, I said. \"It was not the same dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked at me for a moment before becoming thoughtful. \"We both had a nightmare with the same theme, with the same ending, but different details.\" rubbing her chin, she mussed. \"It can't be a coincidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think it is?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought, Megan grabbed my hand and pulled me along with her. \"I remember something odd about the nightmare, Travis.\" running, she said. \"We have to talk to your mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" running with her, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My nightmare was a bit fuzzy, like a television station that was not quite coming in.\" reaching the first floor of her house, Megan explained. \"Did you notice that as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of.\" not making the connection, I said. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just trust me.\" pulling me into the family room, Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon running in, we were greeted by a concerned mom and dad who were talking to Mr and Mrs Connors. \"Where's the fire, Megan?\" standing up, Steve asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Greenway, you can alter reality to a point, right?\" out of breath, Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes.\" taken back, Crystal said. \"I try not to use it though, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan and I began to describe the nightmare we had shared, with the differences between them. \"I have a gut feeling that there is a message in that nightmare.\" finishing her story, Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am in tune with the animal kingdom, being able to change into any creature.\" chiming in, I said. \"Megan is an alien/human hybrid.\" he winced. \"No offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken.\" shrugging, Megan replied. \"Bottom line, Mrs Greenway, it is possible that we are receiving a psychic message between the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Highly unlikely.\" frowning, Sam said. \"However, in a dream like state, the mind is more open to psychic signals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal sighed. \"Stand side by side, you two.\" firmly, she ordered. \"I will try to 'project' your nightmares on the wall like a movie, played on the big screen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan and I did as we were told and Crystal placed a light hand onto our heads from behind before a replay of our nightmares played onto the wall, side by side. \"There does seem to be something there.\" curious, Crystal said. \"Let's try something here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan and I watched, uncertain as the two images came together, overlapping. Once it was done, everyone's jaws opened to see a small boy and a small girl standing where there was once no one. The boy seemed fairly fit with short raven hair and brown eyes. The girl, who seemed younger, was very petite with doll like features; she had auburn hair and green eyes. Both of them had sad, desperate looks on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease... Please, someone help us.\u201d crying, the boy called out. \"Can anyone hear me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help us!\" also crying, the girl called out. \"Please... Please someone hear me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a call for help.\" almost whispering, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a man from Megan and my nightmare appeared behind them. \"There is no escape.\" coldly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost upon instinct, I changed into an anthro lion with a long black mane and roared at the image of Jon. With me, Megan gave a an angry grunt as every car horn within a hundred yards of the house angrily sounded off, equally matching my roar. \"We hear you!\" not knowing if my voice reached them, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will help you!\" added Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe then sounded in unison, \"Problem Child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur mission had begun.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like a CD or disc or something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I could\" Crystal spoke, \"But why?\" Megan and I looked at each other strongly. I heard my mother gasp, \"On no Travis...y-you can't! At least call the other members!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to side with Crystal on this one Travis\" Sam agreed. \"You still have no proper control of your powers, while Megan is still trying to find all of hers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other members are just as skilled\" I argued. \"Sam, Crystal, I honor and respect both of you. But we will never get the chance to get better if we don't do this.\" I sighed as I shifted back to human form, \"Could we at least look at the nightmares? We will call the team afterwards if we find anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mother faced Megan's dad with concern. With a reassuring nod, I once again felt my mothers hand on my forehead. A small jolt passed through me, but in her other hand formed a disc. Megan walked over, and the same thing happened. After we each received our discs they wished us luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to Megan, this place had a media room. To be honest I think she was better with her powers. Since this entire home was a machine, I guess she could navigate it easier. When we reached it, I couldn't believe my eyes. It was like every gamer's dream; flat screens, surround sound, plush seats, it was truly amazing. Megan mentioned that the screen can become as large as a movie theater screen. I told her that we don't need that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...which one should we look at first?\" I looked to Megan who seemed nervous for her's to be picked first. I did not like mine either, but her's was obviously more traumatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked up, slipped my disc into the DVD player, and then prepared for it. Experiencing a nightmare is one thing, telling someone about it was another, but showing someone what exactly happened was a complete other story. It started on the big screen as all black. Then the first flash happened, clearing the video. I heard Megan giggle when she saw the little girl and the camera. I couldn't help but to chuckle as well; it was a cute moment. But then, we got to THAT part. I couldn't help but cry again at what Megan said in the nightmare, even though the real Megan was beside me. Then I heard her gasp at when I was attacked by the dream Megan. I couldn't stand to watch it again; I turned away and sobbed for a bit. I heard the video stop and a gentle hand on my back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis, it's okay\" she spoke. \"You know I will never do that to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" I was silenced by a gentle kiss on my cheek. My face flushed red right afterwards, I could feel the heat. \"Uh...c-can we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch the rest?\" I nodded since she already finished the sentence. With another small giggle, she restarted the video. We were both surprised by the man's offer. Megan was more surprised on two accounts; that is what happened in her nightmare too, and that I was beginning to extend my hand. \"You were...going to...accept?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" I couldn't lie, \"I was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis why?!\" she gasped. \"They are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ones that have my cousin.\" Megan was silenced, \"I know it could be just the message playing tricks, but that did not sound joking. If that was real, I was going to join so I could save him and anyone else in there. I would sacrifice myself for any of those kids, any member of the team, I would even sacrifice myself for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence passed through the room. The video even seemed quiet, or it could have been Megan's doing. We were soon both embraced into a hug. It was definitely going to be a long night filled with emotional drama. Thank goodness we were both excused from school. We decided to stay on this video. But I wondered why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There could be clues hidden here\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and watched the film. She was right, there would be a way to tell where they were.</span></div></div>",

The images from both nightmares vanished and we saw a black screen before the image of the boy and the girl appeared on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Tommy Winters.\" introducing himself, the boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Aura Winters.\" introducing herself, the little girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are receiving this message, please listen carefully, we do not have much time.\" quickly, Tommy said. \"My sister and I are being held against our will by a group called, The Agency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are using what we can do to hurt people... kill people we don't know.\" tearfully, Aura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty years ago, The Agency was defeated by a brave and powerful group known as the Problem Child Gang.\" speaking quietly but clearly, Tommy said. \"If you can find them...\" he paused, crying, then blurted out, \u201cPlease... Please, someone help us! Can anyone hear me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help us!\" also crying, Aura called out. \"Please... Please someone hear me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the man from both Megan's and my dream appeared behind them. \"There is no escape.\" coldly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the screen went black. \"They had been caught, sending a call for help.\" crying, Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I refuse to believe they are dead.\" clenching a fist, I said. \"There has to be a way to find them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought, Megan touched the computer tower. \"Please....\" tears falling, she whispered. \"Help me find Tommy and Aura Winters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, the monitor came to life with image after image flashing into view as the computer searched the web. At the same time, hers and my cellphones began to do the same. Unknown to us, the computer before us had contacted the computer next door and it began to search as well. Watching the monitor, I came up with an idea of my own but I had no idea weather or not it would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw this in a movie once but that's a movie.\" running outside, I muttered to myself. \"It's crazy but anything is better than nothing at all.\" I sat down in the front yard and placed my hand onto the ground, whispering,. \"Mother Earth, hear my plea... help me find my cousins, Tommy and Aura Winters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, nothing happened but then, I began to see through the eyes of a cat nearby then a hawk, high above the city before I saw through the eyes of a dog in front of Our Founders Mall. The animals were searching from where they stood and, if they saw nothing, they moved the message on. \"Incredible...\" awestruck, I thought. \"I'm connected to a natural world wide web!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne would think I would be excited by this discovery when, in fact, it humbled me. I had thought my power was so complex when it was actually quite simple. I was one with nature itself... \"I'm an Animancer.\" whispering, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Focus, wild one.*</i> came Zoe's voice in my head. <i>*You do not wish to be 'logged out'.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, finally realizing what I truly was, and focused on finding my cousins. It was now just a matter of weather I or Megan will find them first.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't know why my parents never told me, but at this point I did not care. Then, I saw them. \"Megan!\" I shouted. \"Megan get out here quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not want to lose the connection I had, so I stayed with my hand on the ground. I heard someone run out of the home, followed by a few others. \"Travis\" I heard Megan, \"What's wrong?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see them!\" I exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You found them?!\" Crystal spoke. \"H-How?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...from what I can tell, there's a spider in their room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't lying, I had like eight different ways of looking at Tommy. There was a television in his room, showing a video feed of his sister, Aura, being tortured. I felt sorry for him, but even more for the Agency. I growled, knowing what I would do to the Agency. <i>Once I get them, I'll tear them apart limb by limb in front of their boss.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Travis...\" Megan spoke, \"Y-You're changing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit late, but I indeed felt part of the change take place. I shifted into a lion, strangely with the black mane and dark coat. But I still held the connection. \"I can still see them, I just wish I knew where they were\" I spoke aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly my vision shifted and began to move; whatever animal's eyes I was looking through was moving. Based on the sideways angle of the room, I could now determine that I was looming through the eyes of a spider. It stopped at a small hole where I saw the face of a rat. My vision shifted again, this time looking through the eyes of the ray. It darted back into the darkness before appearing on the floor of a room. The strangest part was that I was slightly feeling the movement myself. The room held a work desk and comfortable chair along with two normal chairs facing it. The rat hopped onto the chair and then onto the desk. <i>Did they...did they hear me?</i> The rat shifted through the papers lying on the desk. Then, he stopped at one, giving me what I needed. My vision blacked out after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up outside, surrounded by Megan, my parents, and her parents. Before I had the chance to sit up I was hugged by Megan. A quick check showed that I was human again. \"Don't get up too fast\" Sam said, \"You took a lot of energy out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat up with the aid of Megan. \"I...I know where they are...\" But before I finished, I faced my parents. They looked a bit distressed. \"Mom, dad, we need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Travis, I know...\" Crystal spoke quite sadly.</span></div></div>",

The house was truly a common house; but it could be a base of operations truly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mother looked a little distressed, since nearly every being in the room was focusing on her. \"Travis, Megan, you two are wondering how Tommy and Aura fit into this\" Crystal spoke. \"Travis, what I am going to say might be hard. You see, I had...a twin sister.\" I couldn't believe it; well I knew something had to fit together but still, I had an aunt? \"She, unlike me, was normal. Her side of genetics contained nothing for her to develop powers. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...what?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She still carried the traits. Her children, Tommy and Aura, received them. They were both born with significant powers, making her family a double target for the agency.\" The next part looked tearful for her, since I could already see tears beginning to form. \"They went on a small trip together, a family vacation\" she started in a sad tone. \"Their room was payed for, by some man. They took it, only to...find...\" Crystal cried into her hands before she could finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew it was too painful to continue, but I understood the rest. Her sister and husband died because of the Agency, and their two children were captured. I walked over, sat down beside her, and embraced her in a hug. My father joined in soon after, my mother calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the window behind us broke, two things landed on the floor. Our embrace broke as everyone's attention was gained. The two objects beeped slightly. Sam jumped up, \"Everyone duck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small explosion of light and smoke exploded in the living room. The lights went out as well, darkening the room. My eyes changed, adjusting so I could easily see through the smoke and dark. \"Megan! Where are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few coughs caught my attention. I was able to see her, she was pinned under a chair. I made my way over to her. I grabbed her hand to reassure her it was me before I helped her up. To my surprise, her eyes had changed as well only she seemed to have almost glass eyes with what looked like mechanical parts. I knew then that she too was able to see through the smoke and dark only she was very frightened and confused. We ran down the hall into a bedroom where we paused to rest. \"T-Travis...\" she spoke, \"W-What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was obviously scared, I was too. But I had to be brave. We heard more commotion; the door was kicked down and footsteps entered. \"Find the kids\" one spoke. \"We can take care of the parents later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan gasped but I covered her mouth. She breathed quickly, the lights flickered from her fear. She needed to calm down. I slowly rubbed her back, while hugging her. Her breathing settled as she finally became quiet. \"Travis...\" she whispered, \"Get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was kicked down as one man stood with a gun towards us. \"Freeze you brats!\" in a threatening tone, she said. \"You are now property of the Agency!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA high whirring sounded through the hall, causing the man to turn away. \"What the?\" he backed away, only to get knocked of his feet by a super fast automated vacuum cleaner. We both ran out as the man hit the floor but another man stood before the kitchen door, raising a weapon of his own. Another sound of whirling mechanics caught our attention. A blender spun its blade so fast that it shot out of the glass pitcher, scaring us both. The spinning blades bounced off the ceiling and embedded itself in the man's wrist, forcing him to drop his weapon. The man howled in pain as the ice cube maker in the door of the fridge began to fire ice cubes like bullets from an automatic rifle. The man ran passed us, trying to avoid the painful ice, only to be knocked off his feet by the speeding little vacuum cleaner. He fell onto the other man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis now!\" I jumped out in mid-transformation pressing the alien device on my wrist.  I felt a long snake tail form and immediately wrapped up the two men. I was hoping to become a Naga, a mythological anthro snake. However there was something different. I did not feel a hood like when I was a Naga, plus my tail felt longer. In the newly acquired light, I was instead an anaconda anthro! That explained why I was so long. I adjusted myself so I had more than enough body length and tail length in-between the wrapped men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Megan spoke as she approached the two wrapped men, \"You two will tell us who sent you and why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what will you do about it Missy?\" scoffed the larger of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small frown appeared on her face but she turned to me. I think I knew what she was going to do. And I decided to play along. I nodded back, causing her to smile. \"Well, I'm not going to do anything\" she spoke. \"But I never said he wouldn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, I moved to where he could see me. Even with his ski mask on I could tell he was scared. I flicked my tongue at him, barely scraping the skin. It tasted and smelled good, something in me wanted to eat them but I shook the idea out of my head. Well, not completely. \"Pleasssse shall I eat them, missstresss...\" I spoke in a lisp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan hid her giggle as she approached the men. \"I do not know, if they are going to talk-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll never talk!\" the smaller man shouted. \"You and your freak of nature can just go and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of her fingers I reacted. I bit down over the small one's head, but I did not chomp. Snakes eat their prey whole, and boy was this guy tasting good. I slowly swallowed him, already past his chest area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay we'll talk! We'll talk! Just call off your beast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan snapped her fingers again to play along. I spat him out, rather sad that I couldn't. <i>No Travis...don't think like that...</i> Sam was the first to recover while the others began to. \"Release them... now.\" he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo further the act, Megan snapped her fingers one last time. I slowly uncoiled, the two men looked rather thankful that they were free. As the parents interrogated them, I slithered off with Megan. She playfully pushed me, \"What was with the \"mistress\" act?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it worked didn't it?\" I asked. She rubbed between my eyes, a sweet spit for snakes. I immediately relaxed and hissed with pleasure before returning to my normal form.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once settled, Sam walked to the door leading to the stairs and closed a steel door with a wheel like hatch. \"Just sit tight of a moment.\" walking out of the room, he said. \"This will only take a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the entire room shook slightly, startling everyone present before Sam returned to the room and opened the hatch like door. \"Okay, Megan, go see your new home.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan walked up the stairs, with me behind and we all gasped, seeing a completely different house with all of their belongings set in a similar manner. \"That is creepy.\" shivering, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More creepy than a boy who can become any animal?\" smiling, Sam asked. \"I merely teleported everything from our old hour to one that was up for sale a few miles away.\" he then pointed to a computer. \"I have labor robots placing identical items in each room so no one will know we left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't stay long when they find out no one is home.\" pointing out, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depending upon who they send, I might confront them.\" serious, Sam replied. \"You are welcome to help, kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do you think they will strike?\" curious, Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The computer will alert us if anyone enters.\" simply, Sam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But what?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked to the window, seeing how most of it was now broken and out. It was a perfect way to enter. And I just remembered the perfect animal for the task. However I had to look at my wrist. The device was still clamped on. I sighed, \"Hope this works.\" I made a mad sprint for the open window. Then I concentrated, and shifted my form. I became the anthro arachnid again, and I immediately shot a web to the high ceiling. I was lucky that most of my pants tore up outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So far so good...</i> I stayed low to the high ceilings and crawled down the hall. I surprised myself when I could not hear my steps. It only took a few seconds to find the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe appeared to be a preteen, around thirteen or fourteen. In his hands was a strange weapon. They looked like a policeman's nightstick, but with what looked like a sledgehammer's head on the end. It looked funny, but dangerous. I watched as he checked each room of the upper level. He entered back into the main room, performing another short scan of the room before sighing. He pressed against his ear, possibly an earpiece, \"No one's home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then\" a voice spoke back. \"Return to mobile command.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy did as ordered and walked out of the house. I jumped back down as soon as I sensed it to be safe. I walked out just before seeing a van drive off. \"Travis!\" I turned to see Megan running towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan, that boy is returning to their command center. This is our chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to catch them as a spider?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw her reasoning. Only one problem. \"My pants...they're shredded.\" I was handed a pair, to my surprise. She simply smiled to me. I quickly changed back, put the pants on, and shifted into a cheetah again. \"The boy had an earpiece\" I continued. \"Maybe you can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got the signal\" she spoke. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on the ball today. You sure you're not a mind reader?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is serious.\" I could hear the flatness of her voice. She was right, I nearly forgot. This wasn't just a tracking mission, it was a rescue mission. My cousins were being held hostage. And it was our job to bust them out. \"Alright, let's go.\" With a burst of speed, we chased after the van.</span></div></div>",

Megan, sitting on my shoulder, must have focused on the van as the doors opened on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you can hear me!\" her voice echoing through the van's radio and the men's ear piece communicators, she said. \"Step out or my boyfriend will step on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused, stunned. <i>\"Did she say boyfriend?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing I could not allow my mind to wonder, I rose my foot. \"We will not repeat our demand!\" my voice booming, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver and two others stepped out with the boy following. \"Okay, we're out!\" his hands raised, the first man said. \"What do you want of us!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you or are you not of the Agency!?\" firmly, Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know what you are talking about.\" flatly, the second man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heavily brought my foot down in front of the man and he stumbled backwards from the ground shaking. \"Answer the question, you insect!\" irritable, I roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We- We are.\" stepping forward, the boy stammered. \"I'd run now, if I were you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence, Bull!\" snapped the first man. he then turned to Megan and I. \"You two are children of the original members of the Problem Child Gang, are you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are asking the questions here, not you!\" eying the man, I thundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, Travis.\" flatly, Megan said. \"Do not forget our objective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fell silent to that, getting the hint that Megan had a plan in mind as she then eyed the first man. \"I'll get straight to the point, gentlemen.\" eying them, she said. \"You are to take us to your leader where we will give him our demands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first man was silent for a moment before he gave a low, dark laugh. \"Do you seriously think you two would stand a chance against us alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The four original members of our group kicked your asses alone twenty years ago.\" in an even tone, Megan countered. \"Only that is not our objective... not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't take you to our 'leader' in the form your boyfriend is currently holding.\" calmly, the man said. \"He will have to return to his human form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human is overrated.\" darkly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man took a step back, I knew I had unnerved him, at least as little. He only relaxed when I changed my form to an Anthro snake with Megan at my side, looking like a person of liquid metal. \"You will our normal forms when we am ready to show you.\" in a deadly tone, Megan said. \"Take us to your leader... now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then touched the man in the neck and he gave a yelp of pain while I touched the second man with the same result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" annoyed the first man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A special form of lead poisoning.\" softly, Megan replied. \"You will get the antidote when we arrive at our destination, awake and alert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a form of snake poison.\" changing into my Anthro wolf form, I said. \"Without knowing which snake I was, you can not make an anti-venom so I suggest you don't do anything stupid, earning your antidote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth men gulped then led us into the van. <i>\"Hang on, Tommy and Aura.\"</i> buckling my seat belt, I thought. <i>\"We're coming to bust you both out of there.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to us, mom was watching from the rooftop of Sam's house. Once the van drove off, she took out a cellphone and dialed a number. \"They took the bait.\" softly, she reported. \"The rest is up to you.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was what Megan said. <i>Boyfriend...she said boyfriend. Even after everything I've done to push her away, she chose me. Oh man, I have to ask her on a date when this is all over.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked out the window to try and clear my mind. But I then failed to notice Megan. Her hand was resting on mine. I slowly moved it, but her's darted away; probably by surprise. I knew I was blushing but looked to the window. I just watched the landscape pass by. But then, I saw the window fade black. It wasn't that we were going through a tunnel or anything, but all of the windows, even the windshield. Became completely black. \"Hey?!\" I exclaimed, Megan aware of it too, \"What gives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man driving smiled, \"Did you really think we would let you know where the base was at? Stupid kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shot him a deep feral growl which made him turn back around. Megan grasped my clawed wolf hand, calming me. \"Okay, that's fair\" she spoke, \"But how can you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regulation\" said the second. \"We may not have powerful mutations, but the lab boys gave us special lens for our eyes so we can see through it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grumbled, \"That's actually useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe van kept driving, not knowing a single moment of our location. Then, after a few bumps, the van stopped. The others got out, us following wherever we were looked like the inside of a parking garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Follow us...\" said the one man. I noticed there was sweat on his brow. I think it was from him being noticed, but then I saw a few dark veins in his neck. I smiled; the poison was setting in. The other guy looked just as bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were taken to an elevator, which the men took us up. I had no idea what happened to the kid. The trip up would have been silent if it wasn't for their deep breathing. The doors reopened and they led us into the long hallway. The man with my venom was now shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying our poison?\" I laughed. The guys did not respond, only even deeper breathing. When they approached the door, one pulled out a card key. They attempt to slide it, but they couldn't. One fell over, the other joined him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked to Megan who gave me a nod. I shifted back into the same anthro snake from before, and bit him with my fangs. I quickly sucked the venom out, as well as a lot of blood. I licked my scaly lips for some reason. Megan stopped me though, after she cured her guy. I grabbed the card and swiped it. The door opened, revealing a office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sitting at the desk looked familiar, but I couldn't match his face to a name. He let out a chuckle, \"I never knew you two would attempt what you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do what we must\" Megan spoke. \"We have come to make some demands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first\" I slammed down my fist and hissed in his face, \"WHERE ARE THEY?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, unfazed by motion. \"Of course, you need to see them.\" he pressed a button on his intercom, \"Alright, bring them in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door buzzed behind us and opened. I turned, happily waiting to see my cousins. But I saw two men and a woman, and that woman was my mom. \"M-Crystal? What are you doing here?\" I corrected myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a silver gun, which she fired. A cable wrapped around Megan, sparking to life. Electricity coursed through her, causing her to scream in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe what I saw. My mother attacked Megan. I hissed in anger as Megan fell unconscious. \"You!\" I felt something inside, something I couldn't control. I quickly darted towards her, but she pulled something else out. Suddenly my ears rung with noise, and surprisingly it was sweet. My vision went black before I could even get to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jolt passed through my head, forcing me to wake up. As my vision cleared I was aware of my surroundings and myself. I appeared to be in some animal storage area, because I could hear the other animals. I was still a snake, crammed in but still fine. I made my way to the front, \"Hey! Let me out!\"</span></div></div>",

He had a smug smile on his face. \"After all that talk about escaping the Agency, mom is still just one of their puppets!\" furious, I said. \"If you harm one hair on her head...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor little fool.\" cooing me, Megan said. \"Don't you realize that we are about to become a part of greatness?\" she chuckled. \"Why, with our powers, we could easily work our way up to being Alpha's personal bodyguards! Everyone will fear us and respect us though that fear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not believe what I was hearing! Megan seemed excited about becoming one of the Agency's puppets! As she then continued to ramble on about how great she and I could become, I flicked my tongue and got a taste of something very unfamiliar to me. It was then I remembered that snakes had a sense of taste a hundred times more acute than humans. I tasted the air again and discovered that the girl talking to me was not Megan. <i>\"Whoever this is, she's damn good at changing her appearance and voice but she can't change the way tastes to a snake.\"</i> angry, I thought. \"She and her 'puppet master' need to learn just who they are toying with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, Travis, your girlfriend sees the potential for greatness and wants you to share in it.\" softly, the man said. \"All you need but do is swear your loyalty to the Agency and we will start you both on your way to that greatness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rose my serpentine head up as a cobra would then gave an almost human laugh with my hissing. \"I have a much better idea in mind.\" almost smiling, I said. \"Why don't we do lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I gave the mental command to my body and I rapidly grew to both 'Megan' and the man's horror. I had read about a prehistoric snake that was the length of a football field and could easily devour a horse. That was what I decided to become to push my point across, a Titanoboa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The glass shattered, sending the snakes that were in the cage with me to flee for their own lives while I continued to grow in size. Powerful arms formed as my new shape finally took hold and towered over the girl who, to my surprise changed as well but into a girl no older than five years of age. She opened her mouth as if to scream but nothing came as the man slipped through a set of steel doors, closing them behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your master had fled, leaving you to die.\" my voice raspy, I said. \"I guess I'll have to settle with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked around then gulped, realizing she was now alone. She then made the mistake of trying to run to a door that was still open. I fought the instinct to hunt and merely wrapped myself around her so she could not escape. The girl screamed, fearing she was about to be devoured. \"Please don't eat me!\" crying, she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel lucky I don't have a 'crush' on you.\" with a hissing laugh, I said. \"Tell me where I can find Megan Connors, Tommy and Aura Winters and I will release you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" trembling, the girl replied. \"This place is huge, they could be anywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moved my mouth to the girl's head, causing her to wince then sob only she fell into a fit of giggles as I merely wiggled my forked tongue in her ear, hissing softly. \"Where are they?\" softly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...\" giggling, the girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wiggled my tongue in her ear, hissing again, and she began to scream in laughter. \"Stop! I can't take it!\" laughing, she pleaded. \"It tickles! It tickles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" hissing, I repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the detention cells!\" tearing up with laughter, the girl replied. \"South Wing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon getting the answer I needed, I slithered to the steel doors and easily ripped them open before returning to my human form. <i>\"I'll need to eat soon.\"</i> frowning, I thought. <i>\"This shape shifting makes me hungry.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I left the vaulted room with the girl still giggling...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As I walked past a tinted lab window, I saw my reflection. My skin could be described as snow white. <i>Oh man, I need to eat something now...</i> My eyes glanced down at the tattered clothing I now had. <i>And some pants...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard footsteps and ducked into the first door I saw. The lights turned on automatically. It looked like the employee's lounge. A few lockers were there, as well as a working fridge and microwave. \"Wow, just what I needed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI first headed towards the lockers. I opened the first one and smiled. There was a one piece jumpsuit inside. But I recognized the material. I forgot the specific name of that stuff, but the fabric could be stretched dramatically and still keep it's original size. \"Man, Garth would kill for this stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tossed it aside and looked through the fridge. There, resting in there, looked like a miracle. It was a six inch chicken sub! I never ate that fast in my entire life. But it was good. I should have had enough energy soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaked open and I rushed into the closet. I could hear voices, but not clearly in my human form. I slowly creaked the door open, hearing the voices now. \"I can't believe those rotten brats!\" I silently gasped; it was those two drivers. \"Poisoned by that metallic whore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grumbled at that remark. \"Hey, at least yours had a positive antidote. I was bit and I had no idea what it was! I hate snakes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guy chuckled, \"Hey! Who ate my chicken sub?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy stomach let out a quick growl. Apparently I was still hungry. However from the limited amount of vision I had I could see them approach the closet. I panicked quietly, I had no energy until I digested that sub. I was cornered, like an animal waiting to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt something in my gut, it wasn't vomit, but it was something. It flowed up my throat and into my mouth. As soon as the door flew open I let out whatever it was. The two men's faces were coated in the green sickly stuff. They were both screaming in pain. I let this be my opening. I ran and jumped, drop kicking them both. That hit knocked them both out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning their faces, I tied them up back to back and stuffed them in the closet. Obviously whatever I upchucked was my defense mechanism; the tactic that all animals had when facing immanent danger. I looked at my reflection, seeing my skin being normal. But then my eyes went to that suit. I then spotted one item the man dropped, his Swiss army knife. \"I wonder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the knife, I made some modifications to the suit. Then I slipped in on and changed into an anthro wolf. The suit was now sleeveless, showing my muscular wolf arms. The suit also had short pants, revealed a good bit of my legs. I also made sure to cut a hole for my tail. I balled my hand into a fist, \"Don't worry everyone, I'll save you.\"</span></div></div>",

A scream echoed from my own throat just as someone from the frantic crowd swept me into his arms as he ran with the fire scorching his heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm scared.\" I sobbed. \"Please, I don't want to see any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must, John.\" replied Deidre's tearful voice. \"This is the truth of who you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched the vision, helpless to stop it with my own mind as I felt myself being carried through a number of halls into a small room where a dozen other people were desperately talking in a language I did not understand. They all fell silent as an ear shattering explosion shook the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" I complained, holding my hands to my ears. \"What was that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother jolt was felt and a heavy double door sealed the room with a loud hiss, just as a slender woman reached it with a small girl in her arms. She pounded on the glass of the door, tears falling from her face, as a man appeared behind her and began to pound as well. Four men inside the room desperately tried to force the door open but it was to no avail as a smaller explosion shook the room and it moved away from the woman on the other side of the door. As I saw stars through the growing distance between the couple and myself I saw tears running down the man and woman's face as I saw her mouth my name 'John!'  Then, I heard myself scream, <i>\"Mommy!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vision then ended and I found myself back in the living room, shaking and crying from the terrifying experience. It was as if I was actually there. I turned to Evan and Deidre, not knowing what to do or say but gasped as I recognized their faces from the vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was you two who was trying to get in the room.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it was an escape pod.\" replied Evan. \"You see, we are not from this planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story short, dear, one of the drive engines on our ship malfunctioned and exploded while we were passing through this sector and we were forced to abandon ship, flee to this world, they call Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still very shaken by the vision and brief explanation but I still had my doubts. \"Even if I believed all of this, why did you not come looking for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The escape pods were scattered all over this globe, honey. For us to find you was like looking for a needle in a haystack as we look very similar to the inhabitants of this world.\" replied mom, crying. \"Any technology we brought with us was lost with the mother ship when it exploded, we are marooned here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you react?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking around, I realized that the house I imagined myself in was all a dream.  That being said, I was shocked to see my \u2018family\u2019 walking past me as they entered their car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t quite explain it; but seeing them probably stirred up a longing for family and I found myself imagining they were my family.  I\u2019ve been on the run for over 5 months, fearing that my parents and siblings wouldn\u2019t understand my new ability.  My name changed every time I altered reality; but it was originally John Henault and I was a 16 year old boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring my five month life on the road, I had to learn to control my ability quickly to stay alive. It was not enough to just change my age or gender, I had to also change my student ID to another ID or a driver's license and fill my wallet with money. There was no telling where the money came from and I felt bad taking money from some stranger but I needed it to keep myself alive and my 'talent' a secret, if you can call it that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the family drove off, I realized I was getting hungry.  Looking around, to my annoyance, I saw the only place was a club down the road.  Walking down the road, I turned to walk into the club when the bouncer stood in front of me.  \u201cSorry kid, you\u2019re too young for this place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to protest when I realized that I had the form of a 13 year old boy at the moment.  Simply nodding, I turned and walked back around the corner.  Once I was out of sight, I concentrated on my appearance.  By time all was said and done, I had the body of a 22 year old; complete with ID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with my appearance, I smiled and walked back to the club.  It wasn\u2019t long before the bouncer let me into the club; without even mentioning the 13 year old who tried to get in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Turning to look at it, I saw that I was now an attractive 22 year old brunette wearing an attractive dress (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www1.macys.com/shop/product/jones-new-york-dress-sleeveless-belted-pleated-cowl-neck?ID=675872&amp;CategoryID=5449&amp;LinkType=#fn=SPECIAL_OCCASIONS%3DParty%26sp%3D1%26spc%3D509%26ruleId%3D65%26slotId%3D13\" target=\"_blank\">http://www1.macys.com/shop/product/jones...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing my reflection, I wondered how my twin sister would react if she ever saw me like this.  I was brought back to reality when the bartender walked over.  \"What can I get you, beautiful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the bartender, I said, \"I'll take a Samuel Adams and a turkey sandwich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bartender left, I decided now would be a good time to see who I was in this reality.  Digging through my purse, I found my ID.  Looking at it, I saw that my name was now Kelly Thompson; and I was from San Francisco.  It wasn't long before the bartender returned with my order; taking my payment as I took my food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd just finished my sandwich, and was drinking my beer, when a guy walked over to me.  \"Is this seat taking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the things I had to get used to over the last 5 months was guys flirting with me; and not just when I was a girl.  Looking at him, smiling, I said, \"No, have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting next to me, the guy said, \"I'm Allen; what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Allen.\" smiling, I said, \"I'm Kelly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen you here before, Kelly; what brings you to Oregon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen didn't know it; but he's known me for almost 2 weeks now.  The first time we met, I was a 23 year old pregnant woman at a grocery store; but most of the time I was either a guy or girl in their 20s.  I bet you're wondering why I made myself a pregnant girl; the truth is, I just wanted to know what being pregnant felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Allen.\" pausing, I said, \"I'm just passing through; I've got a lot on my mind and I thought a little trip would be good for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's on your mind?  Maybe it's something I can help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>You wouldn't believe me if I told you.</i></span>\" sighing, I said, \"My sister came home last week to find me making out with her boyfriend; she, uh, got angry and kicked me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" taking his drink, Allen said, \"If you don't mind my asking; why were you making out with her boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't my idea; he started it and I wasn't in a condition to stop him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you tell your sister that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried; but she wouldn't listen.\" sipping my beer, I said, \"I'm traveling around hoping she calms down enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she's calm enough now, Kelly.\" looking at me, Allen said, \"I'm sure she misses you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen and I talked for a few hours, occasionally getting up to dance.  By the time I decided it was time to leave, Allen had convinced me that I should go home.  As we talked, I realized that I made a mistake when I ran away; I should've just told my family about my ability rather than hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, as we walked out of the bar, I turned to Allen and said, \"Thanks for listening, Allen; you're a sweet guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Kelly.\" looking at me, Allen said, \"I hope things work out with your sister.\"</span></div></div>",

As weird as it was for me to be pregnant, this form had its uses; I could get early boarding on the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking out of the hotel, I took a cab to the airport.  Once he'd helped me from the cab, the driver grabbed my suitcase and purse (originally my backpack).  Handing them to me, he said, \"Have a nice flight, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" handing him my fare plus tip, I said, \"Have a nice day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before I got through security.

After making a stop in the bathroom, I found my way to the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n45 minutes later, the ticket agent called for passengers eligible for early boarding.

Only, to my surprise, I discovered that I did not have a single scratch on me.

The nestling gave a screech of pain as the other young nestlings, five in all, snapped at my naked body. As I reached the edge of the nest, the mother hawk took a swipe at me with its murderous beak but I managed to evade it and dive off the edge of the nest. As I literally bounced off of several branches, I screamed and cursed at the pain until I finally landed in Todd's warm hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey.\" he said, seeing me lying miserably in his cupped hands. \"I'm sooo sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I could do at that time was moan in agony from the experience as Todd then carefully held me against his warm chest and hurried out of the woods to the car.

Then, remembering how I felt when my size changed, I tried to make myself smaller, thankful that the back yard was fenced in. \"How small should I air for?\" I wondered. \"I already did doll size and giant size so... maybe somewhere in the middle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought, I decided to try toddler size and focused on that feeling when I had shrunk and grew the first time around. To my inner delight, I began to shrink as it meant I could learn to control it. I found myself shrinking smaller and smaller, my clothing falling off of me as I did. It was a rush, watching everything growing larger around me and I found myself giggling at the thought until something caught my eye. The distraction caused me to stop shrinking at the size of a five or six year old, not that I noticed it yet, and I looked to find an old cardboard cut out of a child holing his hand up. Beneath the hand was a sign that stated, <i>'You must be this tall to swim in the pool alone'</i>. \"I remember this.\" I said, a smile forming onto my face. \"Dad put that up to keep me from swimming alone. I was pretty small for my age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a quick series of images flashed through my mind. I saw a tall man in a tan suit standing next to me as I stood with a small sniper rifle in my hands. It looked as it it had been custom built for my size. The man, I recognized as my uncle Jon, turned to me. \"Kayo, get ready.\" he said, firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw myself look up at my uncle with a blank look in my eyes. \"Yes, Jon.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vision only lasted a few seconds but it was enough to send me falling to my knees, crying. \"Why, uncle?\" I sobbed, burying my face into my hands. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know how long I had sat there, crying but Todd came running out and fell to his own knees in front of me, looking very concerned. \"Sarah, are you hurt!?\" he asked, panic in his eyes. \"Talk to me, honey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still lost in the fear that the images had given me as I just repeated, \"Why, uncle? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd gently gripped my shoulder, causing me to look at him, alarmed. At the moment, I only saw my uncle who was a government agent from some hush-hush group no one was supposed to ever hear about. \"Sarah, I need you here with me right now.\" said Todd firmly but kindly. \"Look where you are. You are safe, here at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill shaking, I looked around and the scenes from my mind slowly vanished, replacing it with reality. I slowly turned back to Todd then exploded into tears. Todd, not knowing what else to do, took me into his arms and carried me back into the house. There he rocked me like the small child I appeared to be until I fell into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, I woke up...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the months passed, my belly grew, and I started feeling the stirrings within my womb. Prof. Kingsbury offered a sympathetic ear, but the whole process left me feeling lost at sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had decided not to have an abortion. I figured that, if I had one, then whoever - <i>what</i>ever - had gotten me pregnant without so much as a formal introduction might just try again later. Instead, I decided to place the baby up for adoption.

My name is Andromeda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said before... You're the one who got me pregnant? How did you do that? And why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was not my first choice,\" she replied. \"I was but a youngling, dwelling in the water until I could find a host. Suddenly, I became aware of foul additives in the water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Runoff, from the illegal dumpsite,\" I guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. The pollutants caused me to begin discharging eggs. Without any sort of a host body, my offspring were dying. My heart was breaking, when you lifted the water I was in to your lips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's how you got inside me. But how did I get pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I discharged one final egg within you. I could not bear to lose another child to this cruel fate. I directed your ovaries to release two ova, instead of the usual one. Then, I combined their genetic material, to create a new being, who could host my child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to process this. \"I had a baby... to save yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. I would not have done it otherwise, and I have not done it since. It may comfort you to know that she is well and healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you know how she is? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can communicate easily. She is more active in the child than is usual, perhaps because of lingering effects from the pollution. Normally, our hatchlings do not reveal themselves to their hosts until the host reaches puberty, but she is already enhancing the girl's perceptions. However, she is still too young to understand everything she perceives.\" Andromeda lifted a hand, and an image appeared. \"This is how she looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was astounded. \"She... she looks like me, when I was that age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. I used only your genetic material, so she would naturally resemble you. My daughter, Tobi, is enhancing her perceptions of the world around her, so that she can see a person's aura. In fact, that is how she learned that her adoptive parents are aliens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean there are more like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. However, your daughter's adoptive parents are of a race of shapeshifters, unlike my race. Tobi tells me that she is greatly concerned about what the future holds for little Rhea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're going to hurt her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they love her very much. However, there are those who have taken an interest in her. The company that dumped the chemicals, and those who seek to destroy that company, by any means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed Andromeda by the shoulders. \"How can I save her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I amnot certain,\" came the reply. \"However, I believe that things will become clearer in the days ahead. Watch for the signs, and be ready.\"</span></div></div>",

I remembered a time when I was very young, standing before a strange man with my uncle John at my side, holding me in place, though I did struggle. \"So you are Dr Smith's pet project.\" smiling at me, the man said. \"It was clever of him to hide it inside his own daughter.\" turning to my uncle John, he asked. \"Were the Smith's neutralized?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nodded. \"An unfortunate house fire, sir.\" with a slight grin, he said. \"Poor Sarah Smith was the only survivor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grunted. \"Well, she was made with Agency property so she is now Agency property.\" emotionless, he said. \"Prepare our new doll for special training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard myself screaming as uncle John forced me out of the room....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up with a start, feeling Todd gently shaking me awake. \"Please, Sarah!\" begging, he said. \"Wake up, you passed out again, open your eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd sighed, seeing my eyes open then pointed to two nurses, hurrying out with a gurney. \"They are coming to get you into the emergency room, Sarah.\" trying to sound comforting, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaken, I weakly got onto the gurney and allowed the two nurses to wheel me inside. The emergency room was busy but, for some reason, I was pushed ahead of everyone else. \"Your husband tells us you were exposed to an unknown bio-hazard waste.\" said the first nurse. \"The effects could be lethal, that makes you a priority.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was placed into a room, Todd tried his best to keep me calm as I felt an increasing sense of dread, though I did not know why. Then a tall, middle aged man in a physicians uniform and lab coat walked into the examination room with a large file in his hands. \"Hello, Sarah Barns.\" smiling, he said. \"It's been years since I saw you last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at the man and immediately began to panic as I remembered seeing the man before. \"Dr Hagen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember me.\" his smile broadening, Hagen said. \"I'm touched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, you know this man?\" taking a defensive stance, Todd asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was her doctor when she was very young.\" looking at me, Hagen replied. \"She was our little pet project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like where you are going with this, doctor.\" annoyed, Todd said. \"We're leaving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid its much too late for that.\" seriously, Hagen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to panic as I saw a number of male nurses walking in our direction to Hagen's silent gesture.

I knew I'd do some damage to the building, which would hurt all the innocent people who'd come here for medical help. Plus, just because I was resistant to damage when I was small, I wasn't sure if the same applied when I got huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, I shrank, willing myself as small as I could, as quickly as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat turned out to be pretty quick, as my clothes collapsed around me. \"She's gone!\" one of the nurses said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gone?\" Hagen demanded. \"How is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I dug my way out of my clothes, I did a quick estimate, and figured I was less than an inch tall.

He was in the form of a five year old in a blue dress, stockings, and mary janes, doing his best to walk causally while he carried me as a favorite doll in a pink dress. We both saw the guards working on locking the main exit doors and Todd ran up, his lips trembling. \"Mommy is waiting for me outside!\" using a false alto voice, he said. \"Please, they just said I can go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine.\" quickly, the guard said. \"Get going, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd happily ran out the door, following the side walk, towards the parking lot.

Once we were, Todd began to run with me with the intention of gaining as much ground as possible. He seemed to have ran for ages before he gasped, \"How much further?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*They will be here any moment now.*</i> serious, Andromeda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we can wait here.\" happy Todd had a strong grip, even as a five year old. \"Andromeda said some help should be here soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andromeda?\" curious, Todd asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Todd gave a scream as two cars came screeching to a halt near us. I swallowed hard, seeing Dr Hagen step out. \"That was a neat trick, regressing yourself, young man.\" smiling evilly he said. \"However, I have a gift as well.. I can follow anyone's scent and you both left your clothes behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the motion of a single finger, the four goons pulled out what appeared to be handguns. \"Come along quietly unless you wish to be tranquilized.\" still smiling, Hagen said. \"Kiss, Kiss, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KISS THIS!\" came an enraged voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could react, a huge fist barreled into Hagen's jaw, throwing him completely off his feet. Seeing Hagen crash to the pavement, moaning, I turned to find a teenaged boy with muscles more suited for an Olympian weight lifter.

As if sensing my thoughts, Garth nodded. \"Dad wants you to know just enough to stay here for a while as a guest.\" softly, he said. \"It's not because you are not trustworthy, its because you were brainwashed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was twenty years ago.\" sighing, I argued. \"I suffered countless nightmares from my year under their thumb, I still do but I managed to move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do anything to try to undo that brainwashing?\" serious, Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised by the question, I slowly shook my head. \"No... I never looked back after I fled from The Agency.\" tearing up a little, I said. \"I was found, trembling in an empty alley, by a young couple who adopted me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace sighed. \"Unless you saw someone to break that brainwashing, you are still under their control.\" serious, she said. \"All it takes is one code phrase from them, likely over a phone, and you are theirs again.\" pausing, she turned to the other kids and muttered, \"We better get Cait over here, fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cait?\" confused, I asked. \"How many members does this new gang have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids ignored my question as Garth suddenly grew to the size of an Olympian and took a strong hold of my arm. \"Please do not take any offense to this.\" pulling me along, he said. \"We can not risk you turning on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I was half dragged, half carried into a spacious sitting room where I was pushed inside with Todd before Garth closed and locked the only door. I do not know why but I walked over to the wall and gently touched it. \"Solid steel, this is a holding cell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I love you more than anything in this world.\" looking at me, Todd said. \"However, I must now insist... no more mysteries, tell me everything.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I must know what the worst is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" I took a deep breath. \"I was born Sarah Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your family changed their name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try to get ahead of me, sweetheart. As I was saying, the Smiths documented every little thing about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only natural, especially with the first child. If we start a family, I'll look forward to following our little one with a camera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't just their little girl, Todd. I was the product of their work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong, the Smiths loved me, and would have no matter how I'd turned out. But the fact remains that my genes were personally selected by my parents, and sometimes even improved upon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only time I've gotten sick was five years ago, when I picked up a case of giardiasis, with a side order of unplanned pregnancy. In addition, I started walking and talking before my first birthday, and I was learning to read and write at an age when other kids were still struggling with toilet training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd whistled. \"Impressive. So what happened? Why'd you change your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon Hagen happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doctor who tried to capture us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not just a doctor. At the time, he was working for a group I only knew as the Agency. So was my father.\" I paused, marshaling my strength to continue. \"Dad had used Agency equipment to create me, so they decided that they owned me, and sent Hagen to collect me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet your parents weren't about to let that happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why he shot them.

I had to obey or be punished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll make him pay for this, Sarah.\" seriously, Todd said. \"We'll make them all pay.\" pausing, he asked, \"How did you manage to break free form that brainwashing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That day, when I shot officer Jones in the shoulder, they forgot to give me my daily dose of the drug and 'Tex' was able to reach me.\" tearfully, I replied. \"I- I never looked back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd hugged me as I broke into tears. \"We'll get through this.\" stroking my hair, he promised. \"You are a strong woman, I know we can beat this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe hugged for what seemed like an eternity before the door clicked and opened, revealing Mr. Jones, Mr Tanner, and the kids with another teen who I assumed was the girl, Cait they had mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Barns,\" Lyssa said, \"this is Cait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do?\" politely, Cait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \"My life's turned upside-down and inside-out in the past week, but I'm holding together. Ted says you can help me unravel my past?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait sat down across from me. \"I can try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax, and trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two of us made eye contact, everything seemed to go blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon found myself floating in space, surrounded by images. Before I could make heads or tails of my surroundings, Cait appeared before me. \"How did you get inside my head?\" sternly, I demanded. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story, ma'am,\" quickly, Cait replied. \"I had an accident a while back, and developed telepathy and a limited ability to see the future as a result.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you go into people's heads often?\" unimpressed, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, you're my first.\" trying to sound confident, Cait said. \"Usually, I just pick up people's thoughts like you overhear their conversations.\" pausing, she added, \"The closest I've done to this was when I linked up with two of my friends to try to reason with a young schizophrenic yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard about that attack at the mall.\" concerned, I said. \"You were there? You helped that boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda. One of the girls has a spirit guide, who told us what was happening to him.\" wincing, Cait said. \"Once we understood that, we were able to 'talk' him down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made me relax a little. \"Well, I'm not schizophrenic, so I should be an easier case. What do you need to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much about you as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave Cait a tour of my memories, with stops at the mystery pregnancy I had experienced, my reunion with my daughter, and the accident that gave me my shrinking powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to know I've got something in common with you, Ms. Barns.\" smiling, Cait said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait smiled. \"My aunt's name is Sarah. Now, why does the chief think you might be a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was younger, I was under the thrall of a shadowy government agency.\" frowning, I replied. \"I was supposed to kill him, but I wounded him instead, and fled for cover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait whistled. \"Good thing you missed him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shot his shoulder. I never miss.\" serious, I fired back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. How about we check out your memories of that assignment, and see if we find a clue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait and I soon flashed back to my childhood, to the moment before I broke free and ran away from the Agency. I was in a small, windowless room, with nothing but a firing dummy for company. \"Did you play many games with that life sized dummy?\" Cait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is 'How many ways can you kill someone' a game?\" sighing, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then no, I didn't play games with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only door in the room opened, and a man, I recognized as uncle Jon stepped inside. \"Kiss Kiss, my dear,\" he said. \"I have your new assignment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" in a robotic tone, my past self replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave her a picture of a boy. It looked an awful lot like Garth Jones. \"This is your target,\" the man said. \"He is to be exterminated. I want a clean shot, right between the eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit me: The younger Sarah was responding, but so was the grown Sarah beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss Kiss, my dear,\" uncle Jon had said before leaving. My past self then returned to what she was doing as if nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing I knew, I was back in the room Todd and I were held in with Cait being carried out, unconscious to a room across the hall. \"Wait, what happened?\" I asked as Ted, the last one to leave reached the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be fine.\" quickly, Ted replied. \"Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he closed the door, locking it again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Reluctantly, he obeyed and Geo looked me in the eye. \"Kiss kiss, my dear.\" in a serious tone, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd gasped and moved to stand in the way but Geo stared him down then turned back to me to see my eyes had glazed over and I was staring at him, not really thinking anything at all. \"Yes... Geo?\" with a robotic tone, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From this moment forward, for the rest of your life, the phrase, 'kiss kiss, my dear' will mean nothing to you.\" in a firm tone, Geo said. \"Whenever someone says this phrase, you will ignore it, is that understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly nodded. \"It is understood, Geo.\" still talking in a robot like tone, I said. \"The phrase 'kiss kiss, my dear' means nothing to me, I will ignore it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl.\" smiling, Geo said. \"Kiss kiss, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, I slightly shook my head and looked at Geo, confused. \"I'm sorry, Geo.\" as if waking from a dream, I said. \"Was there something you wanted to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeo nodded. \"Kiss kiss, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, shaking my head. \"I'm flattered but I'm married.\" taking Todd's hand, I said. \"So are you, by the way, don't tease your wife, you might not like what she does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mistake.\" smiling back, Geo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door, and Ted stuck his head in. \"How'd it go?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worked like a charm,\" Geo replied. \"Your hunch paid off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What hunch?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had a trigger phrase,\" Geo explained, \"which Hagen used to control you. Cait told us what it was, and we used it to shut down the mind-control system. Hagen won't be able to control you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you told me to kiss you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeo nodded. \"That was your trigger. When I said it the first time, you went into a trance, ready for orders. If Hagen tries it again, he'll get a much different response from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, imagining myself trying out some of the techniques I learned as a kid. \"So I'm good to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed smiled. \"We'll let you see more of the place, but they're still looking for you at your apartment. By the way, somebody's waiting to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door wider, and Rhea came in, accompanied by a teenage boy. \"Hi, Mommy,\" she said, giving me a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, sweetheart,\" I replied. \"Who's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Clem,\" he said. \"Rhea's brother. This is what I usually look like. Jessica was... something of a punishment. I called Lyssa by the wrong name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk, tsk. You shouldn't have done that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am. Yesterday gave me some insight into what she went through all those years. It won't happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like Jessica,\" Rhea said, pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClem chuckled. \"I meant that I won't call Alyssa the wrong name again. Maybe sometimes, I'll let Jessica out to play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all laughed, and Rhea told me about the years since the Rodgers family adopted her. I didn't regret giving her up to a different family, but I was glad to be in touch with my daughter again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have a little sister named Aura; she's seven. She is a very petite girl with doll like features; she has her mom's auburn hair and green eyes, if I remember right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and I are being held prisoner by a group calling themselves The Agency. I want to escape, I really do, but I don't know where they are holding my sister. That and, if I resist them or try to escape, they promise to beat her senseless until I comply or return for a punishment of my own, usually having to watch Aura being tortured on a video screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease...  Please, someone help us.\u201d crying in my bed, I whispered. \"Can anyone hear me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have the ability to gain knowledge and skills from other people's minds but I am not able to talk to them this way, though I still try. I am hoping I will, someday, reach someone and get them to send help for me and my little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had just celebrated my twelfth birthday before his nightmare began, Aura and I had come to Europe on vacation.  Only, our bungalow was not yet ready so we had to find a hotel room to stay the night. We had walked into a hotel, just inside the outskirts of Rome and approached the desk where dad politely cleared his throat.  He was an average sized man, from what I remember, but he was very strong, always wearing a business suit....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I help you?\u201d asked the clerk, politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we are vacationing here in your beautiful nation.\" smiling, dad said. \"Unfortunately, our bungalow is not ready yet.  We were hoping you had a room available for the four of us tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desk clerk looked down at some papers then turned back to dad, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re in luck, sir.\u201d he said. \u201cA gentleman, Mr. Kline, had reserved a two bedroom suite a few weeks ago but canceled at the last minute.  He left instructions to give the room to someone who could use it.  It\u2018s paid up until the end of next week\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \u201cNow, that\u2019s generosity.\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s known for that.\u201d  he waved to someone behind them. \u201cIf you will be kind enough to sign in on the registry, I will have the bellhop carry your bags up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad signed his name in the book then followed the hotel worker to the elevator, which took them up to the tenth floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis is your room, sir.\u201d politely, the bellhop said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cThank you.\u201d handing the teenager a large bill, dad said. \u201cJust leave the bags here, my kids and I can carry them in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cYes, sir.\u201d smiling, the bellhop replied. \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, he placed the bags down and walked away as dad unlocked the door and walked in with mom following close behind with Aura and I in the hall, gathering the smaller bags.  Just as we reached the door, a powerful explosion rocked the room, sending the two of us to the floor. I looked up as Aura screamed to find, to my horror, that the room mom and dad had just walked into was completely engulfed in flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cDaddy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days afterward were a blur to me as Aura and I were taken away to a strange, frightening place were we were separated and I was given a number of injections, making my mind feel clouded and confused. The monsters who had kidnapped us forced me into training in how to kill and torture people, form strategies on what I learn from people's minds and find weaknesses in those people they put before me. I wanted to escape, only my captors are holding my sister, Aura hostage.  We were a prisoner of The Agency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cYou will do exactly as you are told.\u201d one man had said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, we will beat your sister until she stops moving.  Is that clear, Tom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI has been a year since then and i still want to escape. The only question was how?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I sat up in my bed, rubbing the sleep and tears from my eyes, and looked around my room. It was small, plainly decorated, with a large mirror covering almost a quarter of the wall to my right. I knew it was a reverse mirror, a window for my captors to keep an eye on me. On the wall to my left was a dresser mirror combo and a small closet and a door which led to a small washroom.  Across the room from my bed was a closed, locked door; the only way out.  Under the reverse mirror was a number of toys and games, on the floor, given to me for past jobs well done; they all meant nothing to me, I wanted my younger sister, Aura to be safe.  I buried my face into my hands to silence the cries of the hundred victims I had help slay in my year as their puppet strategist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have a rare ability they called 'Psychic Clairvoyance'; the power to see through the eyes of other people, know what they know and, to some extent, control their bodies.  I do not need to see that person to do this, a photograph will do as long as that person is within my range. Jon, my 'master', has the ability to manipulate the nervous system and has used it to increase that range several fold, though it gives me a headache later. I have tried to see through his eyes, searching for Aura, but his ability blocks me from 'getting in'. On the bright side, my own ability allows me to block him out as well, if I so desired. Jon knows about my power but not about the ability to control a person's movements. I am keeping that a secret as I try to hone that skill, I intend to use it as a trump card when it is my time to escape. Until then, I and Aura were prisoners of the Agency. <i>\u201cPlease... Please, someone help us, can anyone hear me!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused, hearing a knock at the door. This was new to me as no one had ever knocked before, they merely entered. \"Tommy, are you awake?\" firmly, a deep voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recognized the voice as my 'master' Jon. \"Y- Yes, I am awake.\" pulling myself out of bed, I called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA buzz and a click was heard before the door opened and Jon entered the room. He was tall and muscular with short light brown hair and copper green eyes. He wore a black business suit and black dress shoes. He turned his gaze upon me and again surprised me by giving me a slight smile. \"Ah, you just woke up, good.\" with a courteous tone, he said. \"Get dressed, we are in for a treat today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A treat, sir?\" walking into the washroom, I asked. \"Dare I ask what this treat is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I have been personally requested by the CEO of the Agency.\" with a hint of pride, Jon replied. \"I can only imagine that this is due to our perfect track record.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" trying not to sound depressed, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, cheer up.\" his voice still courteous, Jon said. \"Do well at this meeting and I will you allow a two minute telephone conversation with your little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got my attention as Jon never offered such a prize for a job well done. <i>\"This must be very important to him.\"</i> moving quickly to get ready, I thought. <i>\"I better be at my best if he is to honor that promise.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was clean and dressed in a black suit of my own in under five minutes and Jon led me out of my prison bedroom, down the hall to the heart of the Agency complex. Their headquarters, as far as I could piece together was a vast underground facility, originally used as a nuclear bunker during the cold war. Now it served as the United Europe Orphan Placement Organization. It was the Agency's cover to allow them to do their work undetected. The UEOPO (pronounced yo- po) was an internationally funded foundation that sheltered and provided homes for orphans no one seemed to want or know existed throughout Europe and beyond. That was the cover story; in reality, they searched Europe and beyond for uniquely talented children and teens to be used as their soldiers in their quest to influence their world to their liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not speak unless you are spoken to.\" in a deadly serious tone, Jon instructed. \"The members of the board do not tolerate any insubordination; I have seen them kill a twenty year veteran for merely speaking out of turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped then nodded, indicating that I understood as we reached two large doors. In front of them were two heavily armed guards who opened the doors for us. \"They are expecting you, gentlemen.\" flatly, one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon and I nodded then entered a spacious room to find a number of well dressed but serious faced men and women sitting, around a long table. \"Welcome Jon.\" a man at the head of the table said. he then nodded at me. \"Tommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, we both nodded and the man motioned for us to take an empty seat on either side of him. We immediately did as told and the meeting began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, I am the CEO of the Agency, the people before you call me Alpha but you may only address me as 'sir', is that clearly understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" quickly, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlpha nodded then pushed a thick folder in front of me and another in front of Jon. \"You are to both study this while I brief you and the others on this mission.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus the meeting began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I opened the folder as Jon opened his own, revealing a detailed report on four teenaged individuals, each with a name and what appeared to have been an alias as it was in quotations. With them, were computer generated age progression photos of each person. I found it strange that I could not look through any of their eyes but figured that, whoever they were, they must have been out of my range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little over twenty years ago, we encountered the four teenagers you see in the file in front of you.\" serious, Alpha began. \"They had called themselves the Problem Child Gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rose a single eyebrow. <i>\"They were real!?\"</i> surprised, I thought. <i>\"Did they fight the Agency!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first, we viewed them as nothing more than a minor nuisance as they were fixated upon Sykes, a long time enemy to our cause.\" frowning, Alpha continued. \"However, Sykes led them to believe we were his employer and their attention was shifted onto us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"They did fight the Agency.\"</i> awestruck, I thought. <i>\"They fought, survived, and escaped.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something on your mind, Tommy?\" noticing my expression, Alpha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am impressed, sir.\" softly, I said. \"To lock horns with the Agency and survive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we were impressed as well.\" flatly, Alpha said. \"However, two of the members of that group were the children of the most wealthy and influential families on Earth.\" he frowned. \"To take them then would have been too much of a risk and we let them go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlpha then turned to a professionally dressed tall and muscular woman with long black hair and green eyes. \"Beta will take it from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Alpha.\" politely, Beta said. \"Tommy, you will call me ma'am or mistress at all times, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress.\" quickly, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeta nodded. \"Around the time the Agency had first encountered this Problem Child Gang, we were working on a child soldier project, of which you are a part of, Tommy.\" looking at me, she said. \"We had considered making them a part of that project but, as Alpha explained, it was too much of a risk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised my hand and she gave me the permission to speak. \"Why is the Agency interested in the members of this group after twenty years?\" curious, I asked. \"They are all in their thirties by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not them we are after, Tommy.\" with a deadly stare, Beta replied. \"We want their children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes grew wide, hearing that as Beta continued. \"I heard you are reading the graphic novel series, based on that group, is this correct?\" she asked. I nodded. \"Where are you in this series?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Book eight.\" softly, I replied. \"The road to Rome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeta nodded. \"That is the last book in the series.\" she explained. \"However, that was not the last mission of the Problem Child Gang.\" she turned to Alpha, who nodded, then continued. \"The group had a mansion headquarters, here in Europe, Sykes and his men burned it to the ground, leaving clues that we were responsible in case they had survived, as they did the trap in Rome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh man, she spoiled the end of the book.\"</i> trying not to pout, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't finished reading it, I take it.\" with a slight smile, Beta said. she then turned serious. \"You are now living the story; the Problem Child Gang, despite their injuries, came to us in retaliation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Alpha who then took over. \"Our headquarters was originally a modern castle, built in the cold and fog shrouded northern Ural mountains.\" serious, he said. \"The Problem Child Gang used powers we had never expected to see out of anyone, especially those as young and injured as they were.\" frowning, he added, \"They completely destroyed the castle as Sykes destroyed their mansion, setting us and our plans back twenty years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So this is a matter of revenge.\"</i> feeling a cold chill run down my spine, I thought. <i>They want their children, if any, to use in their child soldier project or use them as bait to destroy their parents.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need you to find them, Tommy.\" after getting a nod from Alpha, Beta said. \"We have narrowed the search down to the New England states in America, searching news and police archives for unusual events and occurrences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's not going to be easy.\"</i> pressing my lips together, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a muscular man, who looked to be in his mid twenties, entered. He was of average height with light brown hair, and blue eyes. \"Forgive my tardiness, Alpha.\" politely, he said. \"My flight ran late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to the man, curious, then saw all of the adults from the file in his mind. He had not only seen them, he had made contact with them in the last twenty four hours. <i>\"They were right under their noses all this time!\"</i> impressed, I thought. <i>\"This group is truly worthy of being superheroes.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Max Hagen.\" frowning, Alpha said. \"Take your seat.\" he then turned to me, seeing my hand raised. \"Speak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have found them, sir.\" flatly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect track record.\" with an impressed look, Alpha said. \"You've trained him well, Jon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\" showing pride, Jon replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me where they are and I will grant you one wish within my power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waterfront City, New York State.\" again, flatly, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Locate this Waterfront City and send a scout team!\" parked Alpha to his team. he then turned to me. \"Name your reward for this service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy lips trembled slightly before I replied, \"Freedom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlpha chuckled darkly. \"You wish for freedom, do you?\" looking amused, he asked. I nodded, not knowing that Jon was touching the handle of his sidearm. \"So be it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised both Jon and myself as Alpha then turned to Jon. \"Tommy and Aura Winters are no longer your property but your apprentices.\" firmly, he commanded. \"Their price for failure is the same as your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not what I wanted but it was a step closer. I was no longer a prisoner but an 'employee'. \"Well played, Tommy.\" after we were dismissed, Jon said. \"You are now one of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"For now, Jon.\"</i> nodding silently, I thought. <i>\"Just for now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon smiled. \"Now that you and Aura are employees and not property, you may see your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes lit up as if every birthday had come at once. Little did I know I was playing right into their hands as I was only being taken deeper into the complex...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jon led me through a maze of halls, all of which looked much the same. It was obvious that I would not find my way back later without any help. We finally stopped at a door, which Jon opened and led me inside. The room had monitoring equipment dominating the far wall with a woman sitting with her back to them, watching the screens. She turned and smiled, seeing Jon and I, but said nothing as she then returned to her work. I turned to my right and found a number of medical supplies as well as a door to a small washroom. Turning to the left, I found a large window that looked into a scarcely decorated bedroom; it was much like my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we here?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To see your sister.\" simply, Jon replied. \"Remember the mirror in your room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp escaped my lips as I ran to the window and peered into the room beyond. It was identical to my own room only with toys suited for a little girl against one wall and Aura sleeping in the bed. Seeing her tear stained face, I turned to the woman, accusingly. \"Why is she crying?\" angry, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had a rough day.\" not turning to face me, the woman replied. \"We all have them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, this is Lady Sapphire.\" politely, Jon said. \"She is in charge of Aura's care, just as I am in charge of yours.\" he then turned to Sapphire. \"Alpha has declared that Tommy and Aura are now employees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire paused then turned to me. \"I see...\" softly, she said. \"Aura was asked to help interrogate a prisoner and caught him in several lies.\" she sighed then added, \"The man jumped Aura and I was forced to kill him in front of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" placing my hand against the glass, I said. \"Her first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire nodded then turned to the controls. The lights in the room dimmed and a light above me came on before she then turned to a microphone. \"Aura.\" firmly but kindly, she said. \"Aura, you have a visitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAura moaned then opened her eyes, facing the window. Upon seeing me, she leaped out of bed and hurried across the room, leaving a trail of her tears as she almost literally jumped at the window, placing her hand level with my own against the glass, sobbing loudly with me. We were finally reunited for the first time in a long, long year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, I missed you!\" crying, Aura said. \"Please tell me we're going home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working on it, Aura.\" honestly, I replied. \"We're no longer prisoners, its a start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I felt a strange charge within me and I saw or thought I saw through the eyes of someone close to my aunt Crystal as I could see her clear as day. Looking in Aura's eyes, I could see she was surprised as well and guessed she felt the same surge of energy. <i>\"We must be able to augment each other.\"</i> curious, I thought <i>\"There is no other explanation that fits.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste any opportunity, I focused hard and tried to send a quick call for help with my mind. I was not expecting it to work, as it never did before, but I was hoping it might this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your bother has earned him and you a little freedom.\" said Jon, still in the shadows of the room. \"You are no longer prisoners, its true, however...\" he stepped into the light as I was finishing my mental call for help and placed a hand onto my shoulder, causing me to scream in fight. \"There is no escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I please be with her?\" begging, I asked Jon. \"If only for a few moments?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may sit next across from each other during breakfast tomorrow morning.\" pulling me away from the window, Jon said. \"This will give you both something to look forward to and an incentive to behave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jon removed me from the room. Later that day...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that day, Jon knocked on my door, asking to enter. I gave my permission, not wanting to push anything just yet, and he entered, holding a book and a large folder under his arm. \"Alpha has a mission for us.\" firmly, he said. \"You are to read this book and study this file carefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why a book?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a loose documentary on what had happened in Rome about twenty years ago before Sykes went into hiding.\" serious, Jon replied. \"We had gone over this countless of times but Alpha seems to think you might catch something we missed.\" with an amused smile, he added, \"I thought placing it into book form would make it easier for you to study.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged, not seeing the difference then motioned to the file. \"Are those the recon reports on Waterfront City?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon nodded. \"We don't have a lot at the moment but I figured I'd give you what we had so you can start working on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and Jon left to allow me to get to work. First, I opened the book and began to read...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was close to noon in a small suburb inside the busy streets of Rome. There was a certain calm in the air, one that would make any alert person uneasy. Greg, in traditional western clothing, walked out into the open and gazed upon the ten story building they had targeted. There did not seem to be anything out of the ordinary, however, his instincts were telling him otherwise. Inside the target building was a man named Sykes, whom they needed information from, and they were not about to let that man get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep a sharp eye out, everyone.\" he said, through his ear piece radio. \"I have a nagging feeling that we are not the only people working this side of the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, Jon, a tall, well built man in a black business suit, raised a hand to an ear piece radio of his own, having heard the transmission. \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that, Jon?\" came a woman's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, Crystal.\" replied Jon, radioing back. \"It's coming over the static, their frequency must be overlapping our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means they must be real close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rodger that. Keep your eyes out. I don't want any surprises. Sykes won't get away this time.\" he turned to a small girl, standing next to him, holding a sniper rifle in her arms. \"Kayo, get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked up at Jon with a blank look in her eyes. \"Yes, Jon.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the roof of another building, Heather, in western clothing, sat crouched down in front of a number of small flat panel screens on a folding rack rising from an expensive violin case. Each screen showed a parts of the surrounding area and key rooms inside their target building through cameras on small, mechanical flies, built by Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm nervous, Greg.\" she said, her voice wavering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" asked Greg. \"What do you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has been a large increase of suit activity in the area and there is a heavy smell of gun oil in the air. I'm afraid we are not the only people after Sykes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remain calm and keep an eye on them. If they get too close to your location, move to your alternate spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rodger that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside a small government car, Crystal, a slender, well dressed woman with Italian features, listened to the children talk, taking notes, then turned to her radio. \"Confirmed. This group is also after Sykes. What are your orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wait for them to make their move. If they are successful, we simply surround them and take Sykes off their hands. You know the routine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rodger that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in a nearby alley, Tex, also in western clothing, rolled his eyes and touched his radio. \"We tracked this guy for weeks.\" he said, irritably. \"I say we go for it now! Besides, that worm is holding a small girl hostage! Who knows what he's doing to her in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside a black, full sized van, Sam, also in western clothing, frowned. \"Relax, Tex.\" he said into his radio. \"You'll get your chance to bust a few heads soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to consider the suits.\" added Greg. \"We can not afford a battle on two fronts, not now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if they are after Sykes as well?\" radioed Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg gnawed his jaws in decision. \"Tex, I want you to crash the party inside the target building. Make as much noise as you can and take Sykes. I will follow behind, handle anyone you miss, and rescue the girl. Sam you're our transport out, be ready. Heather, do you have a physical visual of the girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Greg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep an eye on her, tranquilize anyone who gets too close, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Greg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Rodger that.' came Tex's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her car, Crystal's eyes widened in surprise.  The voice sounded very close.  She looked up to find a tall boy, no older than thirteen or fourteen years of age, standing a mere twenty feet from her car.  The child wore a brown T- shirt and brown cargo pants with a long jacket and heavy black boots. In a sheath on his back was what looked like a long, heavy metal bar.  Looking at him, he appeared to have been carved out of stone with eyes that burned like wild fire.  Crystal suppressed a cold shiver as the boy ran passed her to charge the front doors of his target building.  He puled out the long bar and ran through the doors, without slowing. Inside, she could hear muffled gun shots and adult screams as the child began his attack.  Immediately after, another boy ran passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He was taller, but far more slender than the first. Most of his body was hidden behind a  long black cloak.  His face, however, was pale with cold, calculating eyes that threatened to enter her very soul.  Crystal watched him run into the building through the destroyed door before hearing more adult screams as puffs of different colored smoke lightly billowed out of the door and open windows.  Seeing this, she shivered off a certain coldness then turned to her radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Jon, I have made visual contact with two members of the other party..' she said, quietly. 'They are teenagers.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon touched his ear piece radio. 'Teenagers?  It must be the Problem Child Gang.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Difficult to say at this time.' said Crystal. 'But, judging from what I saw of them, it will not be easy to bring these kids down, if it comes to that.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Then, let's hope it doesn't come to that.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Rodger.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Inside the building, Tex charged passed the men, their bullets bouncing off of his rock like frame as Greg took them down with both fighting skill and various chemical creations of his own design.  The bullets that came his way, bounced harmlessly off of his specially designed bullet resistant clothing his partner, Sam had designed and built for him and the others, though Tex felt he had no need for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let's get this done quickly, Tex.' he called out. 'We can't stay long.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Rodger that!' replied Tex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a bee line for the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the building next door, Josh and Vendetta made their way up a number of stairs, heading to the top floor.  Vendetta, with her genetically advanced hearing, detected the faint sounds of gun fire.  She turned and let out a low gasp as she witnessed a scene taking place in the building next door.  Josh turned, hearing her gasp and stared as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, through one window, they caught view of a young boy with short dust blond hair charging up a flight of stairs, towards a man armed with an automatic weapon.  Vendetta's mouth opened as if to scream as the man opened fire upon the boy.  Her eyes widened in surprise as she witnessed the bullets bouncing harmlessly off of the boy's body as if he were made of stone.  Josh, seeing this as well, touched his ear piece radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'We have a visual on one of the other party.' he said. 'The boy appears to be unaffected by small arms fire.  Inform all units not to approach these individuals directly.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Rodger that.' came Jon's voice. 'Continue on to your primary target.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Understood.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Is he... one of them?' Vendetta wondered silently. 'If he is...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Let's go, Vendetta.' said Josh. 'We have work to do.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Vendetta hesitated as she continued to watch and was taken back as the boy knocked the weapon out of the man's hand with a wave of his own then, with his free hand, delivered a crushing blow to the man's stomach.  Vendetta could hear the man cry out in pain as a gush of blood flew out of his mouth.  Then the boy grabbed the man by the belt and swung him in the air a full one hundred and eighty degrees before sending him flying through a window.  The man sailed across the alley and crashed through a window close to where Vendetta and Josh were standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Vendetta let out a low scream of surprise then reached for her secondary weapon, a forty five magnum, resting in a holster, strapped to the small of her back.  But Josh stopped her and pointed to the man, he was completely out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'He is no threat to us.' he said. 'Let's go.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Vendetta turned back to the window, hoping to catch another glimpse of the strange boy but he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up from the book, curious. \"I know Josh, he is field training instructor.\" whispering, I said. \"Only who is this Vendetta and how does she play in all of this?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A look of recognition flashed on his face. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them somewhere before.\u201d softly, he muttered. he shrugged it off and continued up the stairs. \"I have a bigger fish to fry today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside one room on the top floor of the building, Sykes paced nervously back and forth in front of his hostage, fingering the handle of an automatic pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is not good.\u201d impatiently, he mumbled. \u201cNo one is taking the bait and time is running out.\u201d he turned to the small girl, tied to a chair with a gag in her mouth. \u201cIf either of those two fools don\u2019t make a move soon, my dear, I am afraid I am going to have to kill you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small girl pleaded and begged under her gag as tears flowed from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now; it\u2019s nothing personal.\" cooing the girl, Sykes said. \"I actually like you, I was tempted to take you in as one of my own.\" he gave a dark chuckle to the girl's muffled response. \"Unfortunately, this is business and you have become an unnecessary asset.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out the gun, turning off the safety, as he then pointed it at her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather, watching from her roof top post let out a low gasp, seeing Sykes make his move, and quickly took up a sniper rifle with a silencer before taking a quick but careful aim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Kayo\u2019s post on another building, she let out a low gasp of her own before taking a defensive position in front of Jon.  She had spotted a small girl on the roof of their target building, raising a sniper rifle with a silencer on the muzzle.  She let out a sigh of relief, however, as she watched the girl point it at a different building and open fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this as well, Jon raised a hand to his ear piece radio. \u201cThere is a small girl, armed with a sniper rifle on the roof of our target building.\u201d he said. \u201cShe might have seen us.  I want her detained, if possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRodger that.\u201d came Crystal\u2019s vice.  \u201cJosh and Vendetta have silenced their target.  I am in the building with the clean up crew now, I will get it done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Sykes, the girl cringed as he pushed down the hammer of his weapon but let out a cry of pain as a bullet ripped through the window and struck his hand, forcing him to drop the gun.  At that exact moment, Tex literally crashed through the door and landed a heavy blow to Sykes jaw, throwing him completely off of his feet. Sykes landed hard against the wall then slid to the floor, he looked to be unconscious.  After checking the man's pulse to ensure he was still alive, Tex took notice of the bullet wound in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cNice shot, Heather.\u201d he radioed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  On the roof, Heather let out a low giggle. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex then turned to the girl, still tied to the chair, and removed her gag. \u201cWhen are you not going to be in trouble, Hannah?\" smiling slightly, he asked. \"You're lucky I like you so much.\" he then released her from her bonds as Greg entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cSykes men have fled the building.\u201d with a hint of worry, he said. \u201cI don't like this, it was easy, almost too easy... I smell a trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least we finally got Sykes.\" turning to where he left the man, Tex said. his voice died as he saw he was no longer there. \"Where did he go!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked around, his eyes slowly widening. \"I saw explosives on the first floor, secured to the main support pillars.\" panic in his voice, he said. \"This place is rigged to implode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex, showing fear, turned to the window; he let out a low gasp as he spotted a woman, leading a number of men up a flight of stairs, towards the roof. \u201cIt's a trap, Heather, you have company coming!\u201d screaming, he radioed. \u201cGet out of there, now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRodger that!\u201d replied Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg then turned to his radio. \"Sam, its a trap, bring the ride!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the entire building Tex and Greg were in shook from a heavy explosion, nearly throwing Tex, Greg, and Hannah off balance. \"Sam, bring the ride!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside an armored van, Sam threw the gear shift into drive and floored the accelerator. The vehicle reacted immediately and sped forward, out of one alley, down a long, narrow road, towards the alley next to the target building just as an explosion was heard, sending heavy amounts of rock and dust into the air while, on her roof top perch, Heather abandoned her equipment and ran to the corner of the roof. She latched a hook with a long piece of rope to a special belt she was wearing, preparing herself for her jump, as practiced since they first targeted the building. Only she nearly fell over the edge as an explosion rocked the building and she screamed, seeing the target building crumbling onto itself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe building is falling!\" panicked, she radioed. \"Sam, hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather gasped as a second explosion rocked the first floor in the room where her two friends had confronted Sykes. Only she breathed a sigh as she heard Greg radio, \"Sam, the ride, NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe van raced between the two buildings as one was falling straight down. Greg jumped from the top story building, his body covered in gashes and scrapes from flying debris. He fell down through a roof door, into the van with pinpoint accuracy.  Tex jumped from a window further down, with Hannah screaming in his arms, both just as injured only Tex more so as he had to have shielded Hannah from some type of blast. The two landed inside the van in the same way. As Heather waited for her turn, she heard the roof door swing open.  She turned around with a low gasp to face Crystal and a number of men in business suits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFreeze!\u201d ordered Crystal. \u201cStay where you are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTen seconds, Heather!\u201d radioed Sam. \u201cJump now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Sleuth gave Crystal a mischievous smile. \u201cHmmm\u2026. No.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she jumped up and back, diving off of the roof.  Crystal ran over to the edge and was immediately aware that she was attached to a rope.  She looked over the edge to see her land inside an armored van, though a roof door, as it passed.  Then, she was gone, lost in the smoke and debris of the fallen building, the rope swinging freely in the wind. The sound of an engine reached her and she turned to see the van pulling out of the smoke. It sped away with a number of black cars giving pursuit. Seeing that her men were giving chase, she sighed and touched her radio. \u201cShe got away.\u201d disappointed, she said. \u201cShe jumped off of the roof into an armored van, heading north, the back up unit is giving pursuit.\" pausing, she spotted the abandoned equipment. \"She left behind her monitoring equipment.\" radioing again, she said. \"Its like nothing I've ever seen, its worth study.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger that.\u201d replied Jon. \u201cPack it in and return to headquarters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his post, Jon let out a low sigh of his own. \u201cThose kids are far from ordinary.\u201d annoyed, he muttered. \"If we manage to catch them, I want to know exactly who they are!\u201d he turned to Kayo. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d<br>\r\n......................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI placed the book down and sighed. \"Well, now I know where they got this part of story from, the abandoned monitoring equipment.\" softly, I muttered. \"The Problem Child Gang is indeed far from ordinary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following day, Jon returned to the crumbled building to search for signs that might tell him if Sykes was dead or had gotten away. He was about to head back to the car through an alley with Kayo in the lead but froze as she suddenly motioned him to stay back. Standing at the mouth of the alley was the tall, muscular boy who had attacked the target building and escaped its deadly trap. He and his Problem Child Gang had lost the back up team and he guessed that they had returned for the same reasons. The boy, who he recognized as Tex 'the mighty' was covered in blood from scratches and gashes from the explosion and falling debris. He looked at Kayo, then at Jon before turning back to her. \"We meet again, my mysterious friend.\" staring Kayo down, Tex said. \"I'm sad to see you working for the bad guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad guys?\" tilting her head to the side, Kayo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This boy is of no use to us, Kayo.\" stepping up behind her, Jon said. \"Kill him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayo rose her sniper rifle, leveling it with Tex's heart, and turned off the safety before touching the trigger. Only she did not fire, it was as if she could not get herself to do so as Tex showed a hint of fear, staring down barrel of the rifle. \"I- I'm trying to obey, Jon.\" apologetically, Kayo said. \"I want to obey but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kayo, kill him, now!\" sternly, Jon ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to him!\" regaining his composure, Tex said. \"You are better than this, better than him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayo's hands began to shake, a look of uncertainty on her face. \"I- I must obey.\" stammering, she said. \"Jon is my master, I am his slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not a slave!\" roared Tex, startling Kayo. \"You are a confused little girl being toyed with by a sick man who uses you to murder people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut him up!\" pointing at Tex, Jon yelled. \"He is trying to turn us on each other!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayo's hands shook a little more. \"Mommy... daddy....\" tears forming, she whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Jon kill them to get you, Kayo?\" taking a step forward, Tex asked. \"Drop the rifle and I'll rattle his bones for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayo lowered the rifle for a second then rose it back up again, fingering the trigger. \"I must defend Jon!\" blankly, she yelled. \"Do not come closer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't win, boy.\" smirking, Jon said. \"Kayo is ours and nothing you can say will turn her against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex's eyes narrowed to angry slits. \"Nothing, huh?\" hissing, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coldness of his voice caused Jon to hesitate as Tex then turned back to Kayo. \"Kayo, who killed mommy and daddy?\" softly, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Kayo's hands began to shiver, tears running down her face as she slowly, tearfully replied, \"Jon... did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why protect someone who killed those you love the most?\" taking another careful step closer, Tex asked. \"Drop the rifle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kayo, for the last time, kill the boy or I will kill you both!\" impatient, Jon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of desperation came across Kayo's face before she suddenly moved the rifle so it was pointing at Tex's left shoulder. With a tearful look in her eyes, she said, \"I am sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she pulled the trigger. The force of the shot sent Tex stumbling into the street before Kayo wildly turned to Jon, leveling the rifle at his heart. \"Murderer!\" crying, she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shot echoed in the alley as Jon fell to the floor while Kayo ran out into the streets, sidearm in hand as she ran into the streets. Her foot falls echoed into silence as Tex then turned to Jon and easily lifted him off the ground with his one good arm and threw him into the wall of the building, holding him there with a vice like grip. \"I will only ask you once...\" hatred in his voice, he said. \"Where do I find your boss!?\"<br>\r\n............................................................................ .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI placed the book down, my face turning pale, then turned to see Jon standing near the bed. \"Yes, I am the one who told them how to find the castle headquarters.\" flatly, he said. \"I had thought we could easily dispose of or capture them if we lured them there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only you underestimated their power.\" softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon nodded. \"I did not, Carlos did.\" gruffly, Jon replied. \"Alpha was second in command at the time, now he is in charge after disposing of Carlos for his incompetence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of this Kayo who turned against you?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon smiled. \"Do not worry.\" walking out of the room, he said. \"I'll settle that score eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he closed the door behind him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn't feel like the presence was threatening, or the gentle probing intruding, it felt like the equivalent of a knock at the door. I opened my mind to the presence. <br>\r\n<i>'Hello,' said a female voice 'I wondered where you were.

As an employee, you must be fully certified in hand to hand and weapons combat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently nodded then followed Josh through a series of hallways and corridors to an open field in the back corner of the complex. There were other training fields throughout the property; this one was a garden maze with high walls of shrubbery and paths which mostly lead to dead ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did we take the scenic route here?\" Darkly curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's standard procedure for any new employee.\" Serious, Josh replied. \"We want to know if we can trust the new hire before we allow them to know their way around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, I silently nodded. I now understood why Jon took me through such a maze of hallways to see Aura; he did not want me to find her again so easily on my own. \"Where do we start, sir?\" Softly, I asked. \"Hand to hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wish.\" Calmly, Josh said. \"Only I was thinking more of a maze run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what...?\" Confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a door opening reached my ear and I turned to see a young woman stepping out onto the field. She was tall and slender with shoulder length blond hair and hazel eyes. I gasped upon seeing Aura step out right behind her! My first instinct was to run to her but Josh firmly held be back with an iron grip upon my shoulder. \"Thank you for retrieving Aura for me, Vendetta.\" Calmly, he said. \"You know what must be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI became fearful as Vendetta leaned down and began to whisper in Aura's ear but paused as Josh whispered into mine. \"Your goal was to run through the garden maze in front of you to find and kill a trespasser whom we had caught and questioned last week.\" Serious, he explained. \"Vendetta and I already too care of that nasty business. Your job is to run through the maze and find your way out before they notice you and your sister made a run for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Josh surprised. \"Why...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh frowned. \"There is no time to explain, kid.\" Darkly, he said. \"This is your only chance to get out before you are both in too deep.

We were lead to a small car where Creed urged us to get in. She jumped in herself and barked to the driver, \"Go, Ace, go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver, Ace, hit the accelerator and we were off, speeding away from the dark complex that had been our prison for over a year. \"Thank you for the rescue.\" Timidly, I said. \"Is Josh a member of your group as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh was a double agent, working for the British secret service.\" Surprising me, Creed replied. \"Vendetta is my twin sister; she and I were a part of the original Cloaked Dagger group. She and Josh worked together to help undermine the Agency back in the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you find us?\" Wincing, Aura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't.\" Gruffly, Ace said. \"A kid from the new Problem Child Gang heard your cries for help and contacted us.\" He gave a low chuckle. \"I must admit, it feels good to be back in action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce was a bald, slender, muscular man of average height in his early thirties. I caught a glimpse of his green eyes in the rear view mirror.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"We can waltz down memory lane later, Ace.\" Scolding, Creed said. \"Right now, we need to get these two back to the old HQ and find out how much they can tell us about The Agency's plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she picked up a phone and dialed a number. Moments later, a feminine voice answered. \"Madam Vague, we have them.\" Serious, she said. \"Tell your daughter they are in good health and in good hands.\" There was a pause before Creed then said, \"Yes, we will contact you if we learn anything more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she ended the call then turned to see my confused expression. \"Madam Vague is an old friend of both groups.\" Kindly, she explained. \"She was an advisor of sorts though her messages were a bit cryptic to say the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hence her name.\" Guessing correctly, Aura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreed nodded. \"Precisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes Ace turned the car down a narrow road to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I let out a surprised shriek only to pause, confused as the road in front of us lifted, revealing an underground passage. The car drove down it and the doorway closed on its own behind us. As we passed through the entrance, I felt slightly light headed as a dull flash enveloped us. I looked around to find that we had stopped in a large parking garage. \"What the bloody hell was that all about?!\" Stunned, I demanded. \"I feel weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teleportation.\" Bemused, Creed replied. \"Just one of the many things Sykes and the Agency are after, not to mention CHILD.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are in a modified underground bunker that was used by Italian resistance forces during the second World War.\" Calmly, Ace said. \"The 'garage door' we went through is just the access port; anyone else would only find the garage of a resident multimillionaire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was the leader of our group.\" Smiling, Creed said. \"You will meet him later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone out.\" Firmly, Ace said. \"The rest of the group is expecting us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain, I followed Aura out with Creed and Ace leading us through a heavy metal door into a long hall that lead to another and another. \"Just another maze.\" Sighing, Aura muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand your concerns.\" Calmly, Creed said. \"These hallways were already here when we took it over. It was to slow down anyone who managed to gain entry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking nearly a dozen turns passed various rooms and other hallways, we entered a large conference room where a dozen other people were waiting. All of them were in their early to mid thirties with serious expressions on their faces. Creed urged us both to sit down side by side as a boy no older than myself walked up with his hands passively behind his back. Professionally dressed, he was rather muscular with black hair and piercing green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, children.\" Calmly, he said. \"My group name is Cog. As you may or may not have guessed, I have not aged in over fifty years. I have the ability to slow down or even work outside of normal time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that even possible?\" Stunned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now, all you need to understand is that there are certain places on our planet where powerful people are born.\" Serious, Cog replied. \"There are powerful people, both good and evil, after the secrets of these places.\" He sighed. \"It is our job to protect those secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing we are a part of that secret.\" Glumly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All those born in these places are a part of that secret.\" Gently, Creed said. \"The point is, we cannot allow that power to fall into the wrong hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hence the birth of the Cloaked Dagger and The Problem Child Gang.\" Serious, Cog said. \"We all knew and understood that the fight would rekindle eventually as it had again and again all around the world for decades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An endless waltz...\" Softly, Aura said. \"That's what daddy said war was like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCog nodded. \"That it is... an endless waltz.\" Softly, he replied. \"All we can do is put out the fires in front of us and pray others after us pick up the fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Aura who gave me a nod with a look of determination. I nodded back and turned to Cog with the same expression. \"We are in.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ace has the ability to literally become one with any vehicle, piloting them with incredible skill. He can also possess any person he chooses and 'pilot' them as well within a certain distance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's insane...\" Startled, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more insane than your ability to see through the eyes and hearts of other people.\" Calmly, a plump man in loose fitting clothing said. \"They call me Freak. I have the ability to grow into a literal giant and fire energy blasts from my hands. Originally, I worked for a group called The Guard back in the States but they asked me to give them a hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreak had gentle blue eyes but his wind burned face was covered in scars, making me wince. He smile kindly at my reaction. \"I have looked worse after a mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They call me Blacksmith.\" A towering muscular man said. \"I built anything and everything they needed from Assault rifles to Zeno tapes.\" He smiled. \"Also, I'm not half bad when it comes to fighting if I have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded but could not help stare. Blacksmith seemed to be made or at least covered in steel from head to toe with just his green eyes showing through a mask. \"What happened to you?\" Was all I could ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blacksmith was badly injured during our last mission twenty years ago.\" Sadly, Cog replied. \"He had shielded us from a massive explosion that would have killed us all.\" He paused, rubbing one eye. \"He may have a body like steel but he still suffered from third degree burns over more than seventy percent of his body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This steel seeped from my own body to protect me while I slowly healed.\" With a slight smile, Blacksmith explained. \"It stayed so I am now literally a 'man of steel'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may call me Gargoyle.\" Calmly, another muscular man said. \"I have the ability to shape shift into any creature I desire, past, present, or mythological. My brother has the same powers but he has moved to the States to help the clean up crew there.\" He frowned. \"I heard that he and his wife produced a child who, after a failed assassination attempt,  was born with an advanced form of our powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGargoyle had longish black hair and piercing green eyes with a face, an entire body that looked as if it were carved from stone. All I could do was nod in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may call me Mirage.\" Calmly, a slender woman said. \"I have the ability to create solid illusions to distract, slow down, or even fight any would be pursuers or enemies.\" She sighed. \"Make no mistake, what you are hearing, The Agency already knows as we have dealt with them on more than a few occasions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage had long brown hair and brown eyes and wore regular western style clothing which confused me. A bemused smile formed on her face seeing my expression. \"The best way to vanish into a crowd is to blend in.\" Smiling slightly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the original members of The Cloaked Dagger.\" Serious, Cog said. \"The other five are our support team and clean up crew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They discovered the children had talent and added them to their growing list of brainwashed child agents who they use to do their dirty work in the field. Tommy, however, was not brainwashed as he seemed immune to the efforts, they instead used his little sister as a bargaining chip to keep him in line.  Tommy is a kind hearted boy with no desire to hurt or kill anyone but he does as he is told out of fear of his sister being harmed or killed. He prays every night for someone to come to his and his little sister's rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy possesses a power called  'Psychic Clairvoyance'; the ability to see through the eyes of other people, know what they know and, to some extent, control their bodies. He does not need to see that person to do this, a photograph will do as long as the photograph is current and the target person is within his range. He has a lesser power to communicate mentally but it is too weak to use at great distances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Aura Winters</b><br>\r\n<i>Age: 7years.</i><br>\r\n<i>4'10'' 98lbs.</i><br>\r\n<i>Description: Very petite with doll like features auburn hair and green eyes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAura and her older brother, Tommy were both kidnapped by the Agency after a bomb, meant for another target had taken the lives of their parents. They discovered the children had talent and added them to their growing list of brainwashed child agents who they use to do their dirty work in the field. Aura, however, was not brainwashed as she seemed immune to the efforts, they instead used her older brother as a bargaining chip to keep her in line. Aura is quiet and shy, she fears the dark and can not bear to see anyone get hurt. She prays every night for someone to come to her and her brother's rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAura possesses the simple power of intimately knowing anyone she meets. As an example, Aura would know how many tattoos a man had, where they were, what they looked like, and why he got each one. She is used in interrogations as she would immediately know if a person was lying, holding something back, or genuinely telling the truth when asked a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jon (last name unknown)</b><br>\r\n<i>Age: 82 (appears to be 30)</i><br>\r\n<i>6'2'' 225lbs.</i><br>\r\n<i>Description: Tall and muscular with short light brown hair and copper green eyes. Always wears a black business suit and black dress shoes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon is Tommy and Aura's 'master', he is in charge of their care and discipline while in the service of the Agency. Jon is both cold and ruthless, he would not think twice to kill anyone who stood in his way unless he believed he or she could be manipulated or used in his favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon has the ability to mentally manipulate the nervous system of any living creature, granting him a wide variety of attacks upon any man or beast only he must be within close range to do this. Through this ability, he heals at an incredible rate, slowing his aging process to a near standstill, making him a very formidable opponent. However, he is not without weakness. Jon is vulnerable magic, he must heal normally from a magical attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Alpha (real name unknown)</b><br>\r\n<i>Age:52</i><br>\r\n<i>6'4'' 250lbs.</i><br>\r\n<i>Description: Tall and muscular; bald, black within black eyes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlpha is more machine than man; very few within the Agency know of this. All of his limbs are cybernetic, giving him incredible speed and strength. Both of his eyes are enhanced with cybernetic lenses, giving him a wide variety of 'sights' such as inferred and telescopic when called upon with eye movement controls. Many of his vital organs had been replaced with mechanical replacements, through his daughter. (see Beta below).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlpha is twisted and evil with an obsession to conquer the world. He will not hesitate to kill anyone he feels have lost their usefulness or stands in their way. Anyone who escapes his wrath, he relentlessly chases until they are killed or made to forever look over their shoulder in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Beta (real name unknown)</b><br>\r\n<i>Age: 25</i><br>\r\n<i>6' 160lbs.</i><br>\r\n<i>Description: Tall and muscular with long black hair and green eyes</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeta is Alpha's daughter, brainwashed from the age of five to serve the Agency. Alpha raised Beta, giving her the rank of his right hand woman and bodyguard. She is just as cold and ruthless as her father and is completely loyal to his every command, referring to him as Alpha, never father. Beta is greatly feared by those within the Agency, hence no one dares to question, or worse, challenge him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeta has the power to change anything organic she grips and focuses upon into its mechanical counterpart and the reverse. She can give a person a robotic arm by merely holding onto it for a short time. If she were too completely mechanize a person, he or she would no longer be a living person but a lifeless machine, serving every command without question until she reverses the process within a few days time. The change becomes permanent after that. However, an iron will can block her powers, giving one a chance to break her grip. Beta can change parts of her body to give herself 'armor plating' to protect her own life but does not dare fully mechanize herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>More characters may be added as they are introduced.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I want to get away from here but not without my brother. The people who come to see me said that if I am bad, Tommy will get hurt. They make me watch a television, showing him getting beat up, each time I am bad. I wish I knew where he was so I could save him. I just know that, together, we can get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Help us!\"</i> hugging a teddy bear, I thought. <i>\"Please... Please someone hear me!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI seem to know everything about anyone I see as if I had known them all their life. I really don't know how it works or why, it just does. I tried to use it on the people I see here but what I get from them don't make any sense. Its like piecing a puzzle together without a picture to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had just celebrated Tommy's twelfth birthday before all this started. We had all come to Europe for a vacation but the house, I think it was called a bungalow, was not ready yet. Daddy took us out to find a hotel for the night. We all walked into one hotel, just outside of Rome and walked up to the desk. Dad politely cleared his throat. He was not tall but not short either and he was strong. I think he always dressed fancy....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I help you?\u201d asked the clerk, politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we are vacationing here in your beautiful nation.\" smiling, dad said. \"Unfortunately, our bungalow is not ready yet. We were hoping you had a room available for the four of us tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desk clerk looked down at some papers then turned back to dad, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re in luck, sir.\u201d he said. \u201cA gentleman, Mr. Kline, had reserved a two bedroom suite a few weeks ago but canceled at the last minute. He left instructions to give the room to someone who could use it. It\u2018s paid up until the end of next week\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \u201cNow, that\u2019s generosity.\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s known for that.\u201d he waved to someone behind them. \u201cIf you will be kind enough to sign in on the registry, I will have the bellhop carry your bags up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad signed his name in the book then followed the hotel worker to the elevator, which took them up to the tenth floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is your room, sir.\u201d politely, the bellhop said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d handing the teenager a large bill, dad said. \u201cJust leave the bags here, my kids and I can carry them in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d smiling, the bellhop replied. \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy placed the bags down and walked away as dad unlocked the door and walked in with mom right behind him. Tommy and I were in the hall, picking up some of the bags. Just as we got to the door, the whole hall shook, throwing us both to the floor. I looked up and screamed, seeing fire shooting out of the room. I guess it was too much for me because I think I passed out. The last thing I heard was Tommy screaming. \u201cDaddy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days after that were horrible. Tommy and I were taken away to a strange, scary place under the ground. They took us in different directions... that was the last time I saw my big brother. I was given a number of shots, they made my head hurt then feel messed up and confused. Those jerks who took us made me learn how how to kill and torture people, form strategies on what I learn from people's minds and find force confessions out of those people they put before me. I wanted to escape, only they have my big brother somewhere in this strange place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will do exactly as you are told.\u201d one man had said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, we will beat your bother until she stops moving. Is that clear, Aura?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a year since then, I still want to get away but not without my brother.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I was more interested in seeing what the local mall had to offer. Still, dad insisted that we take in the natural scenery so up the hiking path we went so to humor him. I had to admit, the scenery was beautiful but I was still bored.

He had short black hair with some gray highlights and blue eyes which seemed to twinkle when he laughed. On the way there, dad called him on the cellphone and told him what had happened to which he informed dad to hit us both with some chloroform, something we were unaware of until Amadeus shoved a foul smelling cloth against both of our faces.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a meteor of unusual properties that had struck your children, Mr Johnson.\" upon waking up, I heard Dr Khan say. \"However, it was an old meteor, ejected from the ground, somehow.

I would also guess that it was ejected from an illegal dump site that had exploded due to the heat, igniting the chemicals. Did you hear any explosion before you saw the 'meteorite'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard something like a sonic boom before Amadeus spoke up.\" thoughtful, dad said. \"Do you think the effect this had on my children will wear off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, no.\" regretfully, Dr Khan said. \"I fear this is only the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying this going to get worse!?\" frightened, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad turned to me, worried. \"Easy, honey.\" softly, he said. \"You don't want to start growing in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to explain, my dear.\" walking up to me, Dr Khan said. \"Normally, humans do not suddenly grow or shrink to any degree as you and your brother did.

That part of your brain is producing an energy that allows your body to grow and shrink at will.\"  he paused, allowing his words to sink in. \"So far, this new ability is reacting to your emotional state, like a reflex. I suggest we work on getting some form of control over this before going any further with studying it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to dad, uncertain who nodded. \"Dr Khan has never steered us wrong before, honey.\" he said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wanted to stay and watch but Amadeus pulled me back and thrust me up the stairs. \"Dad told us to run!\" in an authoritative tone, he yelled. \"We have to move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing his true urgency, I reluctantly ran up the stairs to the second floor where Amadeus led us to an emergency escape door that we used to get out fast in case the house was on fire. The door led to a small closet that had what looked like a fireman's pole which we used to slide down to another closet which lewd to the back yard where the RV was parked. \"What about dad!?\" opening RV's side door, Damien asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He told me to take you three to safety and watch over you until he can catch up to us.\" urging me into the RV, Amadeus replied. \"I'm not going to argue with his orders so please don't argue with mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he jumped into the driver's seat and started the engine. I let out a scream as something broke the back window and found myself tempted to become a giantess. only Amadeus floored the accelerator, throwing me off balance as the RV sped away from the mansion summer home at top speeds. \"We could have stayed and fought them off.\" tearing up, I protested. \"Damien and I can become giants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, your powers are useless as you can not easily control them.\" scolding, Amadeus said. \"If you and Damien were in better practice, I might have agreed with you but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words were interrupted by a loud explosion that shook the road. Amadeus struggled slightly with the wheel before looking in the rear view as you and Damien looked out the back window. A large ball of flame was rising where the mansion summer home once stood. My eyes filled with horror as tears flowed like rivers down my cheeks. \"Daddy....!\" crying, I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" crying as well, Damien yelled. \"We have to go back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad told me not to look back!\" tears falling, Amadeus snapped. \"He told me that this Agency was as evil as they come, we need to find a place to lay low!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Johnson does not run from his problems!\" stating the family motto, I snapped back. \"We have to do something, not just run from those who killed our dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know if he is dead or not.\" regaining his composure, Amadeus said. \"All we know is that those two are willing to blow up a house to capture or kill us. We need to come up with a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Amadeus turned silent and I sat down in the passenger seat, watching him. \"Do you think we'll be alright?\" after a pause, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmadeus sighed. \"I don't know.\" honestly, he replied. \"We'll think of something, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly nodded. \"O- Okay.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He has the power to fly but being only two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine.\" stunned, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGar nodded then continued. \"Clem Rodgers, shape shifting; Susan Tanner, ghost powers and ninja training; Lilith Nightshade, magical powers and mystic wisdom.\" motioning to the others, he said. \"We have two other members but they have gone missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis Greenway, who is an Animancer and Megan Connors who is a Technomancer.\" turning to me, Cait said. \"They went missing after the first day of school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Animancer...

It was strong enough to rattle the walls of their underground headquarters. \"What was that?\" startled, Beth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Amadeus came running into the room. \"The city is under attack!\" firmly, he announced. \"A small army of goons on floating platforms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGar ran from the group to a control unit on one side of the room where he hit a few buttons, activating a big screen monitor on the wall above it. It showed an image of Sykes and a number of his followers on five strange floating platforms, firing what looked like sci-fi laser rifles at random buildings. Gar focused the camera image on a man on the lead platform before a low growl echoed from his throat. The man was tall with longish brown hair and piercing green eyes. He was wearing oddly ancient leather armor as he held a laser rifle of his own while holding the hilt of a sword at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Sykes!\" anger in his voice, Garth said. \"He's back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to stop him before he leave this city in shambles.\" serious, Amadeus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGar nodded. \"Agreed.\" turning to him, he said. \"Everyone to the Beast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped, remembering reading about a near invulnerable armored van the original group used as their transport into and out of their missions. \"Does anyone have a plan?\" following the group, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" grabbing a long metal bar from a display case, Garth replied. \"We go, we see, we kick his ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced. <i>\"Not much of a plan.\"</i> worried, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmadeus seemed to sense my uncertainty. \"We go to the surface, assess the situation, and deal with it as needed to resolve the crisis.\" quietly, he said. \"Gar just has a less definitive way of putting it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe left Beth and Clem behind to watch over Sam and Rhea then raced onto the surface through the secret entrance to face Sykes and his men....<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Mom finally had enough when I landed in the hospital with a concussion, and got him locked up for a while. He still gets monthly supervised visits, though, and it's after these visits that I usually start talking tattoos with Mom and my stepfather. So far, they've held firm that I can't get one until I'm of legal age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't ask me what my birth father does for a living since he left jail, because he won't tell us. Seriously, he changes the subject every time we ask. All we know so far is, every now and then, he'll mention somebody named Hagen, but he goes right back into super-secret mode as soon as we ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's most of my life. Sounds pretty normal, for the most part, and I'd agree with you, if it weren't for the day when things got weird, even by goth standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was my first day of high school. I was having this dream, where I'm taking a shower, and Sue Tanner comes in and we start kissing. I've had it before, but this time, I noticed I felt something different behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I started to wake up, I still felt this difference, and I began to realize that I wasn't sleeping on my mattress. Had I rolled off during the night? I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes, and I saw what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had gone to sleep in my bed, but I woke up lying on the ceiling.</span></div></div>",

How did you get up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I just woke up, and here I was. Can you help get me down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I suppose I can try,\" she said, making her way to the side of my bed. \"Can you give me your hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave it a try, and surprised myself by succeeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom grasped my hand and gave it a tug. That must have been all that was needed to break whatever held me up there, because I fell right on top of her. It knocked the wind out of both of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we could breathe again, Mom said, \"You'd better get ready for school, Lilith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I should still go, after... after whatever this was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I kept you home, I'd have to explain why. And I'd rather not tell your new principal that you and gravity suddenly need to work things out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't argue with that. \"Let me fix myself up, and I'll grab some cereal downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince I'd have to wash after P.E., there was no sense putting on my powder, so I kept my makeup simple: black mascara, purple eyeliner, black lipstick, and black nail polish. Then I checked my hair for roots showing through: nothing major, so I could let it slide until later. I got my products from a goth supplier online. It cost more than store-bought, but that stuff never had the right shade, especially the hair dye. Of course, after one store-bought product started making people's hair fall out, my stuff looked a lot more reasonable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brushed my hair. My hair was straight and shoulder-length, with bangs cut in a wide V. Once I was presentable, I went downstairs for breakfast.</span></div></div>",

However, once I got to school, I found that it would have a lot of competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a start, one of the first people I saw in the schoolyard was Alyssa Vance. Now, I've known Lyssa for a couple of years. We're not great friends or anything, but I know a few things about her. The thing is, up until a couple years ago, she was a boy. Then, at the start of junior high, she showed up in a skirt and longer hair. She told me once that she was taking different pills to suppress male hormones and stimulate female, but she still looked like a long-haired boy with tiny boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, though, she looked like a regular girl. Her facial structure was different, she needed at least a B cup, and she had curves. I was starting to get turned on. How did she get that way? I didn't think any doctors would do that kind of work on a teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe met up with Garth Jones, and then the next weird thing happened: Cait Spencer showed up. Normally, Caitlin Spencer was in the running for Snob of the Year. Today, though, she walked up to Garth and Lyssa and started talking with them. When did they get so chummy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't ponder that mystery too long, though, because Trish Wilson (one of Cait's nicer friends) screamed. When I turned to look, I saw two wolves charging at the kids. Garth and Lyssa started herding everybody inside, then Garth stayed outside to deal with the wolves. Don't ask me what he planned to do against wild animals. I had thought Lyssa was inside, too, but she wasn't where I thought I'd seen her, so I figured I'd imagined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Garth and Lyssa came back inside. Then he surprised her (and everybody else, me included) by kissing her full on the mouth. Once she recovered from that surprise, he kissed her again. A lot of kids cheered. Me, I couldn't help wondering how weird the day was going to get.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The weirdness continued for me as I saw that all of the 'problem' students were placed into one homeroom. Worse, I could sense a strange vibe from all of them. I could always tell if someone was more than they seemed and it felt as if this class was full of students like that, including the teacher, it was real creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back to East Shore High School, class.\" smiling, the teacher said. \"For those who have not yet met me, I am your homeroom teacher, Sarah Barns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"There's a dark past behind that teacher.\"</i> suppressing a shiver, I thought. <i>\"I could probably guess what it is, if I had my Tarot Cards.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a firm believer in the powers of the Mystics and I often turned to the Tarot Cards when I felt lost or frightened. I had tried to use them to guess what my birth father did for a living after he got out of prison but I always encountered the death card, a warning not to follow that path. Turning to Lyssa, a thin smile formed onto my face. <i>\"I don't know how or when but she is definitely all girl now.\"</i> bemused, I thought. <i>\"No one can fake that true feminine scent.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy senses had always been sharp. I think it was my father's beatings that brought them on, a developed early warning system to help me prepare. However I got them, it forced me to wear heavy perfumes to keep other people's scents, good or bad, from attacking my nostrils and special ear plugs to keep me from hearing every whispered conversation. Also, I had to get special contact lenses to protect my eyes as they became sensitive to bright lights. My sense of smell and taste were strong as well. It drove me crazy, at first but I learned to live with them. Only today, I did not have the time for the usual morning routine and I was keen to everything and everyone around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Everyone in this class has changed somehow, including myself.\"</i> looking about, I thought. <i>\"There has to be a connection but what?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided it best to try to ignore everything for now and consult the cards after school. I managed to get through my first class, American History, and was about to go to my next class when someone tapped me on the shoulder. I sighed then turned around to find Caitlin Spencer. \"What do you want?\" trying to be patient, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've go 3rd period PE with Alyssa Vance, right?\" looking at me Caitlin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" wondering where this was going, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep an eye on her,\" her eyes almost pleading, Caitlin said, \"I heard someone planning something about her and I don't want her hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snorted. \"Since when did you care?\" coldly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin sighed, giving me a 'I deserved that look'. This surprised me as I had always known Caitlin to be filled with vanity and pride, she was not herself. \"I've changed a lot over the summer.\" looking at me, she said. \"Besides, I found out she's my cousin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged, inwardly impressed with Cait's improved attitude. \"I'll see what I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Lilith.\" with a look of relief, Cait said. \"I knew I could count on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked away I was more certain than ever that more strange events were ahead. \"Brace yourself, girl.\" steeling myself, I muttered. \"I have a feeling this is going to be a crazy day.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I took one closest to the bend, where Lyssa changed into her things. <i>She's had her first period,</i> I thought. I could tell by her scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could also hear Amber and Cassie giggling over something. When I looked, I saw Cassie passing a note to Amber. <i>That must be the plot,</i> I thought. <i>Wish I could read it from here. Funny, Cait and them used to be tight.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got to start PE with my least favorite activity, dodge-ball. Boys played on one side of the gym, and girls played on the other. As if I didn't dislike it enough, Coach put me and Lyssa on different teams, so I was on the other side of the net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe hadn't been playing long when Amber shouted out, \"Hey, Garth, check out your girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole class looked as, to my horror, Amber and Cassie pulled Lyssa's shorts and panties down, exposing her to everyone. Thanks to them, what happened to Lyssa was apparent to everybody, as there's just no way to fake lady-business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach acted immediately, benching Amber and Cassie, then helping Lyssa with her clothes and walking her to the locker room. Dodge-ball was forgotten by everyone. We all watched as Coach took Lyssa, tears streaming from her eyes, out of the gym, probably to the principal's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Coach returned without Lyssa, she said, \"Everybody, hit the showers.\" Then she turned to Amber and Cassie and said, \"You two are going straight to Principal Hendrick's office when you're through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we washed off what little sweat we had, I caught Amber's scent. It had changed somehow. I couldn't put my finger on what was different. <i>It must have happened after she attacked Lyssa. What's going on with this school?</i></span></div></div>",

I was glad to hear that Cassie and Amber had been punished for their actions. Especially Amber - she'd been a real problem for me ever since I came out as a lesbian. The news that she'd slurred me in the principal's office didn't shock me at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Lyssa's sister, Beth, and passed along the homework for the other classes I shared with Lyssa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I got home, I changed out of the school uniform and into my standard black outfit. With that done, I told my mom, \"I'll be out for a while. A friend from school had a real bad day and got sent home, so I want to see how she's doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be out too late, honey,\" Mom replied. \"We're having lasagna tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked the blocks to Lyssa's house and knocked on her door. When her father answered, I was greeted by the telltale smell of a dirty diaper. \"Yes?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Lilith,\" I replied, \"a friend of your daughter's. I came to see how she's doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"I'm glad you care so much about her. Come on in. She's got another friend visiting, too. She's helping me with Sam, but she'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went inside, and Garth was there on the couch. He and Beth were talking. \"I didn't expect you to drop by,\" Beth said. \"What brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to see how Lyssa's doing,\" I replied. \"And I hoped I'd get some answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answers?\" Lyssa said, as she joined us. \"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a start, how did you change? I've never seen anything like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a family trait,\" she replied. \"The same thing happened to an ancestor of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" I said, \"but what about the rest of you? It seems like a lot of the kids at school, and at least one of the teachers, are more than they appear to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you know that?\" Mr. Vance asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because there's more to me than meets the eye, too,\" I replied. \"I know there's something different about you because I can smell it. I got a concussion from my father beating me when I was a kid, and my senses have been cranked to 11 ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth looked like he wanted to say something, but Lyssa clapped her hand over his mouth. \"And you expect us to take your word for this?\" Mr. Vance continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is more,\" I admitted. \"I know it sounds crazy, but I woke up this morning lying on the ceiling over my bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would explain it,\" Mr. Vance said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa took her hand away from Garth's mouth and nodded. \"Lilith,\" he said, \"you're an inch off the floor.\"</span></div></div>",

I turned to see that it was indeed my mom at the door. <i>\"Odd, she only wears 'Rare Diamonds' on very special occasions.\"</i> my eyes then went wide as I saw mom knell down to hug Mrs Vance as if she were an old friend. <i>\"She acts as if she's known Mrs Vance all her life... what is going on!?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been too long, Madam Vague.\" releasing mom, Mrs Vance said. \"I'm honored that you bring light to my home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The honor is mine, dear child.\" rising to her feet, mom said. \"When Lilith told me the address, I knew it was your family and the family of your friends she was concerned for.\" she then teared up slightly. \"I am truly sorry I was too late to save you from the wrath of Clarence Mayweather...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saved me from bleeding to death on the side of the road, Madam Vague.\" tearing up with her, Mrs Vance said. \"I owe you my life, still today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" my voice shaking, I asked. \"You know Mrs Vance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes; I do.\" turning to me, mom said. \"She had called herself Heather 'Hawkeye' as a member of the Problem Child Gang, twenty years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... you- you were just a- a kid then too.\" stammering, I said. \"Please mom, what is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled and casually walked over to me. \"The cards will explain everything, Lilith.\" showing me a Tarot card deck, she said. \"Place your trust in the wisdom of the Mystics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, those aren't my cards.\" confused and frightened, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my dear.\" still smiling, she replied. \"Your cards are in your hands.\" shocked, I looked and saw that I was holding my Legacy deck then turned back to mom as she said, \"These are mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she threw the cards into the air and they flew about with a fluttering sound as they shuffled themselves before lining up in the air as if they were being stacked onto a table. Once done, they were all shown face down, no matter which side you looked at, ready to be read and shown to all. Everyone's jaws dropped in shock, including my own as my Tarot cards fell from my hands. Mrs Vance alone was smiling as my Tarot cards, like mom's shuffled themselves in the air then lined themselves up before me. \"Not the most graceful cast, my dear.\" amused, mom said. \"Still, you are just beginning to learn.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have known for some time that you are not like the others. It is time that you learned your destiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom leaned in close. \"Lilith Nightshade, you are a witch, like your mother before you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt like my tower had been knocked out from under my feet. \"A-a witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded again. \"Our powers are not quite so grand as popular fiction would suggest. However, if enough of us were to gather, we could accomplish great things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her attention to Lyssa. \"For instance, twelve witches once encountered a young man who, more than anything, wanted to be female. Can you guess what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa swallowed hard. \"Th-they turned Iolaus into Iole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely.\" Mom turned back to me. \"This morning, after you left for school, I dug out my Tarot, and drew the Judgement card. Do you know what that signifies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"There was a call that you should heed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Always trust in the cards, daughter. I disregarded their warnings once, when I was attracted to my first husband. As a penalty, I was denied my powers, until today. That is why I could not protect us from his wrath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI asked, \"Why does Mrs. Vance keep calling you Madame Vague?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Her expectations were formed by old movies, where the fortune teller could lay out exactly what was to come. When I could only say things like 'There is conflict coming,' or 'The current situation will change,' she started calling me Madame Vague, much as you would call someone who told you what you already knew Captain Obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About the cards,\" I said. \"Dad's always so secretive about his job, so I tried asking the cards what he does. Whenever I do, though, I keep drawing the Death card. What does it mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I spoke, I drew another card from my deck. Instead of Death, though, I now drew the Moon card. Something was about to change, and it would either be fraught with deception or reveal important truths. Something told me it would be the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"If he ever learned about this, it would mean the death of us both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath. \"Lilith, you drew the Death card because your father is dead. My first husband is not your father.\"</span></div></div>",

I was looking forward to graduating high school and moving on to college. Only, two men stormed my house and tried to take me by force. I ran out of the house, not daring to look back but I knew they were on my tail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who were they?\" concerned, Garth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" shaking her head, mom said. \"I managed to lose them just outside of Fallen Heroes Cemetery on the edge of town where I found a number of people in dark robes gathered around a fire among the tombstones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creepy.\" shivering, Lyssa muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It turned out to be a coven of witches.\" said mom, softly. \"A young woman among them approached me and smiled....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Madeline Wallace.\" the woman said. \"I have been expecting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline, terrified and out of breath, took a step back. \"Yo- You know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled then threw a number of cards into the air. They shuffled on their own then lined themselves in the air. \"The cards never lie.\" serious, she said. \"My time in this world is coming to a close but your time is just beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline took another step back. \"What do you want from me?\" almost crying, she asked. \"Has everyone gone crazy!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in no danger, Madeline Wallace.\" said the other cloaked people. \"Come....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline found herself slowly walking forward, though her mind screamed to run away. Once she was before them, staring into the camp fire, the young woman walked up and placed her hands onto Madeline's shoulders, staring into her eyes as the others formed a circle around them. They all began to chant with Madeline reciting it with them, though she had never heard it before. As they did, a light, glowing mist bellowed from the woman's mouth and entered Madeline's mouth, causing them both to glow with an eerie light. Madeline stared in horror as the woman became older and older before her eyes. Finally, the chanting stopped and the once young woman was not nothing more than dust, blowing in the light wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... happened?\" trembling with terror, Madeline asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our sister has passed to the next realm.\" solemnly, one of the cloaked figures replied. \"She had no children to pass her power onto so she has chosen and entrusted you to to be that daughter she never had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her knowledge, her wisdom, and her power is now your own.\" added a second hooded figure. \"Use your gifts wisely.\" she then smiled. \"Welcome to the coven sisterhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom wiped the tears from her eye. \"I had lost my mother when I was young and watched a woman who had chosen me as a daughter she never had die before my eyes.\" emotionally, she said. \"I had vowed make her proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" awestruck, Lyssa whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"My first husband, Darren, and I fell in love quickly and did not consult the cards before marrying him.\" looking slightly ashamed, she said. \"That brings us to Dr Thomas Vague.\" she paused to force a smile. \"He was our family doctor and always defended me when he could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, mom.\" taking in every word, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One night, Darren had beat me senseless and left to get even more drunk. I called Dr Vague and he came over to tend to my wounds.\" her smile vanishing, mom replied. \"As he was treating me, Darren returned, found the two of us together, and went into a rage. He mortally wounded Dr Vague with his hunting knife.\" she cried freely. \"That was when I had enough and used my magick on him. One punch sent him through the closed door, across the hall, and through the wall into the room beyond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom... one punch!?\" my eyes widening to saucers, I asked. \"That could have killed him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I learned that magick can not kill.\" almost regretful, mom said. \"Still, to this day, he fears me when I become angry.\" she sighed. \"I then turned my attention onto Dr Vague and consulted the cards to find a way to save him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't find a way, though.\" sadly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't.\" shaking her head, mom replied. \"But I did find a way to help him carry on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made love to him as he died?\" stunned, Lyssa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honored his last request as a debt of honor, Lilith.\" sternly, mom replied. \"He wanted... a family. I had intended to 'introduce' you to him once Darren's visitation rights were officially revoked next week, Lilith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, I did not respond as I was still soaking everything in. Finally, a small smile slowly formed onto my face. \"My dad sounds like an incredible man.\" dreamily, I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"He was.\" she then turned to Mrs Vance. \"The Agency may be after my daughter and I for my involvement with the Problem Child Gang twenty years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible.\" admitted Mrs Vance. \"You did help us in your own mysterious ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to join the new gang?\" offering her hand to me, Lyssa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to the cards, causing her to frown slightly, before I turned back to her. \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It may look like a dance but believe me, it is a powerful and effective fighting style.

Each descendant has two of these powers to guide them. You have magic and stamina where Susan has magic and agility.\" she smiled. \"I also drew the Two of Cups card, showing a good chance for a relationship with Susan but the King and Queen of wands over that suggests you get closer to her with caution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Madam Vague.\" startling mom and I a voice said. \"You usually always get the drop on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe turned to find Mrs Tanner standing before us with a towel draped over her shoulders. \"It's good to see you are finally learning, Amanda.\" smiling back, mom said. \"My daughter has discovered her path, I'm guiding her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lilith.\" startling me, Susan said behind me. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around but saw no one there. \"Sue?\" looking around, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Sue appeared from nowhere in front of me, smiling. \"My parents have the coolest ancestry.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do mine.\" smiling back I said.

Fortunately, the rest of us knew about it already, so the police were ready to take him down before he could fire a shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes got wide at the news of a foiled school shooting. \"How did you find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From Cait. She's got telepathy, and she can see a little bit into the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not as far as your Tarot cards,\" Mrs. Tanner added, \"but she can see with greater clarity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got quite the group,\" I said. \"How about our homeroom teacher?

But she broke free of them. Since then, she can make herself bigger or smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Mom said, \"it was good seeing you again, Amanda, but I should probably get Lilith back in bed. We wouldn't want her to be bleary-eyed on her second day of school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went back outside and, after a goodbye hug from Mrs. Tanner (and a goodbye hug and kiss from Susan), we flew back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething kept me from getting back to sleep, however. I couldn't help thinking about what powerful members we had in our new Problem Child Gang. Nature doesn't like wasting things, and we had enough power to hold off an army.

It took me several minutes but I wanted to look my best for Susan when we tell the others we were going on our first official date after school. I had just grabbed my long black cloak, as it was chilly out, and was about to walk out of my room when I heard the sound of the door being broken open, we were being invaded! My first thought was to hide and call 911 but I heard mom scream and I dashed out into the open, grabbing my Tarot deck on the way out. Why I did that, I had no clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" worried, I called. \"Mom, are you okay!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith, run!\" hysterical, mom yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic struck me as I saw two men dressed in military fatigues and ski masks came into view with what I recognized as tranquilizer guns. \"Olivia Wallace, come quietly or we will take you by force.\" serious, the first man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not my name.\" backing away, I protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter.\" equally as serious, the second man said. \"Consider yourself property of the Agency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I was really panicked. I read about the Agency in the graphic novel, Problem Child Gang. They were a quasi government organization that used children and teens as their soldiers in a push to change the world to their liking. Out of desperation, I drew a card from my Tarot Deck. I expected the two men to smile at such a move only they backed away a few steps as if they had seen it before. I drew the Magician and threw it at the first man, hoping to distract them enough to run for safety. Only, to my surprise, the card glowed for a second before a man in a red robe appeared between me and the men. He waved his hand and two doors on either side of the hall violently opened. One hit the first man in the face while the other hit the second man in the back, rendering them both unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run, child!\" commanded the magician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not hesitate; I ran from the two fallen men to find mom. Unknown to me, the magician vanished, the card appearing in a random spot in my deck. Upon finding mom, I saw her standing over two unconscious men with a man in a knight's armor at her side. \"Thank you, Knight of swords.\" grateful, mom said. \"Your services are greatly appreciated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an honor to serve, my lady.\" bowing, the knight replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the knight vanished, the card flying back into a random spot in her deck. Mom then turned to me and sighed. \"I told you to run, Lilith.\" scolding, she said. \"Why didn't you listen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was cut off.\" tearing up, I replied. \"That and I won't leave you to fend for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nmom sighed again then smiled. \"Well, I'm glad to see you have discovered the true power of the cards.\" pointing to my glowing deck, she said. \"As long as you have faith in them, they will always protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can we do now, mom?\" still shaken, I asked. \"These guys are only the first of many if they work for the Agency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These people were just a scouting party, to force our hand.\" frowning, mom replied. \"Note the cameras, strapped to their heads, their superiors now have a better idea of what we are capable of and send someone who can deal with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to relocate then.\" wincing, I said. \"I have read about these people, they are relentless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we.\" nodding, mom replied. \"That was how we defeated them the last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, as if the think, then took up a telephone and dialed a number. \"Tex, this is Madame Vague.\" serious, she said. \"Yes, my daughter and I were attacked as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI listened to mom talking to Tex, the mighty on the telephone; only I had no idea who he really was. After a moment, mom ended the call and turned to me. \"You have ten minutes to pack two bags, Lilith.\" serious, she said. \"Pack only what is necessary to have, we'll come back for more, if needed, later.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ten minutes later, I had two bags packed with what I thought was essential and walked to the front door where I met mom with two bags of her own. \"I'm going to miss this house.\" tearfully, I said. \"Do we have to move away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll return to this house, sweetie.\" gently, mom replied. \"For now, however, we need to live somewhere else.\" she gave me a knowing smile. \"The S.U.B. station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes went wide, hearing that. The Subterranean Urban Base station was only mentioned once in the eighth book of the series but there was no mention of exactly what or where it was. \"You know about that place?\" surprised, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I helped build it.\" giggling, mom replied. \"My coven and I, that is.\" she sighed. \"We helped under the promise we would be able to hold our meetings there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is um... Tex coming to pick us up?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is.\" seriousness returning to her eyes, mom said. \"Bear in mind, he is of the original group, show respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, three squad cars came to a halt in front of my house and a number of officers jumped out, running for the house with the chief of police, Ted Jones among them. \"Are you injured, Mrs Wallace?\" concerned, Mr Jones asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just shaken, Ted.\" sighing, mom replied. \"How are the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same.\" serious, Ted replied. \"Were moving everyone who was attacked to a substation where they will be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Chief Jones was Tex the mighty!?\"</i> surprised, I thought. <i>\"Well, that explains Garth's strength.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and I were quickly lead to Ted's squad car where I noticed that it was not your normal squad car. The equipment inside looked like something I might expect to find in a space shuttle. Seeing my expression as he got in, Ted smiled and explained, \"This is one of the many vehicles we used twenty years ago. All of this is old but its still cutting edge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, mom took the front passenger seat while I sat in the back before Ted drove off, towards the edge of the city. After a while, I looked out at the passing scenery, worried. \"Where exactly is this substation, Mr Jones?\" turning to the front, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will see.\" giving me a glance in the rear view mirror, Ted replied. he then turned to mom. \"Madam Vague, will you do the honors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom produced her Tarot deck and drew the Moon card. Instantly, the sky outside went from a morning light to a midnight dark, causing a scream to escape my lips. Before the shock could wear off, the car stopped and I looked again to find myself in an underground parking lot as the card slid itself back into mom's deck. This left me shaken and confused before mom stated, \"There is a normal way in but we are dealing with the Agency, we can not afford to leave anything to chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all stepped out and walked out onto a walkway where I discovered we were in what appeared to be a modified old subway station. Instead of tracks for trains, there were two roads for cars. I guessed that they went everywhere under the city with smaller stations that had secret ways to the surface. On either side of the two roads were several rooms that were originally made to serve shops. Only now, they served as a base of operations. Through a window in one of the rooms, I caught a glimpse of electronic equipment. Through another window, I spotted a gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Lilith Nightshade,\" smiling mom said, \"to the headquarters of the new Problem Child Gang.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was especially glad to see Mel, coming back as she was from a cancer scare. \"They're sure they got it all,\" she assured us. \"I'm just going through additional chemo to make sure it doesn't come back too soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to have you back,\" I told her. \"And, Julie, the fangs look good.\" Julie had talked her parents into spending $300 to get a set of fangs made from dental-grade acrylic. She planned to wear them until lunch, or until a teacher told her to take them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty trippy about Lyssa, huh?\" Julie asked. \"Any guesses how she turned into a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magick,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay not to know, Lil,\" Mel said. \"Jules just asked for a guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't guessing.

Who doesn't want to know if love will last? I shuffled under the table, so nobody would see the cards flying around. \"I'll do a three-card spread,\" I explained as I brought the cards up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This first card will represent you,\" I said, turning it over. \"The Empress. She symbolizes abundance, creation, and fertility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed hard. \"My ancestor had 14 children. I seem to be taking after her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"Well, this card means you probably won't need medical help when you decide to have children. However, if you don't want to get pregnant, you'll need to take matters into your own hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, I turned over a card for Garth. \"Strength. The big cats symbolize the practical, assertive, or even aggressive side of his nature. The woman signifies a strong feminine influence. Under her guidance, he finds a peace and power he's never imagined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last card represented their future together. \"The Ten of Cups. The dog and cat symbolize unconditional love. The blazing hearth symbolizes warmth, comfort, and safety. The ten chalices represent the emotions and relationships that will bring you to this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa smiled. \"So, things will work out between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what he wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all turned when Mel spoke. \"When Mom found out she was pregnant, my dad said he was heading out for a carton of cigarettes. That's the last anyone saw or heard from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuch. Mel had never talked about her home life. It had never occurred to me that she'd had things so rough. \"I'm sorry, Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"It's really hurt with the cancer. Mom said my college fund was eaten up by my medical bills. I don't know what I'm going to do when I finish high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody expected Cait Spencer to show up at our table. \"What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of schooling did you want after high school?\" Cait replied. \"Find out how much it'll cost, and I'll pay for it. I didn't mean to interrupt, but I came to tell Lyssa something, and I couldn't help overhearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't do that,\" Mel said. \"I'd never be able to pay you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" was Cait's reply. \"Do you know how many millions I'd have to give you before I started to feel it? Don't worry about the money. I've learned it's like fertilizer: Spread it around, and beautiful things come to light. Keep it in one place, and everyone knows where you live, but everybody thinks you stink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were all floored by Cait's generosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa was the next to speak. \"What did you want to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. You're not going to believe this, but Amber McReady wants to see both of us after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What does she want to see me for? Did she say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't say. Don't worry, though. She knows we're cousins, and she knows I won't let anything happen to you, if I can stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if I didn't know that Cait was telepathic, I could tell that she knew more than she was saying. A glance at Lyssa showed that she knew no more than any of us what lay in store at Amber's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went back to my lunch.

Cait ran forward and thrust her hand forward; an invisible force reduced the door to splinters. We all ran inside to find a man kicking and punching Amber all around the living room with her vainly struggling against him. Acting quickly, I pulled a card from my deck; it was the Knight of Swords. \"Knight of Swords, defend Amber McReady!\" tossing the card, I commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a puff of smoke and a knight on a horse appeared on the front lawn before it took off after a black van with tinted windows. \"What...\" puzzled, I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You commanded the knight to defend Amber McReady!\" her eyes widening, Cait said. \"That's not her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the man stopped attacking the girl and landed a punch onto Cait, sending her stumbling as the girl suddenly went after Lyssa, throwing kicks and chops in too quick of succession for her to use her speed. All she could do was dodge and back away, looking for room to move. I turned to my deck to pull another card to help but someone grabbed me from behind, forcing a foul smelling cloth over my nose and mouth. <i>\"Shit, its chloroform!\"</i> panicked, I thought. <i>\"I have to get free before it overtakes me!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to drop my deck to gain a free hand to struggle with but mom's words filled my mind... <i>I'm glad to see you have discovered the true power of the cards. As long as you have faith in them, they will always protect you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I have faith in the cards...\" </i> feeling my consciousness slipping, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my last ounce of strength, I drew a card and threw it. There was a puff of some before a tall and beautiful woman in sparkling ropes appeared; it was the High Priestess! \"Release that child or great peril will await you.\" in a melodious voice, she warned. \"This is your only warning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, either stunned by her appearance, or floored by her beauty, slowly released me and I felt an iron clad hand pulling me out into the fresh air before I heard the clang ans crunch of metal hitting bone. \"Amber McReady is in safe hands, my lady.\" came a strong male voice. \"However, I fear 'she' is no more and 'he' is born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough of a shock to pull me out of the chloroform induced trance and I sat up to find a man I did not recognize in James' uniform. \"He has to be a minion from the Agency.\" stunned, I whispered. \"Only how did they fool Cait's telepathy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then turned to see a traumatized teenage boy wearing girl's jeans and tank-top. Although the person was clearly male, I recognized the facial features. \"Amber... Is that you!?\" almost whispering, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy slowly nodded, tears forming. \"Yeah, its me.\" on the verge of tears, Amber replied. \"I- I heard this happened to Alyssa and I'm hoping she knew what is causing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped. \"Alyssa, Cait!\" I ran into the house as the knight of swords and the High Priestess vanished from sight and paused, stunned. Lyssa had the girl shaking from convolutions with super speed kicks to every part of her body, pined to the wall by the force of her blows. Cait was smiling, standing over a the man who had attacked her as he sat on the floor, babbling like a newborn baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyssa, that's enough!\" touching my deck, I yelled. \"She's had it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, I feared that Lyssa had lost it and would kill the girl but she stopped immediately, allowing the girl to slide to the floor, moaning. \"I wasn't hitting her hard.\" limping towards me, she protested. \"The first thing she attacked was my legs, I couldn't kick with my full strength if I tried right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their trying to weaken us.\" fearful, I mussed. \"I had to use two cards at once to protect Amber and myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyssa's jaw dropped in shock. \"Is that... Amber!?\" stunned, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so.\" wincing, I replied. \"She's hoping we can help her figure out what's causing this.\" I then quickly added, \"There's more, James was not our driver. It was someone else and he managed to get close, too close, without any of us realizing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not good.\" shaking her head, Cait said. \"We can't stay here.\" she then turned to Amber. \"I'm afraid you will have to come with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we going to get to... where ever we are going?\" curious, Amber asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she moaned slightly then sighed as her body changed back into a girl before their eyes. \"I'm back...\" relief in her voice, she said. \"I'm beautiful again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCait sighed then pulled out her cellphone and dialed a number. A moment later, someone picked up. As it was on speakerphone, we all heard James' voice. \"James here...\" in a strained voice, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James. are you okay, you're not injured or anything?\" urgently, Cait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a bump on the head.\" after a moan, James replied. \"Where are you, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fine but we need pick up, bring the fastest car you can snag.\" she gave the address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she ended the call, I turned to Amber. \"This is not over.\" firmly but kindly, I said as Lyssa called Garth's father, the police chief. \"Those goons will be back and, for whatever reason, they want you as badly as they want us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber gulped. \"But why!?\" trembling, she asked. \"What do I have anyone could possibly want!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what we have to figure out.\" seriously, I replied.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Did they hurt her!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be at peace, Tonya.\" calmly, mom said. \"Amber is just fine but Tex feels we should move her to the substation for her own protection.\" after a pause, she added, \"She is showing the signs of becoming a guardian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going through the change?\" surprised, Tonya asked. \"How far along is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just started, from what I can see.\" eying Amber, mom replied. she then gave me a glance and began to talk in a language I did not recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Not fair, mom.\"</i> pouting a little, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ending the call, mom turned to Ted who was returning from the house.

Once inside, mom closed the door and motioned us to sit down. We did so and mom sat down with us before taking a breath. \"First, your mother and I have been friends since childhood, Amber.\" serious, she began. \"We never introduced this to either of you because you were not yet ready to join the sisterhood.\" pausing, she added, \"That and we firmly believe everyone must make their own paths in life, we can only guide you and hope you make the right choices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Mrs...\" Amber began to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Madame Vague.\" smiling, mom said. \"Its too formal to call me Ms Wallace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it was Mrs Hastings.\" confused, Amber said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My husband is not the best in the world but he is still my husband.\" sadly, mom said. \"To protect him, I take on my maiden name in public and Madame Vague when among the new gang.\" she sighed. \"What is your question, child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you say I was close to becoming a Guardian.\" uneasy, Amber replied. \"What is that and does it have anything to do with me changing into a guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a long story, Amber.\" sighing, mom replied. she took strange colored candle from a nearby table and lit it with a wave of her hand. \"Look into the flame and your answer will be told.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber and I both looked into the flame and soon found ourselves in a trance as images and sounds filled our minds...<br>\r\n=========================<br>\r\n\"Ho, sisters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew of the Amazonian fishing boat all responded to the lookout's cry. They took positions, expecting nothing, ready for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could have been anything, from a shark to an enemy vessel. What it was, however, was a raft, ill-suited for a voyage as long as was needed for it to reach this far. The Amazons approached the raft, and, peering over their own ship's rail, studied the raft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the raft was a young boy, burned by the sun, weak from hunger and thirst. Strangely, he was clad in the robes of a female. Why should a man dress as a woman? Moved by empathy and curiosity, they brought the boy onto their boat. Back on their island, the Amazons began nursing him back to health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had recovered enough to speak, the Amazon queen herself went to speak to him. \"Greetings, young traveler,\" she said. \"I am Antiope, Queen of the Amazons. Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy bowed his head. \"I am Iolaus, Your Majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well met, Iolaus. We found you adrift on the sea, and in a woman's robes. How came you into such dire straits, and why were you dressed so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I scarce can explain myself, Your Majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Iolaus, try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I like to wear such things. I know not why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. What put you on that raft?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The people of my city. My... dress offended them greatly. Some of them wanted to kill me outright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What stayed their hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They feared that the gods might think me an offering. If that happened, the gods would discover my true nature, and might be angered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear not, Iolaus. I have given the command that you are not to be harmed. I will direct my people to see if there is a way that we might help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Iolaus could walk again, he was brought to the temple. There, he was bound to the altar, as the Amazon priestesses performed a strange ritual over him. Finally, the chief priestess unbound Iolaus, and led the traveler out of the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Amazons, even Queen Antiope, were stunned. Iolaus was now a young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sisters,\" cried the chief priestess, \"I give you Iole, our new sister.\" And so Iole became known as the Twice-Named.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Iole settled into life as an Amazon, it became clear that she had found favor with the gods. She could run faster than the eye could follow. She could outdistance any prey she chose. And, in the heat of battle, she could pluck an arrow in flight, as easily as fruit from a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, she bore fourteen daughters and sons. When the time came for her to go to the Elysian Fields, at the end of her life, all the Amazons mourned her passing.....<br>\r\n==============================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the images and sounds left us, returning us to the small room, mom sighed. \"Iole's daughters, granddaughters, and so on, changed genders to become guardians where her sons, grandsons, and so on did the same to become Amazon warriors, such as Alyssa Vance.\" she said. \"In Alyssa's case, she gained super speed and agility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But.. what is a Guardian?\" pressed Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one child in each generation changes.\" seemingly ignoring Amber, mom replied.  \"Chief Jones, or 'Tex the mighty', was a Guardian. You read the graphic novels; he had incredible strength, natural resistance to small arms fire; near invulnerability to pain...\" she smiled. \"Chief Jones did not know the truth of his power, thus he never fully discovered it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped. \"Chief Jones was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"He was originally Tia Jones before he had his change upon reaching puberty.\" smiling, she replied. she then became serious. \"I have been intrusted to keep that a well guarded secret, do not betray my trust in you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber and I quickly nodded. \"It won't leave this room.\" serious, I promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a word of this, I promise.\" not wanting to risk a witch's wrath, Amber said. she then teared up. \"Am I really going to become a guy for life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am sorry.\" softly, mom replied. \"However, you will be a boy of incredible power, like Alyssa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will help you all we can.\" turning to Amber, I said. I offered my hand. \"Friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber paused but then hesitantly took my hand and shook it. \"Acquaintances.\" sighing, she said. \"We'll work up to friends, fair enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed myself. \"Yeah, fair enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom then rose from her seat. \"We will talk about this more later.\" she said. \"Chief Jones is waving us to him. I believe he wishes to show us something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Ted wish to show everyone?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I guessed that, since the Moon card teleported us to the S.U.B. Station, she was using the Sun card to bring us to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light faded, we were standing in the Vance living room, as a horde of Agents ran roughshod over the place. \"Everyone, pick an opponent,\" Ted commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't have too long to decide, as two of the bad guys came after me. \"You must be the troublemaker from before,\" said one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stand still, missy,\" said the other. \"We'll make this short and painless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't sound good to me, so I drew a card: Justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Agents were startled by the sudden appearance of two women right in front of them. \"Thou art weighed in the balance,\" said one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And found wanting,\" added the other, as she brought her sword down upon their weapons, destroying them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they stood staring at their now useless firearms, I drew another card: Strength. Now, the Agents also had to deal with a lion, a tiger, and a leopard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick up brass!\" called one of the Agents. They all activated devices on their wrists and disappeared, leaving only the ruined weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody okay?\" I called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks that way,\" Ted said. \"Hey, we scored a bonus. When these guns were chopped, it must have damaged whatever lets them teleport. We can finally get a look at their tech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sent someone disguised as me,\" Lyssa said, rubbing her hand. \"Her problem was, she moved too slowly. A few dozen punches per second, and she didn't see them coming.\" Her attention turned to the former Amber. \"Thanks for the help, Amber. Though it sounds funny calling you that at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I'll think of something,\" he said. \"I guess I'm finding out what life was like for you, huh? Sorry I was such a pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like they say, what doesn't kill me makes me stronger,\" Lyssa replied, as she gave Amber a hug. \"Thanks again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Boy, you smell nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks, but I already have a boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" he said, breaking up the hug. \"Guess I've got a lot to get used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention, everyone,\" Ted called. \"Given the current situation, we think it's best that we all relocate to the S.U.B. Station until things blow over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got the phone tree started,\" Mrs. Vance added. \"So, for those of you already at the station, you're all going to have company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's cell phone rang, and he checked it. \"Cassie,\" she said. \"We usually get together about this time, but I'm not at my house. And if she went there, she's probably seen what a wreck it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me talk to her,\" Ted said. \"Hello? Hello, Cassie, this is Chief Jones. Yes, we're aware of what happened at Amber's house. She and her family are safe, and they've been relocated. I'll see that she gets your call, and I'm sure that she'll return it as soon as possible. Just remember that she's going through a lot right now. More than you know. Alright. Goodbye.\" He returned Amber's phone to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Amber said. \"Now I just have to figure out how to explain all this to her. When I change back, it won't be all the way. Who knows what I'll look or sound like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe start with texting,\" I suggested. \"Let her know as much as you're comfortable with. She will need to know what's happening to you, though. If you were to keep it secret from her, she'd want to know where her friend went, and where this guy came from.\"</span></div></div>",

I certainly did not relish the thought of living too close, in a confined space, to someone who needed his diaper changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next group to arrive was Susan and her family. \"Everybody OK?\" her father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few of us are shaken up,\" I replied, taking the opportunity to hug Susan, \"but nobody's hurt. From what I've seen, we've got plenty of space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll need it,\" Susan said. \"You know that Asian girl who just started at our school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Narrow face, close-set eyes, high cheekbones, doesn't talk to anybody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan nodded. \"Her name's Mindy Saotome. Dad's done some checking, and he thinks she and I might be related. Apparently, her maternal grandmother and my paternal grandfather were brother and sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the best circumstances for a family reunion,\" Mr. Tanner said, \"but they'll have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll need to think of some way to explain this to Mel and Julie,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever brings them down here,\" Ted said. \"It's a cinch the Agency will come after them, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw another group coming in. \"Who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed looked. \"Looks like the Rodgers family, and they've got somebody with them. Not to worry; we figured we'd need to accommodate a lot of people, and we've got the space.\"</span></div></div>",

I watched with growing interest as she shuffled them with one hand then threw them into the air. My first reaction was to look down at the floor but I was in for a surprise when the cards flew about on their own beforer arranging themselves as if she were reading my fortune on a table!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...\" Nervous, I began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, child.\" Quickly, mom scolded. \"In a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched, increasingly nervous as mom viewed the cards. \"Someone is in grave danger.\" Finally, she said. \"Two children, a boy and a girl; siblings.\" She turned to me, her expression dark. \"Come to me, Lilith. I need to hear what they are saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, I hesitated. Only I had become morbidly curious and walked to mom's side where she moved the cards around with a wave of her hand. As she did, I began to hear the two voices more clearly. Was mom moving the cards like a dial on a radio to get a better signal? I jumped upon hearing the voices clearly. \"Right there!\" Instinctively, I announced. \"I can hear them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me what you hear, Lilith.\" Firmly, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boy is Tommy and his sister is Aura.\" Listening, I said. \"They said they are prisoners of someone called The Agency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom frowned. \"That is not good.\" Darkly, she said. \"That is not good at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her hands and the cards flew back into a neat deck before she slammed them down onto the dinning room table. \"You can forget about going to summer school, young lady!\" Urgently, she said. \"I'll make arrangements for you to be schooled at home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had never seen this side of mom before, it was frightening. \"What's going on, mom?\" Wincing, i demanded. \"You are scaring me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm scared too, dear.\" Her face softening, mom replied. \"I will explain everything in a moment but right now, I need to make a phone call.\" She paused, seeing me shake my head. I had always done this when I was close to going into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please mom...\" Trembling, I begged. \"What is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Remember that graphic novel series you love so much, The Problem Child Gang?\" Cryptically, she asked. I nodded to which she nodded back. \"It's non fiction, dear. I was the mysterious girl the gang knew as Madam Vague.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped at that. \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom ignored me, grabbing a cellphone I had not seen her use before.

This was the closest I could get to a normal life, having to concentrate 24 hours a day, seven days a week to make sure people don't forget who I am. My powers are linked to my emotional state. I can use them on demand, but if I get stressed or angry, they can flare up on their own. The only people who have the slightest clue who I am are British intelligence, and even they only know what they can from observing me, which, if I don't wish to be observed, is very hard to do. I looked around at the kids walking around me, chattering amongst themselves as they walked to school. I kept my thoughts away from my nerves. If I got nervous, my powers would flare up, and I wouldn't even get to school without wiping peoples memories that I attended the school at all. My name is Kiera Stanley. I'm 17 years old and I really wish that was all. Unfortunately, it isn't. A few years ago, I developed powers, I don't know why, I don't know how, it just happened. I can create illusions, extremely powerful ones that make people think they're real. I also have memory altering and memory wiping abilities. I can change people's memories and wipe their memories of me, as if they never happened. I tried the super hero thing a few times, always wiping memories of me from the minds of the bad guys. I've forgotten my real name, when I got my powers, I lost everything coming up to that point. You want super powers? You want to be a hero, and save the world?

Block three connected to the dining hall and the entrance to the block was the corridor connecting them. My friend Gina was sitting on a bench that ran the length of the corridor. Floor to ceiling windows were on either side of the corridor, showing the rare, clear blue skies and sun. <br>\r\n\"Hey Gina,\" I said, hugging her as was the social convention among good friends \"Did you get that English assignment done for Mr Dalton?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've done it,\" said Gina \"What did you write about?\" <br>\r\nI had written about a princess in a fairytale kingdom. It really helped with English assignments to be able to create illusions and see what it really looked like in that kingdom. It was all just my imagination, of course, but still, it did make things easier. <br>\r\n\"I wrote a bit of fantasy,\" I said \"You know, the generic fairytale kingdom with princess in it, but with the twist that the princess is the hero and has to save the kingdom from a dark wizard.\" <br>\r\n\"That's certainly unconventional,\" said Gina \"I'll look forward to reading it.\" <br>\r\nI hate lying to Gina about my real identity, but really, it doesn't matter if she knows or not, as at any moment, I could make her forget me, and any day, I might be called away from this school on another assignment. Besides, revealing that I work for British Intelligence could get me locked away for breaching contract. I could break out, of course, and erase anybody's memory I was ever there at all, but I like to think that I'm doing some good by working with them. </span></div></div>",

He wasn't a bad teacher, his voice just sounded so boring that his class was put to sleep just by the sound of it. The only way to stay awake in his class, for me at least, was to create illusions nobody else could see and watch them while listening to him. So for some reason, I was passing his class, but just barely. Second period, I had to sit through a period of maths. I wasn't that bad at maths, but my class was really unruly, and it was hard to concentrate on anything. I've been asking for work to do at home to catch up with work that was interrupted too much. I know that it probably won't matter, I'll probably mess up and have to wipe the memories of everyone in the school before I sit the exam. Still, I wanted to do this properly, if I was going to live a normal life. After second period, we had break, fifteen minutes of talking with Gina and a few other friends. French followed break, which I excelled at, I had been on several missions to France where I had to blend in with the locals, and that required I speak fluent French. French was followed by English, where I handed in my unorthodox fairytale story. Mr Dalton was really impressed, and Gina, who read it before I handed it in, also said it was really good. I felt pride at their compliments. Even if I had a bit of a cheat with my illusory powers, I still thought of English as my favourite subject. After English was lunch. I ate in the school canteen, where the extent of school dinners was either a burger, a pizza or a vegetarian option (usually a veggie burger). I ate my burger, talked a bit with Gina, then, when lunch was over, we had PE. I usually had to slack off in PE. My secret agent training would have given me an unfair advantage if I had participated in any of the activities. The final class of the day was Information Technology, which I spent checking emails, going on Facebook and updating my stories on writing.com. I had hacked computers to get into top secret facilities, the work given in this subject wasn't challenging enough for me. After sixth period, I left to go home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day had been pretty uneventful, as I walked into the house I shared with my eighteen year old sister Callie. We had lived with our parents, but they were going through a rough time, they had filed for divorce, and everyday, I was kept up with the screaming at each other. So, my sister Callie had suggested I come and live with her, for a while at least, until the whole thing blew over. I walked into the living room, where Callie was sitting, and sat down on the couch next to her. </span></div></div>",

She seems to be immune to my powers, so the only time I can fully relax is when I'm with her. <br>\r\n\"It can't be helped,\" said Callie \"If there was anything I could do, to lessen the burden you've been forced to carry, I would do it.\" <br>\r\nI put my arm on her shoulder, smiling \"You've already done a lot for me,\" I said \"Just by giving me a place where I can relax, where I don't have to concentrate to tell people who I am, with you, I can just be me, without having to force myself, my very existence into people's minds, this power is driving me mad.\" <br>\r\nCallie put her arms around me. \"It's all right, sis,\" she said \"I'm here for you, I'd like to tell you that things will get better, but the truth is, I have no idea if that's true or not, I wish I could give you better reassurance, but all I can do is be here for you, no matter what.\" <br>\r\n\"That's more than enough for now,\" I said \"I really hope, in the future, you can do more for me, I hope for an end to this curse.\" <br>\r\n\"Your powers are not a curse, you know, I read a news article from the US, there's a group there called the Problem Child Gang that live in Waterfront City, they've all got abilities, like yours, there was evidently a cover up, but what happened there, it was huge, I found scraps of evidence, police files, there's very little even there, I suspect that the gang have an associate in the police force there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie was extremely good with computers. She could hack into any system anywhere on the planet from our house with simple, everyday technology. Her technological genius was what had gotten her on the British Secret Services radar. Although she tried to mask her presence by going through several different servers, someone in the Service was very persistent, they had traced it to our house. She really didn't want to go to them, so I offered myself up to the service. When they remember me, I'm a top agent in their organisation, when not, they forget Callie too, because she's connected to me, I've worked out how to use my curse to our advantage, I do a bit of work for the Service now and again, just in case they track down Callie again, and they leave us alone for the most part. If there's anything of note, Callie usually lets me know. That's the thing about computer traces, they can always be reversed, back to the source, Callie was one of the best hackers in the world, she traced the tracer back to the source and placed a hidden bug in the very tracer program they were using to trace her, it picked up anything of note happening in the British Secret Service, I would go to school during the week, and take assignments in the surrounding area on weekends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another pet project?\" I asked \"You've got to stop hacking people for the fun of it, Callie, It's already gotten you in trouble, what if this Problem Child Gang traces you back here?\" <br>\r\nCallie responds with...</span></div></div>",

Apparently, during the times of Ancient Egypt, many of the people were afraid of the sea, except for one, an adventurer by the name of Shaggoth. With a small crew of adventurers, he sailed across the sea and the Ancient Egyptians had pronounced him dead, believing he had fallen off the edge of the world. However, he had in fact arrived at an island off the north coast of Scotland called Orkney, where he and his crew were shipwrecked during a storm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evidence that brought myself and my father to Orkney was found recently in the Parish churches oldest documents, which suggested that when Shaggoth died, he was buried in a hidden tomb which was also said to contain all his treasures, including the Jewel of Life, a priceless magical jewel that was supposedly able to make someone invulnerable. Not that I believed the stories, magic didn't exist after all, but as every good archaeologist knows, all legends and tales have a basis in truth. It was entirely possible that there was a tomb filled with priceless artifacts, probably not the Jewel of Life, but still something that could be sold to museums for us to make a living. My dad had gone into old Orkney records and found the place where the ship Shaggoth had taken to Orkney had been wrecked, and, using records of his lifetime, had narrowed down the location of the tomb until only one remained, a hidden door somewhere on the top of this hill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knelt down on the hill, looking for odd stones, areas of dead grass, anything that might lead us into the tomb. </span></div></div>",

It illuminated grooves in the surface of the stone. As I examined each of the stones, I recognised Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. The stones were the key to the tomb. The tomb would open after I rearranged the stones into the central line in the passcode. <br>\r\n\"Found the key,\" I said \"Get over here, we gotta work out how to open it.\" <br>\r\nDad followed me over to the stones.

I slid down the wall ten feet, cutting myself several times on the uneven contours of the wall. I didn't feel any of it, I was unconscious. Harry landed easier than I had, having slowed himself down using his bag, he jumped out of the tube and landed on the ground without trouble. As soon as he saw the unconscious form of his daughter, he ran over to check her. Although he knew her wounds looked worse than they were, he knew that without treatment in this place, she could get infected and die. She couldn't be left there. He grunted as he lifted her up and gently dropped her over his shoulder, then continued.<br>\r\nIt didn't take him long to find the entrance to the tomb. Gold and jewelled boxes lined shelves on the walls while in the centre of the room, was the tomb itself. As he looked upon it, a strange, green mist seemed to seep out of the sides of the coffin. It was a man, in Ancient Egyptian clothing. <br>\r\n\"I have waited for millennia for someone to find this place,\" said the voice, booming \"Do not look surprised, Harry Harley, you know who I am, I am Shaggoth.\" <br>\r\n\"Why are you still here?\" asked Harry \"Why does your spirit linger here after death, and why can I see you?\" <br>\r\n\"Restless spirits cannot be seen by just anyone,\" agreed Shaggoth \"But my spirit is tied to this existence by the Jewel of Life, therefore, I am not an ordinary restless spirit, I cannot rest until the Jewel is claimed by someone else.\" <br>\r\n\"And you think I am that person?\" asked Harry <br>\r\n\"Not you,\" said Shaggoth \"Your daughter, she must bond with the jewel, take it and give it to her.\" <br>\r\nShaggoth waved his hand over his tomb. A compartment in the side opened, revealing an egg-sized red jewel. <br>\r\n\"Do not touch it,\" said Shaggoth \"The jewel can only be touched by one worthy of holding its power, unworthy will be burned.\" <br>\r\nHarry put on a glove and picked up the jewel, placing it in his daughter's bare hand. The moment the jewel touched her, the cuts and scrapes on her arms and the bump on her head healed up and as she woke up, the ghost of Shaggoth vanished. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For a while at least, we had no assignments, so dad had decided to send me to regular school for a few months. I had been home schooled for most of my life due to my father's lifestyle. Before we had left Orkney, Dad had gotten me a pendant with a compartment big enough to hold the jewel inside it. It was rather big and clunky, but I resolved to get used to it. I had to keep the jewel near me, as we weren't sure how far away I could be from it, as it was bounded to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe would be staying with a family friend, one I had never met, but I was told she was nice. She had a daughter about the same age as me, and I would be going to the same school as her for the duration of our stay. I was told her name was Gina. Her and her mother, Tina had been living alone after her dad died a few years earlier. Dad had offered to pay some of the bills for her, we made a lot of money we couldn't do anything with most of the time, after all, but she refused unless she could do something for us too. Now, Dad wanted me to have an experience of regular school, just to see if I preferred a stable life rather than trekking across the world with him, being home schooled. I had to admit, I was curious what it would be like to be a 'regular' school kid for once. Now, thanks to my experiences with the gem, I wasn't even sure I would be classed as a 'regular' person. I just hope Gina doesn't judge me for it. I'll keep it a secret from everyone else, but if I was going to be living in the same house, I couldn't keep it from Tina and Gina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boat docked. Dad thanked the boatman that had offered to ferry us across, and left the boat, with me following him. It would not be until a few weeks later, after we had hitchhiked inland to a small burgh in Midlothian called Dalkeith that we began to near our destination. It was a small house with a single garage in a quiet, suburban area of the town. We walked up to the door and knocked.   </span></div></div>",

The hallway of the house was small. It had stairs leading to a second floor and two doors, one leading to the kitchen, one to the living room. <br>\r\n\"Mum!\" shouted Gina, \"Your friends are here.\" <br>\r\nA woman stuck her head round the kitchen door.

A girl with average height and long, auburn hair stood in the doorway. She was dressed in hiking clothes and boots.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Abigail Stanley?\" asked the girl. \"My name is Beth Vance, I was asked to come here by Shaggoth, the ghost that gave you the red jewel... there is a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of problem?\" asked Gina, a little defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, I examined the girl. She didn't seem to pose a threat, nothing I couldn't handle anyway, growing up in the Wilderness following my father around had toughened my body and mind.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Come on in,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gina, is there a room where we could go?\" politely, Beth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina led the two of us upstairs and into a bedroom.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"This will be yours while you stay with us,\" said Gina \"Don't worry, we've got more room than we know what to do with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Gina,\" I replied \"Leave us alone for an hour or two.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Good luck,\" said Gina, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What do you mean a spirit?\" I asked, turning my attention to Beth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Viking spirit within your gem, the one who died on Orkney, he wasn't the only spirit inside the gem,\" serious, Beth said Beth \"Shaggoth told me that each time a bearer of the gem dies, their spirit becomes trapped within the gem. If they had power, that power would be granted to the next person who gains the power of the gem. However, all this power comes with a cost and a risk. Not all the spirits within the gem are good, some are evil. A few will try to possess you for different reasons, try to make you do things you don't want to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One may try to possess you to offer his or her sword fighting skills.\" softly, Beth replied. \"This will come in handy in a fight.\" she then frowned. \"Others will try to possess you so to force a swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A- A swap?\" startled, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You become part of the gem and they live again, as you.\" to my horror, Beth replied. \"The gen is very powerful but all power comes with a cost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do?\" worried, I asked. \"The gem is a part of me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth sighed. \"Look, the power this gem could give you may be very helpful, but if the wrong spirit takes over during a fight, it could be deadly.\" looking at me, Beth said. \"All I ask is that you allow me to help you tune out the evil spirits so they can not take you over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you just purge them from the gem?\" hopeful, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that powerful.\" serious, Beth said. \"This gem gives you the power and wisdom of all those who had been blessed with it in the past. The gem is not good or evil, just those who make use of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would this do to me?\" I asked \"If I tune out the evil spirits, I lose their power and wisdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite.\" smiling slightly, Beth said. \"The good spirits will simply become dominant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In battle, they will lend you their power and knowledge, but they will not possess you outright.\" serious, Beth replied. \"The evil spirits will still lend you their wisdom and strength but they will not be able to take control unless you allow it.\" she then rose a finger of warning. \"Abigail, you must guard the gem, as if anyone manages to kill you, your spirit too will be trapped within the gem. If you die a natural death, the power of the gem will be broken and all the spirits will go free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't you let all the spirits free now?\" I asked \"Why wait until I die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't work that way!\" slightly annoyed, Beth replied. \"The spirits cling to the gem and to it's wielder. Even if I had the power to release them, getting rid of just one spirit will put strain on your body!\" she sighed. \"You wouldn't survive getting rid of all of them and then you will be one with the gem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth took my hand. \"You have to take the good with the bad, Abigail.\" more calmly, she said. \"I will help you tune out the spirits who are evil and help you get into contact with those who are good.\" she then looked me in the eye and added, \"I can only hope that you will be able to use this power responsibly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then,\" I said \"Let's talk to some ghosts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each of the lights seemed to go to a space in the room and expand, changing into different people wearing different clothes. Some looked like Japanese Samurai, others looked like ninjas, their faces covered by black masks. There was even one carrying a bow. I was so busy looking at these solidifying ghosts, that I didn't see the red-coloured ghost coming at me from behind. It would have possessed me, forcing me into the gem, if Beth had not noticed it, blocking it's path, she punched it to the ground. <br>\r\nI turned and I wasn't sure what was weirder, that Beth's fist had made contact with the incorporeal ghost, or that her impact seemed to have left a mark on the ghost. <br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" I asked<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Beth \"This one is an evil ghost, it was going to possess you, I meant to block it, it wouldn't be able to possess me, it can only possess the holder of the gem, but it felt solid to me, nothing like a ghost should, how I've never been able to feel ghosts before.\" <br>\r\n\"What should I do?\" I asked \"If you hadn't been here, I would have already been possessed.\" <br>\r\n\"Talk to the good spirits,\" said Beth \"They're over there, I tried to filter out the bad ones, but I guess one got lucky, I'll keep blocking the bad ones from leaving the gem.\" <br>\r\nI nodded, and walked over to the half dozen ghosts that had left the gem. <br>\r\n\"Look,\" I said \"I think it's cruel and unjust that all of you have been trapped in this gem for so long, I wish that I could let you go free now, but apparently, that would only force me to join you in the gem, that wouldn't help anyone, so here's the deal, we work together, you stop the evil spirits inside the gem from taking me over, and lend me your skills and knowledge when needed, and if I die a natural death, the power of the gem will be broken, and you'll all go free, how does that sound to you?\" <br>\r\nThe archer spoke \"It sounds like a good deal to me,\" he said \"I vow to protect you from being possessed by the other spirits within the gem that is our prison.\" <br>\r\n\"As will I,\" said the ninja, pulling off the mask to reveal a female. <br>\r\n\"I will too,\" said the samurai. The three spirits vanished. This left three Vikings. The leader spoke first. <br>\r\n\"My name is Shaggoth, I was the last person to wield the gem, this is my father and grandfather, both former wielders, we were all slain in battle, so were unable to break the power of the gem, I am glad that there is finally a person who can break the curse and allow us all to go free.\" <br>\r\n\"I will do what I can to make sure you do get free,\" I said \"And if you lend me your skill in battle, I'm sure we'll be unstoppable.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure,\" said the spirit of Shaggoth, as he and his kindred faded into the white spirits, flying back into the gem. <br>\r\nAs soon as they had returned to the gem, Beth collapsed to the ground, panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right, Beth,\" I said, kneeling down on the floor next to her \"They're gone, by the way, how did you connect to that ghost?\" <br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" she said \"Like I said, that's never happened before, it's new, which worries me, last time my powers became more powerful, there was something big coming up, and I fear that now they are increasing again because something else is about to happen, something even worse than what happened before.\" <br>\r\n\"Your not making much sense,\" I said \"What happened before, and what do you think is going to happen now?\" <br>\r\n\"I guess I'll start at the beginning,\" said Beth \"Have you ever heard of the Problem Child Gang?\"  </span></div></div>",

I accessed my gem as I walked, allowing the energy from the spirits to flow through me as I surveyed the enemy. They all seemed to have guns, but the guns didn't seem to have ammo clips, they seemed to have what looked like batteries on them. They were stun guns, so they weren't trying to kill us, just disable us and take us in. I, again, looked through the spirits, and chose one simply called Thunderstrike. According to the memories I had accessed, he had the ability to absorb any energy damage that hit him, absorbing it to give him increased strength and durability. He could then fire this energy from his hands as beams of electrical energy. As I selected him, and his power flowed into me, and his knowledge flowed into my head, I saw Gina bring her hands up, and the two cannons appear where her hands were. A spiritual form seemed to rise up from Beth, forming into an old Amazon-looking woman holding a sword. Suddenly, three white spirits came from the gem around my neck, forming into a sword, shield, and helmet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>How did that happen?</i>\" I asked in my head. I heard Thunderstrike's voice reply-<br>\r\n\"<i>We spirits are able to summon anything we had on our person when we died,</i>\" he said \"<i>I thought they would be useful for this combat, no?</i>\"<br>\r\n\"<i>Perfect,</i>\" replied, smiling  as Thunderstrike guided my sword and shield into a combat-ready position.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I felt their energy flow into me as Thunderstrike ran towards the men shooting at us. I felt my body go faster than I'd ever felt it go before. It seemed the energy absorbed by Thunderstrike could also be used for increased speed. I made a mental note to ask him later what else I could do with his power. I sliced one of the men's weapons in half, knocking one on the other side to the ground with my shield, before slicing his weapon in half, too. I turned to continue fighting, as many of the men near me switched their guns for stun batons. The others continued to fire at Beth and Gina. I focused on fighting the half dozen men advancing on me with stun batons. I blocked one baton with my sword, feeling the energy flow through the sword and into me. I spun, slicing my sword through all six batons, then jumped, kicking two of my six opponents to the ground. I backed off, allowing the four that were still conscious to regroup. Before I could reengage, two blasts of orange energy came from my right, hitting two of the cars blocking our way. Both exploded, throwing the men forward onto the ground as I dropped onto the ground too. I may be immune to energy attacks, but not being hit by pieces of an exploding car. I quickly looked around to see where the blast had come from. I saw Gina standing there, both cannons on her arms smoking. <br>\r\n\"I'm only going to say this once,\" said Gina, her voice shaking slightly \"Get into your cars, and get the hell out of our way, or you end up the same way as your cars.\" <br>\r\n\"Pick up brass!\" shouted one of the men, and all the men, including the ones I had knocked unconscious, vanished, along with the remaining cars blocking our way. </span></div></div>",

I would not shrink from this responsibility. I am the guardian of this gem, a long line of people did not yield to the spirits, and I would be no different. I walked towards, and then through, the red gem. It felt like passing through a waterfall, as the red crystal folded around me, like liquid rubber, and then clung to me as I reached the other side, before bouncing back to it's original shape. On the other side, there was darkness, and then three blue lights were floating towards me through the darkness they resolved themselves into three warriors. One appeared to be wearing Centurion armour, like the Roman ones. He was carrying a spear, and had a sword at his side and a shield over his back. The second appeared to be garbed in animal skins with a massive two-handed axe on his back. The third was a mystery to me- they were cloaked and hooded which made their gender hard to determine, and they didn't appear to have any visible weaponry.<br>\r\n\"You are the new bearer?\" asked the centurion. I nodded. <br>\r\n\"Then you are in danger,\" he said, drawing his spear and moving to stand protectively in front of you. The axe-bearer took his axe off his back with both hands and moved to a different side than the centurion. The mysterious one moved to cover another side, forming a triangle, they brought up their arms, and barriers of bright blue sprang into existence, originating from her (or him) and protecting both of them. As she did, her hood fell back, revealing a young woman, about  ten years older than Abigail herself. <br>\r\n\"Here they come,\" said the axe-wielder, as numerous red spirits began appearing, some of them engaged my three protectors. trying to force their way through to get to me. However, the bulk of them flew towards the gem, battering it with spiritual weapons, as well as their own spiritual bodies. By helping me, Beth had become a target, the gem's walls seemed to be holding firm, but I could see that with the battering it was taking, it wouldn't hold for long. Blue spirits were flooding into the area, engaging the red, but the amount of red spirits allowed them to keep battering away at the protective walls of the gem. <br>\r\n\"No!\" I shouted, a shock wave of power rippling out from me, shattering the force fields and pushing my three protectors back. A gleaming, golden sword materialised in my hand, as I raised my hand towards the gem. Both Beth and the mysterious woman vanished, as the red field shrank into nothing. <br>\r\n\"I refuse to be ignored,\" I shouted. Every single spirit, both blue and red, were looking at me, with shock on their incorporeal faces \"I see I have your attention.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I just turned 14.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose I'm like most girls my age, but there is one difference: I've been totally blind since I was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do a pretty good job of getting around. I might do a little better, if I could get my older brother, Zach, to let me do more. I know he means well, but he doesn't seem to know what <i>overprotective</i> means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh school will be a new experience for me, as Mom and Dad have decided to send me to Zach's school. It'll be my first school that doesn't have the words \"For The Visually Impaired\" in its name. Not that I mind. Until I get the layout memorized, I'll need to get around by holding somebody's arm. If you know a better way to get a guy's attention, I'm all ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told you before that being blind was the only thing about me that was different. Well, that was true, or, at least, it used to be. One day, though, something very different happened to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had decided to visit a friend of mine, Mrs. Dalrymple. She's blind, like me, but she was maybe the most independent person I knew. She was the first to really show me how much I could do. I'm not saying I'll be driving in a couple of years, but, thanks to her, I could really (if you'll pardon the expression) see myself on my own one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI visited Mrs. D about once a week, and, usually, she was alone when I came by. Oh, sure, she had grandkids and great-grandkids who looked in on her from time to time, but she lived alone, and liked it. I only hoped I could be half that capable when I was nearly 100. Hell, I only hoped to make it to nearly 100.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rang the doorbell, and identified myself into the speaker. In no time, she unlocked the door and let me in. \"I'm glad you came, Melissa. Would you like some tea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI never turned down Mrs. D's tea, because she always served it with vanilla sandwich wafers on the side. I sat on the left side of the couch, my usual spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. D brought out the tea, poured it into cups, and set my cup in front of me. \"I'm so glad you came today, Melissa,\" she said. \"I... I have a feeling that this may be our last visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding, Mrs. D?\" I asked. \"You'll be here when <i>I'm</i> a hundred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled. \"If only that were true, dear.\" She sat down next to me. \"Lean closer, Melissa. I want to give you something.\" I leaned closer, and opened my mouth to ask what she wanted to give me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could say anything, though, she grabbed the back of my head and kissed me full on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to pull away, but her grip on my head was too strong. I felt something in my mouth. I thought it was her tongue, until it slid down my throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she let go of my head, and I pulled away. \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't get an answer, because, right then, Mrs. D fell over into my lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. D?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gently picked up her head. There was no resistance on her part. I patted her face, like you do when you want someone to wake up. But she wasn't waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put my hand over her face. She wasn't breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was glad I knew where pretty much everything in her living room was, because it made it easier for me to find her phone. I called 911.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"911, what is your emergency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a friend of Mrs. Dalrymple's,\" I said. \"she passed out in my lap, and she's not breathing.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mrs. Dalrymple's death hit me hard. At the funeral, I discovered that she had touched the lives of a lot of people in the small city of Waterfront, New York. I saw the parents of many of Zack's school friends there, including the chief of police, Ted Jones. My mother held me close during the entire funeral; she understood how close I was to Mrs D. Zack was his usual overprotective self, ready to pound anyone who said a single disrespectful word. Still, it gave me comfort to know that Mrs D had touched so many people in her lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after returning home, mom called me down to the living room. I entered to hear the voice of the chief of police, Ted Jones. \"I deeply apologize for coming so soon after the funeral, Miss Davenport.\" Sincerely, he said. \"However, I am required to ask you a few questions as you were the last person to see, err, be with her when she was alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My daughter has already spoken to the police.\" Defending me, mom said. \"Why do you feel you need to ask her more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all due respect, Mrs Davenport, your daughter is not the only person hurting.\" Patiently, Ted retorted. \"She saved my life when I was a lot younger; I owe it to her to be as thorough as I can when investigating her death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You suspect foul play?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed sighed. \"Mrs. Dalrymple had helped a lot of people.\" Softly, he said. \"In doing so, she made a few enemies; it is not the first time an attempt was made on her life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped at that, remembering the unknown object she had forced down my throat with that kiss. I turned to mom, pale; then turned to chief Jones. \"She didn't tell me anything that led me to believe she was in any trouble.\" Shaken, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She never shared her troubles with others.\" Honestly, chief Jones said. \"However, this morning, we discovered that her house had been ransacked.\" He sighed, looking me in the eye. \"Miss Davenport, it is very important that I ask this; did Mrs Dalrymple give you anything in any way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, causing chief Jones to frown. \"She did, didn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief Jones, you are frightening my daughter!\" Annoyed, my mom scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The people who ransacked Mrs Dalrymple's home were after something specific!\" Cryptically, chief Jones snapped. \"It will not take long for them to search here for it as well!\" He sighed then turned back to me, retrieving a card from his jacket pocket. \"I am leaving you my card.\" His face softening, he said. \"If you think of anything else or if anything... strange happens. Do not hesitate to call me; this is very important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... Yes, sir.\" Shaken, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will assign a detail to watch your house for a few days, just to be on the safe side.\" Serious, chief Jones said. \"Keep that card with you at all times, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and chief Jones left. As I heard him pull away in his squad car, I could not help thinking, <i>\"Mrs D... what did you make me swallow? What were you involved in?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slept restlessly that night, experiencing strange dreams of unfamiliar shapes and colors. I found this disturbing as I had never seen colors before. When I woke up the following day, I discovered that something strange had indeed occurred. It was as if all of my working senses had been somehow kicked into turbo mode. I could hear Zack softly snoring in his bedroom with my door closed, I could feel the vibrations of mom walking around downstairs, I could even smell mom's favorite perfume all from my bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" Shaken, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring, I must be dreaming, I moved to my window to let some air in and was bombarded with an overwhelming sensation. My mind became literally flooded with strange images of various shapes and colors! Having never seen color before, it terrified me and I screamed at the top of my lungs as I slammed the window shut. I fell to my knees, crying; I was frightened and confused by what was happening to me. I heard both mom and Zack call my name and felt the heavy vibrations of them running towards my room. Zack was first to throw my door open with mom right behind her, dragging the police officer with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis! What's wrong?!\" Startled, Zack demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at Zack, not expecting to see him, only to find an image of his muscular form in various unfamiliar colors. I turned to mom and the officer and saw their forms as well in different patterns of strange colors. \"Zack, mom...\" Terrified and confused, I whimpered, \"I... I'm scared! I... I think I'm beginning to see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looked at me, surprised then slowly smiled. Behind her, mom teared up, looking trapped between joy and worry.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was rushed to the hospital where our primary family physician, Dr. Huff and her hand picked team of nurses took a look at me. Dr. Huff was 35 years old, mom's age. She was tall and slender with shoulder length black hair and blue eyes. Mom did not trust anyone else other than Dr. Huff; she told me that the two went way back and had been through a lot together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA barrage of tests were ordered but they seemed out of the norm. I was given an eye exam where I was asked to look at a chart on a lighted panel. I was surprised that I could read every letter and number clearly, right down to the smallest digits. Then came a hearing exam, which I passed easily. After that was a strange walking test where I had to walk around a number of obstacles. Many I was able to detect, though they looked strange to me. I should have suspected as much, being blind since birth. Still, I made it through the maze. Finally, Dr Huff tested my reflexes but not as one might think. She threw random objects at me, asking me to catch them. I did so with each object with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we've seen enough.\" Serious, Dr Huff said. She turned to her nurses. \"Do you all agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurses nodded and Dr Huff excused them. After the last nurse had left, Dr Huff spoke. \"Melissa, your four existing senses have become super charged in a way that gives your mind a three dimensional view of the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis stunned not only me but mom and Zack as well. \"I... What?!\" Taken back, I demanded. \"How is that even possible?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Dalrymple had the same condition, Melissa.\" Serious, Dr Huff said. \"While I can't discuss the details, you seem to have developed the same adaptation. I suspected this and modified my tests to determine if that was the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Sarah?\" Worried, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Huff, known to mom as Sarah, motioned to the eye exam chart. \"This is not an ordinary eye chart; the letters and numbers are cut outs over a heated light.\" Bemused, she explained. \"Melissa was detecting the heat that moved through the shapes.\" She smiled. \"I believe that your daughter has developed a sense of touch so acute that she can feel the heat within and around our bodies, giving her a mental image. She can see what we look like based upon our heat signatures and the movement of the air around our features.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she literally sees the world through her sense of touch.\" Mussing, Zack said. \"That's pretty cool but does she have any depth perception?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was just one of her four senses, Zack.\" Smiling, Sarah said. She then motioned to the hearing exam table. \"Half of the sounds that Melissa noted she had heard were too high for normal humans to detect. Through this, she can detect how far an object is based upon how long it takes a sound to bounce off it to her, giving a fair sense of depth perception.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the echo location trick Mrs. D taught me?\" Surprised, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded. \"I was amazed when I saw her use it the first time and i asked her if she could teach it to you as I knew you were struggling with blindness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat about the obstacle course?\" Serious, mom demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That confirmed my theory.\" Smiling, Sarah replied. \"Melissa, though still technically blind, has somehow found a way to use her existing senses to perceive the world around her.\" She then turned serious. \"Of course, she will need training in how to use these new found abilities. It is very fortunate that Mrs. Dalrymple was also my patient; I can help her learn how to understand the images she sees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a nervous smile but stiffened as I heard Mrs Dalrymple's voice in my head. <i>\"Well, it goes a little deeper than that, deary... I'll explain later when you are alone.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo hear Mrs Dalrymple's voice in my head was creepy enough but her promise to explain later when I was alone was even more so. I bit my lip, wondering what to do...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the whatever-it-was said, my senses told me far more about the world than I had ever imagined. I could taste everything that went into the cereal I was eating, and smell the chemicals in Zack's favorite cereal. \"The Chief is here,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he isn't,\" the police officer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after he said that, there was a knock on the front door. The officer bent over at one spot on the door, then opened it. \"Good morning, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Lewis,\" Chief Jones said. \"You can patrol the perimeter while I'm here.\" I could smell Chief Jones's aftershave and deodorant, and his wife's perfume. I could also smell sugar and vanilla from the plastic bag he was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Chief Jones,\" Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Kris,\" he answered. \"Tell me, what all is in your basement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The laundry room, the furnace, and a rec room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk in the rec room. If you have a land line down there, disconnect it, and turn off your cell phones and tablets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief,\" Mom said, \"yesterday, I told you you were scaring Melissa. Now you're scaring <i>me</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the sort of people who cut apart Mrs. D's cane scare <i>me</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike mine, Mrs. D's cane was basically a few eight-inch lengths of plastic tubing with shock-cord running through them. This lets you fold it up and stick it in your pocket or purse, and then bring it to full extension with a flick of the wrist. Anyone who would cut it apart must be looking for something, and determined to find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked down the basement stairs, Zack asked, \"Anything new on the case, Chief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might not want to answer that, Ted,\" Mom said. \"The neighbors have asked us to let them know if we hear anything about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should mention that in my next press conference,\" the Chief replied. \"Someone might crack if they're afraid of what ordinary people might do to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were in the rec room, Mom, Zack, and I sat in our usual spots, and the Chief stood in front of me. \"First thing,\" he said, \"Mrs. D's family has asked me to apologize if they seemed aloof at the funeral. The granddaughter and some of the great-grandkids had visited her an hour or so before you, Melissa, and she told them that she thought someone was snooping around. Thing is, they didn't really believe her, and they... let's just say, they felt pretty bad when they got the bad news. They asked me to let you know that they're glad she was with someone she knew, and who really cared about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. I knew, before too long, I was going to start crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his plastic bag. \"Sugar wafers? The past couple days, the stores seem to sell them as fast as they can stock them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" I felt like I needed a couple sugar wafers more than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa, if you can, I'd like for you to tell me about that day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went there, about my usual time. Mrs. D offered me tea and sugar wafers. She said she thought it would be our last visit.\" I could feel the tears coming. \"She asked me to lean closer, so she could give me something. When I did, she kissed me, and - \" I couldn't go on. I started crying for Mrs. D.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom put her arm around me, and Chief Jones laid a hand on my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, I was able to pull myself together. Chief Jones said, \"If you want, you can just nod or shake your head when I ask you this: Did Mrs. D give you something while she was kissing you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief,\" Mom asked, \"what is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Kris. And it won't do any good asking Steve. He's assigned to a different case.\" Steve was my dad, another officer on the force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Jones took my hands. \"I don't know what Mrs. D gave you by kissing you, Melissa. But I know this, and I want the three of you to remember it to your dying day: Mrs. D could have passed it to her granddaughter, or one of the kids, but she didn't.

I looked up at chief Jones and gasped as I noticed something different about him. His muscles are generating a ton of heat!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once I was able to get some time for myself, I decided to have a talk with the entity within me. \"What should I call you?\" Curious, I demanded. \"Do you have a name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Well, Mrs Dalrymple called me Madam West as that was the person I had inhabited before her.*</i> Kindly, the entity replied. <i>*You could call me Mrs D, if you like. In my world, we did not have birth names as we existed as one collective mind.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brought you to Earth... Dee?\" My curiosity rising, I asked. \"Did something happen to your home world that forced you to move to other planets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Is Dee what you chose to call me?*</i> Giggling, Dee asked. She giggled. <i>*Dear me, no. We did not come from a planet, we lived among the stars in space, it was our world.*</i> She sighed. <i>*To answer your question, it was curiosity that brought many of us to your planet. We discovered that by living inside a host body, we gain incredible longevity and our host gains incredible abilities in return.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was surprised to hear that the symbiont, whom I had decided to call Dee, lived among the stars and that they came to Earth out of sheer curiosity. \"What can you tell me about my powers?\" Again finding my voice, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*It is different for everyone, dear.*</i> Patiently, Dee explained. <i>*From what I can tell, your four existing senses have risen to an epic degree.*</i> She paused then stated, <i>*I'll try to break it down for you one sense at a time.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Nervous, I said. \"let's start with hearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Your hearing is like a radar.*</i> Serious, Dee explained. <i>*You give off high pitched sounds which bounce off objects and return to you, giving your mind an image of what is there. Only that is just part of it.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"High pitched sounds?\" Confused, you asked. \"I don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*You are doing this without thinking, Melissa.*</i> Kindly Dee said. <i>*It was more than just your senses that gained power. Right now, I am simply helping you understand how to can see the world around you.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I have a radar sense like a bat.\" Smiling, I said. \"That's pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Then there is your sense of touch.*</i> Calmly, Dee said. <i>*By feeling the subtle currents of wind and various degrees of temperature, you can make out the shape of a door or a window. Through this same sense, you can tell of a door or window is open or closed.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can also sense if a door is slowly being opened or if someone is in the room.\" Serious, I added. \"No wonder Mrs D was impossible to sneak up on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*On top of those is your sense of smell and taste.*</i> Serious, Dee said. <i>*Once you get a whiff of a person or animal, you will instantly know if he or she is near by catching their scent. Also, you will be able to tell if something had been added to your favorite foods as you would know what they are supposed to smell and taste like.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all of these senses give me an image of the world around me.\" Amazed, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*They do far more than that, my dear.*</i> Kindly, Dee said. <i>*However, that is basically how you are able to see the world around you. It is not what one would call 'perfect vision' but it is far better than anyone with normal senses can claim to have.*</i> After a pause, she added, <i>*I suggest you take some time to walk about the house and learn how to focus your new found senses.*</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since I was in my room, it only made sense for me to start there. As Dee had said, my echolocation was a lot better than sight. For one thing, it didn't depend on light. For another, since not all the sound waves I was emitting went right to my ears, I could also get a rough idea of the room around me without turning my head. My bed, my clock, my bookcase; I could perceive it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped out into the hall, and found a rectangle hanging on the wall. I knew it was a picture that the rest of the family liked, but it was still blank to my senses. Lesson Number 1: Not all the sighted world was clear to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Zack in his room, typing on the keys on his computer. I could hear his heavy breathing, smell his sweat, his - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Eww.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, Lesson Number 2: Heightened senses sometimes tell me things I <i>really</i> didn't want to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed the hall to the upstairs landing, then went downstairs. More art on the walls, but now I could perceive the sculpture in the foyer. As a little girl, I hadn't been allowed to touch it. Now, though, I could appreciate its beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed the sounds of the TV to the living room. Mom was watching her afternoon programs. She turned her head when I came into the room. \"Hello, Melissa. I'd like to talk with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down next to her. \"About what?\" I asked, but I had a pretty good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly is going on with you? What do you and the Chief of Police know that I don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" I began, \"you know how sighted people say that visually impaired people develop heightened senses to compensate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with Mrs. D, it was true. And, thanks to her, it's now true for me, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I apparently now make a noise so high-pitched that my brain doesn't even recognize it as a sound. But, when it bounces off of something, I hear the echo, and my brain forms a picture from it. Like a bat's echolocation. Also, my ability to feel the room temperature is now so sensitive that I can detect body heat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. And what do you plan to do with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, I'm expanding my perceptions of the house. I figured it would be best to start here, since I know the floor layout and nobody would think it was strange I was walking around without my cane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep the cane anyway, Mel. No need to let anyone else know your senses are this sharp.\" She pointed to the mantel. \"What do you see up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Picture frames,\" I replied. \"I can't tell what they're pictures of, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're pictures of our family. The one on the far right is you, when you were little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up and touched the frame. I still couldn't perceive the pictures, but knowing they were us made them special to me.</span></div></div>",

Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, Mom, you don't want to know what he's doing on the computer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom cursed under her breath. \"I've changed that password five times already.\" Then she cleared her throat. \"How about we check out the backyard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom opened the back door, and I followed her out. We have a tall fence, so the neighbors wouldn't see me navigating with no assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like an entirely new world. I'd heard the wind playing in the leaves on the trees before, but now, I could perceive the way each leaf moved. And that wasn't all: I could now perceive living things around me. I pointed to a creature with a bushy tail. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a squirrel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something fluttering around. \"And that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butterfly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that thing with the funny things sticking out of its head?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a rabbit. Those are its ears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"I think I like butterflies and rabbits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, someone called over the fence. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom replied, \"Can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grace and Garth Jones,\" said a girl's voice. \"We heard there was a girl here, who was with Mrs. D when... \" Her voice trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" I said, \"I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy spoke this time. \"Um, we were thinking that, maybe, you might want to talk about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Mom said, unlatching the gate. \"The three of you can talk, if you want. I'll just run in and get you kids something to drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, ma'am,\" said the boy, Garth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Mom closed the door behind her, Grace said, under her breath, \"<i>Puer quaestio</i>.\"</span></div></div>",

I was not certain then why he told me that but now I had a better idea. I turned to Garth and gasped; his muscles were generating insane amounts of energy! He was just like Chief Jones only his strength seemed to have been energy based rather than instant muscle inflation. I then turned to Grace, wide eyed, seeing a beautiful pattern of coloration in her mind as well as her body. I was not certain what it meant as I was still learning how my power works but I guessed she had some type of mind over matter ability that was sure to surprise me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are members of the new problem child gang.\" Whispering, I said. \"Exactly what is it that you want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Shadow was a valuable ally to the original problem child gang.\" Quietly, Garth replied. \"From what I heard from my mentor, you possess similar powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have reason to suspect Miss Shadow was your mentor.\" Kindly, Grace added. \"We are hoping you might be willing to help us in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not asking me to join?\" Surprised, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth shook his head. \"We ask no one to follow us.\" Serious, he said. \"Those who join us do so under their own free will and at their own peril.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we do is dangerous and the authorities frown upon such actions from anyone.\" Softly, Grace explained. \"However, there is a real threat to this city and we believe it can use all the help it can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth handed me a card with a number on it. \"If you decide you wish to help us in our fight or find you need our help, call us at any time; day or night.\" Kindly, he said. \"Puer quaestio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused, hearing mom returning and turned to Grace who seemed to have sensed her coming as well as she quickly changed the subject of the conversation. \"We are very sorry for your loss, Melissa.\" Sadly, she said. \"She was a dear friend of our father; she had helped him out of a few jams when he was around our age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He mentioned that.\" Nodding, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you three are getting along well.\" Smiling, mom said as she approached. \"Melissa will be going to your school once summer vacation is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack told us all about it.\" Politely, Garth said. \"He's already informing everyone that he would be protecting her from any type of bullying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled at that. \"Zack has always been protective of her.\" Smiling, she said. \"Although I'm certain it drives Melissa crazy at times, he does mean well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of normal conversation, Grace and Garth said their farewells and left in good spirits. Mom seemed pleased that I had made new friends so soon but I remained worried. Although Mrs D got involved, I was not so certain I wanted to place my normal family, as normal as it was, at risk. I decided to go to my room to try to think things through. As I passed Zack's bedroom, the door opened and Zack peeked his head out. \"Melissa!\" Whispering, he called. \"Get in here! I need your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, smelling Zack's sweat and 'heightened hormones' to put it politely. \"What is it, Zack?\" Patiently, I demanded. \"It's been a weird enough day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack frowned. \"It's about to get more weird.\" Serious, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could react, Zack pulled me into his room and closed the door. Inside, I was surprised to find his room as neat as a pin when normally it was a trashed up mess. \"Did you lose something during your yearly clean up?\" Sarcastically, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny, sis.\" Frowning, Zack said. \"I'm trying to be serious here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused, noting fear and frustration in Zack's voice. \"There was something genuinely frightening him which was a rarity given the lengths he went to stand up for me in the past. \"What's wrong?\" Becoming worried, I asked. \"Did something happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack sighed. \"You and Mrs D had a lot in common.\" Surprising me, Zack said. \"Including an overprotective brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped upon suddenly seeing a surge of energy building up within Zack and took a step back as he then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say I was surprised would have been the understatement of the century. Zack's body had drastically changed in a matter of seconds! His usual tall, muscular square frame had shrunk over an inch and had gained the curves of a teenage girl! He, or rather, she was still quite muscular but there was no doubt in my mind that she was now completely female!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you got my attention.\" Shaken, I said. \"How did you know Mrs D and how are you able to swap genders like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never really spoke to Mrs D.\" Blushing, Zack said. \"I was approached by her older brother that day you flipped out on me for following you to her house that first week you started visiting her on a regular basis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's new voice was soft and melodious, like mom's only slightly deeper in tone. I could tell she was blushing by the heat I could detect on her face. The way she was standing gave me the impression that she was not very comfortable with her new form. \"What happened?\" Whispering, I asked. \"Did he do something to you to cause this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He told me that he was very protective of his sister too.\" Shifting uncomfortably, Zack explained. \"He taught me ways to watch over you without you feeling I was constantly standing in your shadow, looking over your shoulder. He taught me how to read facial expressions and verbal tones; tell who looked at you with good or bad intentions.\" She sighed. \"He also taught me how to track people in case someone...\" Her voice trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get the idea.\" Wincing, you said. \"What about you changing genders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the weird part.\" Frowning, Zack said. \"I went to him the day Mrs D passed away, thinking he might need someone to talk to. He told me that you were going to need my help more than ever and that his ancestry would help me do just that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His ancestry?\" Confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack nodded, shifting uncomfortably. \"I didn't get it either.\" Tearing up, she said. \"He told me that he was descended from an Amazon woman called Lole, the twice named.\" She shivered slightly before continuing. \"It was a strange tale to say the least but he proved it by changing into a woman right in front of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Stunned, I asked. \"How is that even possible?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this even possible?!\" Irritated, Zack countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"Point taken. What did he, err, she do to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my first instinct was to run for the door.\" Frowning, Zack said. \"However, she changed back and told me that I had nothing to fear. That and I found I couldn't move.\" She sniffed away a tear shifting again. \"He then performed some weird ritual in front of me and before I knew what was happening, I was a teenage girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Shaken, I muttered. \"Are you able to change back and forth as you said he could?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack shook her head. \"I don't know.\" Now crying, she said. \"I'm barely able to control it right now because I feel so weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped, suddenly realizing what was happening and grabbed Zack's wrist, pulling her into her private bathroom. She and I had our own bathroom suite which made things easier for us both. Once inside, I pulled down her sweat pants. Sure enough, I could detect the telltale signs of her having her first period. \"So that's what I was smelling in here.\" Sighing, I muttered. \"Good grief!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me, sis?\" Frightful, Zack demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"Get yourself cleaned up.\" Firmly but kindly, I said. \"I'll find you some clothes and then we will need to have a long talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to tell mom, are you?\" Worried, Zack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going to find out eventually.\" Wincing, I replied. \"You went from my tall, dark and dorky brother to my slim, curvy and hot sister in less than a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, ha.\" Frowning, Zack muttered. \"I suppose you'll want to give me a girl's name to go with this new look I gained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided not to answer as then was not the time to start an argument. Zack was way out of his comfort zone with her new situation and I had to get some answers before something else happened to her that might make things worse.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only difference was that she was unrolling a mess of toilet paper. \"How long does it take to stop bleeding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not go into that right now,\" I said. I unwrapped a tampon. \"Here. You insert it like you're injecting marinade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the flow was interrupted, we could concentrate on getting my new sister cleaned up. \"You know,\" she said, \"I once saw a movie online, about this 11-year-old girl who had a baby. I thought for sure that would be the weirdest thing I ever saw, until this happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has been a day for surprises,\" I replied. \"So, tell me about Mrs. D's brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name's Eli. He said that Mrs. D wasn't much older than you are when she started the whole Miss Shadow thing. He wanted to look out for her, because he knew that enhanced senses and agility aren't much good against something faster than the speed of sound. Like a bullet.\" She pulled on the panties. \"I feel like Sigourney Weaver in <i>Alien</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Eli was very successful,*</i> Dee told me. <i>*We had no idea she was being followed, nor that her older brother could change sex.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was relieved when she got married,\" Zack continued. \"He said having a husband and a family kept her too busy for crime-fighting.\" She struggled with my bra, then threw it aside. \"That's too small. Anyway, he just about had a heart attack when the Problem Child Gang started up, and she up and decided to suit up again. I mean, he was 80 by then, and she wasn't far behind. Hardly the age to be comfortable chasing a bunch of 'whippersnappers,' as he called them.\" She squeezed into my clothes, then stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm still the big sister,\" she said. \"I'm fine, as long as I don't do anything crazy. Like breathe or eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he's the reason you're a girl now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. He said I would figure out how to control it, but I've had no luck so far. My first change today came right on the heels of an or... uh, I mean, I was 'getting happy'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Mom's going to want to talk to you about that. Something about half a dozen passwords?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty as charged. Though I can only guess what my search history will look like after this.

I decided to jump in before she got the wrong idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, something weird happened to Zack.\" Wincing, I said. \"Mrs D brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eli?\" Wide eyed, mom asked. \"You talked to Eli Mist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know him?\" Taken back, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head, looking disappointed. \"Let me guess, he tried to help you look after your sister without her knowing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack nodded, though she seemed as confused as I was. \"How do you know him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was my mother's crush.\" Frowning, mom replied. \"He would have become her second husband if  she and I had not discovered he was literally living a double life.\" She sighed then turned to Zack. \"Well at least now you don't need to hack the computer pass codes to look at pretty girls in next to nothing, you can just look in the mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack blushed brightly. \"I did it for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it for the articles, I know.\" Rolling her eyes, mom said. \"You got that lame excuse from your father. He finally admitted he does it to keep himself loyal while traveling abroad. He told me that no woman compares to my beauty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that as I could hear mom's eyes roll as she said that. Mom giggled back before her face softened slightly. \"I do not know how Eli was able to give you this power to change genders but I am guessing its an ancient ritual, one that is likely irreversible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\" Wincing, Zack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bemused look formed onto mom's face. \"We do the only thing we can do right now... Zoe.\" Smiling, she replied. \"Get ready to head out; we're all going to...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll get you some things from my closet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zack put on Mom's clothes, she said, \"I feel ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think you feel ridiculous now,\" Mom replied, \"just wait until your friends come by, wanting to shoot some hoops. Which euphemism would you like me to use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? I won't be on my period that long, will I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned to me. \"You haven't told her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was half-panicked when it happened,\" I explained. \"I didn't want to pile on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,... you know that T-shirt your friend Boomer likes to wear, that <i>he</i> thinks is <i>so</i> hilarious, and I think is garbage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean, 'Don't Trust Anything That Bleeds For 3 Days And Doesn't Die'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's the one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack thought about this exchange, then groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Zack was dressed, we went over to Eli Mist's house. He took a while to answer the door. When he did, he was bent over. Zack seemed concerned. \"Can I help you?\" Eli wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eli Mist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up. \"Do I know you, ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew my mother long ago, and you knew my son more recently. We'd like to talk about the latter, if we can come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli let us in and slowly led us to the living room. \"What is this about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Mrs. D's brother?\" I asked. \"She talked about you, but I thought you were... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled. \"Not quite yet, young lady. You must be Melissa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came to talk about Zack, Mr. Mist,\" Mom said. \"You gave him the ability to turn into a girl for some reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the time,\" he said, \"it seemed like a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is Zack,\" she said, pointing to my new big sister. \"She can't change back, and she just became a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh.</i>\" Eli said this as though his worst fears had been confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you undo this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, ma'am,\" Eli said, \"this is something it's easier to get into than out of. There's a way that has been used sometimes, but it usually doesn't work, and oftentimes can even make the person younger. You wouldn't want to risk that, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the way Zack was acting, though, I got the feeling there might be another reason. She was shocked to see Eli so frail. <i>Maybe</i>, I thought, <i>changing Zack took more out of him than he thought.</i> If that was the case, even if he undid it, he might not live long enough to be thanked.</span></div></div>",

I knew her when she donned that persona to lead the resistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The resistance?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli nodded. \"It was near the beginning of the cold war, many years before the original problem child gang was first founded.\" Softly, he explained. \"This entire town was targeted by some secret government agency called CHILD. They were very interested in children who were reported to have strange abilities. Ina, or Miss Shadow, lead a group of resistance fighters to drive the government agency out. I was her unseen shield, her unknown partner in her struggle against impossible odds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli paused, reaching for a tank of oxygen. I winced seeing how weak he seemed. \"Changing Zack's gender took a lot out of you, didn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about me, child.\" Lightly, Eli said. \"Also, your sister will have the power to change back into her male form once her menstrual cycle passes.\" He flashed a rueful smile. \"I was on my own for my first experience so your brother is fortunate in that regard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will a gender change do to help me in  any way?\" Curious, I asked. \"Right now, she needs help from mom and I more than anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did more than merely change his gender.\" Serious, Eli said. \"She will soon discover she has skills far beyond any Olympian athlete including heightened reflexes, sharp senses, everything a warrior needs to achieve success.\" He then turned to mom with a kind smile on his face. \"I did nothing more than what my dear sister did with Melissa.\" Calmly, he said. \"I passed on a gift that gave me the power to protect my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then unsteadily reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a large notebook. \"Here are all my notes on what I had discovered about my powers; you can use them as a guide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Eli...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The pages were worn with several corners folded; I guessed they were reference points for him. I turned back to thank him but detected no breath leaving his nose or mouth. I turned to his chest and heard nothing. I quickly realized the worst had occurred; Eli had passed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eli...?\" Fearful, Zack called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to him and winced before slowly, tearfully shaking my head. \"I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack buried her face into her hands as mom pulled her into a comforting hug. \"We'll figure this out, honey, I promise.\" Whispering, she said. \"It'll be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack continued to cry in mom's arms, much as I did shortly after Mrs D passed away in my arms only a few days before. <i>\"Mrs D gave me her symbiont for a reason.\"</i> Saddened, I thought. <i>\"That reason, whatever it was, had to have driven Eli to give his gift to Zack.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Eli was a good man.*</i> Sadness in her voice, Dee said. <i>*He had told Ina that no one should face their troubles alone.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why he did it.\" Whispering, I muttered. \"He knew what might happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, Melissa?\" Worried, mom demanded. \"You think you know why Eli did this?\" She sighed, shaking her head. \"It really doesn't matter now, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He... He said I'll change back after this period passes.\" Crying, Zack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said you will have the power to change back.\" Softly, mom corrected. \"Hopefully these notes he left us will give us a clue as to how.\" She pulled out her cellphone. \"I had better call the authorities and let them know of Eli's passing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom released Zack to call the police while I took over the task of comforting her. Minutes later, a squad car pulled up and Chief Jones entered with the coroner and a deputy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guard the door while I speak with the witnesses.\" Firmly, he ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deputy nodded and walked to the front door to stand guard while Chief Jones turned to us with a rather serious look on his face. \"Normally, someone being close to the deaths of two related people raises more than a few red flags.\" Serious, he said. \"Fortunately, I had spoken to Mr Mist earlier. I knew that he was close to dying but he refused to go to the hospital; he said he had some unfinished business to deal with.\" He frowned, eying Zack. \"I see that business had to do with your son who I see is now an attractive young daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know about all of this?\" Fearful, mom demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it happened to another boy not that long ago.\" To all of our surprise, chief Jones replied. \"He, or rather she, was descendant from the same Amazon tribe as Mr Mist.\" His voice then dropped to a whisper. \"I can't give you the details but I can point you in the right direction to get more answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded and Chief Jones handed her a piece of paper with a number and an address on it before starting his usual questions regarding the passing of Mr Mist. We were all free to leave about an hour after and mom drove us home. On the way there, she dialed the number Chief Jones gave her. Three rings later, a woman answered. \"Vance residence, who am I speaking to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gasped. \"Liv...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice on the phone gasped back. \"Kris...?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zack had a puzzled look on her face as two teenage girls walked in and sat down across from her, mom and I. Both girls had roughly shoulder length hair and an attractive figure. Only one walked with a little more grace; the other seemed to be a bit awkward in her steps. I was curious as to why but decided not to ask. Mrs Vance entered shortly after in a wheelchair with a toddler boy in her lap who was sleeping. \"My husband, Frank is out running errands.\" Kindly, Mrs Vance said. \"Kris, you told me over the phone that your son, Zack had been changed by old Eli Mist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a big way, I fear.\" Motioning to Zack, mom said. \"Chief Jones gave us your number and address, saying that you could give us some answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Vance sighed. \"I see...\" Calmly, she said. \"Well, my daughter, Alyssa went through the same transition as Zack.\" She motioned to the girl with the awkward step. \"Her sister, Beth was a great help to her during this time. However, in her case, it was something she truly wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack gasped, raising a hand to her mouth as she turned to Alyssa who blushed but said nothing. Fortunately, Zack did not say anything in return. I decided to try to break the ice. \"Zack told us that Eli Mist used some weird ritual on Zack, turning him into my new sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth nodded. \"I had done a lot of research into our family ancestry.\" Looking at me, she explained. \"Eli Mist is directly related to the high priestess who had transformed the adopted Amazon woman, Lole the twice named. I do not know how he was able to switch genders at will if his ancestry gave him that power but I do know he would have had to have been female to learn the ritual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea why he did this to my son?\" Worried, mom demanded. \"Is there any way to reverse this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eli was old.\" Wincing, Beth said. \"I can only guess he was trying to pass on his gift, if you wish to call it that.\" She sighed. \"I had spoken to Mrs D when I was working on my research to help Alyssa and she told me that if someone of old age performs the ritual, it almost  always only has a partial effect on the one being changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth sighed. \"It means that, like Eli, your daughter is only transformed half way.\" Almost sadly, she explained. \"She will be able to switch genders at will and gain great attributes, reflexes, and so much more.\" She winced. However....only a full transformation can be reversed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the bright side, she can choose to remain in one gender form or another.\" After a thought, Mrs Vance said. \"Have you considered a new name for your child's feminine persona in the mean time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"I was leaning towards Luana.\" Softly, she said. \"If my son is stuck as my daughter, or will be switching back and forth for who knows how long, I would have to get her a new wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Vance smiled. \"I was about to take the girls shopping for more clothes when you called. Want to come along with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled slightly. \"Maybe Alyssa and Beth can help her pick out some outfits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Vance smiled in return.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, I was blind, so there was no reason for the Vances to believe that I could perceive the world around me almost as if I could actually see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mom and Mrs. Vance were talking. Apparently, they had been good friends in high school, but had somehow drifted apart after graduation. \"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw you,\" Mom said. \"How'd you end up in a wheelchair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story,\" Mrs. Vance replied. \"So how well do you know Chief Jones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve's a detective on the force. We talk just about every chance we get. Of course, he still finds ways to surprise me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, would you believe that the Problem Child Gang from the comics was a real group? Seriously. A bunch of kids actually went out and did a lot of the things they put in the funny papers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to believe,\" Mrs. Vance said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when she said that, her heart rate went up, and I knew she was lying. She knew more about the Problem Child Gang than she was telling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew she was about the same age as Chief Jones. Could it be that she was also a member of the Problem Child Gang? Was that how she ended up in a wheelchair?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*She was,*</i> Dee told me. <i>*She had a talent for escape artistry. Perhaps an old enemy decided to put her in a situation she couldn't escape from.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They wanted to put her in a chair?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Or a coffin.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we went along, I noticed something interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most stores, this one had mannequins showing off the latest styles. However, in this store, at least one of the mannequins was... <i>alive.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, I was certain. She breathed. She had a heartbeat. She radiated heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something even more unusual: This person's brain was bursting with energy, just like Garth's muscles. Was there a connection?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I pondered the situation, the mannequin girl became nervous. But why? I hadn't said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed that Mom and Mrs. Vance were moving on, so I followed them. We were meeting back up with Zack and Mrs. Vance's daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we've got enough at least to start her off,\" Alyssa said. \"She only wanted one pair of shoes at first, but, once we got her to try some different styles, she realized she wanted more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get you girls rung up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe brought our different purchases to the register. \"Good afternoon,\" said the cashier. \"My name's Mike. Did you find everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We sure did,\" Alyssa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mike rang up first the Vances' items, then ours, I noticed Zack was breathing heavily. Her heart was beating like she'd just run a marathon. She kept her eyes fixed on one spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed her line of sight, and gasped. Zack was looking squarely... at Mike the cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack had only been a girl for a few hours, and she was already crushing on a boy.</span></div></div>",

Zack, taking on the name of Luana, was blushing brightly with a perplexed look on her face. At first, I did not know how I was able to see her expression. Then, I heard Dee speak. <i>*Your senses are becoming more focused.*</i> Calmly, she said. <i>*You will eventually be able to see every contour of everything including a person's facial expressions only not their skin tone or hair color.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, looking at Luana. \"How are you holding up, sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" Wincing, Luana replied. \"That boy who rang up our order... just looking at him made me feel weird. I had the strangest urge to spark a conversation with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, boy...\" Sighing, mom said. \"You haven't been a girl more than two days and you are already crushing on a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm what?!\" Blushing more, Luana asked. \"Ew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and I giggled at her reaction as we got out of the car. \"It's just another girl thing you'll have to get used to, sweetie.\" Kindly, mom said. \"Why don't you go upstairs and put on one of your new outfits. Your father should be home soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuana frowned, a sigh escaping her lips. \"He's going to be mad, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was nothing you could have done to prevent your situation, Luana.\" Patiently, mom replied. \"Just head upstairs and pick out an outfit to wear for the rest of the day. I'll deal with my husband when he gets home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you, sis.\" Urging her up the stairs, I said. \"Maybe you can wear that skirt and blouse set you picked out on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, I came down the stairs, remembering my cane this time in case of any surprise visitors and found mom in the living room. Dad's car had just pulled into the garage. \"Luana finished getting dressed.\" With a huff, I said. \"She can be so indecisive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Try to remember that she is new to all of this.\" Bemused, she said. \"Her exploring her femininity is like you exploring your new world of sight; new discoveries and surprises around every corner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touche.\" Grinning, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, dad walked in, already removing his tie. He gave mom a quick peck on the cheek before moving to his favorite chair which had a full view of the entire room. \"How was work dear?\" Kindly, mom asked. \"Any issues in our fair city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just another day at the office, dear.\" Sighing, dad said. \"You know... mundane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sensed dad's heart rate go up when he said that. Something did happen at work only he either does not want to talk about it or was ordered not to. Mom smiled then asked, \"Can I get you a drink to sooth your nerves, honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks.\" Smiling back, dad said. He then decided to change the subject. \"So, did anything interesting happen here today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom let out a low sigh. \"Well, I have good news and bad news.\" Wincing, she said. \"The good news is, Zack is done looking at girlie sites on the internet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded, a look of satisfaction on his face. \"Glad to hear it. What's the bad news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Luana walked down the stairs in full view of dad wearing a simple dress and mary-jane shoes. \"Hi, daddy...\" Nervously, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad let out a heavy sigh as he leaned back in his seat. \"On second thought, I think I'll have that drink you offered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I fell asleep, wondering what had happened back in the fifties that made so many people, including dad, nervous. Dee seemed to have sensed this... I dreamed that I had fallen back in time to the early nineteen fifties in the middle of Waterfront city. There were trucks and equipment everywhere with a strange logo on them. It was a large C with the word 'hild' inside its inner curve. I knew from my world history that Hild was one of the Valkyries in Norse mythology, a personification of battle. Then it struck me. The trucks belonged to the government organization known as CHILD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for the safety of your children, ma'am.\" Sternly, a gruff voice said. \"What is happening to them is not natural and could negatively effect them in the long run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to see man in bio hazard gear with no markings. He was pulling a small girl away from what appeared to be her mother while other children and teenagers were being escorted into the trucks with their hands zip-tied behind their backs. Some were being carried off, unconscious with bruises on their faces. \"I don't car what government agency you claim to be from!\" Hysterical, the woman protested. \"You have no right to take my child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man scoffed. \"You have no rights; its an illusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman screamed as the man struck her with the butt of a gun and began to drag the girl away, crying and begging to be let go. It was a terrifying scene; I was about to yell out in protest myself, not that it would have done much. Only a familiar voice rang out. \"Let her go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man paused only to be struck in the face with a powerful kick. He fell off balance, letting the girl loose who ran to her mother. I turned, surprised, to see a tall and slender woman who appeared to have been in her early thirties. She wore all black with long flowing black hair and a doll like face. As she stepped into the light, I noticed that the features of her face were somehow distorted, as if everything but that was in focus. It had to have been Miss Shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady, you just made your last mistake.\" Drawing a gun, the man growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Shadow took a defensive posture but then the man suddenly howled in pain, dropping the gun before falling to the pavement, unconscious. I looked about, surprised as did Miss Shadow only I spotted a strange distortion in the air in the form of a feminine figure near the unconscious man. It had to have been her gender swapping brother but I did not understand how she could not see her standing there. I turned to see her reaction only she was already off, working on freeing the others while a small group of teenagers joined the fray. Miss Shadow kicked then vanished as if she were never there then would appear a second later from another angle and throw a series of punches. She threw flash bombs, blinding her opponents as more men came to bring the situation under control...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up with a start, drenched with sweat. The dream felt so real only I could not jump in to help, if I could have helped. <i>*The organization, CHILD tried to kidnap half the city's children population.*</i> Sadly, Dee explained.<i> *I am sorry if my nightmare effected you. All of that happened a long time ago.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was Miss Shadow able to vanish like I saw her do in the fight?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*She was able to move very short distances at incredible speeds.*</i> Calmly, Dee replied. <i>*She only looked like she could vanish.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw Mrs D's brother.\" Still shaken, I said. \"He, err, she seemed to have the ability to distort the light around him. I think that was why Mrs D never knew he was there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low sigh came from Dee. <i>*If that is true, you may wish to help your new sister learn how to control it.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Luana and sighed myself. She was becoming invisible then reappearing in her sleep. \"Feel so weird...\" Sleeping, she muttered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was Zack, and I was hanging out with Boomer and the guys. Boomer was showing us these nude pictures he'd gotten. As I looked at them, I realized that they were of me, Luana. And I knew I hadn't posed for them knowingly. Suddenly, I became Luana, and the guys were all looking at me funny. I got nervous as they got closer, and then I disappeared. What do you think it meant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought it meant she was starting to identify more with the girls in the pictures, and starting to think more about Zack's choice of friends, but I wasn't going to tell her that. Instead, I said, \"I don't know. My dreams tend to be just recaps of the day before.\" Which was true, before Dee came into my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was half-dressed when Lu spoke again, her voice shaky this time. \"M-Mel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" I turned toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting up in bed. Or, rather, half of her was. \"Wh-where are my legs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over to her, and put my hand where her legs should have been. They were there, alright, just... undetectable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating,\" I said, turning so she could see my face. \"It's not just your eyes. I can't detect the body heat coming off your legs, and my echolocation isn't showing them to me, either. Once you get the hang of this, the bad guys won't know you're there until your fists start flying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eli never mentioned this,\" she said, feeling her legs with her hands. \"Do you think I can walk like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and walked, the rest of her body fading from view before she reached the door. \"This is going to take some getting used to.\"</span></div></div>",

Dad had allowed me to hold onto it; he seemed to not want anything to do with it. That and I suspect he did not expect me to be able to read it. Upon opening the book, I was surprised that I could detect every written word. Then I realized that the words were written with a heavy hand and every letter had left an imprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel every word.\" A smile forming, I whispered. \"It's like reading a different type of Braille.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Mrs D learned how to read hand written letters with her power; I can help you.* Kindly, Dee said. *I will give you that knowledge to save time.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaining instant knowledge of anything was quite the rush. Still, I was grateful for Dee's help as it allowed me to read what Eli had written. I began my search with the ear-marked pages and quickly found a series of notes about invisibility. What Eli had written down in his notes made my heart race...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...The Amazon Women had several talents and powers that were worthy of legend. They had the ability to navigate through the jungle with hardly a sound at surprising speeds, leap to impressive heights, and swim almost like a fish. This gave them a clear advantage in any fight. Added to that, they possessed the ability to turn their physical power into energy and use it to not only bend light but absorb sound. It took me weeks to learn how to control this technique as it is focused on a feeling rather than a command. An Amazon warrior only uses this technique when she feels cornered or fears an ally is cornered. I had to train my own mind to focus on this feeling when I needed to be invisible. Unfortunately, it also made me a devastatingly effective fighter as a cornered animal or person rarely holds back...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luana's dream...\" Thoughtful, I whispered. \"She felt cornered when shown nude pictures of herself by her friend, Boomer.\" I sighed, feeling a headache coming on. \"That is not going to be easy for her to master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to look through the other pages and found three subjects of interest. The problem was, I only had time to read one as mom was calling us down for breakfast and a talk.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The first list came with a brief note from Eli...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since that whatever it was crashed into the cliff walls at the edge of the city, back in 1852, every child born in our growing community developed special skills and abilities. When news of this spread, witch hunters and greedy business men came to investigate. We were the members of the first group to protect our city, including my sister, Ina and myself. We dedicated our immortal lives to stop those who would bring harm to us or to use us for their own selfish ends or means. We were the Soothsayers; those who fought against the so called witch hunters and power hungry business men who dared to enter our growing community. We were: Ina Mist, Eli Mist, Cy Keys, and Heather Wild. Unfortunately, Cy Keys fell into madness due not being able to be killed or die of old age. He became obsessed with learning all and obtaining all power, which corrupted him completely. He merged his first and last name, calling himself Sykes, the immortal thief. The rest of us tried to save him from himself but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the years passed, we continued our quest with other groups forming to protect the city including The Street Guardians, The Resistance Guild, and the somewhat famous Problem Child Gang. Heather joined the Problem Child Gang and fell in love with a powerhouse of a boy who called himself Tex the mighty. If you are ever in a bind, seek out the Soothsayers or the members of the groups below. They will help you; they you can trust...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shocked to find that I knew a lot of the people on the various short lists. Among them were my teacher from my old school, Sarah Barns, The technology tycoon and private investigator, Geo Tanner, and several others within the community!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is insane!\" Stunned, I whispered. \"All this time, I was surrounded by local legends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on my door pulled me away from Eli's notes. I opened the door to find Luana standing nervously in the hall. She was blushing brightly, causing me concern. \"What's wrong?\" Softly, I demanded. \"Did something happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuana nodded. \"I- I can't get that boy we saw at the grocery store out of my head.\" Tearfully, she said. \"I have to see him again, just to convince myself that there is no real feelings there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, fighting the urge to giggle. \"Oh, boy...\" Softly, I said. \"You got it bad, don't you, sis? Worse, you seriously aren't used to this from a girl's perspective...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Wincing, Luana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls have a lot more to risk when it comes to a relationship than boys; especially when it becomes... more involved.\" Serious, you explained. \"I think now is the perfect time for mom to give you The Talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuana gulped hearing the capital letters in 'The Talk'.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We can also look at makeup, if you're interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLu looked at her reflection in the mirror. \"Is my hair alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd like to do something with it, I'm sure the mall has a salon.\"</span></div></div>",

It's like when I stopped watching <i>Sesame Street</i>. One week, I loved Elmo, and the next, I was into different stuff. The only difference is, with this, I remember when I would have freaked if someone said I was into guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a whim, Lu decided to check out the makeup counter. The clerk put some stuff on her, then let her look in the mirror. \"Wow,\" Lu said. \"It's like it draws attention to my eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'll notice how we accentuate your cheekbones,\" the clerk said. \"Makeup is supposed to minimize flaws and focus on assets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLu didn't need much encouragement to add makeup to her purchases. Turning to me, the clerk asked, \"Can we do something for your other daughter, ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wear much makeup,\" I replied, showing her my cane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe took our purchases to a different cashier.

Dad ordered the guards to wait out in the hall as the chief of police, Ted Jones entered with his wife and two children. I recognized them as Garth and Grace. Chief Jones quietly closed the door before turning to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, everything said in this room is to be treated as beyond top secret.\" Serious, chief Jones said. \"Tell no one without first consulting myself or detective Steve Davenport. Second, none of you are required to go along with this but once you are in, there is no backing out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLu gulped. \"What are you trying to say, chief Jones?\" Nervous, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Jones sighed. \"The Problem Child Gang was a real group, as was The Guard.\" Darkly, he explained. \"We fought against real dangerous criminals who wished to do our fair city and its citizens harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a time, there was no need for us or so we thought.\" Jumping in, dad said. \"The time has come to pass the torch. Our old enemies have returned and a new Problem Child Gang has emerged to meet the challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, this new group is young and inexperienced as we were in the beginning and will need help; not only from the original members but from a second team of heroes.\" Firmly but kindly, Mrs Jones said. \"We need The Guard to rise up from the ashes with new members to be there when the new problem child gang is in need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be dangerous work; you will be placing your lives on the line.\" Serious, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only you have an advantage that we did not.\" Smiling slightly, chief Jones said. \"You have the police department on your side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't the police handle this threat?\" Wincing, Lu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, this is a serious and delicate matter.\" Frowning, chief Jones replied. \"We can't afford to bring too much attention to this city. We need to drive these threat out without the world at large knowing about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This city spawns people with unique and sometimes powerful abilities.\" Darkly, mom explained. \"If word got out, everyone born in this city will become a target of government agencies around the globe as well as dangerous individuals who would use their powers to advance their greed for wealth and influence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These attacks are all pointing at eliminating the original members.\" Serious, chief Jones said. \"So far, the attacks are all linked to one man, John Stalker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few friends and I have formed the new Problem Child Gang.\" Serious, Garth said. \"We can use an ally and we are hoping you are up to the challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Lu who knotted her jaws before nodding. \"We can't let those who blew up Violet's house get away with it.\" Softly, she said. \"Mrs D and Mr Mist would make them pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not argue with that. Mrs D, or Miss Shadow, had protected the city for a long time with Mr Mist, also known as the unknown guardian. I somehow knew that when I was given the symbiont, I was also passed a torch to carry on her legacy. I looked at everyone in the room before stating, \"Call me Miss Silhouette.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mirage.\" Pointing at herself, Lu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed before pointing at herself. \"Lady Fade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Fade?\" Giggling, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I was a teenager!\" Defending herself, mom said. \"I couldn't think of anything else that fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to get you a more updated 'username'.\" Smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will need more members.\" Serious, chief Jones said. \"I know a few people but we will have to work quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do we start?\" Nervous, Violet asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The moment you and your father are discharged from the hospital.\" Serious, Mrs McBride replied. She turned to me, noticing my surprised look. \"Yes, my husband has returned. It's a long story, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was part of an experiment that went wrong.\" Serious, Violet's father explained. \"Long story short I shrank to a microcosmic level. There I found a way to grow back to normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be part of the Guard?\" Curious, Lu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr McBride shrugged. \"If I am, it will be a base operation. I am better at logistics than fighting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then its settled.\" Serious, chief Jones said. \"I will contact you with names and addresses for you to gain more members. \"Time is against us; we must be ready for when our enemies make their next move.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then, she talks about what can go wrong in pregnancy. Then, she works her way to STIs. By the time she starts talking about contraceptives, you're wondering why she bothers, since you're pretty sure you never want to sleep with anyone as long as you live. She's already cautioned Lu about guys who get too clingy.

The only development was that Violet had chosen the name Iota.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuana thought she was ready for her date with Mike right up until Saturday night, when she got really nervous. \"What if something goes wrong?\" she asked. \"What if I turn invisible on our date?

Call me Detective.\" With that, he ushered Mike into the den and closed the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Sandra,\" Mom asked, \"what brings you on your brother's date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom said I might like the movie,\" Sandra replied. \"But I think it's a subterfuge. We have a cousin in New Jersey, about Mike's age, who had to drop out of school to take care of a baby, and Mom and Dad don't want that to happen to Mike or Luana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be, what, eight or nine?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking forward to the third grade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm starting high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this was going on, I could hear Dad talking to Mike in the den. <i>*What is your father talking about?*</i> Dee asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*I think he's explaining the local rape laws,*</i> I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Fascinating,*</i> Dee said. <i>*No such laws existed when my previous hosts were your age. I'm glad your culture has advanced so much.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Dad was sure Mike knew what he would and wouldn't be allowed to do, he brought Mike back out to the living room, and Mike, Lu, and Sandra went to the movies.</span></div></div>",

My heart began to race as I then heard the click of a bullet entering the chamber of a sidearm. Nervous, and afraid, I hurried out of my room, through the dark to get to mom and dad's bedroom. I managed to pound on the door twice before I saw a tall and muscular man standing at the top of the landing on the opposite end of the hall!

Uncle Stan was the fire chief, and he was telling us stories about some of the cases he had worked on, when there was a knock on the front door. \"I'll get it,\" Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mom opened the door, I heard a voice I hadn't expected to hear. I guess I figured he lived closer to our house than here. \"Hey, Mrs. Davenport. I thought that looked like your car in the driveway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom swallowed, something she always did before she spoke to him. \"Good morning, Scooter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently not one for standing on ceremony, Scooter let himself in, followed by his three buddies. \"Didn't expect to see you guys here. Where's Zack? Haven't seen him in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom always tried to be nice to people, but I could hear her heartbeat and breathing, and I could perceive her body temperature.

Only before she could respond, uncle Stan urged her to sit down and ordered her to take off her shirt. Blushing, she did so. Sure enough, Grace had been shot in the shoulder, right in the shoulder joint. \"Who did this to you?!\" Firmly, Uncle Stan demanded. \"What happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our house was invaded last night.\" Almost timidly, Grace replied. \"I thought I could take him but he got me right in the shoulder joint.\" She teared up. \"If it weren't dad and Garth coming to my rescue...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could feel Stan's heartbeat increasing and his body heat rising, he was not in the least impressed with her. \"You could have been shot in the heart, young lady.\" Sternly, he said. \"Was anyone else hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad and Garth went after the intruder and kicked his ass to the curb.\" Tearfully, Grace replied. \"He's in jail right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan examined the wound and sighed. \"You were very lucky.\" Serious, he said. \"The bullet bounced off the bone and exited out.\" He looked Grace in the eye. \"You are going to be sore for a while so take it easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan then began to wrap Grace's wound while I turned to Luana, concerned. \"Our house was not the only one invaded.

Two failures in two nights? People are starting to talk. Can't have that, now, can we? No, we cannot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must have missed the part where I'm supposed to care about your problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed his weapon again. \"What did I tell you about talking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I shouldn't be so predictable, and that you're going to kill me anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't say much about that. <i>I wish it really was Stalker,</i> I thought, <i>just for the expression on his face.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to lose,\" I told him. \"You couldn't beat the Problem Child Gang when they were my age, and now they're in city hall. Hang it up and find another hobby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got right in my face. \"Why are you so determined to die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be a lot of things. Maybe my cramps are super-bad. I've heard they're as bad as the pains of a heart attack. Or maybe I'm trying to ingratiate myself with you, so it'll be harder for you to kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe all I want is what you've given me for the past three minutes.\" I leaned into his face. \"Your undivided attention.\"</span></div></div>",

A second later, we saw the man literally fly backwards out of the women's restroom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Holly...!\"</i> Stunned, I thought. <i>\"She's the unknown Amazon!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, out of what seemed to be desperation, scrambled to his feet and tried to grab me to use as a shield! Only Luana delivered a crushing blow to his gut, knocking all of the fight that was left out of him. \"Jerk..\" Angry, she muttered. \"Picking on kids...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Amanda walked out with a shaking and sobbing Kyle. She had placed a jacket she had been wearing over her shoulders. Although I could not see it clearly, I could tell that her blouse had been ripped wide open, revealing her bra underneath. Her skirt was also damaged and she was bruised on her face and wrists. Seeing this, I saw red... the man had tried to rape her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have already called for security.\" Returning to her normal size, Amanda said. \"Caitlin, summon a bottle of whiskey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough uncertain, Caitlin, with her mental powers summoned a bottle of whiskey of which Amanda poured onto the unconscious man with her gloved hand. She then placed the empty bottle in his hand. \"A reason for his actions and condition.\" Firmly, she explained. \"This part of the mall has no security cameras and this scum likely knows it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Fawn hurried over to Kyle who was still shaking and crying. As she did her best to comfort her, I turned to Luana to see that she had swallowed down a hard lump. It was a close call and an unfortunate wake up call for two newly formed teenage girls as to the dangerous world they now live in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

(giggle) number among your many contacts.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rina fell silent and Kyra shook her head, looking concerned. \"I hope she doesn't make a habit of that, it felt really weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she have to use a phone for a reference tool?\" Wincing, Dana asked. \"I'll never look at my cellphone the same again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced as well though I did find the humor in it. Dana is never anywhere without her phone. Suddenly, it hit me. \"That wasn't a joke, it was a clue!\" Serious, I blurted out. \"Unlock your phone and give it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken back, Dana gave me her phone. \"How can you see the icons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The icons give off heat in the shape they are in including the lettering.\" Quickly, I said. \"I'll just be a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved to Dana's contacts list and smiled. \"It's just as I suspected. All of the powers I had seen you use belong to those on your contact list. You took a piece of their aura while talking to them on the phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the phone is the tool?\" Surprised, Dana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of them at least.\" Shrugging, I said. \"I'd lay off the phone chatter for a while until we can figure this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana nodded. \"Mom said I needed a break from it anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, I decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I listened to a young man, and let his silver words lead me away from God's plan for me. A few words was all it took, and my virtue was as if it had never been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*That sounds like J.T.'s work,*</i> Dee told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's why the curse fell upon me. The devil sent the Beast to tempt me, and I failed the test, so God saw fit to punish me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was our fourteenth birthday when it happened. My twin brother, Jackson, had been fooling around with a riding lawnmower, when he fell into a ravine. The lawnmower teetered on the edge. I ran to it, hoping to pull it away. Suddenly, this force flew out from behind my eyes and pushed the mower into the ravine, right on top of Jackson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My screams brought the others out of the house. They all assumed it was an accident. Only I knew that he was dead because of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed. \"I kept it bottled up for years, never letting anyone know of the evil within me. Then, last year, I was walking down the street in the shopping district, when I suddenly bumped into Faith. It puzzled me, because I had left her back at the house, and she was wearing different clothes from what I knew she owned. I asked her what she was doing, but she didn't want to talk to me. Then, it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found out later that the driver was trying to close a business deal while driving, but all I could see was his car coming at me. I remember thinking, I don't want to die, God, let me live. Then that terrible force came out of me again. I thought it would stop the car, but it only deflected it, sent it on a new course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At Jeremy,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"I am cursed to kill and destroy whenever I want only to save.\" She began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down next to her and put my arm around her. \"You're not cursed, Mrs. Richardson. You have the power of telekinesis. But your fear of it prevents you from controlling it. And now, that fear controls you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J.T. has uncanny powers of persuasion,\" Dana added. \"You have to know what you're dealing with to have a chance against him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not cursed, and you're not damned. You're just a frightened woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe turned. Faith had awakened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to save him,\" she said. \"I wanted to give my baby its daddy. Instead, all I could do was watch him die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, baby,\" Mrs. Richardson said. \"I'm sorry he died because of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Momma. You didn't make that man drive and talk on the phone.\" She sat up and hugged her mother. \"You wanted to save him, just like I did. But we couldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pushed the car away from his body, Momma. You tried to save his life, not take it.\"</span></div></div>",

Still, I was not about to press over the telephone. \"When would you like me to come over?\" Politely, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Richardson gave an audible sigh of relief. \"We are leaving to see the doctor in twenty minutes.\" More calmly, she said. \"I appreciate you coming along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem, Mrs Richardson.\" Kindly, I said. \"I'll see you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon ending the call, I turned to Laura who I knew had walked up behind me the moment she detected stress in my voice. \"I think Mrs Richardson is in trouble.\" Worried, I said. \"That or something really has her frightened or worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was silent for a moment. \"Perhaps she had never gone to the doctor in fear of her 'curse' being discovered.\" Serious, she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good guess but no... its deeper than that, I think.\" Serious, I said. \"She has asked me to go with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'm going too.\" Serious, Laura said. \"You know I'd follow you anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed at that. \"Okay.

I could smell the gun oil and hear them lightly flapping around in their holsters when they moved. The first man opened a pair of handcuffs and I expertly twisted out of his grasp before locking the cuff onto his wrist instead! I then twisted his arm and locked the other cuff into place on his other wrist behind his back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second man took a swing at me but I heard him coming and easily dodged his attack before kicking my leg up high, catching him in the jaw, sending him stumbling backwards. I then dodged the first man who tried to charge me and gave him a push into the second, knocking them both over. That was when the second man drew his pistol. For some reason, I froze. I had never faced the barrel of a gun before so I had no idea what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to take a nap, kid.\" Forcefully, the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he moved to pull the trigger only to find the weapon knocked out of his hand by an invisible force! I turned to find Mrs Richardson pointing a single finger at the attacker with tears in her yes. \"Bang...\" Softly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled but it quickly turned to fear as I saw a fifth man coming up behind Mrs Richardson raising the butt end of his pistol! I wanted to cry out a warning but found it was not needed as an invisible force knocked the man away before Laura appeared beside Mrs Richardson. I was relieved to see that my sister had made short work of the two who came after her as I saw them picking themselves up off the pavement a moment later. \"There are more of these jerks coming!\" Urgently, Laura warned. \"We need to get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not need any further motivation. We all jumped into the car to find faith shaking as if she had seen a ghost. \"What's wrong, Faith?\" Worried, her mother demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of them tried to grab me but someone pulled him away.\" Tearfully, Faith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was it?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can worry about it later.\" Knotting her jaws, Mrs Richardson said. \"We need to go, right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit the accelerator and sped through the sparse traffic with two cars with tinted windows following. I could smell the sweat on her brow as cars she could not go around suddenly skidded to one side of the road or the other before skidding back behind her! It was effectively slowing down our pursuers but I could tell it was quickly wearing her down. I turned to look back and saw that we had successfully shaken off all but two of the black cars <i>\"What to do... what to do...</i>\" Biting my lip, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thought was interrupted by Mrs Richardson suddenly crying out, \"Everyone hang on, Jesus is taking the wheel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly turned the car a full three hundred and sixty degrees in a high speed spin before driving right at the two pursuing cars! I held my breath wondering if she had suddenly lost her mind. Only, to my surprise and slight horror, her eyes were closed shut!  The car raced towards the two cars and the drivers swerved to avoid a collision only to run into other cars, causing a minor pile up that blocked the freeway! Mrs Richardson opened her eyes and sighed seeing that no one was seriously hurt then quickly turned the car around and continued down the freeway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Problem Child!\" Grinning, Mrs Richardson declared. She giggled. \"I kind of always wanted to say that as a kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith giggled but her mind was still on the mysterious boy who had saved her. He was near her height, muscular, with short dust brown hair and blue eyes. \"Who was that...?\" Curious, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe later told me what the boy looked like and I rubbed my chin in thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It never occurred to me that you were time travelling, certainly not that you did it through paintings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith nodded. \"It's been puzzling you for over a year, but, for me, it started just a few weeks ago. But, wait a minute. How come I didn't notice you when I brought the portrait? I'm sure I would have noticed a near double of Jeremy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's going to come as a shock,\" Justin said. \"Until a week ago, I was Jeremy's little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Richardson gasped at this. Faith looked at Luana and me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expected more of a reaction,\" Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \"We've had some experience with girls who used to be boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Present company included,\" Luana added, raising her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" I continued, \"a boy who used to be a girl is only logical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin hugged Luana. \"I just wish I could have known you when it happened. It was such a shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid the shocks are gonna keep coming,\" Faith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith took hold of Justin's hands. \"You're going to be an uncle.\"</span></div></div>",

I made a more thorough examination of the battle staves. It appeared that the staves could connect at a certain point. When I tried it, the connected staves elongated into a staff. \"If I didn't already have these,\" I said, \"I'd want some of my own.\" Reversing the process was as simple as twisting the staves apart again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang.

When the picture came in, Faith gasped. \"Jeremy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Jeremy said. \"In less than 24 hours, I will be dead. I want you all to know that I'm okay with this. It has to be this way. Not because we can't change the future, because I've done that before, but because this will set things in motion that are certain to bring about the end of the Agency. If all goes according to plan, this video is being watched by a human weapon, a shield, a visionary, the new team's muscle, and the Wild Card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't hard to tell who he meant, and the five of us looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Jeremy continued, \"it would take more than my death to bring you all together, so you know I've been busy. That's right, not everything that's happened to you was as random as it appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Convincing Mrs. D was no trouble. When I told her I needed her to pass on her legacy to her protege, she said she'd been planning to do that all along. She's taken a special interest in you, Melissa. You've got her confidence in you. Never forget that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eli Mist was a tougher nut to crack. He didn't like being the Invisible Shield, and he'd hoped that the position would die with him. It wasn't until I told him that Mrs. D had planned all along to give her powers to Melissa that he decided she would need someone, 'to protect her from herself,' as he put it. He tried to make it sound like he had his doubts, but I could tell he saw something in you, Luana. He wouldn't give you the powers of the Invisible Shield if he didn't think you could do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyra, your clairvoyance will serve you well. You will know what tactics haven't worked, and you can advise Melissa and Luana on how to avoid them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin, I had to mislead you a bit. I knew Faith's name all along, and I knew how she got in and out of the house. I didn't tell you because I needed the mystery to keep you interested, and I needed for you not to do anything until the rest was in place. You've always seen yourself as a delicate flower, but now you know your real strength. Do not doubt your ability to protect those who need you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dana, you have powers even you don't yet know. You might think you just soak up other people's powers, but you can do more when you're needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faith, I'm sorry that I never told you how I feel about you. Maybe I had an excuse in school and just hanging around, but I should have told you that night we shared. I love you, Faith. I want you to know that, as scary as things may be now, you will see a world without the Agency. I'm sorry I won't be there to see it with you, but at least a part of me will grow up knowing no other world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the video ended.</span></div></div>",

These children stink of sulfur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're talking about your own daughter, sir,\" Chief Jones said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I disavow Satan's harlot!\" he bellowed. \"I cast her out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith ran to him. \"Daddy, you can't mean - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Mr. Richardson struck her across the face, and she fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone else could react, Dana reached out and touched Faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the fallen girl opened her eyes and sat up bolt upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Richardson turned on her husband. \"I cast <i>you</i> out, Todd Richardson! Get out, and stay out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>dare</i> - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said get <i>out!</i> I'll have your things sent to you! Now, are you going to leave voluntarily, or should I ask Chief Jones here to escort you to some city accommodations?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get to make many arrests sitting behind a desk,\" Chief Jones replied. \"And committing assault and battery on a pregnant teenager is certainly a criminal offense. You're under arrest, Todd Richardson. You have the right to remain silent.\" Chief Jones continued reading Mr. Richardson his rights as he led him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that being taken care of, Mrs. Richardson turned her attention back to Faith, who had picked up a pen and a sheet of paper, and was now drawing with considerable speed. \"Are you okay, Faith, darling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith said nothing, only driving away on whatever she was working on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she's just... drawing to draw something,\" Luana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Faith's hand wobbled over the paper, and she set down her pen. \"What... what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember, baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"I remember Daddy was yelling, and, the next thing I knew, I was lying on the floor, and my mind was racing. What happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid your father hurt you, Faith. But he's gone now, and I promise you, he'll never hurt you again. But how did you get better so quickly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think <i>I</i> did that,\" Dana said. \"I can absorb other people's soul energy, making their powers my own. I think, when I touched Faith after she was hurt, I gave her her energy back. It healed her, and made her feel the need to draw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You found a new aspect of your powers,\" I said, \"just like Jeremy said.\"</span></div></div>",

Looking around, I discovered it was coming from Miss Shadow's costume. Upon closer inspection, I found a cellphone in one of the pockets. I answered on the fourth ring and, for some strange reason, I said, \"Talk to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Shadow, we are grateful you are still among us.\" A feminine voice said. \"Enemies of old have returned. They are after the children of the original problem child gang and its allies. Can you assist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"I am sorry to be the one to bring you this news but the ones you know as Miss Shadow and the Invisible Shield have passed away.\" Sadly, I reported. \"I am Miss Silhouette, the torch had been passed onto my sister and I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause. I could hear the woman crying on the other end. \"Miss Shadow and the Invisible Shield have passed away.\" I heard her say to someone on the other line. \"They have chosen their successors, a Miss Silhouette and a new Invisible Shield... her sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard more people crying on the other line. I even heard one slam a fist onto a wooden surface I could only assume was a table. Ms D had touched more lives than I had thought, possibly more than I could imagine. <i>*The one talking to you is known as Creed.*</i> Calmly, Dee said. <i>*She is second in command of The Cloaked Dagger, Europe's version of the problem child gang.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my heart race. <i>\"When Jeremy said he had been busy, he wasn't just being metaphoric.\"</i> Impressed, I thought. Knotting my jaws in decision, I firmly said, \"Enemies of old have returned to us on this end as well, Creed. There is not a moment to lose if we are to stop them once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreed seemed surprised. \"How did you...\" Softly, she began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Miss D kept detailed journals of her adventures.*</i> Softly, Dee said. <i>*I have no doubt Chief Jones will give them to you soon.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why didn't he...\"</i> Sad, you began...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Evidence... he owes it to her to be as thorough as possible when investigating her death due to both hers and Eli's house being ransacked.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can discuss that at length after this is all over, Creed.\" Interrupting her, I firmly said. \"What do you know so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreed took a breath. \"We rescued two children from the Agency.\" Serious, Creed began. \"Tommy and Aura Winters. From what we have gathered from them, the Agency and CHILD are in a race to create an army of super powered child soldiers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped. \"The  children of the various effected cities...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\" Darkly, Creed said. \"Tommy has told us that they want the children of the original problem child gang as a form of revenge. Aura informed us that they want those with the power to stop them eliminated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Tommy and Aura know of any weaknesses within the Agency?\" Hopeful, I inquired. \"Anything we could use against them will be helpful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard a small boy's voice say, \"A Dr Hagen is working for them. He was the primary doctor of most of the original members before a Dr. Hal took over their cases. He is not aware of their true identities... yet.\" He paused. \"He is the most vulnerable member of the organization.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a start, at least.\" Eying Chief Jones, I said. \"I will bring the new problem child gang and their allies up to speed. Thank Tommy and Aura for their courage and resolve, we will keep in touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then ended the call and turned to Chief Jones. \"Fire your primary doctor, chief.\" Sternly, I said. \"He is a lackey of the Agency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr Hagen?\" Surprised, Chief Jones asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly relayed everything that Creed had told me to which Chief Jones turned red and grabbed a cellphone from his pocket. \"Puer Quaestio...

She was very short and petite with doll like features, waist length auburn hair and gentle green eyes. Both seemed rather jumpy as they stepped off the plane.

That's absolutely necessary, because the only way to resist him is to know exactly what he's up to. I'm going to throw a good solid scare into him.

The other day, we were surrounded, and I didn't know about it until Luana told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of... \" Luana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see them,\" Chief Jones said. \"But they're about to learn it's not wise to challenge my driving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard some buttons being pushed, some switches being thrown, and we were flying. That may sound like hyperbole, but I swear we got airborne at one point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we touched ground again, there was only one thing to say, and we all said it, in unison: \"Problem Child!\"</span></div></div>",

He had short light brown hair and blue eyes. To the unsuspecting, he appeared to be quite handsome and gentle. However, Tommy and Aura shuddered at the very sight of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is cold and ruthless.\" Softly, Tommy said. \"He's raped twelve women in the past twenty four hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He enjoys the power he has over young people, to play with their minds and bodies.\" Almost whispering, Aura said. She teared, up clearly afraid. \"Please tell me we don't have to be in the same room with that monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy blood ran cold, hearing that. I made a mental note to thank mom for warning me to avoid him. To think there was such a person in our fair city who raped innocent women and perhaps children and got away with it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be alone.\" Serious, Garth said from behind. \"If he makes any sudden moves, he will get the second biggest scare of his life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garth Jones, also known as Goliath, has the ability to become a powerhouse just like his father.\" Smiling, I said. \"That man won't be able to even get close without getting the pounding of his life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get this over with then.\" Serious, Chief Jones said. He turned to Tommy. \"Can you get the proof we need for your accusations against Carlos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy and Aura nodded. \"I can give you a description of all those he attacked and the addresses of those he is targeting now.\" Serious, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can give you a detailed list of all those he had attacked in the past.\" Also serious, Aura added. \"this monster has to be stopped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Jones nodded. \"You are very brave, children.\" Gently, he said. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he entered the interrogation room where J.T. was impatiently waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another accusation of wrong doing against me, Chief Jones?\" Calmly, he asked. \"What is it now, twelve misunderstandings this week alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Jones did not say a word. He walked to the camera that monitored the interrogation and pulled the wire out before dropping it to the floor. J.T. fell silent, raising a single eyebrow. \"I want my attorney...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Jones placed his badge and gun onto a table under the dark window away from J.T., increasing his nervousness. From the observation room, I gulped wondering what he was planning to do. He then turned away from the window, an ominous look upon his face, one J.T. seemed to recognize as all the color quickly began to drain from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been waiting twenty years for this moment.\" Darkly, Chief Jones said. \"You can't hide from me anymore... <i>Carlos.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.T.'s eyes went wide and his face turned ghostly pale as Chief Jones unleashed his muscular energy and grew from a six foot muscular man to a ten foot Olympian giant! \"Tex the mighty...!\" Gasping, he wailed. \"I thought you were killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought the same of you... Carlos.\" His voice booming, Chief Jones countered. \"Now we get to finish our business and pay old debts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the desk between him and J.T. and threw it as if it were cardboard! It literally shattered upon hitting the door, knocking it halfway off its hinges! J.T., or rather, Carlos screamed in complete terror, backing himself into a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Desperately, he pleaded. \"Wait... we can still cut a deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should rip your arms and legs off and leave you in a hospital bed for the rest of your natural life...\" Gravely, Chief Jones said. \"For all those you victimized, all those whose lives you had destroyed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door opened and Garth walked in in the guise of Goliath who stood at seven feet tall. He was not as tall as his father but just as powerful. \"That is enough, Chief Jones.\" Forcefully, he said. \"This <i>garbage</i> is not worth throwing away your career or your freedom as a good citizen of Waterfront City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the observation room, I could not help smile. <i>\"That's a bit cheesy.\"</i> Giggling inside, I thought. <i>\"He needs to work on his dialog.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a police matter... Goliath.\" Growling, Chief Jones hissed. \"We do not tolerate vigilantism in this city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet, you are practicing it now.\" Calmly, Garth countered. \"Take your badge and your gun. Find a place to collect your thoughts then come back.\" He then eyed Carlos, quivering on the floor. \"He's not going anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, or seemingly reluctantly, Chief Jones collected his badge and gun then left the room, closing what was left of the heavy door. Once alone, Garth turned to Carlos. \"Take a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Eyes narrowing, Carlos demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I don't have to force you to.\" Coldly, Garth countered. \"Or would you prefer I call Chief Jones back before he has a chance to cool off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos turned another shade of pale before quickly returning to the chair he was in. \"What is it you want from me?\" Dropping his innocent act, he asked. \"I don't remember locking horns with you in the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be grateful for that.\" With equal coldness, Garth countered. \"I am here to introduce you to two friends of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos raised a single eyebrow but smiled as Tommy and Aura nervously stepped in. They were both wearing masks to hide their faces but it was obvious to Carlos that they were very young. \"Good day, children.\" Sweetly, he said. \"Did you wish to talk to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy frowned and described every woman and teenage girl he had raped in the last twenty four hours. Aura then rambled off all the addresses and names of those he planned to target within the next twenty four hours along with the exact location of where he kept his 'bragging journal' as he called it. Carlos turned from one to the other, his face about as pale as a person's can get as Garth then ushered them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you want all of that and a lot more in the open, I suggest you answer all of my questions without hesitation or deception.\" Coldly, Garth said. \"Be fair warned, they will immediately know when you lie and it will cost you a cracked bone...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I nodded at Garth as he entered the room then became curious as Caitlin Spencer walked in behind him. She was wearing a knee length black pleated skirt, white blouse, and a black blazer. I shuddered upon noticing she was wearing a unique mask that showed no features what so ever. I knew it was her as Dee had helped me identify the subtle differences in people's body temperatures. It was how Miss Shadow knew who was in the room before they even spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, this is Mysteria.\" Serious, Garth said. \"She is going to help us tie up a loose end before we finish with Carlos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised a single eyebrow, curious. Caitlin turned to the window and looked at Carlos for a moment before shuddering of a certain chill. \"All memory of who Tex the mighty is has been removed from his sick and twisted mind.\" Softly, she said. \"All he knows is that Goliath interrogated him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth again nodded. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Caitlin had left, Chief Jones walked in, concerned. \"Did you get everything you needed from him... Goliath?\" In a forced calm, he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got a full written confession of all his crimes from his brag journal and target notes hidden in a wall safe.\" Serious, Garth replied. \"Our shape-shifting friend, Metamorph and his partner, Amazon acquired them for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once he saw them in Goliath's hands, he immediately asked to make a deal.\" Calmly, I added. \"I have a feeling he knows all too well what danger he would be in from the people of this city should any of that information got out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He still knows who I am.\" Frowning, Chief Jones said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mysteria took care of that little problem.\" Smiling, Garth said. \"She could not get into his head while his defenses were up. The interrogation knocked those walls down and she removed that memory from his mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Jones sighed in relief. \"Good work, everyone.\" With a hint of pride, he said. \"You make the old gang proud.\" He paused. \"Did you get any information on the Agency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the deal we struck.\" Serious, Garth said. \"He gives us everything he has on the Agency and all this evidence against him does not see the light of day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy then gave a dark grin. \"However, one lie and it all falls into the open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAura nodded, a look of vindictiveness on her face. \"Including him singing about the Agency and its plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Jones seemed impressed, also proud. \"Then let us see how well he sings now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, he walked into the interrogation room with a mock look of surprise. \"I thought they would have put you into a better room than this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is fine.\" Shaken, Carlos said quietly. He looked broken, nothing like the confident charmer he was hours before. \"I wave my right to an attorney, I am ready to talk...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And the current head goes by the code name Jasmine, not Joachim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... so why did you ask me all those questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To find out just how overconfident in your ability to lie your way out of a predicament you are.\" He gathered the papers and Carlos's confession. \"I think I can get this to the media in time for the 11:00 news. The paper will have it for the morning.\" He looked at the panicked expression on J.T.'s face. \"Oh. You're free to go. You're done in this town, anyway. Maybe that private island of yours has enough food and liquor to tide you over for a week or so, once the nearby government decides to block all incoming shipments. I can wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like the air was leaking out of him. J.T. knew the Chief had won.

I'd like to have a word with my client.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Jones shrugged. \"Have all the words you want. He waived counsel, and gave us a full confession.\"</span></div></div>",

Very few even know it exists as it was abandoned for decades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The entrance is in the city of Rome but there is no easy way in without detection.\" Softly, Tommy said. \"These people are very paranoid about getting invaded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likely due to their last encounter with the problem child gang.\" Serious, Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded then turned to Tommy ans Aura. \"do either of you know of a secret way in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy and Aura became fearful before replying...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could hear Mike on the other line, pressing the phone tighter against his ear as if trying to pick up some kind of sound. Finally, he sighed. \"You worry too much, Luana.\" With a chuckle, he said. \"Next Saturday is fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mike.\" Grateful, Luana said. \"Maybe we can catch that meteor shower they've been talking about on the news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" Lightly, Mike said. \"Enjoy your trip and I'll see you when you get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging up, Luana turned to me with a sigh. \"That went a lot more smoothly than I feared it would.\" Relieved, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think you made him worry.\" Wincing, I said. \"You gulped in mid sentence and stammered, that can send all the wrong signals. I heard him pressing the phone tight against his ear, trying to pick up background sounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuana shuddered. \"You can be scary at times, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that. \"Me?\" Feigning surprise, I asked. \"I am not the one who can turn a coin into a cannon like dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to me, on the opposite side of town, Mike slowly hung up the telephone and turned to a towering figure in the shadows of the hall outside of his bedroom. \"Problem...?\" Calmly, a deep voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Luana is in danger, dad.\" Worried, Mike said. \"She cancelled our date for Saturday saying that her dad got called off on a business trip to Europe but her father is a police detective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's father remained in the shadows. \"That is strange.\" Raising a hand to his chin, he said. \"Was there anything else that you found unusual? Did she stammer, gulp, leave any other clues?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike nodded. \"I heard her gulp and she did stammer.\" Wincing, he said. \"I could hear someone breathing close to her.\" He teared up. \"She could have been kidnapped and I'm just sitting here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike threw off his covers only his father stepped into the dim light of his room. He was massively  muscular, wearing pajama shorts and a muscle shirt. He was also covered in heavy hair from his head to his toe. \"Steady there, pup!\" Sternly, he barked. \"Don't go running in half cocked!\" He then more softly added, \"We have more subtle ways of confirming if our friends are in danger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, back at aunt Fawn's house, I heard the growling of a large dog or wolf outside.

Dad answered and immediately hugged the elderly woman who was at the door. She was near your height with white hair tied into a small bun near the top of her head and deep green eyes. She was professionally dressed and carried a willow wood cane with a small crystal ball on the top. It was clear to me that dad greatly respected her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madame Vague, I am honored to be in your presence.\" Smiling, dad said. \"What brings you to my brother's home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not an official visit, Tinker.\" Smiling back Vague replied. \"However, I would warn you that dark forces are at play.\" She sighed. \"I am here to see our new allies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart raced at the mention of the woman's name. Madame Vague was a powerful ally to Miss Shadow. She had given cryptic advice to her and the members of the original problem child gang in times of doubt. She even occasionally fought along side Miss Shadow herself as she was nearly as immortal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Madame Vague has a unique power.*</i> Softly, Dee told me. <i>*Some have called it magic but it goes far deeper than just that. Not even Miss Shadow fully understood it.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Miss Silhouette.\" Starling me, Vague said. She giggled at my expression. \"You need to learn to keep one ear and one eye open at all times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working on it.\" Blushing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVague smiled. \"I understand that you have trouble seeing paintings and photographs.\" Calmly, she said. \"Miss Shadow had similar issues but there is a way around that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Surprised, I asked. \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have an extra pair of eyes that you have not yet opened.\" Cryptically, Vague said. \"Do not be afraid to let in the light.\" She then turned to Laura who was standing right next to me, looking concerned. \"Eli spoke highly of you, young lady though I doubt he admitted it to you.\" Smiling, she said. \"He saw a lot of himself in you which was why he was reluctant to give you the power you now possess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gulped. \"Got any advice for me?\" Nervous, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVague smiled kindly. \"You can learn a lot from Kyra's mistake.\" Cryptically, she said. \"A cry into the darkness sometimes brings an answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she walked over to Tommy and Aura, leaving me confused. <i>\"Now I know why they call her Madame Vague.\"</i> Confused, I thought. <i>\"Any idea what she might have meant, Dee?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee giggled. <i>*She was referring to me.*</i> Calmly, she explained. <i>*While you and I do communicate, we need to act as one for you to be able to use my eyes.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confused me more. <i>\"How can you see?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Telepathically.* Simply, Dee replied. *Tommy Winters has the same ability.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I understood. <i>\"You see through the eyes of every creature around you, including people.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Correct.*</i> Calmly, Dee said. <i>*Just because you do not see the fly or the dove or the rat does not mean they are not there.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my heart race again as I turned to a photograph hanging on the wall. Though I knew now was not the right time, I could not wait to be able to sense such things. <i>\"What of Laura?\"</i> Curious, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*She has a symbiont too, Melissa.* Simply, Dee replied. <i>*Only like Kyra, she does not yet know how to reach her as she was raised to face her battles alone.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, knowing I would have to help Laura with that before we left Friday morning for Italy; it was Wednesday morning. Thankfully, the beginning of summer vacation. It would have been harder if we had to deal with school on top of all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look upon me with your gifts and make your own judgement.\" Calmly, Vague said to Tommy and Aura. \"If you feel you can trust me, we will continue. If not, I will leave you in peace without protest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy and Aura turned to each other then looked at Vague for what seemed like an eternity though it was only a minute or two. Finally, they smiled. \"We trust you.\" softly, Tommy said. Aura nodded, indicating the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVague smiled then offered to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, Luana meditated, getting to know her symbiont.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Gaia enjoyed a pretzel, I caught a familiar scent, and gripped Luana's arm. \"What is it?\" she asked, more than a hint of annoyance in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wolf is on the plane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around the cabin. \"Can you tell where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"It's the same air circulating all over the plane. It could be anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we landed, we looked around as inconspicuously as we could, but nobody collected a wolf.</span></div></div>",

She was tall and slender with shoulder length blond hair and hazel eyes. \"Miss Silhouette and the Invisible shield, I presume.\" Flatly, she said. We nodded. \"I am Creed and the man with me is Ace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded to the man, Ace. He was a bald, slender and muscular man of average height with piercing green eyes. \"We need to hurry.\" Whispering, I said. \"I caught the scent of a wolf nearby and I fear he is stalking us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreed and Ace looked about, their eyes sharp before quickly escorting the two of us out of the airport to an awaiting car. We all piled in and Ace drove off towards Rome. \"Does this wolf you sniffed have a name?\" Curious, Creed asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the strange part of it.\" Honestly, I said. \"I was not being metaphoric. I sniffed out a real wolf and he was on the plane with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know it was a he?\" Also curious, Ace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a rueful smile. \"Let's just say I know what a male smells like when he is excited and leave it at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuana winced at that but only I seemed to notice. Thanks to Gaia, I caught Ace sharing a worried glance with Creed through the rear view mirror. <i>\"They know this wolf or at least know of him.\"</i> Worried, I thought. <i>\"But do they know him as a friend or foe?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************************************************</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the airport, Mike walked off the plane into the terminal to see Melissa and Luana walking towards two adults and became concerned. \"They are not with their father, as I had suspected.\" Worried, he muttered. \"I better tail them until I have a better idea of what is going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Melissa turned his way, looking spooked. He saw her twitching her nose, sniffing the air. <i>\"She can smell me?!\"</i> Surprised, he thought. <i>\"It makes sense as she is blind, he other senses naturally would be more acute.\"</i> He knotted his jaws in decision. <i>\"I will have to be careful.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSticking to the crowds, Mike followed Melissa and Luana out of the airport where he saw them enter a black sedan with tinted windows and drive off as high speed. Knowing he had seconds before he lost them, he ran along the side of the road after the car. He was more than capable to keep up with the car, having the skills he possessed, his concern was losing sight of it. Worse, he feared the driver or passengers would discover he was following. His father's words rang in his mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Cloaked Dagger deals with people who do not care who they kill to get what they are after.\" Serious, he had warned. \"That said, they tend to shoot first and ask questions later.

It was to slow down anyone who managed to gain entry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking nearly a dozen turns passed various rooms and other hallways, we entered a large conference room where everyone was urged to take a seat. Waiting for them were a small number of adults in their early to mid thirties with serious expressions on their faces. Creed urged us both to sit down side by side as a boy no older than myself walked up with his hands passively behind his back. Professionally dressed, he was rather muscular with black hair and piercing green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, children.\" Calmly, he said. \"My group name is Cog. As you may or may not have guessed, I have not aged in over fifty years. I have the ability to slow down or even work outside of normal time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible...\" Stunned, I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that even possible?\" Perplexed, Luana demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now, all you need to understand is that there are certain places on our planet where powerful people are born.\" Serious, Cog replied. \"that said, there are powerful people, both good and evil, after the secrets of these places.\" He sighed. \"It is our job to protect those secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing we are a part of that secret.\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All those born in these places are a part of that secret.\" Gently, Creed said. \"The point is, we cannot allow that power to fall into the wrong hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hence the birth of the Cloaked Dagger and The Problem Child Gang.\" Serious, Cog said. \"We all knew and understood that the fight would rekindle eventually as it had again and again all around the world for decades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An endless waltz...\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCog nodded. \"Precisely.\" Firmly, he replied. \"All we can do is put out the fires in front of us and pray others after us pick up the fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've already met Creed and Ace.\" Calmly, Cog said. \"Creed has a twin sister, named Vendetta who is working as a double agent in the Agency with her 'handler' Josh who works for the British secret Service in conjunction with MI5.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreed smiled. \"We both are literally masters in all styles of fighting with gun, knife or bare hand.\" Calmly, she said. \"We are nearly untouchable in combat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCog nodded. \"Ace has the ability to literally become one with any vehicle, piloting them with incredible skill. He can also possess any person he chooses and 'pilot' them as well within a certain distance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's insane...\" Startled, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more insane than the powers of Miss shadow and the Invisible shield, which I assume they passed on to the two of you.\" Calmly, a plump man in loose fitting clothing said. \"They call me Freak. I have the ability to grow into a literal giant and fire energy blasts from my hands. Originally, I worked for a group called The Guard back in the States but they asked me to give them a hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreak had gentle blue eyes but his wind burned face was covered in scars, making me wince, he reminded me of my uncle Stan without his shirt on. He smiled kindly at my reaction. \"I have looked worse after a mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They call me Blacksmith.\" A towering muscular man said. \"I built anything and everything they needed from Assault rifles to Zeno tapes.\" He smiled. \"Also, I'm not half bad when it comes to fighting if I have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded but winced as I saw through Gaia that Blacksmith seemed to be made or at least covered in steel from head to toe with just his green eyes showing through a steel mask. Luana, I noticed was crying for the man. \"What happened to you?\" Shocked, she asked. \"Who did this to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blacksmith was badly injured during our last mission twenty years ago.\" Sadly, Cog replied. \"He had shielded us from a massive explosion that would have killed us all.\" He paused, rubbing one eye. \"He may have had a body like steel but he still suffered from third degree burns over more than seventy percent of his body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This steel seeped from my own body to protect me while I slowly healed.\" With a slight smile, Blacksmith explained. \"It stayed so I am now literally a 'man of steel'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded at that as did Luana. \"We know from experience that this job is dangerous.\" Serious, i said. \"We are here to help and we are not about to back out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuana nodded firmly, signifying that she agreed. Cog nodded in return. \"We are glad to hear that, Miss Silhouette and invisible Shield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may call me Gargoyle.\" Calmly, another muscular man said. \"I have the ability to shape shift into any creature I desire, past, present, or mythological. My brother has the same powers but he has moved to the States to help the clean up crew there.\" He frowned. \"I heard that he and his wife produced a child who, after a failed assassination attempt, was born with an advanced form of our powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGargoyle had longish black hair and piercing green eyes with a face, an entire body that looked as if it were carved from stone. All I could do was nod in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may call me Mirage.\" Calmly, a slender woman said. \"I have the ability to create solid illusions to distract, slow down, or even fight any would be pursuers or enemies.\" She sighed. \"Make no mistake, what you are hearing, The Agency already knows as we have dealt with them on more than a few occasions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage had long brown hair and brown eyes and wore regular western style clothing which confused me. A bemused smile formed on her face seeing my expression. \"The best way to vanish into a crowd is to blend in.\" Smiling slightly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the original members of The Cloaked Dagger.\" Serious, Cog said. \"The children who came out to greet you are the next generation of freedom fighters, the new Cloaked Dagger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I slowly turned to see four men in security uniforms walk up to me with metal batons in hand. I could smell gun oil so I knew that they were armed. I gripped my special walking stick in case a fight was necessary but decided to act blind for the moment. It was dark and the guards did not have any night vision equipment on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a restricted area, kid.\" Firmly, the second guard barked. \"Move along!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know why but a small grin toughed the corners of my mouth. \"I don't think so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, my walking stick came in half with a twist and extended into two fighting staffs. With a quick spin, I knocked out the first two guards with a blow to their jaws. The other two, surprise on their faces, reached for their guns. The first found himself being hit by an invisible force while the other screamed being tackled by a wolf the size of a bear! the force of the tackle knocked the man out but the wolf jumped back with a loud whimper of pain as a shot rang out from the darkness. I turned to the wolf to find it had been shot in the shoulder and was bleeding badly. I then turned to the gunshot to find four other guards approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry, love.\" Came a male British voice. \"It's just a small patrol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could react, a small boy, no older than ten appeared next to me. He was dressed in old western style clothing with a black scarf around his eyes and baton in each hand. \"Who...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name is Madcap.\" Calmly, the boy replied. \"I'm blind too but my other senses make up for it nicely.\" He motioned to the approaching guards. \"We can talk after we deal with these blokes and see to your Lycan friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to the wolf and gasped as I found that it had become human. Luana gasped as well. \"Mike...?!\" Surprised, she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that introductions and questions would have to wait, I silently nodded and the three of us took on the four approaching guards. Madcap fought as well as I did with moves similar to what Dee had taught me. After they were all dealt with, Ace texted, U O K?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI texted back, AAK 411 @ U 20.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned back to see Luana dressing Mike's wound just as he was slowly regaining consciousness. \"What are you doing here?!\" Worried, Luana demanded. \"You could have been killed!\" She paused. \"And since when were you a werewolf?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike chuckled. \"Since when were you able to turn invisible and fight like that?\" Smiling, weakly, he countered. \"The mane is Lycan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuana smiled back. \"Miss Silhouette and the Invisible shield, at your service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, Invisible shield, I could use your muscle, love.\" Firmly, Madcap said. \"We need to cover up our little walk in the park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit reluctantly, Luana walked away from Mike and helped Madcap drag the eight men onto a pair of nearby benches where Madcap then placed a few small round devices at their feet. Shortly after, they shot out a green mist that smelled strongly of cheap beer. \"What is that stuff?\" Wrinkling my nose, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These blokes will wake up in a few hours with a hangover, smelling like they had been drinking all night.\" Smiling, madcap said. \"Even if they report their encounter with us, most will shrug it off as a drunken dream, thinking they got into a bar brawl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's clever.\" Nodding, Mike said. \"Thanks for your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure, Lycan.\" Bowing, Madcap said. \"Once a Knight, always a Knight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuana smiled. \"Knights of the alliance.\" Softly, she said. \"They are Europe's version of the guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadcap nodded. \"Lycans father was the leader of that group.\" surprising all, he said. \"They called him Huntsman.\" He smiled. \"Don't be too surprised if he jumps in when you need the help the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are trying to see if we can gain access to...\" I began to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the last escape, all possible entrances and exits have been carefully guarded.\" Interrupting me, Madcap said. \"The only way in is to teleport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thought, I smiled as I knew of at least two people who could arrange that. \"Let's get out of here, then.\" Quietly, i said. \"We have a lot of planning ahead of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we had all regrouped at Cloaked Dagger HQ....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Most of our work was digging the bullet out before the wound closed. It'll be a fair bit before he's up and about, but he should be able to take visitors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuana didn't need to be told twice.

Besides , it's not like you told me everything about you, did you, Invisible Shield?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Fair enough. I have kept a lot from you, Mike.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was nothing of interest in the dark room we had appeared in. Mostly office and cleaning supplies. I crept up to the door leading out and knelt down with Gaia in hand. \"Let's see what's waiting for us.\" whispering, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia crawled under the door into the other room and looked about with me seeing through her eyes. The storeroom opened into a long T shaped hall going left, right and straight ahead with several doors on either side of each. Just as Tommy and Aura had said, the complex was an intricate maze. Looking around, Gaia revealed a single camera slowly moving back and forth about half way down each hall with the one that would spot us  seemingly fixed upon the door we had to exit through. <i>\"Damn!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening, I could hear the tiny motor of the camera struggling to move the camera which meant it was malfunctioning. There was no telling how soon it would be before someone came to service it. Gaia looked around again and I saw the door we were hoping to find, filing room number thirteen. It was card locked with a code key but fortunately or unfortunately, it was open a jar. this could only mean that someone was in there or someone had carelessly left it open. <i>\"We need to get passed the camera and into that filing room.\"</i> Frustrated, I thought. <i>\"Any ideas, Gaia?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if sensing my thoughts, Gaia scurried across the hall and climbed a wire to the camera and began to stare into the lens as if sniffing around for food. Seeing our opportunity, I turned to the others. \"We need to move quickly and quietly.\" Whispering, I said. \"Gaia is keeping the camera busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others nodded and we all hurried out of the storeroom to the filing room where I carefully opened the door before mentally calling for Gaia. The mouse scurried back down the wire and ran onto my hand, up my arm to the safety of my breast pocket. \"Why was the door left open?\" Worried, Kyra whispered. \"It seems all too convenient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in a surprise move, she pulled me back, out of the room. \"What...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned pale when Kyra pointed at the room number. There was the outline of another number on the door window. \"This is one-thirteen.\" Whispering, Kyra said. \"I learned to listen to the warnings of the other symbionts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A trap.\" whispering, Dana said. \"Good thing you caught that, Visionary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, knowing that we would have to use our assumed names while in enemy territory and looked around to find that the numbers were all mixed up with no obvious order to them. \"It might take a while before we find the right room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought, Luana turned to me. \"Didn't Tommy and Aura say that the room that held the Black Files had no number but letters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Luana's gaze and smiled upon seeing a room marked 'AC storage'. It had a card and number lock and was shut tight. Using my heightened senses and Gaia's eyes, I could see the oil from people's fingerprints on seven of the ten numbers. I was also able to see a key lock which meant that the door could be accessed by either a key and a code or a card and code. i turned to Diana who was already working the key lock with two lock picks from her jacket pocket. \"Once I get the key to turn, you will only have a few seconds to hit the right code or an alarm will sound.\" serious, she said. \"Do you think you can do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped but paused as Kyra stepped up. \"I can.\" Whispering, she said. \"I'm in touch with Mecha, she can talk to machines. Punch in what I say when Wild Card has the key turned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded then, when Dana had the key turned, I hit the numbers Kyra whispered. \"six...seven...three...six...seven...two...nine...seven...six...three.\"&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nThe lock beeped and a green light came on before the door opened with a click. I turned to the camera to find it still locked in place before urging everyone into the room before following them, quietly closing the door behind me. We immediately spotted two cameras on either side of the rectangular room, slowly moving back and forth. Fortunately, they were aimed high to spot adults who stood over the tall filing cabinets rather than children who were shorter. Remembering the numbers that corresponded with the numbers on a phone, I could not help smile at the code to enter the room. \"Really, 'open says me'.\" Amused, I whispered. \"How droll can you get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra smiled back and we carefully moved passed the files to a specific cabinet that, of course, was locked. The seconds ticked by as Diana worked on the lock only Justin took hold of the handle and gave it a jerk, popping the lock and opening the drawer. \"We don't have time for kid gloves.\" Serious, he whispered. \"We need to get the files and leave, as quickly as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time to argue. I reached into the drawer and pulled out the objective of our raid. It was a single thick folder book containing many folders and files. On the top, in bold letters was the letters, 'Black Files'. \"We need to be certain this is it or our raid will be for nothing.\" Urgently, i whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others nodded and I opened the folder book, keeping a keen ear out for trouble with Luana and the rest of the team doing the same. The first thing I found was a note from the previous leader of the Agency, Carlos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is my insurance in case I should be betrayed by those who seek to claim my power and wealth within the organization. Fear my wrath if you ever cross me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through Gaia's eyes, I skimmed through the folders with my eyes widening in fear, anger, and disgust. The agency was truly an evil organization into virtually everything illegal throughout the world. \"This is it.\" Closing the file book, I said. \"We have to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I said that, the door beeped and clicked before opening. We were no longer alone. I held my breath, watching as I saw a figure enter. As the figure stepped into the light we all saw it was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Move!\" Yelling, I ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera was dead set upon us now as we ran to the storage room to find it locked!

Every dirty deed they had ever done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The question is, what what will the Agency do in retaliation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, I knotted my jaws in decision. \"Let us act before they can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I wasn't anywhere near ready to start talking to anybody about the alien living inside me. \"What's on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's... something I want to show you,\" he said, as he sat on my bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so, show me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bowed his head, and the weirdest thing I'd ever seen happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwen's hair grew longer before my eyes. His shirt, which had been white with red sleeves with the words BOYS RULE! written on it, changed to white with pink sleeves with GIRL POWER! written on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwen lifted his head, and his face now looked girlish. \"How do I look?\" he asked, his voice a lot more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owen,\" I said, \"you... you look like a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"That's because I <i>am</i> a girl,... when I want to be, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing I was sitting already, because I would have been looking for a chair otherwise. \"You... you can turn into a girl?

You can imagine my surprise when I saw this in the mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're totally a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and lifted her shirt, revealing a training bra. \"This is why I wear undershirts now.

She was short and stout with slat and pepper hair tied into a neat bun and gentle blue eyes. She smiled at Owen and me through her half moon glasses. \"Do you mind if I join you girls?\" Kindly, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and mum walked in wearing her favorite black dress. She sat down and looked at me with a kind smile on her face. \"I see you have discovered your symbiont.\" Softly, she said. \"Owen came to me, freaked out when he, or rather, she discovered her own abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum, you're scaring me.\" Wincing, I said. \"Where did these symbionts come from? Does Owen have one inside of him, err her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The symbionts have been here in this little town since the early eighteen hundreds, my dear.\" Smiling, mum replied. \"They came here along with an alien craft that crashed here around the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An alien craft?!\" Turning pale, I demanded. \"The symbionts are aliens?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deep breaths, Lucinda.\" Kindly, mum said. \"Don't faint on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ship that crashed here was a derelict; a ghost ship.\" Softly, Owen said. \"Drifting through space for hundreds of years after the crew had abandoned ship. The symbionts were using it to move from one planet to another in their quest to explore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that?\" Wide eyed, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one of Owen's abilities as a girl.\" Calmly, mum explained. \"Everyone and everything she comes into contact with she will very quickly know everything about as if she had known the person or worked with the object all her life.\" She giggled at my stunned expression. \"You, on the other hand have the ability to tip the odds for everything in your favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hashtag lottery win.\" Grinning, Owen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't work that way; I tried.\" Bemused, mum said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have the same ability?!\" Surprised, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMum nodded. \"That's how I knew you had the granddaughter of my symbiont.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was completely floored by this but also intrigued. \"Does Owen have a symbiont?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owen was affected by the alien ghost ship.\" Softly, mum replied. \"In fact, everyone born in this city after eighteen hundred and thirty five has developed incredible powers and abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not believe my ears. I quickly picked up a copy of the Problem child Gang graphic novel to which mum giggled before sighing. \"I remember those kids.\" Bemused, she said. \"They drove me and the other members of the police force <i>nuts.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they really existed.\" My head spinning, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMum nodded. \"I was the police commissioner at the time.\" Serious, she said. \"I was the leader of a separate group whom the town secretly called the clean up crew. We worked hard to make certain too much attention did not fall upon our town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Problem Child Gang, as they called themselves, found it necessary to have a strong force to protect the city so its inhabitants were not forced to show their hand.\" Calmly, Owen added. \"It was a noble idea and effort only...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please allow me to tell the story, dear.\" Lightly scolding, mum said. \"Or would you rather talk about how you learned to act like a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that, imagining the struggle for a boy to learn how to act feminine. Owen blushed as well before saying, \"Please continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMum smiled then continued. \"As Owen said, it was a noble effort on their part only they got more and more confident in their abilities with each victory.\" Somewhat sadly she said. \"Looking back, I should have told them what Sykes was really after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sykes, the immortal thief.\" Remembering the story, I said. \"What was he really after?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The alien technology.\" Startling me, mum said. \"Sykes is one of the few who was blessed and cursed with immortality; he was there when the ship crashed into the Oceanside cliff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there is a new Problem Child Gang.\" Worried, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMum nodded. \"Which is why I need you and Owen on the new clean up crew.\" Serious, she said. \"What do you say, Lucinda? I've been itching to come out of retirement; want to help Owen and I save the city again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we do first?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMum smiled at me gratefully. \"first, we...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mom told me it was no big deal, that hardly anyone noticed, but I was gaining five pounds a week and couldn't think of why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I got to 30 pounds over my usual weight, my doctor put me on a diet and exercise plan. I didn't lose an ounce. So she put me on another plan. Same results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there's anything worse than getting fat for no reason, it's staying fat for no reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter six months of work, all I'd lost was six months. I stood in front of a full-length mirror, looking with disgust at my double chin, my belly, my muffin top. Suddenly, I felt a tingle all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tingling stopped, I was astonished to see myself getting bigger. Rounder. <i>Fatter.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe my eyes. It was like watching a balloon from the Macy's parade being inflated, only I was the balloon, and I wasn't full of helium, but fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it finally stopped, I was almost unrecognizable. I was big enough to make six of the old me, with some left over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could this happen? I knew you couldn't lose weight overnight, believe me, I knew.

Mom quickly answered and ushered a middle aged man into the room where I was standing. The man was tall and visibly muscular wearing a long brown trench coat over a pair of black pants and black shirt. I blushed horribly as I was naked and looked down at the man with my eyes begging. \"Help me...\" Lips trembling, I pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, Sherlock, my daughter has discovered her gift.\" Softly, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call this a gift?!\" Distraught, I asked. \"This is a nightmare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked up at me and smiled kindly. \"Take a breath, child.\" Lightly scolding, he said. \"Panicking will not help you.\" He produced a quarter from his pocket before allowing it to fall to the floor in front of me. \"Pick up the quarter, if you please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?!\" Annoyed, I demanded. \"How do you expect me to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think about it, just do it!\" Snapping, the man barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped, startled by the man's shouting command and leaned down to pick up the quarter though I had no idea how I was going to pull it off.

I turned to the man who was again smiling kindly at me. \"You see... you can do it.\" Calmly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have the same power as your father who is currently doing business in Europe.\" Serious Sherlock said. \"You have the ability to expand yourself into massive proportions.\" he sighed. \"However, you lack any training in how to use it and that is dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dangerous?\" Gulping, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherlock shook his head before turning to mom. \"Show her the training video then get her ready.\" Darkly, he ordered. \"There is no telling when they will make their next move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was now seriously confused, not to mention frustrated as I had already returned to my usual overweight size. \"What video? Get ready for what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherlock grunted. \"Have you ever read the graphic novel, The Problem Child Gang?\" Cryptically, he asked. I nodded. \"Who was your favorite character?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked before replying, \"Freak; he was a member of the Guard.\" You smiled slightly. \"He was a lot like me, overweight. Only he was fast and could grow into a giant of a man, seriously giving bad guys a scare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom held back a giggle as Sherlock nodded, a bemused smile on his face. \"That's your father.\" Smiling, mom said. \"He is with the Cloaked Dagger, the European version of the problem child gang, helping them against The Agency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lot for me to take in. \"The graphic novel series I had been reading, it was all real...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"We were all hoping this was over and behind us.\" Somewhat sadly, she said. \"Only our old enemies have returned and we must be ready for anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherlock sighed. \"Show her the training film.\" Walking to the door, he said. \"I will pick her up tomorrow morning at seven sharp.\" He gave mom a stern look. \"Have her ready, Valor. She needs to be trained and it would not hurt you to go with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the man left. Mom huffed, shaking her head before turning to me.

It was basically a documentary about select members of the group known as The Guard. \"There are twelve videos in all.\" Surprising me, mom said. \"this one focuses on your father, Sherlock and myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched the video in shock and awe as I watched dad, as an overweight teenager, grow into a muscular giant before shattering a hole through a concrete wall with a single punch! He then shrank into a slender teenager and lifted a large weight before throwing it several feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father had the power to grow and shrink.\" Calmly, mom explained. \"The only draw back was that he could never maintain a slender form for long as it took enormous amounts of calories to power his ability.\" She then smiled at me. \"Your weight issue is your body preparing for that power to come to the surface.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, still in a state of awe and shock. As I continued to watch the video, I witnessed my dad fire a powerful beam of energy from his hands like in some anime fight scene! Mom sighed at that before pausing the video. \"That is what Sherlock was referring to when he said your lack of training is dangerous.\" Softly, she said. \"Your father had the ability to convert his large mass into energy and use it as a ranged weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped at that as mom continued the video and I saw the energy beam literally blow a hole through a car!

I met my birth mom once: She said she was 13 when she had me, and unconscious when she got pregnant, so I can't really blame her for giving me up for adoption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd have to say I'm pretty lucky to be living in Waterfront. Our police chief, Ted Jones, doesn't go in for a militarized look for cops, he trains them in de-escalation, and favors what he calls \"good old-fashioned police work,\" which he says means cops help folks out if they're not busy with something else. So you're more likely to see a cop help some old lady with her groceries than add a hashtag to somebody's name. Keeps a lot of kids out of trouble, too: nobody wants a cop to say to them, \"Do I need to tell your folks about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day It happened, I was heading home from a pick-up game at the park. I waved to people I knew across the street, said hi to people on my side, and checked out the girls wherever they were. No catcalling, though. My mom didn't raise me that way, and guaranteed she'd find out by the time I got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld Lady Jenkins was leaning out her window, talking to one of her friends on the street. When she went back in, she bumped this flowerpot she had on the sill, and it started to fall. She loved that flower, and the pot it was in, and I knew she'd be heartbroken if anything happened to it. Without thinking, I put my hand up. I caught the flowerpot, and put it back up where it belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked a few more steps when what just happened struck me: sure, I had caught Old Lady Jenkins's flowerpot and put it back with one hand, but her window was way up on the third floor, and I was street-level. How did my arm get long enough to do that?</span></div></div>",

I never saw him. I didn't know his name, what he looked like, or why he and Mom weren't together. Any time somebody asked Mom about him, she'd just start crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose that's part of why I didn't have any friends. If nobody came over, they wouldn't ask Mom the questions that made her cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen my life changed, it began with a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dreamed that Mom was having a party in the apartment, and, as usual, I was keeping away from it. Then, I began to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was dwindling rapidly. I ran to Mom for help. By the time I'd gone from my room down the hall to the living room, I was down to maybe a foot tall. By the time I found Mom, I was less than a third of that. I tried to call to her, but my voice was too high and weak to make it up as far as her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was down to a couple of inches tall when I realized that something could still hear me: our cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not good news, as the cat didn't recognize the shrunken me as human. She thought I was a funny-looking mouse. And she <i>ate</i> mice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran as hard as I could, but I also had to avoid all the enormous feet of the people at the party. And I was still shrinking. In no time, the cat had me cornered. In desperation, I threw up my hands and closed my eyes against the coming slaughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I opened my eyes again, there was no party. I was in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI breathed a sigh of relief. Just a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when I looked over to where the clock should have been, I saw... more of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dream had partially come true. I was only a foot tall.</span></div></div>",

The only difference was that I was now four and a half feet smaller than when I went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, my stomach grumbled. It was so loud that I almost expected Mom to come in, asking what that noise was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, just as suddenly, I was back to my full height. And I was hungrier than I'd ever been. I got dressed and headed for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was making pancakes. \"Morning, sweetie,\" she said. Then, motioning to the giant stack of pancakes, she said, \"I overdid it a bit on the pancakes. Hope you're hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Famished,\" I replied. I felt like I could have eaten all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sat down and drank her coffee. \"Where does this appetite come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" I said, after swallowing a mouthful. \"There was something weird this morning, though.

Just look at my pj's, they're buttoned up, 'cause I shrank out of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that I don't believe you, Violet,\" Mom said. \"It's just...

I started simple by only shrinking down a few feet. I was five foot seven; when I stopped shrinking, I was three foot even. With my doll like features and fair skin, I looked like a two year old wearing her older sister's clothes. I could not help giggle at my reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to learn how to make my clothing shrink with me next time.\" Amused, I said. \"Otherwise, I'll return to normal without attire.\" After a thought, I added, \"Better not let mom see me like this, she might diaper me as a punishment for shrinking to this size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at the thought and decided to try to grow back to my normal size only something went wrong. I kept shrinking! I tried to cry out for help only I shrank so fast that I could not get enough air to scream out anything that could be heard! Before I knew it, I was pushing my way through a jungle of the fibers of my carpet! \"What am I going to do now?\" Crying, I asked myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just calm down.\" Startling me, a voice replied. \"There is a time limit on shrinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI whipped around to find myself facing a man in makeshift clothing made out of lint and sandals made out of splinters of wood! He was, by my perspective, a foot taller than me with brown eyes, scruffy black hair, mustache, and beard. At first, I was frightened only I took a second look and gasped! \"Daddy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, my dad, nodded. \"It's an honor to finally meet you, kiddo.\" Smiling, he said. \"It took me ten years to track your mother down.\" He chuckled. \"It's a <i>really</i> big world out there at my current tiny height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said there was a time limit.\" Wincing, I said. \"Why did you never come back to mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can't possibly detect me at this height, kiddo.\" Serious, dad explained. \"I am slowly returning to normal but because I shrank so far, it would be a deadly shock to my system if I grew back to my normal height too quickly.\" He sighed. \"It's like returning from a very deep dive, you need to decompress otherwise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly nodded, understanding what dad was trying to say. \"It's great to finally meet you.\" Hugging him, I said. \"Only I don't understand. How did you survive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, at this height and smaller, I am completely invulnerable to harm.\" Smiling, dad said. \"Since, you obviously have the same power, I'd say you have the same invulnerability.\" He then turned serious. \"You can't let anyone know you have this power or that you saw me. There are people out there who would kill anyone in their way to obtain what you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't even tell mom?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad was silent for a moment then handed me a piece of folded paper. \"Take this with you when you return to normal.\" Softly, he said. \"She will recognize my handwriting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A note?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A personal note.\" Patiently, dad said. \"So don't you read it.\" He then grinned. \"Do and I'll take you over my knee when you shrink again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that. Dad definitely had a similar sense of humor as mom. \"Can you tell me how to grow back to normal size?\" Hopeful, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"Just think big.\" Smiling, dad replied. \"If it helps, come up with a word that makes you think of big things and a word that makes you think of small things. That's how I came back from the microcosmic world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped. \"You visited a microcosmic world?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A talk for another time.\" Serious, dad said. \"You better get back before mom misses you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and thought of a word that made me think big. I chose the word, 'Mountain' and it worked; I steadily grew back to normal size. Upon returning to my normal height, I looked down at the note and found that it had grew with me. Only my clothing was on the floor at me feet. Blushing brightly, I quickly redressed myself and hurried out with the note in hand to find mom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Part of you wanted to hang out at the mall with your friends while another wanted to go see dad again, clothed this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The note grew with me.\" Thoughtful, you said. \"I wonder if that makes a difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought back to the note and realized you were thinking how important it was for mom to get it.

You hurried to your room and rummaged through your clothes until you found your old dancing leotard. It was like a black one piece swimsuit with long sleeves and a short skirt. You undressed and slipped it on, wincing as you felt it hugging your body like a second skin. The leotard was not tight but wearing it made you feel as if you weren't wearing anything at all. Once you had it on, you tried to shrink again and sighed as the leotard shrank with you. \"At least now, I can shrink without losing my clothes though I would want to get something better to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud crash alerted you to something wrong. You peered out of your room to see someone breaking into your apartment! He was tall with short blond hair. It was a tall man in blue jeans and a black shirt with a brown jacket. The man's face seemed to have been carved from stone with cold calculating green eyes and short black hair. You gulped seeing him retrieve a sidearm from under his jacket. Your first instinct was to lock the door to your bedroom and call the police. Only, instead, you shrank to two feet making it impossible to reach the doorknob. <i>\"Oh crap...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man walked towards your bed room and pushed the door open to see you. A smile cracked on his lips. \"Hey, there, cutie.\" Kindly, he said. \"Is your older sister at home? Or were you left here with a baby sitter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth half opened in surprise. The man thought you were a toddler girl; it made sense as when you shrank to two feet the first time, you saw one in the mirror. You gave a coo, holding up your hands, hoping to get the man to come closer so you could take him by surprise. The man did come closer, obviously suspecting nothing. When he was close enough, you returned yourself to normal, clocking him in the jaw as you grew. The man stumbled in surprise and you managed to pull the gun from his hand. \"Who are you?!\" Angry, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled. \"So, Grace spawned a daughter with powers just like her father.\" Grinning, he said. \"How interesting. I am John Stalker and I am here to talk to your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not home.\" Hissing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn smiled then, to your surprise, ripped the gun out of your hands and pointed it directly at your heart! \"I'm not here to play games, little lady.\" Coldly, he said. \"Tell your mother that there is a new calling of the Guard.\" He scowled. \"Feel fortunate that I'm on your side for the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then viciously slapped me, sending me to the floor before walking out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was a living forensics lab and I helped the Problem Child Gang solve many cases.\" She paused, holding back tears before continuing. \"I stayed behind to help a group known as the Guard when a good number of the group left for Europe in hopes to stop Sykes and his followers once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We grew up.\" Serious, mom replied. \"I managed to get a job with a government agency known as the Central Headquarters of Intelligence, Logistics and Defense, or CHILD. They too had attempted to give the town of Waterfront grief. I figured that working on the inside, I could keep their focus away from our beloved city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was hanging on every word, listening to mom's story.

I recognized the teenagers as Garth and Grace Jones and Melissa Davenport, who lived down the street from me. Only I did not recognize the girl next to her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Josiah Higgins. I have lived all my life in Higginsport. In fact, it was for my ancestor that Higginsport and I were both named. Eventually, both names would be changed. But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was decided when I was quite young that I would marry Elspeth Connors. While I found Elspeth charming enough, I was truly attracted to Ina Mist, but Father would have none of that. Besides her being a girl of lower class, she was blind, indecent (walking about wearing trousers at all times), and impudent. (Another reason, though Father would not admit it to anyone, was that he had suffered some economic reversals, and needed the Connors money to forestall efforts by a man named Spencer to take over the town.) Nonetheless, I fancied her. All of this became unimportant, however, when the Strangeness began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt began when a blazing light fell from the sky, striking near a small lake often used for swimming and fishing. Reverend Simmes said it was a rebellious angel thrown from Heaven. Few took him seriously at the time, but opinions changed when the children of Higginsport began to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was the Spottiswoode boy. He went swimming after the fireball struck, and surfaced with gills. Then, Elspeth had some problems with her upper back, which were explained one day when feathered wings sprouted forth from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven I was touched by the Strangeness, as I began to glow. Nobody noticed anything in the light of day, but I was brighter than a candle after darkness fell. It was how Elspeth found me. She had been flying nearby, and saw my light from my window. She invited me to come with her. Out of curiosity, I agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElspeth took me in her arms and carried me to the ravine, where other Higginsport children had gathered. There, we saw a mysterious woman in a porcelain mask. The woman waved to Elspeth. \"You're later than usual,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've brought someone to join us,\" Elspeth explained. \"He gives forth light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was puzzled why this needed to be pointed out, but the masked woman said, \"If our Guardian Angel vouchsafes for you, friend, then you are most welcome. I am Miss Shadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I knew why she had to be told about my light. This Miss Shadow was Ina Mist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explained why we had all been summoned. Reverend Simmes, thoroughly convinced that what was happening in Higginsport was of demonic origin, had summoned witch-hunters to protect the community, and to destroy those children who were now different from the norm. \"I do not know precisely what is happening here,\" she said, \"but it hardly seems demonic, as I'm sure you all agree. But if the adults will not stand up for us, then we must stand for ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so we began the struggle to protect us and those like us from destruction. During this fight, I learned that Elspeth truly would not be the ideal wife for me. Even if I had been attracted to her and not Ina, she was more strongly attracted to another girl in our company, none other than Faith Simmes, the reverend's own daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, during a respite from battle, I decided to explore Haunted Cave, some twenty miles from Higginsport. With my luminosity, which I had greatly mastered, its darkness would be dispelled for me, and I could see what held so much terror for so many. So I entered the mouth of the cave and descended into its depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar into its recesses, I found a peculiar structure. It was entirely made of metal, and it seemed less like something that had entered the cave than something that the mountain had surrounded. Finding an opening, I dared to enter, not even going back for my hat when it fell from my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around the place, I found a small niche in the wall, about the right size for a person. I climbed inside, and instantly regretted it, for some transparent barrier slid into place from above, sealing me inside. Once this barrier was in place, a strange mist began to fill the niche. I struggled to free myself, but I could not. Moreover, I began to grow drowsy, each breath bringing me closer to sleep. I had just enough time to connect how I felt with the mist before I fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I awoke, the barrier was gone. I felt as if I'd taken a too-long nap. I was certain that I'd get a hiding when I got back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found my way back out of the structure. I remembered that I'd lost my hat before I went inside, but it was not there. I groaned, certain that Father would tell me to cut two or three switches from the birch tree before meeting him behind the woodshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI climbed back up to the mouth of the cave, remembered to douse my light, and stepped outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, gathered around a fire,I saw three people: a man, a woman, and a girl. All three wore short trousers, garments I'd only seen young boys wear before. They also wore peculiar shoes. I couldn't imagine how they could be shined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl noticed me first. \"That's some weird spelunking gear he's got on,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adults turned to see. \"Looks more like he's dressed for a wedding,\" the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was stunned. They thought my clothes were strange? How could this be? \"I beg your pardon,\" I said, \"could you help me get back to Higginsport?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl wrinkled her nose. \"Higginsport? Where's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know where it is, Rachel,\" the man said. \"You just never heard it called that. Higginsport is what Waterfront City used to be called.\" Turning back to me, he said, \"Where'd you learn to call it that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI staggered. \"Used to be? Hasn't it always been Higginsport?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shook his head. \"Not for 150 years.\"</span></div></div>",

The liquid inside tasted like water, and the paper label said it was water. But I'd never heard of anyone putting water in a bottle. Clearly, I was in a far different world than when I had gone into the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try to figure out what's going on,\" the man said. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Josiah Higgins. My family founded Higginsport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" he said, \"now for a bigger question: What year was it when you went into the cave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1852. I gather this is a different year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded \"It's 2017. 150 years ago, the Higgins family went bankrupt, and a consortium took over the town, renaming it Waterfront City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"My father has - had hopes that I would marry well, to ensure our fortune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you spend all these years in a cave, unchanged?\" asked the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found a structure of some sort,\" I explained. \"Inside it, I wandered into something which closed when I entered. I fell asleep, and awoke here and now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could have caused that?\" Rachel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't begin to speculate,\" said the man. \"We'd need to go back into the cave to find out, and I'd rather not do that. There's no telling what we could bump into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking we should get our friend checked out,\" said the woman. \"Do you feel up to walking again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"At the least, I can make it as far as your carriage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed them. When we arrived at a clearing near the road, I said, \"I've never seen a carriage like that. But someone has stolen your horses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No horses,\" the man said. \"It's called a car.

I meant it, too: I was reasonably certain that Mom slept with boys she liked when she was a teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I was certain that they were well and truly gone, I called Jack. \"The 'rents are away for the weekend,\" I told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he replied, \"I'll be over soon.

I picked out some games and put them on my bed, then set out some movies on the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jack came over, we greeted each other the way we usually did, acting like best friends until we closed the door behind us, then kissing. \"What games ya got?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured we'd start off with <i>Call of Duty</i>,\" I answered, \"then <i>Ghost Recon</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab some Cokes,\" he said, racing up the stairs, \"and get ready to lose.\" I didn't mind the teasing. I knew I could beat Jack at sports, if I wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got the Cokes out of the fridge and headed upstairs, when I felt a strange chill. I wasn't sure where it was coming from. Shrugging it off, I went to my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was loading the game as I walked in. He kissed me. \"Damn, Tommy,\" he said, \"your lips are freezing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really? Guess you'll have to do something to warm them up.\" I handed him a Coke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the bottle, then asked, \"Where'd you keep this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fridge, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's frozen solid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked again. As he said, it looked as if it had spent the night in the freezer. I looked at mine. It was frozen, too.</span></div></div>",

I am greeted, I respond in kind, and my training begins for the day. I'm not sure what I'm training for, but I hope I'll be good at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this day, my training began with me on the treadmill. Whatever my results, I am always assured that I've done very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running on the treadmill, I went to take a shower, to wash off the sweat before bacteria can grow and cause body odor. I know that body odor is disagreeable, since some people here do not seem to shower every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I came out of the shower, I saw a slip of paper laying where the man in the white coat had been standing. I inferred that he had dropped it, but I had no way to contact him to return it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the paper, I was surprised to find that it was about me. It clearly said Subject 147 right at the top, and that is what all the people in white coats called me. Since it was about me, I saw no reason why I should not read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I read amazed me. Apparently, I had been born here, grown in an artificial womb. I had no memories of being anywhere else, but it was still a surprise to see that it was because I had never been anywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also learned that the cells that made me came from two other people, and that these people had <i>names</i>. What was a name? Did I have one? If I did, it was nowhere on the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI memorized two names in particular, and their connection to me:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMATERNAL DNA: Ina Mist Dalrymple<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPATERNAL DNA: Ted Jones<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at the windows in the room. They were placed high on the walls. <i>Out there</i>, I thought, <i>are these people. Do they know me? Have they been looking for me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn't been looking for them before, but I wanted to find them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I decided to begin my search tonight.</span></div></div>",

I had nothing to connect it to, no frame of reference to know if it was a good name or a bad one. I was a stranger, an outlier. The name Miss Shadow had given me didn't fit, but I didn't know what would. My fear was still nagging at me, making it hard to concentrate on what I was thinking, my mind almost overwhelmed by everything that had happened to me since I had left my previous life. I would not let that fear define me, I would be stronger than it. I felt my fear fall away, as the word I was looking for, the word that would be my name, came to my lips. <br>\r\n\"Hope,\" I said, quietly \"That seems to fit me quite well.\" And it did.

Then it hit me. \"Garth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am immune to armor piercing rounds.\" Darkly, Garth countered. \"So, unless you all want a free flying lesson, take a hike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first man grunted. \"Then we'll have to up the ante to lasers.\" Softly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the monitor, I saw the first man produce a laser sword and activate it with the intention of striking Garth down! A gasp escaped my lips and I did all I could think of doing, I raised my hand as if to block the sword. To my surprise, a blue field appeared between Garth and the attacking man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" Surprised, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I can produce force fields.\" Keeping my eye on the monitor, I replied. \"I just need to see where I am putting it.\" i gulped. \"Most of my training was in that field...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mall, the look of surprise was clear on both the man and Garth. Only Garth seemed quick to recover and he shook a single finger at the first man. He then slowly pulled his hand back as if to make a strike. Understanding his unspoken signal, I pushed the force field forward. To my surprise, the men dodged it but to my further surprise, Garth grew to the size of a Mythological Olympian and slammed his hands together with a thunderous boom!  The sheer power of the clap threw the four men off their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" That was all I could say as I then watched dad make short work of disarming the stunned men and placing them in handcuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreams were heard from the many patrons but Garth was back to his normal size before anyone turned his way and was acting just as frightened. \"Everyone use caution leaving the mall today.\" Displaying his badge, dad announced. \"There is a strong thunderstorm coming through and I would not rule out a tornado watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaken patrons of the mall all nodded as a loud crack of thunder shook the mall from the skies then went about their business as dad called for police backup. Once he was done, he turned to Garth. \"Always have a believable story to back up your actions.\" Calmly, he said. \"Book five, Chapter three, Holes in the story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember that chapter.\" Softly, I said. \"The Problem Child Gang nearly got caught when they had different stories to where they were the night of a robbery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all learn our share of lessons the hard way.\" Calmly, mom said. She paused, raising a hand to her ear. \"Your father has given the all clear. let's finish our shopping...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It all seemed like a formal interrogation, another thing I had been trained in doing. \"Have I done something wrong?\" Wincing, I asked. \"Have I disappointed you in some way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled patiently. \"No, not at all.\" Calmly, mom replied. \"This is going to be your bedroom once we decorate it to your liking. I just need to ask a few questions regarding how those four men found you and us at the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have not contacted anyone.\" Serious, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not suggesting that.\" Remaining calm, mom replied. \"Book four, chapter two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind games...\" Thinking back, I said. \"Sykes the immortal thief managed to plant a tracking device on Hannah in hopes of leading her straight to the Problem Child Gang's headquarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"That was me.\" To my surprise, she explained. \"I did not know I was carrying a tracking device after I had been rescued for the hundredth time.\" She gave a rueful smile. \"Still, it nearly splintered the group once it came down to finger pointing blame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"It was resolved by everyone agreeing to a search.\" Calmly, I said. \"Once they realized I was carrying the tracking device, they all began to carry signal jammers to prevent any such tracking devices from working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hence we all still carry one to this day.\" softly, mom replied. \"There are signal jammers in this very house and in our vehicles, hence they were not able to track until you entered the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you believe there is a tracking device on my person.\" Worried, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were likely wearing one even before you fled from CHILD.\" Serious, mom said. \"I suggest you allow me to search you.\" She then gave me a kind smile. \"After that, we will discuss where you would like your furniture placed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI agreed to the search and disrobed to the skin. Mom was extremely thorough and soon I felt something being ripped off the back of my neck. \"Ow..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Hope.\" Calmly, mom said. \"However, I found the tracking device.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to find mom holding a microchip transmitter that had been disguised as a mole on one side which she then promptly destroyed with a lighter as she held it. I raised my hand to stop her only to be greeted with a smile. \"I'm immortal, remember.\" Calmly, she said. \"Yes, I feel it but it does not damage me in the least. I have gained a large threshold for pain over the years\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded as mom signaled me to get dressed. Once I was fully clothed, we began to talk about furniture placement. Mom was so casual, I began to worry. \"You are not angry that I was carrying a tracking device?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were not aware of it, honey.\" Reassuring me, mom said. \"If you were, I have no doubt you would have ripped it off yourself the moment you escaped.\" She smiled. \"Just as I would have if I knew when it happened to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that then sighed. \"Do you think Chief Jones... err... dad will get any information out of the four CHILD agents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will worry about CHILD and their agents when the time is right.\" Lightly scolding, mom said. \"All you need to worry about now is where to put your furniture.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I must have changed my mind a dozen times as to where to put everything but Garth did not seem to mind in the least. \"He can pull freight cars so a bed or dresser is no challenge for him.\" Bemused, mom explained. \"Though it did take a bit of practice to be gentle with his strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace giggled. \"He had to have gone through at least three dozen eggs before he could hold one without crushing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can master any skill, art, or trade in minutes but you still have trouble holding a B average in school, young lady.\" Bemused, mom countered. \"We all need continuous training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried not to giggle less be targeted next for embarrassment. Instead, I thanked Garth and Grace for their help then turned to mom. \"Will I be training with everyone too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once we establish what your skills are, yes.\" Calmly, mom replied. \"However, it has to be done in a controlled environment where we can keep things safe for everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, we heard the front door open then slam. Dad had returned home from work. We walked down to greet him to find that he looked very drained. \"Rough day at work, honey?\" Wincing, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed before nodding. \"Ina Mist Dalrymple passed away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom teared up then hugged dad as they sobbed on each other's shoulders. I began to tear up myself knowing that she was essentially my mother. Once mom and dad had composed themselves, they turned to us. \"Mrs. Dalrymple... Miss Shadow, had saved our lives more times than we can count, kids.\" Serious, dad said. \"We owe it to her to investigate her death and find out who had managed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You suspect foul play...?\" Gulping, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shook his head. \"We cannot rule out any possibilities at this time.\" Firmly, he said. \"I will be running the police investigation.\" He turned to Garth and Grace. \"Rally the new Problem Child Gang, see what you can dig up and be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth and Grace nodded before hurrying up the stairs to their rooms. I moved to follow them but dad stopped me. \"You are staying home with your mother.\" Firmly, he said. \"You are still a target of CHILD and need to be protected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a bit disappointed. \"Yes... dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"Do not worry, you will have your chance to shine when the time is right.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It looked like a study though mom called it her hobby room. \"What do you do in here?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I help your father solve mysterious crimes.\" Simply, mom replied. \"You wanted to run your own investigation so let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that and mom began by asking me questions regarding my time at CHILD.

I did not see any pattern. \"How are these questions going to help our investigation?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Shadow was a long time rival of CHILD.\" Serious, mom replied. \"My husband had caused them much grief as well.\" She sighed. \"As you were born of samples taken from her and my husband, any information you have may be essential in determining if they were responsible for her untimely death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What has your questions told you?\" softly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your answers told me that you were born and raised to face her and my husband.\" Calmly, mom said. \"The others you had mentioned are likely people made from samples taken from the other senior members of the problem child gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only I do not have any of dad's powers.\" Curious, I said. \"I wonder why...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as everyone is different, they have different abilities.\" Serious, mom replied. \"All those born in this city and others like it around the world develop a power or ability. Over time, we had learned to keep these powers a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Super soldiers...\" Gasping, I said. \"Every nation of the world have tried to accomplish making one at some point in their history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, mom nodded. \"CHILD is a secret organization bent upon that goal to police the world into their version of a utopia.\" Darkly, she said. \"Thus far, all we could do was to keep them at bay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the Agency?\" Curious, I asked. \"Are you keeping them at bay as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned pale. \"We defeated them years ago, on our last mission...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"They were crippled twenty years ago by the problem child gang.\" Serious, I countered. \"However, they simply went underground and are still active. A group known as The Cloaked Dagger has been keeping them at bay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's face turned from pale to red, making me worry. \"That was the clue we needed.\" Darkly, she said. \"If the Agency has resurfaced then they are no doubt after revenge.\" She grabbed her jacket and turned to me. \"Come along, Hope. It's time to learn first hand how problem child gang got things done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To some old friends with contacts all over this city.\" Calmly, mom said.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Pavise just gave me the heads up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" Came dad's deep voice. \"I will rally the senior members. What's your sitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In route to Multiplayer's HQ.\" Calmly, mom replied. \"Hoping they heard something through the grapevine. Will keep you posted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rodger that.\" Said dad. \"Both eyes open...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, dad ended the call. \"The Rodgers, who called themselves the Multiplayers, have the ability to merge with any family, literally becoming one with them for short periods of time.\" Softly, mom explained. \"They still do this to keep their ears and eyes open for any potential threats to our city's secrecy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I read about that in the graphic novels.\" Nodding, I said. \"Only who is this Pavise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"You.\" Calmly, she said. \"A Pavise is an early fourteenth century shield that covers the entire body, used by archers and infantry. As you have the powers of force fields, it seemed like a good temporary code name for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Temporary...?\" Confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you really did not like the name Miss Shadow gave you, did you?\" Calmly, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... it didn't seem to fit.\" Wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"You need to come up with a code name that you believe suits you.\" Serious, she said. \"For now, Pavise will do so no one who may be listening in will know it's you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded then saw that mom had pulled into someone's driveway. Upon stopping the car, she again turned to the cellphone and dialed a number. Already, there was a small girl peering out at us from the curtains, followed by two teenage boys. finally, someone answered. \"Hannah here, the suits are back.\" Serious, mom said. \"We need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are aware.\" Darkly, a male voice replied. \"We will brief you inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom ended the call then turned to me. \"The Rodgers are a powerful family.\" Firmly, she warned. \"Let me do the talking unless they address you directly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're our friends... right?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"They are trustworthy allies but they have a lot of enemies so they are very cautious of everyone, including the senior members of the problem child gang.\" Calmly, mom explained. \"You will understand when you meet them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe left the car and walked up to the door to be greeted by the wide eyed little girl how looked us up and down before turning inside. \"They're friendly, daddy.\" Smiling, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall, muscular man stepped forward with a look of relief on his face. \"Hannah, so glad to see you again.\" smiling, he said. \"Who is this with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pavise of the new problem child gang.\" Calmly, mom replied. \"I will brief you inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded and allowed us inside. Once the door was closed, i heard a hiss followed by a tall and slender woman using a strange device on mom and I. \"They are clean.\" calmly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Hope.\" Serious, mom explained. \"We adopted her shortly after her escape from CHILD.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded. before motioning to a nervous looking teenage boy. \"Alexander... we adopted him shortly after discovering he has an ability similar to our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded then turned to me. Jon and Mary are shape-shifters, they can change themselves to look like anyone or anything within reason.\" Serious, she explained. She then turned to Jon. \"Hope has the ability to create force fields. We are uncertain of any other abilities just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon sighed. \"There have been a number of hit attempts on the families of the senior members.\" Serious, he said. \"This included my son and daughter before Alexander joined our family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the game is already afoot.\" Frowning, mom said. \"Any word on Sykes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in Europe giving the new Cloaked Dagger grief right now.\" Calmly, Mary said. \"I would focus on securing your homestead from assassins...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, mom left the Rodger's residence and drove away from their house. Only I noticed we were no driving home. \"Where are we going now?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one remains home alone in times of uncertainty.\" Serious, mom replied. \"We are going to the substation where we are going to set up shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened.

Three boys and one girl, dressed like Nineteen Twenties detectives, all looking at us in fear and concern. The girl's face softened the moment she laid eyes on mom. \"The immortal Hannah of the Problem Child Gang.\" In awe, she whispered. She bowed. \"It is an honor to meet you, ma'am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The honor is mine, young lady.\" Maintaining her calm, mom said. \"May I assume it was you four who upgraded headquarters...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know this gal?\" Gruffly, the second eldest boy demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the founding members of the original Problem Child Gang.\" Calmly, the eldest boy said. \"She has senses and reflexes beyond even animals and is a dead shot with any weapon including knives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to have me at a disadvantage.\" Frowning, mom said. \"Also, how did you find this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Multi Players owed us a favor.\" Smiling, the youngest boy replied. \"They brought us to problem child headquarters and I brought it into the new millennium. Everything state of the art on a network separate from the world wide web.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eldest boy bowed at mom. \"I'm Pantomath, team leader. I am able to summon any skill, art, or trade needed instantly for any situation.\" He motioned to his team mates, eldest to youngest. \"This is Guardian, near unlimited attributes and healing factor. Tech, our gadgetry wizard and pilot. Finally...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleuth.\" Smiling, the girl said. \"I'm a lot like you, just getting started...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPantomath cleared his throat. \"Sleuth is a human forensics lab.\" Calmly, he explained. \"She is also a marksman and a real scrapper. Together, we are The Squad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled at that then turned to the four teenagers. \"I am here with Pavise of the new problem child gang.\" Turning serious, she said. \"The suits have returned and we need to be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Squad looked at each other for a moment, stunned then began to work the controls at their own station...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Standing over them was their team leader, a man who had called himself Blitzkrieg. \"The old man in charge down there can make nearly endless solid energy clones of himself.\" Whispering, she explained. \"His name is Blitzkrieg, literally a one man army.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any way to subdue him?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An electro-magnetic pulse will stun him as his powers are electrically based.\" Quietly, mom replied. \"However, a good enough distraction will do the trick too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI discretely looked around and found that dad along with Garth and their new problem child gang had arrived on the scene. I noticed that they were wearing similar costumes to what the original gang had worn and had already quietly moved the ship the boarding party had come in well out of reach. Although the Squad did not realize it, they served as a useful distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have an idea...\" Whispering, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you kids really think you could spoil our little party by snooping around here?\" Frowning, Blitzkrieg demanded. \"We were hoping to lure out  someone with a little more experience than you four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, they were just a distraction.\" Startling, the men, mom called out from her roof top perch. \"The pups wanted a taste of the action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we gave it to them.\" Entering the scene, Garth added. He grinned. \"Good to see you again, <i>mister multiple personality.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tex the mighty...\" Frowning, Blitzkrieg said. \"It seems you still haven't grown up, in body or mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I grew up, <i>giggles.</i>\" Sternly, dad said, showing himself. \"We just tend to multiply, not unlike you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitzkrieg looked about to find that not only was the ship he arrived in was gone but so were his hostages. On top of that, the men he brought with him were passed out on the ground. He turned to dad with a scowl. \"You have improved over the years.\" Darkly, he said. \"Where have you been hiding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come now, <i>baker's dozen</i>.\" Grinning, mom said. \"We haven't gone anywhere which is why you will never control this city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not welcome here.\" Coldly a tall man said. \"The Problem Child gang and its allies will stop you... always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg the ghost...\" With a scowl, Blitzkrieg said. \"We are here to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flush out the problem child gang or whatever freedom fighter team that had taken their place.\" Firmly, I interrupted. \"Only I was aware of your plan in advance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject 147, you are unauthorized to be here!\" Angrily, Blitzkrieg barked. \"Return to your station immediately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad took hold of Blitzkrieg's neck and easily lifted him off the ground. I found that my force fields did well to prevent him from making clones of himself. I do not know if it was a programed response to protect him or to take him down from those higher up but, for the moment, it was working in our favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aegis is a member of the new problem child gang.\" Darkly, dad said. \"She is no longer in yours or anyone else's control.\" He then dropped Blitzkrieg to the ground where he began to cough from lack of air. \"Take your men, go back to your little plane and tell your superiors that the problem child gang is here to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not over, Tex the mighty...\" Angrily, Blitzkrieg hissed. \"We will be back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will be ready... <i>old man.</i>\" Calmly, Garth countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitzkrieg threw Garth a death glare then pressed a button on his watch. His boarding party vanished with a dull flash. Once they were gone, dad turned to the Squad. \"Get out of here before the police arrive!\" Firmly, he ordered. He turned to mom and I. \"All of you, leave... NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and I ran to our van with Garth and Grace hopping in with us. The Squad ran to their all terrain vehicle and roared away with the others following. Mom and I with my new siblings declared, \"Problem Child!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not the sex, not the request that I not say anything about what we did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a whole week, we repeated the process: He would pick me up, drive me to school, and we would have sex in his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the next week, I began my walk, but he didn't pick me up. He didn't even drive by. I realized that the road must have been reopened, and he went back to his usual route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt bothered me a lot, at first. However, as I thought about it, I realized that he knew more about me than I knew about him. He hadn't even told me his name. The only thing I knew about him was that he drove on the road that had just been fixed. I decided to put the whole thing down to bitter experience and move on, with nobody else needing to know anything about what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kept thinking that right up until the morning of my graduation, when my breakfast went back the way it came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter my tenth trip to the bathroom to pee, I finally figured out that something was desperately wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brings me to the beginning of my story: me, in the bathroom, staring at the plastic stick which told me my life was over with one word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPregnant.</span></div></div>",

No name, no address, just a general description and make of car. What was worse, I had sex with him not knowing why or even thinking it might not be a good idea. Fearing what my family might say or do, I ran to the local clinic to ask a doctor about my options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was met by a Dr. Hal; a young doctor, in her late twenties, with a lean but powerful body, long brown hair and green eyes. Upon telling her my story, she sighed as she shook her head. What surprised me was that she was not looking at me in disappointment but rather in pity. \"I should scold you for getting knocked up so easily by a total stranger, Miss Mara.\" With a startling calm, she said. \"However, I know the person you described all to well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... do...?\" Taken back, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Hal nodded. \"He goes by the name of J. T.\" Serious, she replied. \"He is a perverted son of a bitch who has the ability to talk anyone into or out of anything he desires, including a woman's virginity. He likes to toy with young ladies who were born in this town.\" She sighed before adding, \"You are far from his first victim but, fortunately, he cannot get anyone pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confused me. \"But I took the pregnancy test...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That test can't tell the difference between a baby and an awakened symbiont.\" Confusing me more, Dr Hal said. \"I take it you were born in this town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded but was too stunned and confused to respond. Dr Hal nodded back then continued. \"I know this is a lot to take in but I can assure you that you are not pregnant.\" Calmly, she said. \"I will run some tests just to ease your mind but you should be more concerned with what occurs in the next forty eight hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what do you mean?\" Frightened, I demanded. \"Dr Hal, you're scaring me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Hal smiled kindly. \"As I said, it is a lot to take in.\" Softly, she said. \"Let's take it one step at a time; starting with proving you are not pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis doctor, although kind, was really beginning to freak me out.

I had met a man who could talk anyone into anything? And now I had something called an \"awakened symbiont\" inside me? One that somehow mimicked the symptoms of pregnancy? All I knew was that I needed to put some distance between me and this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was dressed, I left the clinic. I didn't get far, however. While I was inside, a protester had shown up. \"Baby killer!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Leave me alone,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What are you going to do,\" he asked, \"when you hear the baby you murdered crying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" You don't know anything about me, \" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your baby's in Heaven,\" he told me. \"But you're going to Hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The next thing I knew, he was pulling out a gun. <i>He's going to kill me,</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I felt something well up inside my head and push out, and the protester went flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scrambled to his feet, then ran off, a terrified expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had one of my own.

Second is though contact with an alien being known as symbionts and third being born of a symbiont's offspring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I have an alien inside of me?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These beings offer special powers in exchange for 'room and board'.\" Kindly, the first woman said. \"In your case, I would say your power is telekinesis, the ability to move things with your mind but other powers may follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everyone who lives in this city was born here so we tend to try to keep a low profile unless circumstances demand we take action.\" Serious, Dr. Hal said. \"I too was born here and I have the ability to see and understand everything that is happening inside a person's body by simply looking at them.\" She smiled. \"I call it tele-diagnostics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you run tests to...\" Wincing, I started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To keep those not born here unaware.\" Simply, Dr Hal said. \"Trust me when I tell you that this city has seen its share of trouble each time word got out that some of us had powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped. \"The Problem Child Gang!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Hal nodded. \"They are one of many small groups who attempted to fight those who would take advantage of our skilled populace.\" Serious, she said. \"It goes far deeper than I suspect you are ready to understand but I can assure you that your parents will understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt faint and had to sit down. \"My parents know about this?\" Softly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Hal smiled. \"Where do you think your symbiont came from?\" She then turned serious. \"I am calling your parents to pick you up.

That's when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I touched the countertop, I felt something like an electric shock run up my arm and through my body. When it stopped, I looked completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked like I was made of marble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy skin was marble. My hair was marble. My eyes were marble. My teeth were marble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you really can't blame me for screaming at the top of my now-marble lungs.</span></div></div>",

Anything you do in that regard should be the right thing. She just so happens to be shaped like a house, but she's a person, just the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you, Lucinda,\" ROSIE said. \"I wish I had arms to hug you.

What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, ROSIE,\" Dad said, \"the point of a surprise is to <i>surprise</i>. I'm afraid we'll need to shut down your higher functions beforehand.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really necessary, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so, ROSIE. But I promise, we'll have you back up and running again immediately after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the basement, Dad shut ROSIE down, then we dressed the android and wheeled it into the maintenance room. \"OK, Robb,\" Dad said, \"let's see if you can wow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took off my gloves, just in case my powers were needed. \"Dad, I had a talk with Mom's portrait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear it, honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said you could tell me about a group called the clean-up crew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, the clean-up crew. Your mom and I were in that group.\" Dad connected the smart house computer to the android. \"Basically, we tried to keep people from outside Waterfront City from finding out what a weirdness magnet we were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A 'weirdness magnet'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange things seem to happen here. There's magic, and there have been rumors of a spaceship from another planet crashing here once. Let's facethinthing seems to draw such things to our town. We wanted to keep it all secret, because there's no telling what would happen if word got out.\" He walked over to the control panel. \"Time to see if this works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad tapped keys on the keyboard, then watched the display screen. \"O.K., let's try this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure it worked?\" I asked. \"She's not moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She hasn't been turned on yet.\" He pressed a spot behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe android opened her eyes. \"Something is wrong,\" she said. \"I can only see this one room, and the angle is all wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is wrong, my dear.\" He helped the android into a sitting position. \"This is the surprise we promised you: You are now an android.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head back and forth, then lifted her hands. \"This body is... mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad switched the smart house computer back on. \"All yours, ROSIE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Working,\" said the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back and forth at each of us. \"If ROSIE is the smart house, and I'm not the smart house anymore,... who <i>am</i> I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad thought for a bit, then asked, \"Who do you want to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I want to be... Rose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"Very well, then, Rose you shall be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose lifted her arms and hugged Dad. \"Thank you, Mr. Frye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a servant, anymore, Rose. You can call me Robb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,... Robb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stopped hugging Dad, I stepped up for my turn. As we embraced, I thought, <i>She really is almost human.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt energy flow down my arms, but I didn't think much of it.</span></div></div>",

I found her in the kitchen, pondering over the various snacks we had for in between meals. \"Hey, Rose.\" Catching her attention, I said. \"How would you like to take a stroll through the back yard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have seen the back yard.\" Calmly, Rose said. \"You and Robb seemed to have much fun there though I never really understood why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"Let me show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lead Rose out through the back door into the yard and took off my sandals before placing my feet into the grass. \"Try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit reluctantly, Rose took off her own sandals and stepped into the grass. She let out a low gasp of surprise. \"It's damp and chilled!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No better way to wake up.\" Smiling, I said. \"It won't hurt you, Rose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lead Rose, who was clearly uncertain to the swings and had her sit down on one. After instructing her to hold onto the two ropes holding the swing up, I gave her a push. She let out a low yelp of fright then began to giggle. \"This feels strange but sort of nice.\" Smiling, she said. \"Is this why humans swing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled. \"Yup. It almost feels like flying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does.\" Giggling, Rose said. \"Can I go higher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little.\" Giggling back, I said. \"There is more I want to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me several minutes to convince Rose to leave the swings which reminded me of myself when I was just a child. Then again, Rose was like a child; seeing the world for the first time. I lead her to the edge of the back yard where I pointed out to the east towards the hills near the ocean. \"I wanted to get you out early to see this.\" Smiling, I said. \"Watch the horizon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose watched the horizon as i asked then became wide eyed as the sun began to rise over the hills. She let out an awe filled gasp before smiling, her eyes twinkling with child like delight. \"I have never really seen a sunrise before.\" Almost whispering, she said. \"It's quite the sight to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just a taste of what lies outside of the house, Rose.\" Softly, I said. \"When you think you are ready, i will show you more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I would love that.\" Smiling, Rose said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe shared a hug only I was forced to pause as I felt real skin on Rose's arm. As we parted, I looked but saw nothing unusual. I began to wonder if mom sensed something I didn't.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I led her to a vending machine. \"We can feed this to the ducks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was right. Rose did enjoy feeding the ducks. She laughed as they ate. \"They're eating right out of my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we ran out of duck feed, we started walking around the lake. We greeted others as we passed, but dogs shied away from Rose. \"Why don't they like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid you're the first android they've met, Rose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway around the lake, I stopped at a drinking fountain.

Men were shouting as they moved into the building, against the caretaker's protests. I heard bangs as the intruders kicked in doors and screams of startled children as they were woken from their slumber. There were shouts and screams coming increasingly closer to my room. Someone was searching for something or someone. I don't know why but something was screaming at me to escape from whoever it was. I decided it was probably best to listen to that urge and get out quickly. I grabbed a bag and packed my clothes and art pad along with pencils to take with me. To my disappointment, I realized that I would have to leave my portfolio behind as I was out of room in the bag. Not that it mattered, I would have to draw a completely new portfolio of super heroes anyway and had decided to draw my own super heroes, name them and profile their powers with pictures of them using their powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second interview is going to be magical.\" smiling, I muttered. \"They would have no reason not to hire me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy knock on my door broke me from my thoughts.

It was enough for the man who had tackled me to gain control and force me to my feet. He held me firm as a tall man in a black business suit approached me with a small girl at his side. The man had a strong frame with short light brown hair and copper green eyes. The girl was very short, wearing a standard girl school uniform. She was about five years old with long red hair with blond highlights and fire hazel eyes. She remained silent but watched me with a rising curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean I am in danger?\" trying not to sound frightened, I asked. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am special agent Jon Moore and this is agent Maria Vendetta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nodded but did not speak as Jon continued. \"A madman named Sykes is trying to recruit children and teenagers with extraordinary talent in a bid to create an army.\" serious, he said. \"Its my job to make certain he does not succeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see how that puts me in any danger...\" confused, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon pulled out what I recognized as the portfolio I had handed the new comic book company. Upon opening it, I let out as gasp as all of the drawings I had made were moving on their own! \"It seems that everything you draw comes to life.\" closing the portfolio, Jon said. \"They do not jump from the pages but they can talk and think as if you were talking to them through a videophone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...\" stunned, I whispered. \"What- what does than mean for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon sighed. \"Your gift makes you a great prize for anyone who can control you.\" making a motion with his hand, he said. \"I'm afraid you will have to come with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, I felt a sharp prick on the back of your neck.

The bed I was lying on was of a simple design; as was the small dresser and mirror, opposite side of the room from the bed. To the right of me was an open door, leading to a small washroom while to the left was was a large window that took up almost half of the wall. There was nothing I could see that gave me a clue as to where I was but the card lock on the door, next to the dresser, made me realize that I was not going anywhere for a while. With a sigh, I threw the sheet and light blanket off of me to discover the clothes I was wearing earlier had been replaced with a fashionable pajama top and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been kidnapped.\" frowning, I muttered. \"Where did this agent Moore character take me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled out of bed to find a pair of blue slippers on the floor and hesitantly put them on, as I was barefooted, and began to search the room for clues. Only the door clicked and Jon walked in. He eyed me with a certain coldness before speaking in a firm tone. \"Sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling I had no choice in the matter, I obeyed but I gave the man a glare before I did. \"I want answers.\" looking Jon in the eye, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for the forceful extraction, Tim.\" after a sigh, Jon said. \"Sykes has the ability to influence the minds of young and unsuspecting through a technology we are certain he had stolen.\" he paused, as if to think then added, \"There was no time to convince you to come willingly so I deemed it necessary to sedate you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" curious, I asked \"Wouldn't you have been controlled?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are on to his game and run  an interference wave through our radio transmitter over all of our frequencies, stopping any mind control or mind reading from taking place,\" tapping an ear piece radio, Jon replied. \"Our intelligence tells us that Sykes is very interested in you, Tim; we need to keep him from getting his hands on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I don't have any powers, or at least no powers I can control.\" worried, I explained. \"I'm sure moving pictures on a page is no good to anyone other than cartoonists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon smiled. \"We can train you to gain control of your powers, Tim.\" he replied. \"The ability to make drawings come to life holds endless possibilities. We could use your help to capture Sykes, he is trying to amass an army of powerful kids and teenagers.\" pausing, he added, \"We have to stop him and to do that, we need powerful kids and teenagers on our side as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a bit much to take in,\" I said \"I just want to get a job so I can get out of the orphanage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we strike a deal?\" said Jon \"You come and work for us, we'll pay you well enough to become independent and we'll even provide accommodation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was surprised.

Reaching in, I found a folded sheet of paper. Opening it, I found the drawing of a woman whose cape, tights and top were yellow. I knew who this was. It was one of the first original super heroes I had ever drawn. her name was Sun Warrior.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You have to get out!\" warning me, she said \"They're trying to brainwash you, get out now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" I asked \"How do I get out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know anything about your powers yet, do you?\" asked Sun Warrior, her head in her hands \"All right, let me take over, and I'll get us out of here.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"How do I let you take over?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I felt my hand jerk away from the paper and move to the side. It moved into my pants pocket and grabbed a small pen. Turning the page of the notebook I had drawn Sun Warrior on, I drew a circular window. I placed my finger on the window then dragged it off the page. It turned into a real window floating in the air. On the other side, was a corridor. I quickly climbed through the window into the corridor, still not in control of my body, I ran down the corridor to a wall with what looked like windows at the top of the wall, but no doors leading outside. I again was forced to draw a door on the paper and then drag it off the page onto the wall. I opened the door, stepped outside, closed the door, then dragged it back onto the page, leaving the wall just as it was before. I finally ran away from the building, only to find that I was in an underground complex somewhere! I looked about for a way to the surface but, before I could get far, a boy appeared in front of you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Where do you think you're going?\" seriously, the boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned and ran in the other direction but the boy appeared in front of me again, shaking his head. \"I am Blitzkrieg, the name meaning 'lightning warfare'.\" gravely, he said. \"You have no chance to escape.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMy hand moved to my pocket again, bringing out Sun Warrior's picture. <i>\"You need to use my power,\"</i> her voice in my head, she said. <i>\"Drag me onto yourself, like you did with the doors and windows.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dragged Sun Warrior's picture off the page and dropped it onto myself.    </span></div></div>",

I grew six inches taller, my hair grew out and turned blond as my muscles bulked up a little as you grew. Next, my clothes changed all at once, and immediately, I was wearing Sun Warrior's costume, which looked silly because of my lack of breasts. But not for long, as B cup breasts grew on my chest, and my figure changed slightly to accommodate the costume better. Then I felt my penis being pulled into my body, to be replaced by a vagina. Lastly, although I didn't see this, your eyes turned a very bright blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to speak when I saw words flash before my eyes as if I were looking at a computer screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Name: Sun Warrior.<br>\r\nReal Name: Unknown.<br>\r\nAppearance: Tall with blond hair, bright blue eyes, muscular physique, and B cup breasts. <br>\r\nAttire: Yellow cape, tights and top, black mask over eyes.<br>\r\nBackground: Scientist/Astronaut doing research on cosmic radiation; was selected to go on an expedition to study odd radiation from space. She was caught in a cosmic storm which gave her the power to absorb solar and control solar energy and radiation.<br>\r\nPowers: Solar light/energy/radiation absorption and control; flight through energy propulsion. Strength relative to amount of energy absorbed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Author's note:</b> At full power, she has class B super strength, just under Garth at full power, but without the muscle growth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of the fact I had just turned into a girl, I felt fantastic. I turned to face Blitzkrieg, the teleporter, my fists up, ready for a fight. He vanished again. My hand acted of its own accord, Sun Warrior, my character, was still controlling my movements. I supposed it was best for now, I had no idea how to control her powers, even though I created her and had no problem with her fighting through me. I felt your eyes close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What are you doing?</i> having no idea if Sun Warrior would even hear you in this form, I quickly thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Light sonar.\"</i> replied Sun Warrior's voice in your head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI was about to ask what light sonar was, when I <i>felt</i> Blitzkrieg appear. I felt your body turn, my eyes still closed, and bring both its hands up, energy shooting from them. A few seconds later, I opened your eyes. Blitzkrieg was gone, a pile of ash the only evidence he had ever been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You didn't need to kill him...\"</i> horrified, I thought to Sun Warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I did what needed to be done in the situation.\"</i> simply, Sun Warrior replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You can't go around killing people like that!\"</i> furious, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I fought for control of Sun Warrior's body. Finally gaining control of my own body, I brought her hand up to her head and dragged her drawing off of me. I felt yourself returning to normal as I pulled out the notebook and put Sun Warrior on it. Frustrated, I snapped the notebook shut and shoved it in my pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That kid had been brainwashed, he couldn't help what he had been doing, and Sun Warrior killed him.\" gravely, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew I shouldn't feel guilty about it, but she had used my hand to do it. And by extension, I had created her, so did that make me responsible for her actions? A lot of super heroes had created their own super villain. Had I created one in Sun Warrior? Only time would tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to my relief, I saw Blitzkrieg appear again. He was a bit taller than myself, wearing fashionable jeans and top with high-top tennis shoes. \"Not bad, kid.\" smiling, he said. \"You turned my armor to ash.\" he then turned serious. \"That blast shorted out the cameras for a time, now is your chance to escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must stay behind to help the others, if I can.\" sadly, Blitzkrieg replied. \"I have nothing left to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not contact the police?\" pressing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitzkrieg shook his head. \"The Agency has their hands in everything, including the police.\" seriously, he said. \"Others have tried and were punished in ways I dare not mention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to help.\" determined, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to help, get to the States and go to Waterfront City in New York State. There you will find the original members of the Problem Child Gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, Blitzkrieg was gone and I was left wondering what I should do next, go to the police and report what the Agency had been doing, or start my search of the Problem Child Gang?</span></div></div>",

He was standing at the head of a table, speaking to a room of well dressed but serious faced men and women inside a luxuriously furnished room. I recognized the man, from the graphic novels as a man only known as Alpha, the head of the infamous Agency. Curious, I touched the picture and got a slight shock just before the characters on the page began to move on their own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little over twenty years ago, we encountered the four teenagers you see in the file in front of you.\" turning to someone  out of the picture, Alpha said. \"They had called themselves the Problem Child Gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What is this!?\"</i> startled, I thought. <i>\"Am I making this happen?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first, we viewed them as nothing more than a minor nuisance as they were fixated upon Sykes, a long time enemy to our cause.\" frowning, Alpha continued. \"However, Sykes led them to believe we were his employer and their attention was shifted onto us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes, Sykes.\"</i> frowning, I thought. <i>\"He called himself 'the immortal one.'</i> I chuckled. <i>\"What an ego!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something on your mind, Tommy?\" eying the person out of my field of vision, Alpha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am impressed, sir.\" softly, a boy said. \"To lock horns with the Agency and survive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing I was watching what this mysterious Alpha was doing at this moment, I continued to watch and listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we were impressed as well.\" flatly, Alpha said. \"However, two of the members of that group were the children of the most wealthy and influential families on Earth.\" he frowned. \"To take them then would have been too much of a risk and we let them go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlpha then turned to a professionally dressed tall and muscular woman with long black hair and green eyes, just within my field of vision. \"Beta will take it from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Alpha.\" politely, Beta said. \"Tommy, you will call me ma'am or mistress at all times, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress.\" quickly, Tommy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeta nodded. \"Around the time the Agency had first encountered this Problem Child Gang, we were working on a child soldier project, of which you are a part of, Tommy.\" looking at me, she said. \"We had considered making them a part of that project but, as Alpha explained, it was too much of a risk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"A child soldier project!?\"</i> alarmed, I thought. <i>\"That must be what they had planned for me!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is the Agency interested in the members of this group after twenty years?\" curious, Tommy asked. \"They are all in their thirties by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not them we are after, Tommy.\" with a deadly stare, Beta replied. \"We want their children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart jumped into my throat as I began to understand.

He was of average height with light brown hair, and blue eyes. \"Forgive my tardiness, Alpha.\" politely, he said. \"My flight ran late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Max Hagen.\" frowning, Alpha said. \"Take your seat.\" he then turned to to Tommy, still out of my vision. \"Speak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have found them, sir.\" flatly, Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect track record.\" with an impressed look, Alpha said. \"You've trained him well, Jon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\" replied a male voice, also outside of my vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me where they are and I will grant you one wish within my power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waterfront City, New York State.\" again, flatly, Tommy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Locate this Waterfront City and send a scout team!\" parked Alpha to those at the table. he then turned to Tommy. \"Name your reward for this service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what sounded like a tear filled voice, Tommy replied, \"Freedom.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAlpha chuckled darkly. \"You wish for freedom, do you?\" looking amused, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He's dead.\"</i> sadly turning the page, I thought. <i>\"The poor bastard.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the Agency didn't know where the Problem Child Gang was any more than I did. That meant that if I could get on a flight to Waterfront City as quickly as possible, maybe you could get there before them. I took the book, which was called 'The Road to Rome', and left the library, heading for the nearest transport out of the underground complex to the surface. Fortunately, it was near the guard's end of shift and I was not questioned and quickly reached the surface where I quickly found an empty alley where I changed disguises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, at the airport, I drew Sun Warrior in civilian clothing and gave her a name, as well as a more full background story. The character was impulsive and she had almost killed someone, if not for Blitzkrieg's teleportation, he would be dead. The civilian version of Sun Warrior, named Sandra Sierra, would make a good disguise if ever needed. I was partly to blame for Sun Warrior's impulsiveness. If she would continue to control her body through me, I would have to make her more restrained. I also started working on a second character. This one would be a male character, who can create both fire and ice, being able to fly by directing hot air into his cape which would inflate and act like a hot air balloon. I also drew a civilian version of this character before the plane landed in the airport in Waterfront City... just in case it was needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't see any unusual extra security in the airport, so I assumed that the Agency had not arrived yet. I quickly left the airport before returning to my normal form and headed for...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As I entered, I stopped one of the officers who was leaving by grabbing onto his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sir,\" quickly, I said. \"I need help, perhaps you could help me.\" I looked up at the officer and began to quiver; the man was tall and muscular to almost an extreme compared to myself. my lips began to quiver as I added, \"I'm scared.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What seems to be the problem, son,\" looking at me, the officer asked. when I did not answer right away, he gave my hand a gentle squeeze. \"Why don't you come inside and sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and the powerful man led me inside where he got my name and age before leading you to a few chairs that were set up for people waiting to be served and politely asked me to sit down.  \"I am police chief Ted Jones.\" calmly, the man said. \"Why don't you take a deep breath and tell me; what is the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I have reason to believe that a terrorist group called the Agency is sending someone here, to this city, sir.\" genuinely shaken, I said. I looked at the police chief for a reaction, I didn't see one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you believe this Agency is sending someone here?\" pulling up a chair, Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard them talking about it.\" tears forming, I replied. \"I had to do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you come into contact with the Agency?\" his face hardening, Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I was crying as I replied, \"I- I was taken by them.\" I cried a little then said, \"They are after the children of the original Problem Child Gang for some child soldier project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... they've resurfaced.\" a certain growl in his voice, Ted said. \"Can you tell me how you got away from them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything I draw becomes real when I 'drag' it off the paper.\" softly, I replied. \"Let me show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI produced my pen and paper then drew a picture of a small bird and dragged it off the page. The small bird became real and began to sing on my hand for a moment before I placed it back onto the page, changing it back into just a drawing. Ted was shocked but he kept his composure as I then quickly explained how I had escaped and made my way to Waterfront City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to need some protection.\" softly, Ted said. \"I'll need you to tell the new PCG what you told me.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You know the PCG?\" surprised, I asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTed pointed to the graphic novel under my arm. \"I was Tex the mighty, leader of the original Problem Child Gang.\" whispering, he said. \"My children and the children of the other original members have powers of their own, do your parents know that you've left to come and find us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lived in an orphanage,\" sobbing again, I replied. \"Nobody ever adopted me for sixteen years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said something about becoming other people by drawing them?\" curious, Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled out the pictures I had drawn and showed Ted. \"They tried to brainwash me, but I used my powers to escape, I was attacked by a teleporter named Blitzkrieg, he let me escape, he didn't seem to be brainwashed either.\" quickly, I reported. \"I consider myself lucky to have escaped; these guys don't play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are now 'officially' under the protective custody of the Waterfront City police department, Tim.\" standing, Ted said. \"The safest place you can be right now is with me in my home.\" he smiled. \"I was heading there anyway, come home and at least meet my kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if anywhere is safe enough.\" cringing, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed smiled then whispered, \"You are safe with the Problem Child Gang.\" </span></div></div>",

If I do draw the next novels and the characters move on their own, people will see them and I... everyone will be exposed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what you mean.\" nodding, Ted replied. \"We'll work on it, find a way to 'turn off' your powers when needed.\" he then rose a finger of warning. \"Just make certain its not anything someone else can control. If you focus your power on a single pencil or pen, for example, you will be powerless when it is taken away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car pulled up in front of a modest sized house where Ted parked the car in the garage. \"My children, Garth and Grace, are still at school.\" stepping out of the car, he said. \"My wife Heather should be home, we'll have a long talk then see about some living quarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed led me into the house and left me in the living room while he went to find his wife.

Vendetta should be able to kidnap and replace one of the kids then lure the others into our trap.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"A fitting revenge, one served cold.\" leaning back in his seat, Alpha said. \"We will turn their own children into weapons, just as we should have done with them twenty years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe characters on the page fell silent, leaving me shaken.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

I turned to Ted. \"There's something you should know, chief Jones; the Agency are sending or have already sent two teams here to Waterfront City, one team is lead by Blitzkrieg and Psyche, the other is Vendetta, led by her handler Jon. I'm not sure what powers the others have, but as I said, I don't believe Blitzkrieg was brainwashed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to consider anyone working for the Agency as an enemy, Tim.\" seriously, Ted replied. \"You must let go of any attachment you have to this Blitzkrieg for letting you go.\" touching my shoulder, he added, \"I know this from experience, until you can determine otherwise, you must assume he is an enemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded \"What about the other two, do you know them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one of them, Jon.\" frowning, Ted said. \"We know about Vendetta but we have seen her handiwork.

What about the rest of the children, shouldn't we warn them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of that,\" serious, Heather said. \"Be a good lad and go with chief Jones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain on the way, son.\" quickly, Ted said. \"Just come along with me quickly and quietly.\" pausing, he added, \"You just keep checking that comic, if any more intel turns up on the Agency, I want to know about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I was taken to Ted's civilian car where he roughly urged me into the front passenger seat. After he had jumped into the driver's seat, he began his explanation. \"We had a secret underground headquarters set up, which we intended to use if things got too dangerous.\" speeding down the road, he began. \"It is an old subway system project that the city abandoned years ago due to budget issues. The tunnels go everywhere under the city but no one remembers it even exists, they abandoned the project over fifty years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that where you are taking me?\" curious, I asked. \"This underground headquarters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed nodded. \"If the Agency makes their move on our kids, as you had said, it is where we will be taking everyone.\" firmly, he said. \"No one knows it exists and we removed all evidence of its existence from the city records to make sure of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stole them!?\" surprised, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everything about us is all 'goodie two shoes'.\" frowning, Ted replied. \"We did it to protect ourselves but they are not stolen... just misplaced, accidentally sold at a charity auction years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I to do there?\" worried, I asked. \"Are you just going to leave me alone in that place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be training.\" serious, Ted replied. \"The place is fully stocked with fresh provisions and I will be checking in on you every day.\" pausing, he added, \"It is best that you train alone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, we arrived at a dead end road where Ted hit a garage opener. Curious, I looked out and watched, wide eyed as a part of the road slowly sank into the ground, forming a ramp. Ted drove down it and paused as the ramp rose back into position, hiding the entrance. \"Two members of our family are extremely wealthy.\" smiling, he said. \"That was originally the parking garage entrance, we just installed a door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ted parked the car, I stepped out and looked about what appeared to be my new home for a while...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Behind them was a tall and very muscular boy with short sand blond hair and green eyes and a girl of average height but a well-toned body with long brown hair and blue eyes. \"Tim, this is our son, Garth and our daughter, Grace.\" introducing me to them, Ted said. \"Kids, this is Tim, your new little brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears formed in my eyes \"Little... brother?\" choking, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather knelled down, smiling. \"The final adoption papers rushed through only an hour ago.\" looking at me, she said. \"Welcome to the family... Tim Jones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped into Heather... mom's arms, crying. It felt so good to have a family again, I was completely overwhelmed with emotion. \"Mommy!\" whimpering, I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Its alright, Tim.\" stroking my hair, she said. \"Let it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I had managed to compose myself, mom released me and I found myself in the powerful embrace of Ted... dad. \"No one can replace your biological father.\" holding me tight, he said. \"Still, I am honored to call you my son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lost it again, crying into dad's arms. I had been without a family for eight years, turned down by family after family, until I was finally adopted by no other than my favorite hero, a member of the Problem Child Gang! I had come home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are Tim.\" smiling, Garth said. \"Good to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad released me from his embrace and I took Gar's hand, his grip was gentle but like a vice. \"Sam-Same here.\" shyly, I replied. \"I hope we can be good friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends?\" smiling, Grace asked. \"Tim, you are family now, it goes beyond friendship; you are a part of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed brightly at that to which Grace giggled and gave me a warm hug. \"You will never be alone, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Agency... they- they...\" I was on the verge of crying again before mom pulled me into another hug. \"They know all about it, dear.\" cooing me, she said. \"Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGar smiled and, to my surprise, grew to Olympian proportions. \"We are far from defenseless, little bro.\" his voice now booming, he said. \"Like dad, we have talents of our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to dad, standing behind Gar and I nearly fainted as he did the same only he did not grow in size, just in physique as he smiled at me before returning to his normal form. I gaped at him but a quick finger to his lips caused me to smile as I suspected Gar did not know this about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We inherited abilities from our mom and dad through a symbiont.\" returning to normal, Gar said. \"An alien creature, living inside our bodies which give us our power in exchange for 'room and board'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is epic.\" whispering, I said. I then smiled. \"I have a power of my own, want to see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGar and Grace eagerly nodded and I pulled out my pen and pad before quickly drawing an image of a tall female warrior with large breasts and powerful muscles in a tight body suit. I wanted to really impress them so I thought bigger was always better with everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the drawing was finished, I dragged it off of the paper, onto myself and transformed into the woman warrior. \"I am Amazona, Princess of Power!\" I said in a strong female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth and Grace looked at my new form with their jaws dropped as mom and dad merely shook their heads. Once the initial shock wore off, Grace giggled. \"Um... your character is a bit much.\" clearly amused, Grace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you need to tone that character down a little.\" smiling, Gar agreed. \"For one, err, Amazona is proportioned all wrong, she'll have a hard time standing straight, let alone fight anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe costume I was now wearing began to rip and Grace quickly covered Gar's eyes. \"Please put the drawing back before we all get a show.\" firmly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI touched my paper pad and the woman returned to it, leaving me slightly drained. \"I just wanted to impress you.\" pouting, I said. \"Please don't be mad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Grace giggled. \"We're not mad.\" roughing up my hair, she said. \"It's just that Amazona character needs work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't believe me, ask the others.\" smiling, Gar said. \"You'll meet them later.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even if I had her exact powers, which I doubted, she had more experience than I. It was then I decided not to try to copy her but to trip her up by using my own skills. I was not a bad fighter as I had basically grown up in the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may make the first move.\" as we circled each other, Grace said. \"Let's see what you can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made the first move by throwing a high kick but Grace avoided it all too easily. It did not help that I was not used to fighting as a girl. When I was a girl before, her persona had taken over and fought for me or was it all my imagination? There was really no time to ponder over it as Grace took a swing at me, which I too easily dodged and swung back. \"You're pretty good, sis.\" struggling to make a hit, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back at you... <i>sis.</i>\" as if toying with me, Grace replied. \"Only, I think we should raise the bar a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that said, she went at me with a barrage of kicks and swings, hitting me with most of them. I could not believe it, I was losing. Then, I remembered that Grace told me that she can learn any skill, art, or trade in minutes and that had to include fighting styles. She had all of my moves figured out and had found ways around them in no time at all! <i>\"That is an impressive power.\"</i> impressed, I thought. <i>\"I need to find a way to level the field.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a desperate idea came to me and I grabbed my notebook only Grace seemed to be onto me as she charged me. \"You won't get the chance to draw anything else.\" almost teasing, she said. \"I'm too fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then heads up!\" throwing the paper at her, I yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paper flew from my notebook and, as if following my thoughts, wrapped themselves tightly around Grace until she looked like a paper wrapped mummy! Dad called the sparing match over, seeing Grace was unable to move and hurried to her only to see her tear herself free.  \"It seems as if Tim has a telekinetic power over paper, dad.\" blushing, she said. \"We should look deeper into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" eying me, dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am- Am I in trouble?\" worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"No but we should work on that new part of your power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had a lot of old electronic equipment but they all still worked. \"Let's take a look at the sparring match a little more closely.\" queuing up a recording of the fight on a screen, dad said. \"There seems to be more to your power than meets the eye, Tim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he played the video of my transformation into Grace at a much slower pace where I witnessed something that surprised us all. As I dragged the image off the paper, the paper quickly followed, attaching itself to my body! It surrounded and encased my body in an instant, forming a paper body over my own! Then, in a flash, various colors of ink colored everything in, creating a perfect likeness of Grace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible!\" whispering, dad said. \"Here I thought it was some type of magical ability but it seems to be more of a psychic ability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it explain the drawings I make being able to talk?\" stunned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace thought for a moment then asked me, \"Have you ever worked on a character for so long, that it seemed to have a life of its own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made those characters so you know how they would react to certain situations.\" jumping in, dad said. \"When you are not certain of what to do, you ask yourself, what would this character or that character do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the character answers...\" astounded, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a truly unique ability, Tim.\" smiling, Gar said. \"Only becoming someone else only seems to work when it is a character you know well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" nodding, dad said. \"I would focus on summoning only what you know you can control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thought, I asked, \"Do you think I can control this without drawing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can react more quickly?\" asked Grace. I nodded. \"Maybe, give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to my large notebook, about the size of a small satchel, and thought, <i>\"Let's try a suit of armor.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that mental 'command', I felt something wrapping itself around my body, like before and, with the same quickness, I was wearing a suit of armor, like in the medieval times! \"I did it!\" looking at myself, I declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is only the tip of the iceberg, son.\" serious, dad said. \"Its time for some serious training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, dad led me out of the room, back to the main track and motioned me to stay as he continued on for a few steps. Suddenly, his muscles grew in size and he charged me! I yelled out in surprise, seeing him let a fist fly and rose my arms as if to shield myself. In an instant, papers flew from a nearby table and a shield was formed in an instant, meeting dad's fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to me, dad was holding way back and he smiled at the result of his scarring me. \"It's just as I thought, the paper reacts to your mind's need to defend yourself and others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was surprised to find myself now holding a shield but even more surprised to find that a sword had been added, resting in a sheath at my side. \"Did I do that?\" almost whispering, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did.\" smiling, dad replied. \"Though most of it was through reflex, you made that happen.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Immediately, I started flicking through the pages. Unknown to me, my eyes had glazed over as I opened the book. The book stopped on a page with Sykes pictured on it. He was young, fair skinned, with short brown hair and what looked like cat's eyes. I hoped it was just my imagination. He wore what looked like antique leather armor from the middle ages. It was a strange look but I had no time to dwell on it as, like before, the picture moved as if I were watching the man through a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our attack force is prepped and ready, sir!\"  out of the picture one voice said. I suspected he was one of Sykes' higher ranking followers, a captain of the men, perhaps.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Good,\" in a sinister voice, Sykes said. \"We fly for Waterfront City at first light. I am trusting you to commence the attack, bring me the heads of this 'new' Problem Child Gang. I will deal with the original group myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at my new family. \"Sykes has found you,\" my lips trembling, I said. \"At least, he has a rough idea where you are, he's flying to Waterfront City at first light to attack the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much time do we have?\" looking at me, dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI teared up as the picture had stopped moving. \"I- I don't know.\" crying, I said. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call Alyssa,\" grabbing his cellphone, Garth said. \"Grace, you call Cait, see if she has sensed this. Maybe she can give us more details as what Sykes has planned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" grabbing her own cellphone, Grace replied. \"We'll have to coordinate this, Cait's communication with all of us by telepathy and Alyssa's speed will save us a lot of time.\" she turned to dad. \"You might want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already on it, sweetie.\" dialing a number on his cellphone, dad said. \"We need to get the civilians off the streets for when this dirt bag makes his move.\" he paused. \"This is the real deal, kids. Sykes is as dangerous as they come, pray what little training you got was enough.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"We will need disguises.\" suddenly, Grace said. \"We already decided that, but we never got around to it.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that.\" serious, dad said. \"All of us had made costumes for you, similar to what we wore when we fought crime. It may not be your style but there are lives on the line, there is no time to pick and choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the pages in the graphic novel turned on their own until they reached the back of the book, showing a picture of the author, Aaron Flynn. \"Hello, lad.\" in a heavy Irish accent, he said. \"You look like you could use some help and a bit of luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes went wide. \"How are you able to talk to me?\" stunned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be plenty of time to answer that later, lad.\" firmly but kindly, Flynn replied. \"For now, tell your new pop to answer his phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture stopped moving and I turned to dad as he ended his call with the police station. \"You might want to answer that.\" my voice quivering, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad gave me a questionable look but jumped as his cellphone rang...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I turned to Gar worried as he whispered, \"Lyssa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That must be his girlfriend.\"</i> wincing, I thought. <i>\"I hope she's okay.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty tense minutes later, dad returned in the squad car with another car following. I had seen most of the people piling out before but I was still afraid and kept myself hidden. Seeing my concern, Grace smiled. \"You have nothing to afraid of, Tim.\" gently, she said. \"Those are friends, they will not hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, I nodded and followed her and Gar over to them. Mom came out from another hall and joined us as we approached the group. All of them looked shaken, making me worry but a gentle squeeze of my hand from Grace told me I was in good hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took me by surprise as well.\" urging a girl out of one car, Lilith said. \"Welcome to the Subterranean Urban Base station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really existed!?\" startled, the girl asked. \"Does that mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief Jones was Tex the mighty.\" serious, Lilith replied. \"All of it was real, including the Agency, who attacked you today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gulped. \"How did your mom know my mother?\" still rattled, she asked. \"Is there anything else I should know about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, there is.\" speaking up, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to find her walking towards them with Grace and Gar following, keeping me between them. I looked at them, feeling very shy and, by the looks on their faces, it showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blessed be, Mrs Jones and family.\" kindly, Lilith said. \"Who is your new friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Everyone, I'd like you to meet the newest member of our family.\" motioning to the small boy, she said. \"This is Tim Jones, he was an orphan from Europe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense you were in the hands of the Agency.\" serious, Lilith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was but he was not brainwashed.\" cutting in, Cait said. \"His mind is free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and I have already met him.\" smiling, Vague said. \"He has the strange power to make anything he draws come to life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't we meet him earlier?\" confused, Lilith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a sheepish smile, not knowing what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, child,\" patiently, Vague replied, \"he was too scared to come out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We convinced him you were all cool.\" placing a firm hand onto his shoulder, Gar chimed in. \"These are my friends, little bro, you couldn't be in safer hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the S.U.B. Station, Tim,\" Lilith said, holding out a hand. \"My name's Lilith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" shaking her hand, I said. \"If dad had said there were pretty girls like you here, I might have made my presence known sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool your jets, bro,\" Grace told me. \"Lilith isn't into guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that, hearing Gar chuckle a little. <i>\"You can't blame me for trying.\"</i> almost pouting, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you can bring your drawings to life?\" Lilith asked, brushing off the attempted flirting. \"I can call up the figures from my Tarot cards. That sounds similar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly,\" smiling, I replied. \"My drawings actually move on the page. And I can actually become them.\" <i>\"Here is my chance to impress them.\"</i> \"Want a demonstration?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my sketchbook and stopped on one page. \"Say hello to... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving the mental command to become a character, I allowed the papers to quickly surround me, creating my revised character, a new body with me in the center, becoming a part of it, a completely different person. I decided to keep 'Amazona' six feet tall with great muscles but, in my haste to impress everyone, I forgot to be less dramatic with her proportions as Garth and Grace had suggested earlier.  In the blink of an eye, a tall woman appeared where I once stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Amazona, Princess of Power!\" finishing my line, the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith snorted. \"Yeah, you came up with that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" confused, the 'woman' asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you try moving around off the printed page,\" Lilith explained, \"those bazongas are going to be more of a hindrance than a help. They block your field of vision, they'll restrict your arm movement, and they'll make you fall over the second your back isn't straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya, Tim,\" Grace added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried moving around and found that they were right. \"I see your point, younglings,\" Amazona said. \"I am sure the artist sees it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim doesn't just change physically,\" calmly, Gar explained. \"The characters he creates come alive as he envisions them. So you're really talking to a character in a comic book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazona touched the paper again, and the papers returned to the satchel in an instant, leaving me standing sheepishly in front of everyone. \"Thanks for the advice,\" near tears, I said. \"I'll definitely redesign her before I call on her again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do that,\" firmly but kindly, Grace said. \"And, please, stop making her costume rip in strategic places in battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then an evil organisation tries to kidnap you, you escape and leave the country to warn a group of superheroes that the same evil organisation is going to go after their children. In case that wasn't enough for me, I was then adopted by the former leader of the group of heroes. And now, standing right in front of me, were two members of the biological family I thought I had lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma,\" I whispered, running into her open arms. It seemed that during my inner monologue, Garth and Detective Flynn had had some sort of discussion that I hadn't listened to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear your father adopted Tim,\" said Detective Flynn (Or should I start calling him Granddad now?), taking Garth's hand \"I'm glad to see he's in good hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, but how did you get here so fast?\" asked Garth, confusedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say I've had a lot more experience than Tim,\" Detective Flynn replied, then paused and turned to see Ted beckoning to Garth \"You'd better go see what your dad wants. Take Tim with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI broke the hug with Zenia Flynn, and followed Garth. \"We're getting a distress call from the Vance residence,\" said Ted indicating a blinking red light on the console. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne girl groaned and turned into a boy \"Just what I needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary,\" said Madam Vague \"The strength of a Guardian will be needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll probably need this too,\" I said, pulling out a male character I had recently finished working on named  Nightside. Although he had no super powers, Nightside was a master of all fighting styles known to man. I had created him not long after my fight with Grace as herself, thinking that becoming him might help her to train. \"His names Nightside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everyone,\" said Vague \"Focus on the Vance household.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the SUB station faded from existence, I dragged Nightside from the page and onto myself. A blink of an eye later, and we were in a well furnished living room that would have looked nice had it not become a battleground. Nightside immediately engaged the men around him using street style moves mixed in with Martial Arts. I watched as the boy who was formerly a girl did the same. A bullet, unnoticed by her flew towards her shoulder. Nightside pulled her out of the way, causing the bullet to bury itself in the wall instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that,\" she (he?) said, then looked around at the black suited men that surrounded us \"Back to back?\" she suggested. Nightside nodded. Both of them started fighting, dodging attacks and pushing back and slowly but surely, we were pushing the enemy back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo intent were we in fighting off the Agency goons, we didn't hear anything of the battle around us until one of the Agency members shouted \"Pick up brass.\" and they all vanished, leaving nothing but a few destroyed guns on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody OK? asked Lyssa, the girl who had run off earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks that way,\" said Ted. As he continued to speak, I felt something running off me, like liquid, but I ft physically drained. I missed the rest of the discussion as I tried to catch my breath until Garth turned to me. \"You did great, Tim,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" I said, blushing slightly \"I think I overdid it a little with the multiple changes today, I'm exhausted.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go and sit down over there for a bit then,\" said Garth, pointing to a largely intact chair in the corner. I walked over to it and sat down. I sat in the chair and closed my eyes, meaning g to rest them for a minute, I didn't realise I had fallen asleep until I felt a someone shaking me awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Madam Vague. \"You need rest Tim,\" said Vague \"Your endurance for so many changes is commendable, but you can't just rest whenever you feel like it, wait till we get back to the station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVague led you to where the others were gathered in the circle and drew a card from her Tarot deck. The card had a cartoon impression of the moon on it.</span></div></div>",

It was very brief as I was in the middle of trying to escape but I was sure I had seen her face. I began to draw her, hoping it would help. I did not realize, until I was done, that Vendetta was a small girl. My mind went back to where I had seen her and remembered seeing her in a school uniform; the same school uniform used in the Waterfront City schools! \"Vendetta is going to infiltrate the middle school?\" confused, I asked myself. \"That's strange; why would she be ordered to do that? The only person in our group who goes there is...\" I gasped. \"Rhea Rodgers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim!\" came Flynn's voice. \"Tim! Wake up, lad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes darted open and I looked around, confused. \"Weird dream.\" rubbing my head, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just a dream, lad.\" pointing to my lap, Flynn said. \"You had a vision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at my lap and found that I had been drawing in my sleep. Page after page of images I do not remember making, including one of a massive ship that looked like two aircraft carriers linked in a V shape, flying in the sky. \"How could I have had a vision?\" confused, I asked. \"I'm not psychic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you are not.\" pausing, Flynn said. \"However, you have a unique form of extra sensory perception. One that I had found very useful in my day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anywhere there is a picture of you, anywhere in the world, you can see though its eyes.\" serious, Flynn said. \"Anytime you see a picture of someone you had encountered, you can see what they are doing at the moment you stare at the image.\" he smiled then whispered, \"Why do you think I took pictures of the original members when they were fighting crime in my city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a dream that you were telling us about Maria Vendetta!\" quickly, I said. \"She's a little girl and I think she is going to try to kidnap Rhea Rodgers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That attempt was already made.\" calmly, Flynn said. \"I had the same vision and warned Mrs Rodgers to home school her children for their own safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed in relief then showed Flynn the image of the massive ship I had drawn. \"Do you have any idea what this is, grandpa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlynn turned pale. \"The Singularity.\" whispering, he said. he then eyed me with a cold eye that made me shiver. \"Have you encountered a man named Blitzkrieg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I met a teenager of that name.\" thinking I had made Flynn mad, I replied. \"He helped me escape the Agency before I fled to the States.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlynn sighed, his face softening. \"That man is someone you would be better off avoiding.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, is he with the Agency?\" curious, i asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story, lad.\" shaking his head, Flynn said. \"He technically works for the 'good guys' but he has a nasty habit of ignoring the rules. He will do unspeakable things to get the job done.\" he shed a tear, adding, \"Including taking you from your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face turned pale then turned red. \"What!?!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Believing they were with the Agency, come to capture me, I interrogated them, but found them to be working against the Agency as I was. They asked me to come back to their headquarters, so I did. Their leader, a young man named Blitzkrieg, only about ten years older than the oldest member of the Problem Child Gang at the time, told me he had some information that might be of use to me, but I would have to agree to something first, he wished that I join his organisation and fight against the Agency  with them.\" <br>\r\n\"And what did you say in response?\" asked Tim. <br>\r\n\"Naturally I refused,\" said Flynn \"Although their intel would help the Problem Child Gang a great deal, I disagreed with the tactics he had been planning to use to capture me, kidnap, I thought that they're morals were not much better than the Agency. They attacked me, apparently thinking I would join them willingly or unwillingly, but they were no match for me.\" <br>\r\nFlynn took out his own pad and drew what looked like the inside of an aircraft carrier, along with himself at a younger age and several men attacking him. They watched as Flynn transformed into a superhero with the letters 'HS' on his top. <br>\r\n\"Blitzkrieg thought he had me beat, his men overwhelmed me, but I had figured out his weakness,\" said Flynn \"Hit the real one, and the rest would disappear.\" <br>\r\n\"How?\" asked Tim \"There must be hundreds of him, how would you tell which was real?\" <br>\r\n\"I think I know,\" said Grace \"Only one of them gives off heat, right?\" <br>\r\n\"Very good,\" said Flynn \"The HS on my character's costume stands for Heat Seeker, his power is simple, he can tell if an object or person is emitting heat and the hotter someone is, the stronger his blows on them, so in essence, the more his opponents try to kill him, the more they get worked up, the easier it is to kill them, and in this case, Blitzkrieg is the only one building up heat, the effort of controlling the clones is putting up his body temperature even more.\" <br>\r\nThe Flynn on the page punched just one of the clones surrounding him, throwing him backwards into the wall of the carrier. The other clones vanished.<br>\r\n\"You're pretty good,\" said Blitzkrieg, getting up slowly \"Very well, I shall let you go, but rest assured, if I ever find anyone with the same power or similar, I will do whatever it takes to get them on my side.\" <br>\r\n\"As a gesture of 'good faith', Blitzkrieg gave me everything they had on the Agency,\" said Flynn \"He was true to his word, and let me head back to my station, but by the time I got there, the Problem Chid Gang had already left, going after Sykes.\" <br>\r\n\"I think I see what you mean about this affecting me now,\" said Tim \"But if all of this is true, then why did the Blitzkrieg clone in the Agency tell me to go find the Problem Child Gang?\" <br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Flynn \"What I do know, is that years later, after my son and daughter had been born, I lived in constant fear that one of them would develop my powers and CHILD would return, it wasn't until you were born, that CHILD kidnapped you, putting you in an orphanage in Europe. Then Blitzkrieg returned to me, he told me that if I wanted my grandson back, I would come and work for CHILD, again, I refused, but I was oh so tempted.\" <br>\r\n\"What of my father?\" asked Tim <br>\r\n\"He fell into a depression for a few years,\" said Flynn \"Then without warning he disappeared. I tried to track him down through my police connections, but he had vanished completely. I tried tracking you too, but CHILD had been very thorough, I guessed that in a few years, you would become a CHILD agent, and we would never see you again.\" <br>\r\n\"It's all right, Granddad,\" said Tim, crying slightly \"You got me back, I'm fine.\" <br>\r\n\"That's why I'll never trust CHILD,\" said Detective Flynn \"No matter what they offer me, they're blackmailers, backstabbers and kidnappers, all done in pursuit of the greater good.\" </span></div></div>",

He has the power to fly but being only two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine.\" giggling, Annette said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGar nodded then continued. \"Clem Rodgers, shape shifting; Susan Tanner, ghost powers and ninja training; Lilith Nightshade, magical powers and mystic wisdom.\" motioning to the others, he said. \"We have two other members but they are in the hands of CHILD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis Greenway, who is an Animancer and Megan Connors who is a Technomancer.\" turning to Annette, Cait said. \"We suspect CHILD took them after the first day of school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Animancer... Technomancer?\" confused, Damien asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this CHILD?\" serious, Amadeus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An Animancer is a person who can shift shape into any form of animal, including Anthros like Minotaurs or Centaurs.\" serious, Cait replied. \"A Technomancer has the psychic power over machines, making them work on their own within the limits of their design.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can she change into machines?\" curious, Damien asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not without seriously injuring herself.\" wincing, Beth replied. \"Even without that, her power is impressive, hence why we think CHILD wants them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't doubt it.\" stunned, Annette said. \"We have quite an arsenal of power here.\" she winced, asking, \"Are you planning a rescue mission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, new evidence has us thinking that even our power may not be enough.\" softly, Ted Jones said. \"The Agency has people under their control who have powers like our own, they are a greater threat now than when we faced then twenty years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of Sykes?\" curious, Amadeus asked. \"Was he not the greatest adversary of the Problem Child Gang when they were active?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could answer, a number of alarms sounded, startling everyone in the room. \"What was that?\" startled, Beth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad turned to a table and hit a button, causing a large screen television to rise from the floor. It came on, showing camera images all over the city. One showed a number of strange hovering platforms, moving into the center of the city. He hit another button, filling the screen with that image. What they saw was Sykes and a number of his followers on five strange floating platforms, firing what looked like sci-fi laser rifles at random buildings. Dad focused the camera image on a man on the lead platform before a low growl echoed from his throat. The man was tall with longish brown hair and piercing green eyes. He was wearing oddly ancient leather armor as he held a laser rifle of his own while holding the hilt of a sword at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sykes!\" anger in his voice, he said. \"He's returned and he is attacking the city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why!?\" angry as well, Gar asked. \"What could he possibly gain by...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bait.\" flatly, Geo said. \"He's trying to draw us into the open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- What are we going to do?\" worried, Lyssa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll handle this.\" serious, dad said. \"Its us he wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not alone, you're not!\" firmly, Gar said. \"We are the new Problem Child Gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a bunch of kids with no real experience in taking down criminals!\" snapping, dad countered. \"All of you will stay here!\" he then turned to me. \"I need you, however, to come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped. \"Me?\" surprised, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"I'll explain on the way to the surface.\" serious, he said. he then turned to the other parents and nodded before leaving the room with them following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only wonder what my new brother Gar was thinking as I was lead out with the adults. Still, I was more worried about what they needed from me....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I gasped and ran up to it, just wanting to touch it. \"I read all about this van!\" excited, I said. \"It's virtually indestructible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a tough one, that's for sure.\" smiling, dad said. \"However, we need to create a distraction in order to catch Sykes off guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what you need me for?\" gulping, I asked. \"To give you that distraction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"Do you think you can make a copy of the beast with your paper manipulation powers?\" he asked, pointing to a number of tall stacks of paper. \"It will help us get the jump on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the van then turned to dad, uncertain. \"I- I'll try.\" wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a deep breath and close your eyes.\" softly but firmly, Geo instructed. \"Picture the van in your mind in every possible detail from what you had read in the graphic novels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did as I was told and visualized the van in my mind. I tried to think of every detail from the battering ram front bumper to armored tail lights. Once I had the van pictured in my mind, I said, \"I think I got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" softly, Geo said. \"Now, imagine the stacks of paper coming together to build it. Keep thinking of every detail as you do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clenched my fists, giving the effort all of my mental strength. At first, nothing seemed to happen and I sighed, frustrated. \"I- I...\" tearing up, I said. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, son.\" touching my shoulder, dad said. \"You are trying to hard, ease into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a breath and tried again, trying to stay relaxed and, to my surprise, I saw paper moving about in my mind, surrounding the van, covering every inch. In the parking garage, dad smiled as papers flew about in a frenzy, quickly forming the van in every last detail. Within a minute, there was an exact duplicate of the van standing next to the original. Then, to everyone's surprise, it came to life with a roar, the paper van was running idol!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the engine come to life, I opened my eyes. \"I did it!\" surprised, I exclaimed. then I felt an overpowering weakness and found myself falling into dad's powerful arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did great, son.\" smiling, dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat this, Tim.\" handing me what looked like a candy bar, Geo said. \"It will help you regain your strength, we need you to keep the paper van intact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chomped onto the 'candy bar' and nearly gagged. \"It tastes like tree bark.\" making a face, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an energy bar.\" smiling slightly, Geo said. \"I'll admit the taste leaves much to be desired but it will restore your strength quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit reluctantly, I ate the horrid tasting bar and was surprised to find that I was feeling better within minutes of swallowing the last bite. \"Wow, what was in that?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" simply, Geo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes and turned to dad. \"What's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next we, give Sykes what he wants.\" serious, Geo said. \"We give him us. Tim, you will be in the paper van with Madame Vague, who will be driving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make inanimate objects move with the flip of a card.\" mysteriously, Vague said. \"Don't worry, we will be safely away before Sykes fires his first shot at us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will be coming in from another direction.\" nodding to Geo, dad said. \"With luck, we all still have it and Sykes will not know what hit him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Vague led me to the paper van where she sat in the driver's seat while I jumped up into the passenger seat. \"You did not miss a single detail, Tim.\" smiling she said. \"You even remembered the seat belts.\" she touched my shoulder. \"You have a great power; use it wisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"I will try, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVague winked at me. \"Let's go get them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused, seeing a certain sadness in Vague's eyes. It was as if she knew something she was not sharing with everyone. Then I remembered the card she did not reveal and began to worry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fire and smoke surrounded us and hover platforms flew overhead, taking pot shots at random parked vehicles. I saw Sykes standing on a hover platform idling at the end of the road we were speeding up. On his platform, was a huge, sci fi cannon, and it was pointed directly at us.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"When he shoots,\" said Vague \"Get ready to change into a character, I thought we might have bought enough time, but the others aren't here yet, we'll need a longer distraction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then looked through my sketchbook at all the characters I had created. My most powerful one was still Sun Warrior, but with the tweaks I had made to her personality, would she have enough restraint to stop her from unnecessarily killing Sykes, but enough initiative to do what needed to be done? It wasn't Sykes I was worried about, he was practically immortal anyway, and wouldn't really be affected by Sun Warrior's powers to the same extent as a normal person, it was the safety of the buildings and people of Waterfront City that I worried for. I had no time to choose another character, though, it was time for action. The fake Beast exploded just as Madam Vague grabbed me and barreled out the back, barely getting away before it violently exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you could get us out by moving the van,\" I said \"Not us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something is blocking my power.\" she said \"We still need to keep up the distraction, we need to buy more time.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI nodded, putting my hand to the picture I'd already selected.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

As the papers continued to fly around me, forming the clothes and body of my character, Sun Warrior, we landed on the ground, just in time, as a massive, green beam missed us by inches. Sykes stood off to the side, the gun he had just fired in one hand, and a sword in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we have here?\" his voice even and cold, Sykes asked. \"Madame Vague, its been a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not long enough, Sykes.\" rising to her feet, Vague replied. \"I had thought you were dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way, I was.\" serious, Sykes said. \"Only, like the Phoenix, I rose from the ashes of my defeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sykes boasted, my pad and pen appeared in my hand and I drew a sword, pulling it off the page and handing it to Madam Vague. The pad and paper vanished, and I allowed Sun Warrior to take over for the time being. \"Villains talk too much.\" in an almost melodious tone, I heard her whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately flew into the air, glowing brightly as sunlight entered her skin. This feeling was better than anything I had ever felt. It wasn't her controlling my body, nor me controlling hers. We were working together, as one, our thoughts, our actions, they were all unified. I felt energy being absorbed by Sun Warrior's body as she flew around, dodging Sykes' blasts. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Vague circling Sykes as if trying to find a position to attack him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you found yourself a new prodigy, Vague.\" calmly, Sykes said. \"I wonder why 'she' hesitates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\" I asked, in my head. Sun Warrior replied, <i>*Let's do this.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe dived, so fast, we seemed to turn temporarily invisible. We slammed into Sykes so hard, that he was buried in the ground up to his knees. We brought our hands together and shot a beam of energy at the ground around Sykes, sealing the ground around him, so he couldn't get out, or so we hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you've beaten me.\" sarcastically, Sykes said. \"I don't know you, what's your connection to the Problem Child Gang?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI waved my hands in a dramatic way to hide the fact that they were returning Sun Warrior to my sketch book where she had come from. Once the papers were gone, I was left with my super hero outfit, which was a skin tight outfit that was made to look like a number of blank canvases stitched together. As for hiding my face, it was a clever design of my own. It was a paper mask that made me look as if I had no face at all, just the outline of one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Sketch,\" papers flying off me, I replied. \"That is all you are getting from me besides a one way trip to prison for your crimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps when I am done.\" said Sykes \"Only I am confident that the world will be thanking me for my service to them.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs he spoke the real Beast drove up behind, and the original PCG stepped out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect timing.\" with a sadistic smile, Sykes said. \"The whole gang's here, have you come to surrender?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI almost laughed \"Surrender? We've won, your beaten, you won't be getting what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already have what I want.\" calmly, Sykes replied. \"Only I want more.\" he gave a low sadistic laugh that sent a shiver down my spine. \"The Agency is after this as well as revenge. You've defeated us both but you won't be that lucky twice, Problem Child Gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, shut up,\" annoyed, Ted said. \"Your coming down to the police station with us.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"There was one thing I learned from the Agency,\" said Sykes \"Always have an escape plan.\" <br>\r\nSykes glowed with green light, then vanished with his sadistic laughter echoing as the platforms sped away from the city center.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" shouted Ted \"We had him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadam Vague paled then drew a card. \"No, he had us.\" trembling slightly, she said. \"This was a distraction, we've been conned!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeo paused then turned pale himself. \"He needed to bait us into the open so he could see where we exit our headquarters from the sky.\" softly, he said. \"He needed us, the more experienced members out of the way from the base.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kids!\" turning white, Ted yelled. \"He got us away from the substation so his men could attack it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought no one knew about the substation, that it was safe.\" confused, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is completely safe.\" quickly, Ted replied. \"Get in,\" said Ted \"We have to get back, and quickly!\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The last time I had flown as Sun Warrior's alterego, Sandra Sierra, I had used a fake passport I had drawn to look exactly like a real one. This time, the CHILD agents provided me with two passports, one for me, with a different name, and one for Sandra Sierra. I was confident that Sun Warrior's human form was very different from her costumed form, so I did not have to make any changes to her civilian form. I flew as Sun Warrior for two reasons- the first, was that it gave me anonymity when I got there, the second, was that her powers were based on the absorption of solar radiation. Therefore, the longer I stayed in Sun Warrior's form, the more radiation I would absorb, the more powerful I would be when I eventually faced the Agency. The Agency, knowing the great wealth of our family, would be expecting us to come in on a private plane or jet, so that would be what they would be watching. If they also knew of our alliance with CHILD, they would be even more sure of the fact that we would come in on a private plane. So our best course of action, to avoid detection, was to come in on a public plane, and hope the Agency wasn't watching them. I sat with Garth and Grace, talking with them about the mission. <br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm the best choice for your second in command,\" I said \"Why was it that you chose me, Garth?\"<br>\r\n\"You've shown a brilliant grasp of tactical thinking during your time with the Problem Child Gang,\" said Garth \"Your horrified at the idea of killing someone, your kind of tactical thinking isn't something that can be taught to just about anyone, Grace's accelerated learning abilities would allow her to learn it in the time we have, and her analysis of the enemy movements would make her as good a tactical thinker as you.\" <br>\r\n\"Why did you choose a second in command at all?\" asked Grace \"It's not like we're going to let any member of the team get captured or killed.\" <br>\r\n\"We don't know what sort of technology the Agency has behind it,\" said Garth \"Dr Hagen has had time to tell them everything they know about our symbiotes, he's an expert, he could probably create a device that targets symbiotes, not us, and as Dr Hagen already has a piece of my symbiote, I would have to guess that I am the likely target.\" <br>\r\n\"That's why you chose me and Travis,\" I said \"Our powers don't rely on symbiotes, so we wouldn't be affected by an attack like that.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Garth \"I also thought that Travis's unpredictability in combat paired with Grace's ability to predict and counter the moves of her opponents would be a good combination.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I turned, and began flying towards the direction both Cait and CHILD had indicated. It didn't take me long to find what I was looking for. From above, I saw three children running, and what looked like an army chasing them. One of the three children was throwing what looked like purple bolts at the Agency, and many of them fell down, clutching their heads. They returned fire with their alien-looking guns. I flew along the front row, firing a burst of solar energy which immediately burned through the metal, causing the men holding them to drop them, then dive for cover as they exploded, one after the other. I landed on the ground, executing a series of martial arts moves I had never used with Sun Warrior before, but seemed to complement her abilities. The men in the second row turned their guns on me, but were unable to shoot without hitting one of their own. Once I had rendered many of them unconscious, I picked one up, and threw him into two of the people on the second row. He knocked them both to the ground, as I shot a beam at two of the guns, the solar radiation, once again, setting off the explosive as the men holding them threw them aside. <br>\r\n\"Let me through,\" shouted a big, booming voice,as someone pushed their way from the back of the throng \"It's obvious you can't do your job, you need Berzerker to finish it for you.\" <br>\r\nThen, I located the person coming towards me. He was at least six and a half feet tall, towering over the men he was pushing aside as he came to the front, pulling an axe taller than me from his back. The axe glowed with red energy, as he swung it straight for me.  </span></div></div>",

We can take him.\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"We don't even know his powers,\" I replied \"We need to regroup and come up with a better plan of attack.\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"I have a plan,\" said Sun Warrior \"Attack.\" </i><br>\r\nShe jumped backwards out of the giant's reach, and shot a beam of solar energy straight for him. He brought his axe up to block the beam, and the red energy around the edges increased dramatically. There was now also a red glow in his eyes. <br>\r\n\"Thanks for the boost, Sun Warrior,\" he said, then bellowed as he charged towards me, his axe once again coming down, and once again, Sun Warrior dodged, but I felt the axe slightly graze my chest, and it felt like an electric charge went through my body, and I was thrown , spinning, into the circle of agents that had stopped to watch the fight. They pushed me back into the centre, as Berzerker brought his axe down again, this time connecting with Sun Warrior's form. The pain was more than I had ever experienced, and as it happened, I felt Sun Warrior's form leave me as it went back into my sketch book in my pocket. I was weak, mentally and physically drained from both the expended energy, and being separated from Sun Warrior so forcefully. Still, I slowly forced my way to my feet. No hero should die on their knees. I needed to survive to tell the story of the new Problem Child Gang, they needed me, and I needed them. Sun Warrior thought she needed nobody, and that was a mistake. I had tried to change her, to make her more restrained so she wouldn't kill again, but perhaps she was just too powerful. Her overconfidence ended up being her downfall. With the last reserves of my strength, I once again transformed into Sun Warrior, and took off, taking to the sky in less than a quarter of a second. Once above the clouds, I stopped, relaxing as the sun's rays rejuvenated me. <br>\r\n<i>\"Why did you save me?\" asked Sun Warrior \"I deserved to die, I failed, I overestimated my own abilities, there's nothing for me now.\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"Every hero has a fatal flaw, Sun Warrior,\" I said \"Without it, we would be gods. The fatal flaw is your greatest weakness, but by being aware of it, you can turn it into a strength.\"</i><br>\r\n\"How do I do that?\" said Sun Warrior, this time aloud. <br>\r\n<i>\"That, you'll have to discover for yourself,\" I replied \"But right now, Garth needs our help, the Problem Child Gang needs our help.\"</i></span></div></div>",

Every few hours, you would get up and talk with Garth, giving him all the details you could remember about the army that was coming towards you. It was almost noon the following day, when they saw the three figures on the horizon. <br>\r\n\"It's them,\" said Garth \"Sandra, can you get above the clouds and attack from that angle? It's an angle they'll be expecting, don't attack until we've attacked. Attack them from behind, see if you can call out tactics from what you see from above.\" <br>\r\nSun Warrior's costume reappeared on you as you flew into the air, you saw the large mass of Agency goons split into smaller squads of eleven men apiece. One squad had the giant Berzerker in it. <br>\r\n\"Garth, they're splitting off, five squads of ten men, they're fanning out, I believe there's a single powered person per squad,\" <br>\r\n\"We've got a plan, attack on my signal,\" said Garth \"You'll know what to do.\" <br>\r\nYou watched as the three runners crossed the borders of the safehouse and reached the house itself. As soon as the Agency squads crossed the threshold, you could vaguely make out several hundred turrets come out of the ground and begin firing at the Agency, cutting through most of the goons, leaving very few remaining, but one of the remaining started multiplying itself, and another began firing energy blasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now would be a good time, Sun Warrior,\" said Garth as you heard him yell. You flew down towards the five apparently superpowered agents, the rest of the Agency having either vanished, or were unconscious. You recognised the teenage version of Blitzkrieg. You went towards one of the guys that were staring down Travis, in a wolf anthro form. You felt a presence enter your mind, and a voice, but you can't make out the words, as you felt your hand slowly move towards Travis. <br>\r\n<i>\"Tim, snap out of it!\"</i> Sun Warrior's voice pulled you out of the stupor. You realised that another mind was attempting to control your mind. You moved your hand back to focus on the black-suited agent and fired. He jumped out of the way as you landed in-front of the agent. I immediately recognised the man named Jon, the one that had tried to take me into the agency at the beginning of all this. </span></div></div>",

Jon didn't seem to be listening. A dagger of ice forming in his hand, he charged directly at me, throwing fire from his other hand. I dodged the fireballs coming at me, and then caught the ice dagger by the blade in my right hand, wrenching it from Jon. With the dagger, came the rest of the form, coalescing around me instead. <br>\r\n\"What other tricks have you got?\" I asked, my voice overlapping with the unnamed hero I was now. <br>\r\n\"Your powers are formidable, Tim,\" said Jon \"But it will be your overconfidence that will be your downfall.

Still, Alice began drawing in the sand that this area had become, drawing various unfamiliar symbols and muttering more latin words. The glyphs began glowing.<br>\r\n\"These glyphs should keep powers contained so we don't damage anything,\" said Alice \"Show me what you can do.\" <br>\r\nYou once again opened your pad, this time turning to the new hero you had been working on on the plane. He was a master of energy, able to absorb, redirect or deflect any energy that may come at him. You dragged it off the page, and onto you, and walked into the circle. Alice began to speak in latin, her hands lighting up as she flung balls of light at you. You instinctively dodged alot of the balls, and they dissipated harmlessly against the walls of the magic circle. You charged at Alice, the next volley hitting you head on and being absorbed. You brought up your own hand, and opened it, forming an identical ball and throwing it back at Alice. She dodged to the side, and began running to the side,throwing more balls as she did. You simply batted these balls aside, as she stopped, changing the words she was speaking. This time, her eyes glowed purple, and you felt a sudden wave of drowsiness come over you. You dropped to one knee, before shaking it off, and standing back up. You charged towards where you thought Alice was, but moved right through what you had thought was her, and hit the wall of force keeping you in. Looking around, you saw that the circle was empty. Standing there, you felt something barrel into your side, knocking you flat on your back. The weight on top of you manifested itself into Alice, her eyes now glowing with a pink light, and suddenly, there were two more of her, each of them holding down a different part of him, but they all felt real. Their weight holding him down all felt real. He yelled out incoherently, and energy was expelled from every point of his body, throwing all three Alice's off of him, just as he fell, unconscious. </span></div></div>",

Pulling her image onto yourself, you pulled yourself up. <br>\r\n\"Help me outside,\" you said in Sub Warriors voice.

I did not know how I knew they were stun guns but I had no time to dwell upon it as the first man fired his weapon in my direction. There was no time to think, I jumped out of the way and saw the small dart embed itself into the wall near my ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I going to get out of this one?\" trying not to panic, I asked myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Let me help.*</i> came a whispered response. the voice came from my pocket sketch book. I pulled it out and the pages turned themselves to reveal a man in his late teens with black hair, hazel eyes, and a stone chiseled face. He wearing a black suit and a long black jacket, all the markings of a dark hero. \"No time to explain, just trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having any ideas at the time, I took my pen and dragged the image off of the page and placed it against myself. In an instant, I had become the man I had dubbed Da-unus, Latin for 'the one.' He had one simple but powerful ability, he had the power to defy the laws of physics. \"Lets make one thing clear,\" hearing the men cautiously approach, I whispered, \"I am in charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*You act, I will guide your movements.*</i> came Da-unus' voice in my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, I drew two stun laser guns on a clean sheet of paper with incredible speed then dragged it off the paper, causing it to become real in my hands. I then placed the pad of paper into my pocket and ran out with the weapons at the ready. I was amazed by how quickly I was able to move, dodging every last dart that was fired in my direction as I fired one laser shot after another, hitting each men in turn. Of course, it took more than one shot for each person, I would have considered myself a fool to think it was going to be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I could see every dart move as it they were in slow motion, making it easy to dodge them as I fired back against my attackers. I could hear an alarm sounding, Jon or one of the guards must have triggered it to announce that a prisoner was trying to escape. <i>*We have to finish this now, Tim.*</i> warning me, Da-unus said. <i>*We will be overrun in seconds unless we can reach the elevators.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's finish this.\" knotting my jaws, I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving with speed and skill I would not have without Da-unus, I almost literally danced between the flying darts and took out the last of the guards before running for the elevators on the far side of the large room. I saw other guards approaching but I had no time to engage them. I instead found myself grabbing two of the guards. Da-unus was guiding my movements but I did not see how I could lift one man, let alone two. Only, to my surprise, the two men seemed weightless as I easily lifted them by the belts and used them as shields from the flying darts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Of course, Da-unus can defy the laws of physics.\"</i> amazed, I thought. <i>\"He made the men weightless the second I grabbed them... weightless to me but not to anyone else.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the elevators, I threw the two men at the advancing guards and hit the surface button on the elevator, hoping I will reach the surface before they can cut the power, halting my escape...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At the same time, I felt my strength quickly leaving me. My knees shook then buckled and I slumped down onto them, barely able to move! This was not good as I knew that my captors were certain to give chase at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" frightened and confused, I whispered. \"Why do I feel so weak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it occurred to me that using Da-unus must have sapped my strength as his life force, his powers, had to be fueled by something and that had to have been my own reserves. I began to feel desperate as the elevator came stop and the doors opened. Fortunately, there was no one to be seen... yet. I weakly forced myself to stand before stumbling out of the elevator to find myself in what looked like a low office building with people walking back and forth. Some had children with them, making me feel sorry for them as I had a good idea what might become of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I have to get out of here, tell someone what is going on here.\"</i> staggering forward, I thought. <i>\"Only who would believe me, how deep does this Agency go?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to sweat, seeing a number of guards walking in my direction and gave a desperate glace at the main entrance. Even though I was near the point of complete exhaustion, I had to get out of the building and find a place to hide until I could at least catch my breath. I could feel my knees, my whole body shaking from sheer exhaustion as I began to walk unsteadily towards freedom. The guards, I noticed, were fingering their stun guns as they came closer and I felt myself beginning to cry. My chances of escaping seemed very slim. Then, just as I was certain I was about to be grabbed by the first guard, someone grabbed me from another angle and I found myself in an alley somewhere outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!?!\" hoarsely, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was quickly turned to face a tall boy, around the age of fifteen, with short blond hair and blue eyes, wearing a black business suit and gloves. There was something about the boy's glare that made me feel very much afraid. \"I have just given you a chance, kid.\" in a grave serious tone, he hissed. \"I suggest you get as far away from here as you can and try to lead a normal life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" weakly, I asked. \"Aren't you a prisoner of those... people too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late for me, kid.\" almost sadly, the boy replied. \"All I can do is fight them the best I can from the inside until I am caught... and killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy began to walk away but paused as I called out, \"Can you at least tell me your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a birth name, not anymore.\" softly, the boy replied. \"They call me Blitzkrieg, its German for 'lightning warfare' so I guess you can call me Blitz for short.\" after a thought, he added, \"I suggest you keep better track of your reserves in the future. You won't stay free or alive for long if you push yourself into exhaustion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he vanished completely, leaving me wondering what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It did not work out so I am trying a new angle. Here it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Please note</b>: Changes have been made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE RULES...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Do not kill the main character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. All chapters are to be written in first person. (I, me, myself, I'm, etc.) This makes you the main character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. New characters are welcome but I ask you to keep this an original story, avoid using already made up characters (unless if being used in reference ie: he's as strong as Superman(c).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Love scenes are allowed but only in general terms... remember the rating +13.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. The power of the main character you choose must start out weak then grow with new powers surfacing if needed. (No instant super heroes, the character you choose must work up to that over time and practice.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. The character you choose <b>must</b> keep their power a secret or be very careful who he or she shares the secret with. In this story, super powered people (super heroes or villains) <i>do not exist</i>. The main character is the first to surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. The power(s) you chose for your character must be tasteful and believable.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIf you have any questions, feel free to email me and ask, I am a reasonable person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHERE ARE A FEW CHARACTERS YOU MAY CHOOSE FROM...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are either...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Clem Rodgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Garth Jones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Megan Connors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Susan Tanner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Caitlin Spencer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Alyssa Vance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther characters are available; look through to see who you would like to follow. You may add new characters if you wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Important note:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one thread of several of these characters, we are following one single plot. Twenty years ago, a small group of teenagers, each with unique skills or gifts, formed what they called the Problem Child Gang. This group, with other members adding to their numbers, worked to fight crime in Waterfront City like many a super team in the comic books they had read. Sadly, the entire group was nearly killed on their last mission, forcing them to give up crime fighting. Now, twenty years later, the original members of the group have kids of their own and they are developing powerful gifts of his own, making them fear a repeat of history. The parents reveal their past and try to detour their children from repeating their mistakes but fate forces them to allow the Problem Child Gang to rise again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story was inspired by Stan Lee whose characters are legends in the super hero universe.<br>\r\nRest in peace, Stan Lee. Know that your legacy carries on. Excelsior!<br>\r\n</td>",
