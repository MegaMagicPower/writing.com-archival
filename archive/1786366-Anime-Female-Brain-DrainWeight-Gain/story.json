Even though it seemed to be something that was unimaginable here it was existing with six children roaming she world trying to figure out how they got to here in the first place, being in summer camp wasn't all to exciting on it's own but being dropped in somewhere that they had no frame of reference to go on was worse, not knowing what was going to like around the corner has placed a seed of fear in their hearts as the digital world crawled with all manner of friend and foe. &lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One such child who was dropped into the digital world was a girl by the name of Sora, she was brave and fearless in her own ways, known as the digidestined of love Sora knew that she had to comfort the other kids that were trapped here with her no matter the cost. \"Come on just a little further up this hill and we will be in a new zone\" stated a little orange dinosaur looking creature who accompanied them along with other friendly inhabitants of the digital world, one such creatures that has taken a liking towards Sora was a digimon that went by the name of Biyomon. Her and Biyomon begun to explore the new done in which they had found themselves and the other children and digimon in, unlike the forest some in which they crash landed into this one was more rocky and rough, looking like a cross between a desert and mountains the area was not something that they were used too due to never being in such a area before the sun beat down on the kids draining their resolve to push forward.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Although they knew that other digimon had lived in the area before they had even arrived in this area it was another thing to assess the particular set of dangers these digimon could be to the children, with black gears taking hold of the mind of nice digimon corrupting them into something that not even their friends could reconize. One such digimon that has been tasked to getting rid of these children by the influence of the black gear embedded in it's back had been lurking in the peaks of the mountains waiting for the children to lower their guard so that they could strike. looking like an old woman, grandmotherly in appearance this particular division only known as Babamon had a plan to get rid of the bearer of the crest of love if she could only separate her from the rest of the kids.</span></div></div>",
