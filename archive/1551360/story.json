There are two sides: the Twatterati and the Rebellion. WHat side are you on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twatterati are pseudohipsters that are addicted to the miccroblogging service. They have spent enough time Twittering to know how to use the program to brainwash people. All they need is time and a plan for what to do with those who are brainwashed. Once they have that, they are prepared to instill something of a New World Order. Little can be gleaned about them, except they're like cocaine: instantly addictive. Without getting close enough to become addicted, some sources say the leader of the Twatterati goes by the name Alp4aMe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rebellion consists of people who are on the internet but have learned how to fly under the radar. They heard around about the Twatterati's dangerous plans and feel it must be stopped. People who choose to take on the Twatterati have a difficult job, as making the connections to the core group is time consuming if one doesn't know where to look. If one can contact the Rebellion's Leader, FuegoPura, it's only a tiny step in quashing the Twatterati.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sides in this war are taking shape. Where do you stand in this frivolous battle?</span></div></div>",

I'm the sort of person who enjoys nothing better than a good fanfiction- there's just something relaxing about having the character, setting, and plot taken care of already, leaving you to think up the absurd situation or ridiculously unlikely love triangle. While waiting for my favorite Twilight/Harry Potter crossover to be updated with another sexy, sweaty, drool-inducing chapter of Vampire Harry, I found myself craving something new, something fresh. I'm not sure exactly how I got sucked into Twitter, but within two seconds of creating an account, I was hooked. When I heard about the Rebellion setting out to damage the glorious mission of the Twatterati, I knew that I had to fight them, but how?</span></div></div>",

I saw ads for it in a few places but was surprised to find it was a physical group that met in my hometown. After filling out a contact page, I found a list of meeting times and places. The next meeting was only a couple days away. I figured I might as well go to that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe gathered at the Lyric Theater and sat on the main stage. Twenty or so chairs were placed in a semicircle facing out toward the seats. By the time I arrived, only two seats were empty. I snagged one near an end just as a borderline anorexic guy ran up on stage and stood in front of us. Looking around, it seemed a lot of people assembled knew this guy, as their faces relaxed or even turned into small smiles. Their reaction soothed my nerves, even though the lot of these people were overweight and looked like they hardly left their houses. I should have guessed given this was a group of people who lived at their computers. Then again, my slim figure and my biological sex (I'm a girl) made me look like one of those blasted Twatterati members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting was kind of dull, dominated by one guy's verbal dissertation on a Google hack that could be used to access streaming porn around particular firewalls. Just as I was about to fall asleep, Mr. Manorexic (as I started calling the group leader in my head) dismissed the meeting. As I got up to leave, a skinny but cute guy with a mop of reddish brown hair approached me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ailsa, right?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you here looking for information on how to find FuegoPura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid smiled. \"That's my little secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocking my head, I told him to give it up without uttering a single word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what. I'll buy you dinner and tell you how I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree food? I could swing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" I said, \"maybe. But who are you, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Gregor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Gregor....\"</span></div></div>",

In actuality he Igor McTweeter, one of the worst of the Twatterati in the state, but of course Ailsa wouldn't know that. That's why I'm here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've got her back, even if she didn't know it.  The waitress seated them in a corner booth just across from me and as he slid in, I shot a small ice needle into his right butt cheek making him jump and bump his bony hips on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the waitress took their order, he had to excuse himself to use the restroom-they don't call that Ice needle shot the Volcano for nothing!  As soon as he had the door closed behind him I approached Ailsa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know me, but I know you're on the Google Team.

As I sit here nibbling at something that vaguely resembles a slice of pizza, I try to ignore the din of people texting each other and jabbering about their blogs. I might be a 16 year old guy, but I really do not see the appeal of chattering about your clothes or showing off pictures of your drunken shenanigans on the internet. If it wasn't illegal and immoral, I'd hit of those vapid, popular bitches that I know blabs about her personal shit all the time. It's ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that this chatter was hindering my appetite more than anything, I tossed my lunch in the trash and headed out the door. I still had about fifteen minutes until my next class, so I wandered the courtyard wondering what to do with my time, seeing that I had next to no appetite. Not wanting to look at my mostly complete Spanish homework, I grabbed a copy of the school newspaper. There wasn't too much interesting being written, but I was so bored I started reading an article on Twitter. Apparently the reporter caught wind of some sort of battle between militant Twitters and some small group on the internet calling themselves the Rebellion. Rebellion? Seriously? Haven't these people heard the joke about fighting on the internet and how it's like the Special Olympics? Hell, even President Obama knows the score on that one. I just hope he doesn't Twitter on his Blackberry or any of that shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the bell rang, I had read the paper from cover to cover, which still didn't get the stupid story about Twitter and the Rebellion out of my head.

Like a pigeon with no where to go he tottered up and down trying to avoid any contact with a student. The class returned the favour and ignored him entirely. As I walked in the room well after the last bell, no-one even noticed. The class had segregated itself by blatant and unchangeable rules of social groupings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Leonnard, the teacher's pet, was drifting without purpose now that there was no-one to dote on him and no homework to bury his fears in. He wandered through the text book trying desperately to find some piece of knowledge to hold onto so he wouldn't get sucked into the vortex of uselessness that is puberty. The jocks stood over the cheerleaders who were poised to look non-chalant as they sat updating their facebook statuses. I suddenly had an image of instinct driven male primates dueling over a mate and laughed to myself; what could she possibly be writing? \"Crotch in my face, what's new?\"  The gaming nerds sat in a clump at the back or the room. This group is easy to identify; they look greasy, red-eyed and like they haven't changed their cloths in a week, they are smelly, oily and uninterested in reality. The group heaved and jolted, reliving their great adventures as gnomes and trolls in grunts and snorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only seat open was next to the high tech snobs group. These are the people who will one day design Schwartzeneggars \"Terminator\" robots that will take over the world. They are crisp and slick, always wearing black and never bothering with spoken word. Their eyes dart back and forth across a screen as their fingers nimbly take hold of the keys. Why speak when a machine can do it for you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sit in the open seat next to David, a Korean exchange student who openly laughs at our education system. His eyes flicker back and forth as his fingers dance on the touchscreen. I glanced at the brand new tech and flinched as the home page of his twitter account gleamed back at me. Can a person not escape this beast that consumes our devotion? I would just like to have a normal conversation for a change, is that even allowed these days?</span></div></div>",
