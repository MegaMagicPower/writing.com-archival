This whole phenomenon will ether end terribly, or just might take some time getting use to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey. I'm making a new interactive, about Pokemon, and the new Dynamax \"feature\". Because despite being the obvious candidate for macro material, no one on this site seems to want to make a interactive story for it, so i guess I'm filling in the space here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's a few rules and clarifications before we start:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-This interactive is mainly going to focus on giantess material, but unlike my last story(which is not doing to well.) this can also have male giants to, so a little something for everyone. Pokemon (except Zacian &amp; Zamazenta, For \"lore\" reasons.) can be effected, but they aren't the main focus here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Clothing can be effected by Dynamax in this story, so they can grow with the user, but don't let that stop you from having it tear off during the growth sequence. Just don't make them entirely nude. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">(please?)</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-This won't just be restricted to the main series games. This story can take place in the anime, manga, and spin-offs, as long as it's Pokemon related. (Smash Bros. might be a stretch, I'll get back to you on that.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Dynamax is usually instantaneous, has a set height, and last for three turns (however long that is in real time), but the growth can be slow or fast, last as long as you want, and they can be any height you want as well. This is a Fanfiction, GO NUTS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that should cover everything, hope you consider contributing and enjoy this story, and I am honored to be the first person to make a Dynamax Interactive for this website. <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">(If that's considered an an honor for some reason)</font></td>",
