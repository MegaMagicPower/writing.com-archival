            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You walk quickly through the empty halls of the school, rushing to get home. You've already spent longer here than you'd wanted to, since you hadn't expected there to be such a long line to speak with the teacher you needed to talk with about your grades. By the time you got up to her and finished your discussion, it was already way later than you'd hoped it would be, so now you're hurrying through the halls long after the last class of the day has ended, worrying about how you'll have time to finish your truckload of homework now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pass by one of the classrooms, you notice movement inside through the door's window. Strange; there shouldn't be anyone in class still. You wonder if it's just a teacher finishing up some stuff before heading home, and for some reason, you're very interested in knowing what's going on in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over and look through the window, and to your surprise, see a short mousegirl with shaggy brown hair, freckles, and buck teeth tinkering with some sort of gun-shaped device. Your eyes widen as you examine the device, and note how much it looks like a weapon. Is this girl making a gun to blow up the school or something? As cool as that sounds, you don't fully like the concept, and, despite your better judgement, you decide you should step in and see what's going on. Best case scenario, she's actually making a gun and you save everyone in the school. Worst case, she's not making a gun and you just end up embarrassing yourself slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, not entirely sure why you're deciding to act like the hero, you throw open the door and enter the classroom. The mousegirl literally jumps form her seat, quickly reaching down and picking up the gun after she recovers from the initial shock. You freeze--she's aiming it right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... please don't shoot me,\" you begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" the mousegirl stammers in her high-pitched and squeaky voice. \"I thought this wing of the school would be empty for a while!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not. What's with the gun? You planning to shoot some people? Blow up the school? Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mousegirl starts the shake, and her grip on the gun seems unsteady now. \"N-no, I'm not... please, just leave! I was really hoping to keep this a secret...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's got to be bad if it's a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not bad, honest! Just... Just leave, alright? Don't make me use it on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat makes you stop and think. If this is actually a weapon, it's probably a good idea to run and get some help from the police, or someone who could handle this situation better than just an ordinary student like you. However, there's definitely something up with the mousegirl and her gun-thing, and you're not sure about leaving her alone, especially if you're not sure just what the gun is and what it can do. Right about now, you're wishing you hadn't foolishly rushed in here, but hey, you're here now, and you have to choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what do you do? Run and get help, or stay and handle this yourself?</span></div></div>",

With speed you didn't know you had, you lunge at the mousegirl, reaching for the gun, hoping to surprise her so she doesn't use it on you. She gives a high pitched squeak of surprise, and unfortunately for you, pulls the trigger instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jolt of pain shoots through you, and you instantly fall to the ground. You start to black out, and the last thing you see before you fall unconscious is the mousegirl kneeling down, having dropped the gun, and bringing her paws to cover her mouth in shock....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, something is very different. You're still in the classroom, and lying on your back now, that much is obvious. However, it's from a very different perspective. Propping yourself up on an elbow and looking around, you realize with a shock that you're lying on one of the tables... And you're tiny! Somehow, you've shrunk, but you can't easily tell your current size. As you lie there, propped up on an elbow, stunned at your current position, you hear a very quiet voice from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... You're awake,\" it says, sounding glad yet sheepish. You look towards its source to see the mousegirl sitting on a chair at the table's side near you, only now she's giant compared to you. You stare up at her, marveling at her size, and the huge bright blue eyes gazing down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... Happened?\" you ask, stammering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, confession time... That gun was a shrink gun. And I just shrunk you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured that out myself. How small am I though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had it set to...\"</span></div></div>",

You had used that popularity like most did, to pick on many of the herbivores in the school and most of the nerdy furs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts because of your behaviour that you get into this mess though, as you pad quickly down the empty corridor on your way to early morning cheerleader practise.  You round the final corner quickly but someone is in your way, but there isn't nearly enough time to dodge as you walk right into the shorter fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small mousette falls to the ground with a loud squeak, a small device she had been carrying clatters to the ground by your feet.  She glares up towards at you through her glasses, \"What the hell did you do that for!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply shrug down towards the small mouse, hardly even worth the attention she has already gotten. \"You shouldn't have gotten in my way.\" You say with a small smirk down to the little mouse before you step past her and begin walking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\" You hear her say from behind you but you ignore her and keep walking towards the door to the changing room.  You only get about three metres before you feel an electric shock hit you in the back and move through your entire body quickly.  The next thing you know it you're lying in complete warmth, surrounded by a thick layer of pink cotton.

A smirk appears on her short muzzle as she looks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't speak for the rest of the short trip as a few moments later she opens the doors into one of the empty science labs and steps inside.

You try to stand up but there is far too much of the pink cotton ontop of your like there is a large pile ontop of you, so you are mostly just pinned under the cotton.  You lift your paws up and push at it, but you can't even budge it a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly booming voices fill the room and they're very familiar to you, the rest of the Cheerleader team, but the voices seem so much louder then usual.  You recognise the voice of Casey most of all, the young tiger's voice had always been the loudest, but even not it seemed to be booming as if amplified. \"Hey, there's Sam's things.  She must be around here somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink as they talk about your things... but that couldn't be, you're wearing your...with a glance downwards you notice you're totally naked now.

Casey was head-bitch of the cheerleaders and of most of the school, mainly because of her breed.  Cats though mostly larger then canines and usually better and stronger predators were always considered to be lower than them in the natural order.  Casey had always wanted to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer keen feline eyes look down at the small pile of clothing at her feet.  She seems to pass over where you are peeking out off before her gaze suddenly snaps back sharply to where your small head is visible.  You let out a sharp yelp and duck back into cover again, trying to hide yourself under the clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... She must have been in a hurry, she left her panties and bra here.\" The huge cat says to the other girls, slowly leaning over the clothing so she can scoop up your clothing.

You land ontop of her clothing inside the bag, the movement having knocked you free so you end up sitting ontop of the pile of clothing inside.  You only get a second to look around the bag before the all too familiar, but now strangely loud sound of a zip closing, and the world goes dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up slowly ontop of the soft pile of clothing, trying to look around at the landscape made of clothes that stretches out around you.  It is far too dark to see much, but you can make out that you are standing on the crotch of your own panties, because of the large bow sitting close by you, a bow that was usually only an inch across as half your height across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nearly overpowering stench of feline sweat is all around you, the cat obviously having already stripped her clothing into the bag after training.    You start to move down the 'hill' in the landscape where your clothes had landed, trying to see if there is anyway for you to escape.

She was a cheerleader after all and that she needs a good little pet to keep her motivate for all of her days work. Even if it was her own species like her, she'll like to have one as a pet too.

She can hear voices from outside of her clothing, it must be Casey's class though. Sam thought she could of hear one of her friends asked Casey about where Same was. Sam started to scream \"HELP! I'M HER-\" Her voice was silence when both of them massive boobs came together to pressed her silently. She can't believe Casey will do this to her and that she will never get out of this situation. Sam hope her cries for help will come, but to her despite, there was another purr coming from Casey's friend. It looks like Sam will be here for while as her day continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Casey was just sitting her seat when a female cheetah sits by her and ask \"Casey, where is Sam? I thought she would be here by now. It not like for her to be late though.\" \"Well Tiffany, she told me that she wasn't feeling good today and that she needs to go to the nurse office to be check up. I think she had a bad stomach ache or something. So she might gone home today to rest and-\" Casey voice was cut off when she heard a squeak from her chest. \"What was that\"? Tiffany glances her shirt, hearing a tiny voice coming within her. Casey then move her paws together between her boobs and then rub one of the paws in her stomach. \"It was my stomach growling and I am kind of hungry after doing some cheer-leading.\" Tiffany purrs and rubs her stomach. \"I know what you need my dear Casey and I got it right her for you waiting.\" Her paw rub down into her crotch rubbing in briefly, and stops when more furs gather into the class awaiting for class. \"We do this later Tiffany, but for now, let's listened what the teacher what he had to say in class today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam on the inside was already passed out during session of Casey's class as the feline musk was getting into her fur and overwhelm her.

How did you get so small though?\" Her voice was calm but still determined to get an answer from the little border collie. Sam knew if she would lie to her, she would be big in trouble and that she may never see another day in light. If she tells the truth about who shrunk her, Sam knew that Casey will hold the shrink ray and that she probably end  up making some furs small as she sees them as toys.

Rosa easily could have carried you in her paw without you being noticed, seems she was just making an excuse to stuff you into her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls move down the corridor to the science labs, standing around the doorway in a large group.

Her ambition is tempered by uncertainty and inexperience.<br>\r\n\tThere's a clattering sound from above and you see Rosa's put the lid on the fish tank, and a heavy book on top just in case. She sits down in a chair next to the desk you're on, looks at the device, then at you all, then she moans and buries her head in her hands.<br>\r\n\tJulia, Mel, and the others are making half-assed attempts at covering their bodies. Rosa doesn't seem to mind being naked, and Casey is too indignant to care. At this point, you've given up caring about your own nudity.<br>\r\n\tCasey puffs up her chest and walks over to the transparent glass wall. She bangs on it with her fist three times and shouts, \"Let us go, right now!\"<br>\r\n\tTracey lifted her head slightly and glared at Casey. \"You're not exactly in a position to be making demands, Case.\" Casey bristled at the nickname. \"And for the record, this isn't on me, okay?

It looked like a plastic raygun, and it was so light in her hand it was hard to believe it wasn't a toy.<br>\r\n\tDarlene took a small step forward, her usual confidence replaced with uncharacteristic temerity. \"Are we going to be like this forever?\"<br>\r\n\tTracey slumped. \"Probably not. All I did was re-write your volume data to a set value with a proportionate adjustment to your mass. I'd just have to do the same thing, just with a different set value.\"<br>\r\n\t\"So you'll turn us back?\" Rosa asked.<br>\r\n\t\"I'm not just going to change you back, just like that.\" Tracey said. \"If I do that, you'd all just gang up on me, break my stuff, and get your revenge. Best case scenario.\"<br>\r\n\t\"So then,\" you try, \"what are you going to do with us?\"<br>\r\n\tTracey's face contorted into an angry frown and she pushed herself out of the chair.<br>\r\n\t\"Well,\" She said, \"Let's start by looking at what you've all done to me, eh?\" She pointed a finger directly at you, and you took a step back without thinking. \"I've been your victim for every day that I've been here, Sam. Whether it's wet willies, or wedgies, or getting shoved into a locker and staying there for a whole afternoon.\"<br>\r\n\tShe moved her finger to point at Tabrynn. \"You stole my diary out of my locker and read it over the PA system during morning announcements. You outed me to the whole school, and then managed to convince the principal that I'd slipped those pages into your script so I got in trouble for it. Plus? You OUTED ME TO THE WHOLE SCHOOL!<br>\r\n\t\"Kesha started a rumor that I was a call-girl and payed Jerrid to write my number in all the boys' bathrooms! Imogen pantsed me at the Science Fair when I was doing my presentation for the judges, and she strung me up the flagpole by my underpants! Mel stole my clothes during gym, threw me out into the halls, and took a video of it that she posted online! Julia fucking sat on me until I passed out!\"<br>\r\n\tThere were tears streaming down her face now, and her voice was getting hoarse. \"And how about the time that Casey and Darlene tried to drown me in a toilet, huh? I got pneumonia and ended up in the hospital for three days! And Rosa...\" She stopped to wipe her face, but all it did was smear. \"All you ever did was stand by and let it all happen, so I guess I'm not as mad at you, but...\"<br>\r\n\tShe took a moment to compose herself, choking back sobs and letting her tears dry up. When she did speak again, her voice still wavered. \"You all have made my life a nightmare for my entire high school career. Some days... some days I've wondered if I should even keep going. If it wouldn't be better if I just...\"<br>\r\n\tShe shook her head and climbed back into the chair. \"I'll tell you what.

In her confusion, Tracey looks upwards for answers, and her jaw hangs open in shock. She is still on the desk after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time. I was getting bored,\" the tigress comments with a faux yawn as she stands up from her seat on a desk nearby. A grin soon spreads over Casey's feline muzzle, an expression shared by the wolf whom had previously been pinning the mouse down, though for the most part all others show amazement. Tracey begins to squeak up, stammering for words, \"How... How long have I--\" \"Did I <i>say</i> you could speak?!\" demands the tigress, slamming her powerful fist down on the desk--enough to startle the other cheerleaders, and enough to throw the mouse clear off her feet. Now laying prone, her dainty dress ruffled untidily, the mouse wraps her tiny arms around her head partially in fear, but also in despair, knowing now the power of her invention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasey nods, grinning again as she relaxes her paw and retrieves it, commenting, \"Better.\" Looking to her other paw, the tigress considers the size-changing device and lets out a hum of thought. \"You know, little mouse, you made quite the toy here,\" she offers, then leaning down, and just as Tracey looks up, the moist, hot air of her breath flows out of the feline muzzle inches away, \"And I'm going to have <i>such</i> fun with it.\" Glasses fogged, the mouse can at least be thankful she does not have to see what comes next.</span></div></div>",

I'll take GREAT care of her. Up you get, Sam.\" and you climbed onto her palm. Before anyone could make any sort of uproar or protest, you and Mel were out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sam. I ... I didn't think you really liked me that much.\" Mel admitted, and you smiled up at her, \"No problem. I think I trust you more then them right now. You're the only one I know that won't eat me.\" you say, but the look in her eyes starts to worry you... \"Who's to say I won't, Sam. You *do* know what they say about me, right?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, \"Ye....yeah, that you.... oh my god.\" and Mel nodded, bringing her hand with you in it up to her muzzle, \"Yes Sam, it's true. I *do* prefer girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look into the eyes of this goliath skunk, and can only stammer...</span></div></div>",

What could I do for you?\" you stammer out, though she only smiles, and ducks into one of the empty chemistry labs nearby, and locks the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bolt slides shut, you almost feel your heart skip a beat. You could do nothing but stare up from Mel's hand to her face as she leaned against a wall, and slowly lowered her hand with you in it, from muzzle level, to chest level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I want with you? What could you do for me? Sam, I joined the cheerleading squad to get closer to you. I took classes I have no interest in to get closer to you...\" her breath was warm, almost hot, as it washed over your nude form. Her breath came in slow motions, her heaving chest before you, each mountainous globe of flesh and fur bigger then your entire body in every dimension. Her free hand came up to cup one of those mounds, and she gasped slightly, \"I can get everything I ever wanted from you, Sam. I can hold you close to my heart, I can love you, I can be taken to new heights with you. I only wish you could love me the way I love you.\" Mel confessed, then brought the hand holding the two-inch tall canine closer to her heaving chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your hands out in front of you, as though that would stop the wall of flesh from approaching, shaking your head. This was wrong... on so many levels. Soon your hands made contact with Mel's immense breast, sinking in slightly through the fabric and the flesh... They were so soft, for being so big. You shook your head, \"Mel, stop this!\" and your only reply back was a soft gasp from your touch. \"See Sam?\" she called down from above, \"It's not so bad. You may even enjoy it.\" and with that, you were plunged into darkness as she fully cupped the breast you were touching, rubbing you against her mound of flesh, sighing softly as she slid your tiny body along the curve of her breast. You were pushed into the soft flesh, slid along it, and moved in all manner of directions until finally the hand returned to a floor, allowing you to more or less flop off of her massive chest back onto the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gone from an incredibly warm breast to her incredibly warm hand, you were aware of exactly how aroused the titanic skunkette had become. Her hot breath washed over you like a storm, and she was looking at you with a look of hunger, though oddly enough, not of a predatory nature. She shivered, closing her eyes slowly, and it was at that moment that you began to wonder just where her other hand had gone to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam.... I love you.\" Mel admitted between gasps, \"... and, at two inches... you'll either make the .... best girlfriend..... or a great plaything...\" she shivered again. You backed up a little, growing more concerned by the moment. \"And... you opted to become... my plaything. So... little toy, where do you want to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her in confusion, \"Where do I want to go? I want you to let me go!\" and Mel shook her head, \"Not happening, Sam. Not ever.\" she paused, another shudder and a sigh escaping. From the scent you were picking up with your canine nose, you were *pretty* sure where her other hand was. \"You have two choices, little toy. Go in my cleavage, until I get home...... or...\" she paused, and pulled her other hand up. It was slick with excitement and smelled heavily of her arousal... \"Or... I slide you inside me, and have the most beautiful girl I know bring me to heaven and back, while I welcome her to my most intimate spaces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Mel horrified, the sheer prospect of her sliding you between her breasts seemed unthinkable, but it was a welcome alternative to actually being put *INSIDE* of her body! You shook your head, walking away from her, as her slickened hand approached, fingers spread to pluck up your two inch tall body. \"Well, if you can't decide, then I'll make up your mind for you.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a squeak as the slick fingers grab you, her thumb and forefinger pinch around your waist, and the scent of her arousal soon almost overpowers you. You look up at the skunkette as she smiles drunkenly at your tiny form. You almost scream as she moves you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the hand holding you descended below the ridge of her chest, you screamed and started to squirm for all you were worth. From this height, if she dropped you, you'd probably die.... though dying from a fall would be a far more welcome prospect then being put inside this skunkette's body. You are taken below her waistline, and you look up at her, screaming.... \"Don't do this!! It's ... It's not right!!!\" though you are surprised to find yourself on a hard surface... It's a stool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand, and look around as she lets you go. You're on a stool in the chem lab. Mel pulls up another stool and puts it next to the one you're on, and sits on it in a fashion you find most discomforting. She sits on it spread legged, a massive black-and-white furred thigh on either side of you, giving you a splendid view of her blue panties... with a disturbing view of a damp spot that's probably longer then you are tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go find something to put you in, dear. If I put you in me right now... and believe me, I want you in me right now, but if I put you in me, the first time I cross my legs... or the first time your squirming body makes me climax... I may hurt you.\" she brings a finger over to caress your tiny cheek, \"And I really... really don't want to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then don't do it.\" You can only reply back, trying to look her in the eye, rather then at the swell of her chest, or her thighs, or even.... no, you keep your eyes on her's. She smiles, leaning back and reaching over for her bag as she stands up. \"I'll be right back, sweetheart. Don't go anywhere.\" she gives you a wink, and walks over to one of the cabinets, her thick tail bopping as she walks, and she returns with a big test tube, a bowl, and some rubber hose. From her back, she produces a glowstick, and cracks it before shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her, confused, \"Ummmm, Mel? What's going on?\" and she smiles, punching a hole in the glowstick with her keys, and pouring the glowing liquid into the bowl before setting the bowl down in front of you, \"Okay Sam, I want you to climb into the bowl, and get yourself good and glowy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" You ask up to the colossal cheerleader, and she smiled, \"Please? For me?\" and you give a half-smirk... she could just pick you up and drop you in the bowl, but she wasn't. You go along, since she hadn't made any moves to letting her panties swallow you up, let alone her.... you shudder at the thought, and climb up into the bowl, sloshing the glowing green fluid along your body. After a minute, you're completely glowing green. \"Okay, I'm all a-glow.\" and then Mel sighs, \"You're not the only one... stand on this...\" and she lowers the rubber stopper from the test tube down to your level, and you comply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you wish you hadn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tube itself soon slides over your form, and while there's a rubber hose attached for air, you're now trapped in a plastic test tube... Covered in some form of gel... You blink, then scream as you realize what she's done. \"Mel! NO! Wait, why did you have me cover myself in glow-stick?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel leans against a table, moving the test tube with you in it down between her thighs, \"So you wouldn't be in the dark, love. There's no light where you're going, but I want you to become acquainted with my body, since it's going to be so acquainted with your's, and this way, I won't crush you when I walk... you'll be safe and sound, tucked away within my love, until I get us home. Once there, we can play and explore each other, and I can be careful about not hurting you...\" and you scream as her panties are pulled aside, revealing the damp lips of her quivering, starving womanhood. As she brought the tube closer and closer, your tiny fists banged against the plastic tube, hoping... praying she'd change her mind. You almost scream yourself hoarse as those massive lips touch the tip of the test tube, and then slide along it's length... You close your eyes, not wanting to watch her body consume your prison, and you along with it, almost holding your ears shut as her moan of pleasure erupts from seemingly miles above. Soon it's all over... all you feel is massive heat and the pulse of a heart from the heavens. You open your eyes hesitantly, and are met with the sickening sight of the folds and slick of the interior of Mel's vaginal cavern, tinted green due to the glow about you, the glowstick chemicals illuminating the area. The air coming in from the tube smells heavily of her arousal, but at least you can breath... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunkette's moans turn almost into a growl as her sex consumes the tiny test tube, but moreso at the thought of the tiny passenger within it. Further and further in she pushes, until the test tube is no longer visible, and even then for an inch more, fully encapsulating it within her. She takes a breath, sliding her thighs closed to make sure it was comfortable for her to have the tube inside her, and she smiled, feeling the tiny pounding of Sam's fists against the plastic wall. \"God I hope she keeps that up.\" the titanic skunkette muses. She positions the rubber air-tube in a place where it won't get clogged or pinched, then slides her panties back into place. \"Oh god Sam, you feel wonderful in there... I can't wait until we get home.\" She gives her panties a slight pat, then she cleans up the glowstick and the bowl, before claiming her bag and getting on with her day, her hips swaying a little extra, as she silently prays for this day to end quickly, so she can get home and play with Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the end of the day rolls around... Sam's place within Mel has driven the skunkette crazy with excitement. She needs this day to end, and so she heads home as fast as she can, eager to play with her new plaything...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mel was all abuzz...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every step, with every swagger of her hips, with every sway of her tail, she felt the tiny test tube within her deep womanhood shift, she heard the tiny voice of the tiny canine within it, and she felt that tiny canine beat her tiny fists against the plastic tube. It sent shivers up her spine, it brought her to higher heights then she ever thought possible. She couldn't wait to get home, to properly introduce Sam to the finer, softer, curvier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reverie was shattered as she made a wrong turn, and literally bumped into another student, a short mouse, but very curvy. She dropped a pile of books, and fell to the floor, and everyone around her was laughing. \"Oh sorry, guess I .... guess I didn't see you.\" Mel offered, though the mousette was more hurt by the fact that people were laughing at her then the fall. The hallway cleared quickly as the final bell rang, though, leaving Mel alone with the nerdy mouse... just how the mouse wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all your fault I fell...\" she started, reaching into her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry about that.\" Mel started. Though, when the mouse pulled out what looked like a gun, she took a step back....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside Mel's womanhood, Sam started to hear what sounded like Mel panicing. She felt Mel moving away from something, and the entire area around her started to tighten and heat up. \"Mel!! What's going on out there?!?!\" then the tiny canine heard a scream, and then felt very funny.... though a very familiar type of funny feeling, and she blinked... then she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mel was taking a few steps back as the mousette stood up, brandishing a gun. \"Now wait, hold on a moment, let's not be crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crazy? Is that what you think this is? It's genius! You popular girls always going around, pushing little people around. How would *YOU* like to be the little person? Huh?\" she said, fixing her glasses and advancing. \"This isn't a gun, not in the normal sense. It won't kill you, but it will kill your social life. One squeeze of the trigger, and you'll be like a tiny plaything in my hand, or anywhere else I want you.\" the mousette said, with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Mel said, now not worried, at least not about being killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shrink ray, silly girl.\" The mousette said, taking aim. Mel blinked, \"Wait, don't shoot! Please wait....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mousette just smiled, and pulled the trigger. Soon Mel started to get smaller and smaller, dwindling down and down until the nerdy mouse took her finger off the trigger, looming over the now inch tall skunkette. \"Now, what was so important, tiny skunk, that you wanted to tell me before?\" she bent down to pluck the tiny skunkette off the floor, holding her by just her thumb and forefinger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel screamed, looking up and up at the titanic mousette, and in an instant she knew exactly what Sam.... holy shit, she still felt Sam inside her! She shrank along with her. As the mouse plucked her up and held her in front of her titanic face, it took a moment for Mel to come to her senses... \"I.... I found someone you must have shrunk before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" the mouse boomed, \"And where are they now?\" and Mel blushed, \"They're...... in a test tube.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they're in the chem lab? Wonderful.\" Though Mel spoke again, \"Well, no. We were in the Chem Lab.... then I put her in a test tube....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I ..... I ....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mousette gave a smirk, enjoying the embarassment. \"Then you what, little skunk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel blushed, hard... \"I..... I put the test tube inside me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nerdy mouse gave a smirk, then a giggle.... then a full laugh. \"You put her where?\" and Mel only repeated, \"In.... Inside me.\" and after a moment, the mouse's laughter came to an end, \"Is she still inside you now?\" and Mel could only nod. \"Well then... she's the smallest one out of us all, then. A tiny speck, a plaything for you, and since you are a plaything for me... that makes her my plaything too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel looked up into the giant blue eyes of the mouse, through her glasses, \"No please! You'd be too deep for her!\" and the mouse only giggled, \"You know, I never thought about putting your tiny toy inside me like that, but now that you bring it up, oh we're going to have to try that... Well, I better put you someplace safe for now...\" and the mouse lowers her hand to her shirt, pulls back the neck with her now free hand, and drops the tiny skunk into the vast expanse of her gray-furred cleavage. \"Name's Yvonne by the way. Learn it, since I'm your new owner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep within Mel, Sam sat, shivering... terrified.... The only safety line she had was Mel, who after the world stopped spinning and swirling, spoke to the tiny canine with a whisper. \"Sorry about that, Sam... looks like we're both in big trouble now. I promise I'll keep you safe, when I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the mousette gathered up her things, gave her chest a pat, and made her way home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon the gray furred world around Mel stopped bouncing. You know.... for a nerd, she had a great set of breasts. The skunkette could only sit, trapped between the two globes, as the mousette made her way home. She called hi to her mom and dad, then went up to her room. Once there, she opened the neckline of her shirt, and pulled the tiny skunkette out from her cleavage. Mel noted that aside from her shirt, she was only in her panties, and her socks. Probably just pulled her shorts off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, tiny little toy. What to do first?\" Yvonne asked, her finger trailing along Mel's form. Mel couldn't help but lean against her finger, \"Hold on... ca... can I say something first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYvonne blinked, then smirked, \"I suppose so, but don't ask me to change you back, or let you go free, or anything like that.\" and Mel shook her head, \"Actually I .... I wanted to say that you're... you're very pretty.\" and Yvonne smiled, \"Awww, why thanks. Just for that, I'll be extra gentle with you and your teenie tiny little friend too.\" She leaned in close, and whispered, \"Take off your clothes.\" her breath washing over the tiny skunk in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel wasted no time in removing her clothing, though hesitated when it came to her panties. \"What if Sam slips out?\" and Yvonne smiled, \"Well, I was looking forward to meeting the girl that got shrunk twice, and your little suggestion before? About me being too deep? Yeah, I've been thinking about that the whole walk home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunkette almost fell to her knees, \"No, no you can't be serious...\" though Yvonne gave a nod, \"I'm very serious. I was at a loss as to what to do with her till you made that suggestion. She must hardly be as big as a speck to me... and I want to feel what it feels like to have that much power over someone. Those cheerleader bitches ruined me, they laughed at me, and made others laugh at me. It's time she felt how small it made me feel.\" and Mel just blinked, and before she had time to say anything, Yvonne calmed down and said, \"Now, if you would....\" and she put her index finger by Mel... \"... would you, put her on my finger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE MEL, NO!!!\" Sam screamed, beating her tiny fists against the plastic test tube, though she felt it move, and she saw Mel's fingers around the base of it, followed by the feeling of her sinking down, being removed from Mel's vaginal depths. Though, from what she heard, she'd have welcomed the depths to what Yvonne had in store for her. Soon she was out, looking up at Mel, who was standing in the palm of Yvonne, who was too titanic for words. The stopper was removed, and Mel grabbed Sam by her tiny waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't do this, please don't do this...\" Sam called out, almost delirious, though Mel had a broken look on her face. \"I'm sorry Sam... I.... there's nothing I could do.\" and she put the tiny canine on the fingerpad of Yvonne's outstretched finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYvonne blushed, slowly bringing her finger up to her bright blue eyes... \"Holy shit... I can barely see you. Hello down there, tiny. Tiny isn't even the word, you're hardly visible. It's a good think no one slipped the shrunken skunk babe up their cooch before I shrank them, or you'd be practically microscopic.\" She wiggled on the bed, \"Though, point to be taken, you can always get smaller, so don't piss me off.\" She said to the speck on her fingertip. Mel watched helplessly from Yvonne's other hand as the titanic mouse berated the tiny tiny cheerleader on her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, on the other hand, was beyond tears. She looked up at the mammoth mouse, then realized that she was standing just on the mouse's fingerpad, and then the shock of how small she really was sank in. She collapsed to her knees, in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYvonne, however, didn't notice the motion, though, she did move on the bed, spreading her thighs and setting Mel down on her thigh. \"Well, you're giant friend Mel here gave me a great idea as to what to do with you, so I hope you had a lot of fun in Mel, cause now, it's my turn.\" and the finger holding Sam slowly descended. Sam looked up at Yvonne, eyes full of tears, and screamed as she descended. Yvonne's free hand held open her panties, and as her other hand came down, Yvonne gave a smirk to Mel, then laid back a little, and with a soft sigh, slid her finger deep within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam screamed and screamed, though as she passed the mouse's navel, she looked for Mel. She found her titanic skunkette on Yvonne's thigh. \"HELP ME MEL!! PLEASE!! W...WHY ARE YOU JUST STANDING THERE? PLEASE, HELP ME!!\" though soon the vision of Mel was blocked by Yvonne's panties, and though the canine didn't want to, she turned around, just in time to see the lips of Yvonne's indescribably immense womanhood. The canine's scream was consumed by the slurp of the finger entering the cavern of Yvonne's womanhood, just as the tiny canine was consumed. The speck of a woman was plunged unimaginably deep within the mouse, to the point where she wasn't sure if measuring it in foot ball fields would be sufficient. Though soon the ride in was over, and the finger came to an abrupt stop, which threw the tiny tiny canine off of her finger, to land in a puddle of sticky goop. That wouldn't be the worst part, though, except the finger that brought her in this deep, was pulling back out. \"NOOOOOOOOOOO!!\" she screamed as the finger left her, and soon the walls closed back in, without the finger to hold them open... soon she was alone, hardly a speck, deep within this mouse, who cared little for her survival. With a sob, and a shattered heart, the tiny canine started the long walk out of the cavern of flesh she found herself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel watched from Yvonne's thigh as her hand came down. If she tried hard enough, she could hear Sam's screaming, though no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't force it out of her head. The mouse did that well enough, though, as her finger slid within, replacing Sam's scream with dead silence, save for a sign from the mouse. Though, Yvonne brought her finger back out, and Mel's spirits rose that Sam would still be there. Though, coated in a thin glaze of her arousal, Mel inspected the fingerpad as the mouse brought it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Yvonne asked, and Mel just looked up, \"She...... she's not here!!\" which made Yvonne giggle, \"Well then, in a minute, you're going in there to find her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I say no?\" and Yvonne shook her head, \"Doesn't matter to me either way, just the thought of that stuck up bitch being that tiny and slipped up inside me is enough to make me happy. Though, I may forget she's up there, and while she may have loved the concept of being trapped up your snatch, I doubt she wants to stay in mine forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel thought about it, then looked up at the titanic mouse....</span></div></div>",

Her toes twitched, her tail twitched, hell she was pretty sure her fur twitched... Every move that Sam made against that test tube within her shot up her spine. She took a breath with each impact her tiny little fists made against the plastic. Her walls tightened against the tube, and she was thankful she put her in there. Otherwise, well.... Mel didn't want to think of the consequences had she not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in love, and she didn't want to hurt Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell rang, she rose up and made her way to the bus, a hop in her step as she swayed her tail, enjoying every step as she felt the tiny form within her pound and heard her tiny, high pitched voice echo within her. God she felt powerful... it was such a turn on... she just had to be careful not to show it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus ride felt like it took forever, and soon she was home. She hopped off the bus and all but bunny-hopped home. She opened the door, and called out to her folks. No answer.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" the skunkette looked around, then found a note on the fridge. \"Sweetie, be gone for the night. You behave. Love, Mom and Dad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoooo! The place is our's for the night! Hear that Sam?\" the Skunkette said, looking down. It was faint, but she thought she heard an answer. Seeing as how there was no one here, she reached down under her waistband, and very carefully went about removing the test tube, and it's shapely inhabitant. With a sigh, and a smile, she removed the test tube, and after opening it up, removed the tiny canine inhabitant. \"There you go. Fresh air, sweetheart.\" said Mel as she softly caressed the tiny cheerleader in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, please.... let me go?\" Sam pleaded, but Mel shook her head, \"Sorry doll, not happening. Especially now that you and I have the place to ourselves. Though... I want to make this a special night for us, so I'm going to invite one of my friends over. Don't worry, one of my girlfriends.\" She winked, \"And yes, I mean like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no... you .... you can't! Not with me like this!\" Sam stammered, still in Mel's grip. Mel just smiled, \"Relax, you'll love her.\" as she reached for the phone and dialed up...</span></div></div>",

She's done so well for my own.\" Mel said, running her tongue over her lips as she looked at Sam. \"I can't wait. See you soon.\" and she quickly hung up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?? Mel, what's going on?!\" Sam yelled up. Mel smiled, \"Well, Mistress Julie's coming over. You're going to be *our* little playmate for a while. Just do what she says and you'll be fine. Otherwise, well, I don't want to know what kind of punishments she thinks up for a tiny little cutie like you.\" She said, bringing Sam up to her cheek to nuzzle her. \"Mel, what have you gotten me into??\" Sam asked, almost pushing Mel's cheek away, and Mel giggled, \"Gotten you into? Well, if you play your cards right, lots of cleavage and maybe some more girl *in* girl action.\" She giggles, \"But, if you misbehave... who knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon there was a knock at the door, and Mel went to go answer it. There in the doorway was a lovely red hedgehogette dressed in tight black, with a smirk on her face. \"Come in, Mistress...\" Mel gestured in, and Julie smiled, sauntering in, caressing Mel's cheek, \"Thanks, doll. So, where's this surprise?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel smiled at the touch, and then after the door was closed, produced the tiny Sam from behind her back. Sam recoiled from the smirk of the colossal hedgehog, while Julie took a step forward, to re-assure her height advantage over the two inch tall girl. \"Oooooo, a little little teeny tiny girl?\" she smiled at Mel. \"She could fit in *all* the right places, you know...\" and Mel just smiled, and nodded. \"Oh, so you already broke her in, did you?\" Julie smiled, then gave Mel's head a pat, \"Good girl. Now, as for you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam tried to resist as Julie plucked her up off Mel's palm, holding her with just a thumb and her forefinger, and bringing her up to her expansive chest, forcing her to look up into the hedgehogette's green eyes. \"Rule one, you will address me as Mistress. Break this rule at your own peril. Rule two, when I command, you obey. Rule three, if ever there is a dispute of how something is to be done, my way is the proper way. Rule four, only good girls get pleasured. Understand?\" and Sam blinked... almost starting to cry... until Julie leaned in a little closer, looming all the more over the tiny girl, \"I said, Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.....\" Sam worked the courage to say. Julie narrowed her eyes, \"Yes... What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes..... mistress.\" Sam corrected. Julie then smiled, \"Good. You're learning, but you've already got two strikes. Three strikes and, well..... Hmmmmm....\" she thought. Then smiled a wicked smile. \"Two strikes means tonight, when Mel and I are asleep.... you are to be tied to my tail. Mel will pluck a strand of her hair out and tie you to my tail with it.\" She smirked down at the tiny girl... \"Preferably near the base...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel almost smiled at the prospect. Julie had a great ass... though Sam just shook her head. Julie brought the tiny girl up to eye level, \"Disagreeing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam kept shaking her head, \"No, mistress.... please, don't.\" then Julie smirked, \"Three strikes, and you won't be tied to my tail, I'll have Mel put you in under it. If I'm feeling nice, I'll let her keep your head out. Otherwise, you'll spend the whole night under my tail, trapped within me. Care to go for that third strike, tiny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam blinked, horrified..... \"No!! ..... No mistress.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie smiled, \"Good. You may be able to work those two strikes off, though I think Mel is honestly looking forward to tying you to my tail. I have a nice tail, don't I tiny?\" and she brought her hand down to press Sam into the yielding flesh of her rump, near her hedgehog tail. \"Yes, you do, Mistress!!\" the tiny canine yelled, hoping to be heard. Julie smiled, and pulled Sam back to eye level, then leaned in slightly to run her thin tongue along the length of Sam's body, from toes to ears. \"You're learning so fast, tiny. Good tiny girls get to sleep in my cleavage. Exceptionally good tiny girls get to sleep between my soft thighs. Let's see where you end up, tiny...\"</span></div></div>",

You didn't trust her, she just never seemed to fit in with the rest of the girls, often kept at a bit of a distance because of her natural scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the girls, looking for someone you think would be friendly to you, a predator but someone below you in the natural order.  You just knew if Casey or any of the wolves got you, you might end up as part of their food chain.  Your eyes finally fell upon Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young gecko was quite small, only 5 feet tall but she was counted as a a predator, but barely, but apart from that she was actually a friend of yours.  She was thin but what muscle she had was well toned.  Her hair was messy and a dyed purple in colour, well showing off her slightly wild personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... think I'll go home with Alex...\" When a few of the girls look annoyed you quickly make up an excuse, \"'Cause she lives nearest to school.... so it will be less likely anyone will see me on the way home..\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young gecko blinks down towards you, before shrugging and reaching out to take you.  She doesn't scoop you out of the Rabbit's paw, or pluck you out, instead she just taps you with a finger and you stick to it.  She lifts you up to her face and stares down at you with her large eyes. \"Don't worry Sam, you'll be fine with me.\"</span></div></div>",

The huge, soft piece of tissue paper easily absorbed the blows of anything larger tumbling around in the darkness of the bag, with gigantic lipsticks three times larger than Vicky rolling around, threatening to hurt her each time they fell nearby.  The worst was Alex's purse, stuffed with loose change, the heavy weight would likely flatten her if it landed on her, a scary reminder for the dog of her new size, but she was able to ignore it for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly light split into the handbag as Alex unfastened the buckle and pulled it open, revealing her large, beautiful face as she smiled down towards you. \"Hey Sammy.\" She whispered down towards you, trying to hold back a giggle.  She suddenly reached a massive hand in and unceremoniously scooped you up, before closing her fist lightly around you and pulling you from the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smooth, yellow scales were cold against your little body, tough and giving very little yield against your little wiggling body.  It was a stark contrast to the warmth and relative comfort of the handbag, but you kept your mouth closed, just keeping quiet in your friends grip.  The gecko moved you across slowly before suddenly her paw opened and you dropped down, only a few inches to her but to you it was nearly 20 feet.  The landing was relatively cushioned though, as your light body landed ontop of a large, cold and tough green 'mattress' and a quick sniff suddenly revealed what it was.  It was a lettuce leaf on the gecko's plate, the dog left lying ontop of a pile of the green leaves which sat neatly beside a large, bloody steak on the gecko's plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, eyes widened in fear before she looks up towards the gigantic Alex, ears flattening down ontop of her head. \"A-Alex....?

Her large, hazelnut doe eyes looked right back at you, but while your face was that of shock and awe, her's held a smug little smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leant there on the table, her head propped up with an arm, elbow resting on the table mere inches from the plate you were currently kneeling on.  \"Mymy...think there's a dog in my salad.\" She said with a quiet little giggle across towards Alex, keeping her voice low though, trying not to draw attention to herself it seems.  She held a fork in her free paw, twirling it slowly in the air infront of the plate before finally she moved forwards with that fork.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were frozen in fear as you just sit there on your ass on that large piece of lettuce, just watching those steel prongs moving closer to you. You knew it was coming, you had been betrayed by Alex and now you were going to just be a piece of extra protein in the doe's salad.  The fork suddenly stabbed down right by your feet, stabbing the lettuce leaf before she lifted it up, the sudden slope caused by the lift sending you rolling down onto the leaf below.  The doe lifted that leaf up to her face before she simply slipped the whole thing into her mouth in a single action, before chewing on it, the thick leaf crunching loudly between her flat teeth.  The huge doe just seemed to take her time as she chewed at it, her eyes never leaving you the whole time, as if she was warning you, showing you what she could do to you any moment of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe swallows it down before flashing a large, toothy smile towards you. \"Don't worry, cutie.  I don't eat meat.\" She said with a giggle to herself, glancing across to Alex, before poking her tongue out at you. \"Was fun to scare you though, glad Alex told me about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm....anytime Kiera.\" The huge gecko nearly purred behind you as she looked across the table to the gorgeous doe, her tail swishing around a little behind her wide rear end. \"Heh, sorry to scare you Sammy.  But wanted you to meet Kiera....my girlfriend.\" She smirked down at you, flashing those sharp little fangs, \"I'm crashing at her house since my parents moved.  Didn't think it'd be right too keep you from her.  But she's great....and who knows.  She might let you sleep in the bed with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare up in shock between the two, ears flat on your head, you weren't sure if they were being serious or not, maybe they were just fucking with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....lunch is nearly over Sammy-pup.

You hadn't even tried when you were normal sized, but here things were, when you had been shrunken  and left only at an inch tall, basically a bug to this goddess, you finally had her attention, and it was intimidating to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember you, lil cutie.\" She suddenly says, a deep smirk on her face, the doe reaching forwards to stab the fork infront of you again, picking up the leaf you were sitting on, sending you tumbling down to land ontop of the remains of Alex's steak. \"Not hard to notice you, you aren't too subtle when you were staring at my ass or my tits...hell, you'll take anything won't you, even saw you staring at my groin.\" She giggles out as she chews on the lettuce leaf, \"Mmmm....part of me was thinking of just flashing you finally but Alex wouldn't tbe happy.  But now, you're a bug, so I get to have BOTH the girls I wanted.  Lucky me, hmm?\" She smirks again, showing off those large, flat herbivore teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was basically flirting with you now, but this was a very risky situation right now because of your size.</span></div></div>",

She holds her paw over the open top for a few long seconds, as if she is letting you have a really good look at those tits, which would look small compared to yours normally but now they were like hills; and the gecko knew this.  One little glance up to her face by you revealed her large, smirking face before she released the suction on your back, letting you drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shrill, scared little scream is all that manages to escape your lips before you disappear down into the depths of that cleavage.  She sways her chest from side to side a few times, those titanic tits bouncing and wiggling around for a few seconds, allowing you to slip down right to the centre of that cleavage where the pressure from the tits on either side was enough to hold you in place.  The pressure was intense, squeezing her powerfully but not painfully, making it hard to suck in a breathful of air, but you were at least alive, even if you were horribly humiliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex releases the neck of her shirt, letting it seal up around her neck before she turned to grin at the other girls, \"There we go!

Alex knew those girls were jealous and she liked it, anything to piss off the other girls.  She folds her arms over her large chest, giving an extra tight squeeze to you, forcing the wind from your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well girls....off to class!\" She teases, winking at the girls before scooping up her bag and heading off to class, the other girls mumbling ou in annoyance that they hadn't thought of doing that.</span></div></div>",

And scary too, as the bunny lifts you to her face, holding you frighteningly close to her enormous visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really is you, huh, Sam?\" she whispers. You nod, squirming slightly in her tight grasp. Rosa is silent for a second before speaking up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, listen,\" she begins. \"I don't know how you shrunk, but I don't care right now. I'm gonna get you out of here, okay? Just don't struggle and stay quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod quickly. You're glad that the bunny girl is willing to help you, but you wonder why she's helping you at all, considering you barely know each other. She looks at you for another moment before...</span></div></div>",

Just because everybody knew you and people said they wanted to be your friend did not necessarily mean you were popular.  In reality people would probably consider you the school bully.  It was fun being abnormally large for your age.  There weren\u2019t many other people that would agree with you though.  Especially not the skinny specimen of a horse you found yourself \u201crequesting\u201d some lunch money from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis horse was named Benny and he was every bit as short as you were tall.  He was a genius though.  A few years down the road that might actually mean something.  For now, all his intelligence got him was ridicule from his fellow classmates.  You didn\u2019t really have anything against him, but you really had forgotten your wallet back at home and he was a convenient target.  What you were doing was natural anyways.  He is prey and you are a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day continued on as normal until about noon.  It was lunch time and you were enjoying the fruits of your earlier hunt.  As was normal, you were eating alone since most other students tended to avoid you.  That was fine since you enjoyed your privacy.  It was easy enough to get your privacy since you were eating in one of the classrooms, which you were not supposed to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething different did happen today.  Benny actually intruded on your solitude.  You were about to confront him when you saw some weird gun in his hands.  \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of you Mark. You\u2019ve spent the last three years tormenting me whenever you felt like it and this is the last day you\u2019re getting away with it,\u201d Benny said as he raised the gun in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold on Benny\u2026\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up Mark.  I don\u2019t know if this will work, but you are the ideal test subject.  It\u2019s not like anyone will care if you disappear,\u201d Benny said with venom in his voice.  Then he pulled the trigger.  You tried to dodge but were hit with a ray of light from the gun.  Then everything went white and you passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up you could not hear anything and you were covered with something extremely heavy.  It took a while to pull yourself from underneath whatever you were trapped under.  After you had managed to free yourself you checked to see if you were alright.  Despite getting shot nothing seemed to be wrong with you until you looked around the room you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was huge.  It looked like you were only around an inch tall.  As impossible as it seems Benny must have shot you with a shrink ray.  Then you heard to door to the room begin to open.  You dived for cover to see who it was.</span></div></div>",

The lavel read: CAUTION!  GROWTH HORMONES INSIDE.  UNSAFE FOR GENERAL CONSUMPTION.  ONLY TO BE USED UNDER CAREFUL PRESCRIPTION IN SMALL DOSES.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If the doses were supposed to be small, why are the pills so damn big?</i> Shiera smirked. <i> It's an honest mistake if I pop one... or three.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the bottle into her backpack, Shiera got in the car and drove to school, plotting all the way.  The tigress was always game for some fun, even if it came at the expense of others.  She figured it was her solemn duty to shake the school up occasionally, keep things interesting for everyone.  Especially herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school, Shiera strode cockily through the commons area and out into the open courtyard at the center of the facility.  Sitting down at a bench behind a statue of a mouse wielding a pen like a sword (<i>Way to go, Mr. Bulwer-Lytton,</i> Shiera snorted), she pulled out the bottle of pills and some water.  Dumping a few pills into her hand haphazardly, she swallowed them all down with some water.  Standing up, the tigress waited impatiently for the drugs to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when the drugs kicked in, they kicked IN!  Shiera's vision and senses blurred as she felt bones, tissue and fur expanding at an ever-increasing rate.  The world around her shrunk down.  Shiera shrieked with laughter as she felt her clothes tearing and shredding like tissue paper against her body, an unexpected but not entirely unwanted side-effect of the growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiera's senses returned completely as her rate of growth eventually slowed to a halt.  The hundred-foot tigress now towered over the school-building.  Shiera felt powerful.  She was pretty much unstoppable.  She could do whatever she pleased.

It was 8:50; her friends would be gathering outside the cafeteria. She lifted her long, slender leg over the building and stepped out of the courtyard, walking around to the backside of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree students were hanging out, leaning against the wall next to the cafeteria. When they saw the mammoth tigress approaching, their mouths fell open in amazement. Vikki, a voluptuous filly, was the first to speak. \"Damn, Shiera, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tigress simply smiled. \"Who else?\" she asked. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F'n A,\" Diego said as he stepped closer to Shiera's footpaw. \"I don't know how you did it, but I think it's great. I'd never thought I'd see you naked before,\" he added, as Shiera noticed the jackal adjusting his pants slightly. She started wiggling her toes, causing Diego to fall back, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you going to fit into the school building now?\" Mia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnorting, Shiera shook her head at the worried fruit bat. \"Who needs school now when you're this big? C'mon, guys, let's ditch this place and go have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three nodded, agreeing to the plan. Shiera picked them up in one quick scoop and placed her tiny friends on her shoulder, Diego and Mia on the left, and Vikki on the right. Stepping away from the school, she headed out into the city, ready to have some fun.</span></div></div>",

Grabbing the top of the wheel, she began to spin it with ever-increasing speed.  The Ferris wheel's axle snapped free of the constraint and it began to roll free of the stand.

It was a big deal in the city, and those selling had come from all around for people to try out what they had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jackal stepped over a row of buildings, striding up to the market. \"Well, how do you do!\" he said to himself, licking his lips. He reached down and grabbed a fruit stand. The owner of the stand just stared at him blankly as his entire season's worth of produce disappeared as Diego poured it all into his open muzzle.

The pharmacy was only a few miles away, and it took the tigress about five minutes to get there. As she hurried down the streets, people dove out of the way and cars crashed in to each other trying to avoid her running feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to the pharmacy, she wasted no time, ripping the roof off of the one-story factory building.

She had returned to near her normal height (give or take a few inches) and now no longer was an intimidating presence to the cat, Mia, the factory workers, or anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad you're back to normal,\" Mia said, wiping sweat from her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that lunatic jackal isn't,\" Shiera said. \"And if I can't be big, then neither can he!\" She turned to the cat, her face still furious. \"Gimme another bottle of those shrinking pills you just gave me! Don't make me deck you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-here!\" the cat said, trembling, throwing the bottle at her. \"But how do you plan on getting him to eat them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiera turned around and headed down the street, down to where Diego was still eating at the market, Mia following timidly after her. \"I'll figure that out when I get there!\" she growled.</span></div></div>",

A truly enormous Diego was sprawled across the market.  His legs were draped across the buildings at the end of the square and several dozen stalls were crushed under the jackal's back.  Another cart was currently having its contents emptied into Diego's open mouth.  He belched happily and tossed the cart aside, nearly taking out Mia and Shiera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm.  That hits the spot,\" Diego chuckled, patting his stomach.  \"You have pleased your god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh.  That's it.

You and I attract Mr. Too-Big-For-His-Britches' attention. Then I put the moves on him and try to get some mouth contact.  That's when I feed him these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia shuddered, but nodded her agreement as the pair continued to make their way up the stairs.  Bursting out onto the rooftop, they were greeted by a spectacular view of their enormous \"friend.\"  Diego was standing up now, looking around and idly scratching his balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what do do,\" Shiera instructed Mia.

Shiera threw the whole entire bottle with the pills inside it as hard as she could, and it landed on the back of Diego's tongue, where instinct kicked in and he swallowed them.

In case you haven't noticed, Diego is literally the biggest thing in this city!  He could use some buildings as chairs.  Hell, he's fixing to use a jet as a sex toy!

It won't do anything,\" Mia worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That kind of thing would happen when a skyscraper-sized jackal drops it,\" Shiera rolled her eyes. \"We'll just have to strike out on foot,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget the pills!\" Mia called, running to keep up with the furious tigress. \"Even if we ran the whole way (which I doubt we could do), it would take us to get all the way across town.  Diego's huge.  It'll take him a couple minutes.  It could take us hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why we drive,\" Shiera replied.  She jumped in front of a car, slamming a fist on the hood. \"Hey, you!  We're chasing down that gargantuan jackal.  Either drive us to the airport or get the hell out and let me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what else to do, the bewildered beagle surrendered the wheel to the tigress, who hopped in and motioned furiously at the fruit bat.  They took off, weaving through the streets and dodging all the craters left behind by Diego.  It took Shiera awhile to find the airport, but when she arrived, it became perfectly clear that the giant jackal had already made his grand entrance.  Several runways had already been obliterated and it was clear that the rest would follow soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" Mia pointed ahead of them. </span></div></div>",

He flew high in the sky, over a hundred feet straight up, and reached out his arm as high as it would go, opening up his paw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had timed his leap just right so that a huge jumbo jet that was circling the airport for landing smacked right into it. He grasped the plane tightly as he came crashing back down to the ground. The force of his paws hitting the tarmac sent shockwaves throughout the county, and nearly caused Shiera to veer off the road leading up to the airport while she was driving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! The?! FUCK?!\" She couldn't believe what she had just seen. \"What on earth is that jackal DOING?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego brought the jet up to his face, peering into the cockpit with his huge, looming eyes. \"Well, hello there,\" he said to the pilots and passengers inside. \"So nice of you all to drop in. But I'm afraid your plane has to make an unscheduled stop -- my cock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he really just say that?\" Mia groaned, as the car blew through the (now-unmanned) security gates and headed down to the service road leading to the tarmac. The fruit bat shielded her eyes as Diego brought the jet down to his waist, while at the same time he worked his cock with his empty paw. It only took a few seconds for him to become fully erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" Diego grinned, his tongue hanging out of the side of his mouth as he began to pant slightly, \"please make sure your trays and seat-backs are in the full, upright, and locked positions. And don't mind the giant jackal shaft that's about to come down the center aisle!\" He forced the tip of his cock to the plane's nose, pushing against it with all his might until the glass shattered and the metal bent open. As he got more and more of it into the plane's fuselage, he worked up and down, faster and faster. He could barely hear the screams of the passengers inside, but the thought of them in terror caused entirely by his member only helped him along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a complete and utter jackass,\" Shiera muttered to herself. She was now driving on the tarmac, the jackal's giant footpaw directly in front of her. Determined, she pressed the accelerator down flat, and the car quickly sped up. \"Let's see how he likes this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shiera?\" Mia asked in growing fright. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bail out on three, okay?\" The tigress didn't wait for a response. \"One!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, don't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia took a deep breath and said a silent prayer. Overhead, Diego's moans were getting louder, his breathing more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THREE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls both threw open the car doors and jumped out of the car, hitting the asphalt hard and rolling several times. Bruised and battered, Shiera nevertheless quickly jumped to her feet and turned her attention to the car, which sped along, just about to barrel into Diego. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" she growled, \"for the love of GODS, work!\" </span></div></div>",

Maybe all of those stupid driving classes her parents had forced her to take had paid off in their own weird way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on!\" Shiera snapped as the inevitable happened. \"Of course something went wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the car had neared its mark, Diego's foot lifted up and landed heavily on top of the car, smashing it flat like a soda can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have GOT to be kidding me!\" Shiera howled, stomping her foot. \"Can everything go wrong today?  Apparently so!  I just want one little thing to go my way for once.

Nearly falling over in shock, Shiera backed off as the giant sprawled on his back, panting heavily.  The tigress approached the enormous jackal with murder in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna slit that dog's throat if it takes me hours and I have to do it with my bare hands,\" she fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shiera clambered across the giant's chest, Mia called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Shiera snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Vikki!

Just whatever I want at the moment,\" Diego replied casually, pulling himself into a sitting position and tossing the plane aside. \"And right now, all I want is you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  You sick fuck!\" Shiera gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in <i>that</i> way, silly,\" Diego chuckled. \"You're much too small to satisfy me.  Nope, I'm just gonna take you with me.  So don't think about complaining,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiera rolled her eyes and pursed her lips, but did little to resist as Diego stood up and set her on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego looked around. \"Hmm... and right now, I feel like...</span></div></div>",

And I've had enough fun with toy airplanes for now; I think I'll try playing with some toy boats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off at a brisk pace, stepping over hangers and warehouses, making his way along the interstate. The distance to the bay was about 4 or five miles, and Diego covered that in the span of a minute or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was walking, Shierra schemed and plotted, trying to think of what she could do to stop this mega-canine. After thinking for a while, an idea suddenly popped in her mind. She pulled out her cell phone and dialed Mia's number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fruit bat answered on the second ring. \"H-hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Mia, I need you to do something for me. You need to find someone there at the airport who can pilot a helicopter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief pause, Mia answered, \"I-I don't see anyone else around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The terminal building is still standing, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShierra turned to face away from Diego's ears and lowered her voice. \"Head there; there has to be someone who knows how to fly a chopper. I don't care if it's the weatherman from the Channel 5 news who only thinks he knows how to fly because he's been in the passenger seat a few times, just get them - and you - in one and come out to the bay. Call me when you're in the air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, I'll try.\" Shierra flipped the phone shut and spun back around to look at Diego. Luckily, the jackal hadn't heard any part of her conversation. His attention was on the bay, which was now sitting right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on tight, Shierra!\" he called out, then started running. The tigress gripped his shoulder fur for dear life. A half-crazed look in his eye, Diego started yelling, \"CANNONBALL!\" He then jumped up into the air, curled his body up, and landed down into the bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OWWW! SON OF A--\" He had greatly misjudged the depth of the waters, and his ass quickly hit the bay floor, the water not even covering his junk. Large waves headed out in each direction due to his impact, capsizing several ships in the area. \"I guess this is the shallow end,\" he said, chuckling a little. \"That's okay! I'm okay playing in a kiddie pool for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out and grabbed a tanker that was down by his feet, running it through the water and making VROOOM sounds with his mouth. Shierra gritted her teeth; she could barely stand being this close to such an enormous jackass. She hoped Mia would arrive soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, she thought she heard her wish being answered with the sounds of engines getting closer and blades flying through the air.

All she could do was hope that Diego would remain oblivious to the presence of the helicopters long enough for Mia to get to the bay as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone such luck.  As the sound of the rotors became louder, Diego's ear's twitched and he turned his head to look at the craft.  A grin split his face and he stood up to greet them, tail wagging wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Over here!\" Diego called, waving his arms wildly. \"I'm ready for my close-up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!  Turn away!  Turn AWAY!  Leave him alone!  Just buzz off!\" Shiera called, jumping up and down on the giant's shoulder and flailing her arms about.  It was to no avail, as her cries were drowned out by the general cacophony around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego looked like a pup in a candy shop.  News helicopters whizzed around his face like so many flies and the jackal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tongue was lolling out happily.  Reaching up, he caught half a dozen or so of the craft, squinting closely at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGods.  When will Mia get here?  Does she want a golden engraved invitation or something?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shiera snapped to herself.

But we stopped by that chemical factory and got some stuff to make Diego normal-sized again.  Actually, we got a whole bunch of stuff,\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fucking genius, Mia!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shiera beamed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut wait.  How are you certain you got the right pills?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe place was mostly deserted, but I ran into a guy who works there, Norm.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only an intern but he says he knows the stuff,\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood.  But hurry up.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took a few seconds for Kieran's head to stop throbbing and for his eyes to focus again, but when they did, he was stunned to see his formerly diminutive body fill what had until then been a pretty ample-sized pool. His back was leaning against the shallow end, and his legs and paws were hanging out of the water near the deep end. he looked down at his crotch and noticed that his swimsuit had ripped to shreds, seemingly disintegrating under the sudden increase in tiger that they had failed to contain. He was completely naked, open for anybody to see. Luckily, he was the only one in the pool hall just then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, Kieran racked his brain for what to do. \"I cant stay here,\" he said to himself. \"But where can I go?\" Jumping out of the water, he crouched to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling that had seemed so high just a moment ago and quickly made a dash for the emergency exit. He was way too large to fit through even the wide double doors, but he squeezed as tight as he could, though he knocked out most of the wall surrounding the door in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Kieran looked around, hoping no one was there to see him. The school grounds were deserted for the most part, and he hid behind the three-story athletics building fairly well, though it wasn't the hardest thing in the world to make out the towering teen tiger from a distance. As he hurried to a more secluded spot, he thought to himself, \"How did this happen to--\" He stopped in mid-thought, realizing exactly what had caused this. \"Beatrice!\" Of course! She had given him that vial of nasty-tasting whatever-it-was to drink, and said it was a bit of 'liquid courage'... It had to be her doing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around in frustration, Kieran let out a loud growl. \"Beatrice!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom around the corner, he heard the mink's distinctive chuckle. \"What is it, ti-- Whoa!!!\" she gasped in surprise as she rounded the corner and saw all thirty feet of Kieran in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, Beatrice?\" Kieran cried out, pointing a finger at her. \"I can't believe you did this to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, kid,\" she said, as she walked up to him, coming up only to his shins. \"I didn't know it would work that well. Guess I may have made the serum a little too potent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you did do this!\" Kieran said. \"Change me back, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't,\" the mink replied. Kieran started freaking out, so she continued. \"Don't worry, it'll wear off eventually. But why don't you take advantage of this now, while you have the chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you psycho?\" Kieran exclaimed. \"I can't have anyone see me like this!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice grinned, and pointed a finger behind Kieran. \"I think it may be too late for that. Look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran turned around and saw that the entire swim team, plus the coach, were al standing outside the pool hall doors, staring up at their massive teammate. Devon was standing in the front and center of the group, mouth open in shock. As Kieran cringed, he prayed that this was all a dream, and that he'd wake up any minute now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kieran covered his face with his paw, shaking his head. How could something like this happen, he thought to himself. He prayed that the day would be over quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his eyes, he saw that Devon had stepped out in front of the group, coming up closer to his foot. The otter, who before was a good seven or eight inches taller than him, now couldn't even reach his knees. Kieran expected Devon to be frightened, but instead he looked more curious than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Devon said, still staring in awe at Kieran. \"What happened to you, K?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran's eyes lit up in surprise. Devon was actually talking to him now, and, if his eyes weren't fooling him, even looked like he was showing more of an interest than before. Kieran tried to keep his excitement in check. \"This is all her fault,\" he said, pointing at Beatrice. \"She gave me some kind of growth serum or something, so I would be...\" His voice trailed off as he realized that now probably wasn't the best time to reveal his crush to Devon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Devon asked, ignoring the uncompleted sentence. \"That's kinda cool. Do you have any more?\" he asked, turning to Beatrice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mink shook her head. \"Nah, it was a lucky break that I got the mixture right for the first one, and I didn't write down what I used. It'll take me a while to get another batch brewed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another batch?!\" Kieran exclaimed as his eyes lit up. \"No way! This is already getting too insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well,\" Devon said. \"I guess you won't be able to do time trials today, will ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably right,\" Kieran said as he thought about it. \"If the coach'd let me, though, I could swim a lap in about 0.4 seconds. I just have to lie down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Devon laugh, and Kieran smiled meekly. Maybe this whole giant mix-up wasn't such a bad thing after all. It sure seemed to get Devon more interested in him, that's for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" Devon said, \"if you want, we can go for a swim at my house. My family lives in the forest on a lake; it's secluded and the water's deep enough that you'd be able to swim like normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Kieran asked. \"Sure! If you're sure you and your parents won't mind having a giant tiger around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't get home until late; I'll deal with it then,\" Devon replied. \"C'mon, give me a ride on your shoulder and I'll tell you the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My shoulder?\" Kieran asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, Shorty,\" Devon said, smiling. \"You can cover a lot more ground than me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his point, Kieran kneeled down and stuck out his paw, motioning for Devon to climb on. When the otter did, he then lifted him up to shoulder level, where Devon climbed off and grabbed a hold of his fur. The sensation of someone climbing onto him felt strangely pleasant to Kieran, and the fact that it was his secret crush who was wearing only a speedo made it even moreso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait!\" the swim coach called out. \"What about your time trials, Devon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon turned back to face the team. \"We'll do 'em tomorrow,\" he called out, then faced forward again as Kieran started to walk away. \"I wasn't really in the mood to do them today anyways,\" he said in a low voice into Kieran's ear. Kieran grinned out of the corner of his mouth, and they started on the way to the forest where Devon lived.</span></div></div>",

There's a shortcut through the woods that goes right by the house.  You probably won't be spotted as easily going through there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran nodded his agreement and stepped over the gate, striding carefully down the wooded path.  As glad as he was that Devon had accepted him in his new... situation, he wasn't quite certain the rest of the world would be as open-minded.  The tiger picked his way through the thick forest, ducking and crouching occasionally to keep Devon from getting whipped in the face by a branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long, Kieran had cleared the forest and was standing at the edge of Devon's yard.  The house was small (in every sense to the tiger), a single-story ranch with a long driveway leading up to the main road and the rest of the neighborhood.  The lawn sloped down to the clear blue waters of the lake.  Trees surrounding the property gave the area a peaceful, secluded atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home sweet home,\" Devon commented.  \"My parents won't be home for a few hours, so we've got the place to ourselves for awhile.  Wanna go for a swim?  Feel free to take a dip.  I'll try to find something for you to cover up with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanking the otter for his hospitality, Kieran dropped Devon off on his doorstep and made his way down to the edge of the lake.  Stepping out onto the dock, Kieran slipped into the refreshingly cool water.  He'd always kind of wanted to go skinny-dipping; he just hadn't pictured doing so in his present situation.  Ducking under the surface, Kieran propelled himself around the lake in powerful strokes.  When he surfaced again, he noticed Devon, now in jeans and a t-shirt, standing on the edge of the dock.  Kieran grinned and swam over, resting his forearms on the dock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought some large towels and sheets for you to dry off for and use as cover when you're done swimming,\" the otter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Kieran smiled.  He was struck by how kind Devon had been to him.  \"I really... kinda like you,\" Kieran gushed involuntarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter paused, taken aback.  <i>Shit,</i> Kieran cursed himself inwardly.  <i>Coming on WAAY too strong.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you, too,\" Devon smiled back, brushing a hand against Kieran's lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  You're pretty cute,\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kieran's heart beat so fast it nearly jumped out of his chest, and he was glad the lower two-thirds of him was underwater, helping conceal the erection that had suddenly sprung up (or maybe that wouldn't be so bad...). He thinks I'm cute, Kieran thought to himself. The feeling was by all means more than mutual; inside, he wanted to pick Devon up, rip off his shirt and jeans, and go to town, right there in the water, but he knew that wasn't the best of ideas. He just didn't know what was the right way to react; he'd never been in a situation like this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, however, the choice wasn't up to him. He heard the sound of a car engine revving as it pulled up the driveway, and Devon turned around, his brow furrowed. \"Damn,\" he said, \"it's my parents. What are they doing home so early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes beginning to fill with panic, Kieran let go of the dock and tried to dive back into the water as much as he could. \"What should I do?\" he asked Devon, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon shook his head, grinning slightly. \"Don't fret too much, Shorty. My parents are pretty accepting; I'll just go explain the situation to them, and we'll be as good as gold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Kieran stayed in the water for now as Devon circled around to the front of the house. By the dock it was shallow enough that he could sit on the lakebed and still have most of his head above the water line. He leaned back into the water, so that the only things that were visible were his ears and muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about what was going to happen with his situation. Sure, Beatrice had said it would wear off eventually, but until then, how was he going to eat, sleep, dress himself or go to school? And of course there was the issue that many people just wouldn't accept a giant in their midst and might start freaking out, calling the cops, the military, or worse. Kieran didn't like thinking of these worst case scenarios, but what other choice did he have? At least one good thing had come of the whole mess. Devon sure seemed much more interested in him than before. It even seemed like he might have been willing to get a little more intimate before his parents showed up. And Kieran liked how Devon had seemed to keep his cool about the whole situation, taking him to his house and still calling him \"Shorty\", ironic as the nickname was now. At this point, the otter was just what Kieran needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, he heard several sets of footsteps approaching, and heard a masculine otter's voice (Kieran guessed that it was Devon's father) saying, \"Absolutely not. I don't care what the situation is, you're not having friends stay over on a school night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Dad,\" Devon said, a slight whine in his voice, \"He really needs to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't argue with your father,\" a feminine voice, Devon's mother, said. \"As long as you live under our roof, you'll follow our rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon's father continued, \"And furthermore-- wait, what the heck is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfraid he'd been spotted, Kieran dove down completely into the water, trying to avoid being seen. In his haste, though, he had forgotten to take a deep breath, and within a few seconds, his lungs were beginning to burst. He brought his head back above the surface of the water, gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they spotted you, Kieran,\" Devon said with a smirk. \"You can stand up now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSputtering, and dripping wet, Kieran did as Devon said. His waistline was just about level with the water surface, so he didn't have to worry about covering up in front of Devon's parents. The adult otters both stared at Kieran in wonder, though not as afraid as Kieran had feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Devon,\" his father said, \"I think you might have had a point about him needing to stay.\" He turned to Kieran, giving a half-smile that was covering a little bit of apprehension. \"So, son, you must be Kieran, right? How on earth did you get so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sir,\" the tiger replied, \"it's a long story, and I'm not sure of most of the details myself. Let's just say I didn't plan this, that's for sure. And I'm hoping it won't last too long.\" When he said this, Kieran noticed Devon's ears drooping a little. Was being so much taller than him that much of a turn-on, Kieran thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon's father nodded, \"I see. And Devon says you need to stay here tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran looked back and forth between Devon and his parents, unsure of how to respond. Sensing his confusion, Devon spoke up. \"I told them that it'd be best if you stayed here tonight. I just know that there's not many other places in town where you could go without being spotted and harassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly nodding, Kieran replied, \"I guess it would make things easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then,\" Devon's father said, \"just for tonight. Tomorrow, though, if things haven't gotten back to normal, we'll have to call a doctor... or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran nodded, \"Thank you very much,\" he said, bowing slightly out of respect. At least for now, things seemed to be working out all right for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night went fairly smoothly. Kieran called his parents, letting them know he wouldn't be home tonight and only receiving a slight dose of worried chastising from them. He didn't mention anything about the sudden growth spurt, hoping to not cross that bridge until absolutely necessary. Devon's father offered to have a cookout by the lake for dinner, so Kieran wrapped himself in the towels and sheets that Devon had brought, and gladly chowed down with the family, having three hot dogs and a hamburger. He didn't want to eat any more out of fear of rudeness, but at his size, it was barely enough to keep his stomach from growling through the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it got dark, Devon tried to find a place in the backyard for Kieran to get comfortable. He had pleaded with his parents to let him sleep outside with Kieran, but his parents wouldn't budge on that. Right before Devon had to go to bed, he made sure Kieran was going to be okay, and gave him a quick hug on the arm, burying his face into Kieran's fur. \"Good night, Kieran,\" Devon said. \"See you in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night,\" Kieran said. \"Pleasant dreams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they will be,\" Devon said, smiling, \"as long as you're in them.\" He winked at Kieran and then slipped in side, leaving the tiger blushing slightly. As he lay down and tried to find a comfortable position on the grass, he thought of how lucky he was to have a friend like Devon. and he fell asleep dreaming of the sexy otter he had always liked, knowing that he liked him in return.</span></div></div>",

It took him a moment to re-orient himself and remember why he was sitting in a pile of sheets in the middle of a lawn.  <i>Wait a minute,</i> Kieran realized, <i>I'm normal-sized again!</i>  He was glad to be out of the awkward and possibly dangerous situation that he'd been in.  All the same, Kieran hoped that Devon wouldn't be too disappointed.  He was the same Kieran no matter what size he was, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping himself in a sheet, Kieran made his way up the sloping lawn to the house.  Knocking on the glass back door, he smiled as Devon opened the door and let him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, cutie,\" Kieran grinned, brushing his lips against the otter's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Shorty.  You're, ah... short again,\" Devon replied, his expression mercurial.  \"There's some clothes for you over there by the table, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong with that?\" Kieran asked, concerned, as Devon handed him a bowl of cereal and the clothes he'd mentioned earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.  Nothing like that,\" Devon said, but his expression seemed to suggest the opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm still Kieran,\" the tiger replied, dropping the sheet around his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing!\" Devon hissed, blushing slightly.  \"My parents are right upstairs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran just grinned and pulled the clothing on.  The pair finished breakfast and headed out the door to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, I wish you were still big enough to carry me to school,\u201d Devon commented wistfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could hold hands\u2026\u201d Kieran suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s not do anything too hasty,\u201d Devon sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHasty?

I can\u2019t believe that,\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverwhelmed with emotion, Kieran ran off down the path, tears stinging his eyes, ignoring Devon\u2019s shouted apologies and pleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to make me big again.  And I mean really big,\u201d Kieran begged Beatrice when he ran into her in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad fun with Devon last night?\u201d Beatrice giggled. \u201cI knew making you big would do the trick.  Looked like fun.  Might make some for myself soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s so amazing.  But he seemed disappointed when I returned to normal size,\u201d Kieran conceded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, there.  Maybe this was a mistake.  I\u2019m sorry, Kieran.  If that\u2019s the only reason he liked you, maybe you should move on,\u201d Beatrice sighed, her ears drooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Beatrice!\u201d Kieran frowned.  \u201cI want him so bad.  I love him.  And he loves me.  Just do this for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice pursed her lips and scowled, but slowly nodded.  \u201cFine.  See me after school,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran could hardly wait all day.  The minutes and hours seemed to take centuries to pass by.  When the day finally decided to stop torturing the lovesick tiger and the final bell rang, Kieran dashed down the hall to Beatrice\u2019s locker.  He nearly bowled the poor mink over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have it?\u201d Kieran asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea how tempted I was just to drink this myself,\u201d Beatrice commented snidely, holding up the flask.  \u201cHere.

By the time she had caught up with him near a dumpster behind the school building, he already had the flask uncorked and was holding it to his lips, the contents disappearing into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go drinking it all at once,\" Beatrice said, rolling her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran's lips curled in disgust, and he dropped the flask to the ground, where it shattered. \"Yuck!\" he said. \"That tastes a lot more bitter than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, be careful with those flasks, Kieran,\" Beatrice said, frowning. \"Like I said yesterday, I hadn't written down the ingredients. This was as close as I could get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger crossed his arms across his chest and started tapping his foot. \"Well, why isn't it working yet?\" he said, impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not instant,\" Beatrice said. \"Besides, don't you want to maybe take off your clothes first, so you don't shred them like before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, crap,\" Kieran said. \"They're not even my clothes; I borrowed them from Devon this morning.\" He started removing his shirt over his head, but as he was unfastening the pants, he started feeling dizzy and his vision blurred. \"Ahh, here it comes!\" he said. He fell back against the brick wall, trying to keep his balance. His head started to pound as he fell to a seat and blacked out completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, he heard the mink's voice calling from somewhere seemingly far away. \"Kieran, are you alright? Kieran?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger slowly opened his eyes, his vision still fuzzy. He rubbed his head with his paw, trying to ease his headache. \"Ughhh,\" he said, \"that didn't feel so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" Beatrice said, her voice definitely a lot more squeaky than before, \"well, it seems to have worked. A little too well, I might add.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his eyes, Kieran looked down at where the voice was coming from. Beatrice was standing there, a mixture of awe and worry filling her face. Something seemed a little strange though; the mink was now only half as big as Kieran's foot. \"Beatrice,\" he asked, \"what happened? How big am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Beatrice said, shrugging. \"Definitely a lot bigger than before. Stand up so we can see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran slowly came to his feet, leaning against the roof of the school building for balance. He took a double take at what he was leaning on, realizing that the building which he was about the same height as the other day, now only reached his thighs. He stood up to his full height and looked out over the campus, able to see every bit of it with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Kieran said. \"Why am I so much taller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mink furrowed her brow, frustrated. \"Like I said, I wasn't using exact measurements. Plus, who knows, maybe there's a cumulative effect.

You'll have to protect me,\" Kieran added, with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Shorty,\" Devon said, rolling his eyes but smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran sat Devon on his shoulder and headed for the interstate. Cars swerved to avoid colliding with the colossal tiger and his feet, and more than one accident was caused by drivers gawking at Kieran as he passed by. A satisfied grin crossed his face; he was starting to get used to being a giant, and even basking in it. He didn't even mind being naked. Having Devon with him and happy made it all the more enjoyable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about a six mile walk to get to downtown, and Kieran covered the distance in a matter of minutes. Devon had to hold on tight as Kieran climbed down from the interstate onto the surface streets. In the office buildings around him, all work was stopped as everyone gasped and stared at the seven-story beast in their midst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look over there,\" Devon said, pointing at the baseball stadium, located right on the riverfront. \"It looks like the Knights are playing an afternoon game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Kieran said, \"let's go see.\" The tiger stepped over to the ballpark, and leaned against the grandstand roof, which started to creak and groan but held up under the massive weight. Some fans started to run away screaming, while others looked up at Kieran in awe, even cheering the tiger. The game paused as the players and umpires were among those dumbstruck. \"Don't worry about me,\" Kieran said, waving his paw. \"I'm just here to watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teams nervously resumed play, and Kieran and Devon enjoyed a few at bats. \"I've never been to see a Knights game before,\" Devon commented. \"I'm glad to get to go to one with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Kieran sighed, contended. A loud CRACKing sound caught his attention, and he saw that the batter had hit a long foul ball that was heading his way. With quick reflexes, he reached his paw out, and the ball landed square in the middle of it, no bigger than a pinhead to Kieran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go,\" he said as he handed the ball to Devon. \"Your first foul ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, way to go Kieran!\" the otter cheered, taking the ball. He leaned up against Kieran's muzzle, and planted a kiss squarely on his cheek. Kieran felt his insides turn to mush, and he saw that he was beginning to get hard below, but he didn't care. He turned and looked at the otter straight in the eye, unsure of what to do next, but knowing that whatever he chose to do, it would be alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Devon,\" Kieran finally said. \"I have an idea of what we should do next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" the otter replied, with a knowing look. \"What did you have in mind?\"</span></div></div>",

Police officers jumped out of the cars and took up a position behind the doors, aiming their guns up at the enormous tiger.  Instinctively, Kieran got down on his knees, keeping his hands raised.  Devon grabbed onto the fur on Kieran's shoulder to keep from slipping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, whoa.  I don't mean to do any harm,\" Kieran told the officers in as level a tone as he could manage.  The tiger tried to maintain a facade of calm, but his voice shook, betraying the sudden attack of the nerves he was feeling.  He hadn't ever had someone point guns at him before, much less an entire contingency of cops taking aim at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put your hands on the ground slowly,\" an officer barked through a loudspeaker.  Kieran complied nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need?\" Kieran asked.  \"What am I doing wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could arrest you for disturbance of the peace and public indecency,\" the officer replied curtly.

The tiger flinched slightly, a little nervous of what was going to happen, but knew that he was in too deep now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better hurry!\" he said to the officers, as he raised his footpaw mere inches above the closest police car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire!\" the Doberman cried out, and a barrage bullets started springing forth. Many of them missed Kieran, though some of them did hit him in his thighs and stomach. It felt a little like lots of little mosquito bites all over his skin; unpleasant, but nothing he couldn't handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you got?\" Kieran laughed as he brought his foot down, crushing the car flat and sending the two officers next to the car flying away. The glass and metal crunched with a satisfying groaning sound. He twisted his paw back and forth, making sure the car was completely destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, the police stopped shooting at him, and stared up at the seemingly-invincible destruction-minded colossus. \"Our guns are useless against him!\" one of them screamed, and many started to flee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you get for messing with me,\" Kieran chuckled. \"Now if you go away as fast as you can, I'll let you live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kieran!\" Devon was swooning on the tiger's shoulder. \"That was awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cops who hadn't fled before were now slowly backing away, then turning and running as fast as they could. Some of them jammed themselves into the cars that were still working, driving off. The only one left was the Doberman sergeant, who stayed fixed in his position, a combination of fear and duty keeping him in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" he barked out through the loudspeaker, his voice cracking as he raised his shaking arm. \"In the name of the law, stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you know what to do with that asshole, Kieran,\" Devon said, suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Devon's eager smile out of the corner of his eye, Kieran felt like it was time to show his true power. A nagging thought ran through his head though; he didn't want to become a murderer, even if it was of someone who was trying to kill him. The sense of power that crushing the car had caused, though, felt good, and it started to build up inside himself. Maybe he should teach this pig a lesson, demonstrate his power as a -- a what? A giant? A god? Something even greater?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran shook his head, sorting his thoughts out, and finally decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From his towering new height, everything looked so fragile, so... fun to break.  Grinning, Kieran balled up a fist and sent it smashing through a building nearby.  Glass shattered and metal bent and snapped with a shrieking rending sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho ho!\" Devon shouted triumphantly.  \"You are so amazing!

Kieran was well on his way to having a raging erection, but he didn't care.  Anyone who might be offended would soon be crushed underfoot anyway.  Letting out a lustful roar, Kieran launched himself at the nearest highrish building.  He tackled it to the ground in a cloud of rubble.  He sat up, checking to make sure Devon was still okay.

The bullets were much more concentrated and powerful than the police force's had been, and the tiger felt his legs getting pelted, nearly losing his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rounded the corner again, nearly crashing into a building, knocking it off its foundation. Numerous fleeing crowd members were trampled underfoot, and cars were flattened without care, as Kieran ran with all his might. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon hung on tightly to the shoulder fur, but when Kieran stumbled, nearly falling down, the otter lost his grip and flew into the air. Reacting quickly, Kieran stopped, reached his paw back and caught Devon in the air, saving him from a nasty drop. Kieran decided to keep Devon held in his hand for safety as he started running away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you,\" a truly petrified Devon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not out of the woods yet,\" Kieran said, as they left the downtown area. \"We've got to find someplace to hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not going to be easy.\" Devon thought for a few minutes, and suddenly came up with an idea. \"Hey, there's a large cavern in the mountains near my house. I think it'd be big enough for you if you crouch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea as any,\" Kieran said. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Kieran had squeezed into the aforementioned cavern, and Devon had gone back to his house. He didn't want to leave Kieran alone, but the tiger insisted, not wanting Devon's parents to get suspicious. Devon curled up, trying to fall asleep, but couldn't get comfortable in the dankness of the cavern. He thought about what had happened today, and while it was fun to be big and he loved how it turned Devon on, his actions definitely seemed dangerous, irresponsible, and totally unlike him in retrospect. If he got out of this alive, he promised never to do anything like this again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nightfall, Kieran heard twigs snap in the nearby forest, and, using his honed night vision, saw the shape of on otter coming trudging up the path, followed by a mink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Devon! Beatrice!\" Kieran exclaimed, careful not to speak too loud in case anyone else was in the forest. \"I'm sure glad to see you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hon,\" the otter said, giving Kieran's footpaw a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, did you cause a shit storm out there today,\" Beatrice said, smirking. \"Lucky bastard,\" she added with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least by tomorrow I should be back to normal and we can put all this behind us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so sure,\" Devon said. \"Every police officer and soldier in the country's seen your face by now.

Each of them held the same familiar yellow liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kieran exclaimed. \"No, no, I don't want to touch that stuff again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice grinned, a hint of what looked like malice in her eyes, as she said...</span></div></div>",

Be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friends disappeared into the dark, and Kieran headed off in a circle around the backside of the base, keeping enough of a perimeter to avoid being seen. He came to Lake Furon and quietly slipped into the waters, which were a good deal chillier than he had expected, but deep enough that he could swim underneath the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few minutes for Kieran to swim the three mile route to the base, and as he got closer, he slowed down, sticking the top of his head out to examine the situation. It seemed that the base was quiet; no one had been alerted to his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran breathed in deeply through his nostrils, working up the courage to do what had to be done. \"It's now or never,\" he said to himself, as he prepared to stand up and fight.</span></div></div>",

He quickly set to work, smashing everything in sight.  Kieran didn't know anything about the layout of the base, so he wasn't entirely certain which buildings were the most integral to the base's operations.  All he could do was get rid of as much opposition as possible and hope that the troops would be too surprised by the very wet, very big, and very naked tiger in their midst to muster a quick response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he crushed a barrack full of soldiers, Kieran began to remember the strange erotic feeling being so big gave him.  The fear he'd had was beginning to drain away, replaced quickly by an odd excitement.  He was going to have some fun with this.  At least as much as he could with his time constraints.  Didn't want the army nuking him or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran's ears perked up as he heard a siren shrieking across the base grounds.  <i>Hmm,</i> Kieran mused. <i> I've got company now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing there wouldn't be much time before he would have to start worrying about the threat posed to him by the armed forces, Kieran kicked his assault into high gear.

Laughing, Kieran rolled on his back and tilted his head towards Devon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly full of grace, are ya,\" the otter said with a smirk on his face. \"But then again, neither am I!\" With that, Devon jumped into the air and landed on Kieran, causing him to roll over and flatten a barracks that was next to the hanger. The two of them were turned on by the destruction they were causing, and started to make out a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Beatrice said, tapping her foot impatiently as she saw the two lovers going at it. \"We've got some work to do!

During class, they would still get weird looks from other students and/or teachers, and Kieran and Devon both were shunned at swim practices, but otherwise, nothing out of the ordinary happened. Devon and Kieran had continued to date and had begun to get somewhat serious, while Beatrice isolated herself from her friends, becoming somewhat of a loner. It wasn't the exact same as life before the Incidents, but it was as close as it was gonna get. At least, for twenty-two days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the last day before fall break. Kieran and Devon were walking home from school, holding each others' hands, a habit they had gotten more and more comfortable in doing.

The secretary lead them right in, where the mayor paced the room, along with the police chief and a sergeant from the army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor ran over to them with a relieved look on his face. \"Thank goodness you all made it!

She had a haughty expression on her face and had stuck-up written all over her red-and-white frame.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we have a suspect,\" Kieran sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what was Mr. Mayor doing with our suspect that led to her obtaining the key, eh?\" Beatrice prodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not important,\" the mayor huffed.  \"What's important is a solution,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any left?\" Beatrice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes,\" the mayor hurried over to the safe, unlocked it, and pulled out a vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's IT?\" Beatrice scoffed.  \"There's hardly enough to make one of us as big as that bitch!  Here, give it to me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think YOU get it!\" Kieran and Devon complained in unison as the mink snatched the vial away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy.  I've got the most experience with this.  And besides, if you want to go pointing fingers, YOU'RE to blame for this whole thing, Kieran,\" Beatrice scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to point fingers,\" Kieran snarled, his ears flattening. \"If I messed up so badly, let me make up,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I'd rather do it,\" Beatrice laughed.  Devon shouted in protest as she downed the contents of the vial.  \"Now, I's best be going before I outgrow the building!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice ran out of the room, shedding her clothes as she went.  Several minutes later, thundering footsteps heralded a much larger Beatrice's arrival on the scene.  She stoped in front of the building and bent over slightly so that she was eye-to-eye with the mayor, Devon, and Kieran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hello there,\" Beatrice chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quickly grabbing Kieran and Devon in one quick swoop, she pulled them out, the two boys screaming in shock as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought the otter and the tiger up to her massive, looming eyes, a grin forming across her face. \"Well, ready to get going?\" She opened her fist, freeing the two from the pressure of her tight paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran had keeled over, gasping for air, while Devon patted his back in concern. Looking up to Beatrice, the otter scowled. \"Easy, Beatrice!\" he shouted. \"You'll kill us if you're that reckless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Kieran said, having caught his breath, \"I almost suffocated there against your fingers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, quit your whining,\" Beatrice said, tossing her hair to one side. She placed the two boys on her shoulder and started stomping off towards the street a few blocks over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, the vixen was causing even more chaos than before. She had already taken every car she could find and had punted them hundreds of yards away, and was now peering into some of the buildings, a frightening grin forming on her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you bitch!\" Beatrice called out as loud as she could, pointing an accusatory finger at the other giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen turned her head towards the mink, and her grin vanished. \"Who the hell are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you don't recognize me from last month?\" the mink scoffed. \"I'm Beatrice. Who the hell are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Jade.\" She stepped closer, trying to intimidate Beatrice. \"You're the one who came up with the formula, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am,\" Beatrice half-lied, \"and that means you've gone and stolen something that didn't belong to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so?\" The vixen rose up, adjusting her stance into one of indignation. \"What are you going to do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the mink leapt forward and tackled the mighty vixen, sending both ladies crashing into a nearby building. Claws, teeth, fur, and skin started flying as the two giantesses began to fight. Devon and Kieran had to cling on to Beatrice's shoulder fur just to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bea-ea-ea-ea-ea!\" Kieran yelled as he felt his paws starting to slip. \"Sto-oo-o-oo-o-ooopppp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her friend about to go falling a hundred feet to his death, Beatrice jumped back from the vixen, wiping the traces of fox-blood from her mouth. \"Hang on there, guys,\" she said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you SURE there's no more formula anywhere for US?\" Devon asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverhearing the otter's question, the vixen started to laugh. \"Oh, there is, my dear little otter. But it's not for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Beatrice turned her head back, shock in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you didn't think I'd just use the formula on myself, did you?\" The vixen backed away slowly, her malicious grin getting wider. \"No, I gave it to my older brother, who's a science geek, and he analyzed it to determine the ingredients. We've got enough formula to last a lifetime, and we can make more whenever we want! The whole world is our little game now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice, Kieran, and Devon all gasped. If what the mink said was true, then--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of paws stomping in the distance, gradually getting closer, interrupted their thoughts. The vixen looked behind her shoulder, to where the stomping was coming from. She began to chortle. \"And it looks like we've got our first contestant. May I introduce you to\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

Meet Alex, my older, and well.... bigger brother.\" she smiled again, \"And that there is Jason, and Sam. They must have seen you come after me and well, being the big, strong brothers they are... well, they're here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't appreciate you calling our little sister a bitch.\" Alex said, and reached down to clamp his hands roughly on Beatrice's arms. \"What's the plan, sis?\" he said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think we should take the three of them back to your place, Alex. I think we should take them there, and give this one here...\" Jade said, giving Beatrice a pat on her ass, \"... The cure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY NO... what what?\" Beatrice asked, after a light jump from the pat. Kieran and Devon held on for dear life as their 'ride' mink jumped. Jade smiled, \"Well, the first thing Alex did after figuring out how it worked was how to cure it, you know, in case of rogue giants.\" She smirked at Beatrice. \"He also found out another formula, to make things smaller. So I think your friends are going to be my little sister's dolls, and my brother Sam's playmates.... and you are going to spend the rest of your live *very* small, *very* helpless...\" Jade gave a soft moan, her tail swishing from side to side, damaging buildings as it did. \"...and *very* deep in my cleavage. Damn, I might need to start wearing clothes again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!!\" Beatrice cried out, and tried to struggle against a fox twice her size. Jade leaned in slightly, \"See? I piss you off, and you try to jump me. You piss me off? I'll have Alex shrink you so small that you'll be a fucking dot in THEIR hands...\" as she motioned towards Devon and Kieran with her head... \"... while THEY'RE in my fucking dollhouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade gave the mink a final kiss on the cheek. \"Let's go.\" She said, and Alex roughly picked up Beatrice and carried her away from the city, and towards her fate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't leave Beatrice.\" Devon said, but Kieran shook his head, \"We need to get more of that stuff and mount a rescue.\" and it was then that Devon had a thought, \"There's bound to more of the stuff at Alex's place. We can stick around and see what we find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunch of them soon found themselves at a large house on the outskirts of the city. It was obvious the owners of the house never had to worry about things like money or bills. Rich blood. Painfully rich blood. \"Oh Amber?\" Jade called out to the house, \"Be a dear and bring out some of the orange vials. Oh, and bring out four of the green ones with the minus sign?\" and presently, walking out the door was a lovely vixen who came up to about Jade's ankle, holding a rack with test-tubes in it. Jade knelt down and plucked up Amber, who then administered the orange vials to all the giants present. When Beatrice objected, her mouth was forced open, and much to her terror, she was forced both an Orange, and a double helping of the Minus Sign potion. Amber held out a Minus Potion to each of Devon and Kieran, and the look in Jade's eyes said it all. Drink, or die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shrugged, then looked apologetically towards Beatrice, as they both drank their portions. Then everyone started to slowly get smaller. Everyone, that is, except for Beatrice, who's complexion went from Confidence to Fear in no time at all. She had no idea how small she was going to get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all was said and done, Devon and Kieran shrank to about six inches in height, but they watched as Beatrice met their height, then kept shrinking. \"Hey guys... HELP!\" she called out, as she got smaller and smaller and smaller, her pleas for help becoming squeaks and high pitched shrills... until she was hardly half an inch tall. The extremely tiny mink issued a high pitched scream of fear as a black furred hand came from the sky, and snatched up the white mink from the ground. Jade hoisted her up ... up ... UP along the height of her body, stopping Beatrice's ascent at about chest level, forcing the tiny mink to look up over the swell of her nude breasts to look her in the face. Beatrice was wedged between the finger and thumb of Jade, who was smiling at her with sadistic glee. \"Let me get a shirt on, squirt.... then I'll introduce you to your new neighbors.\" She said, as she ran her free hand along the swell of her breasts. \"This is what you get for being a bitch.\" Jade said softly, \"And if you piss me off again, well, I've always wanted to know how small this stuff can make folks.\" She leaned in close, and then gave Beatrice a full body lick, before turning to the rest of the group. \"The other two are all yours, guys. This one's mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade walked into the house with her half-inch prize, while the others looked down at Devon and Kieran with a smirk each. \"We need to run.\" said Devon, and Kieran shouted back, \"No shit! Let's go!\" and the two tiny males bolted into the house. They were followed, but not at more then a leisurely pace. They were miles from the city, and the wildlife out here would eat them in nothing flat. They were trapped here.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jade had a wide smile on her face as she walked through her house, the incredibly tiny minkette Beatrice held between just two fingers. The vixen kept her hand at about chest level, which meant that Beatrice's entire view was just her massive uncovered breasts, freely bobbing with every step the vixen made. Beatrice screamed and screamed, but it was nothing more to the vixen then just squeaks and high pitched noises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Jade's ears twitched, and she brought her hand with Beatrice up to the massive ear, \"What was that again, hon?\" and Beatrice screamed out \"Let me the fuck go!\". Jade gently shook her head, \"I don't want to do that, and I'm pretty sure you don't either.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you talking about? You think I *want* you to wedge me between those tits?\" Beatrice questioned, and was answered by being brought around to Jade's face. \"As a matter of fact, yes. You don't see what you're being offered, little mink.\" Jade smiled as she walked the rest of the way to her bedroom, \"I'm offering you a place to live, rent free, in my house. You'll be given food, shelter, love, and a very soft place to sleep.\" Jade emphasized this by running an arm under her breasts and slightly lifting them. \"All I ask in return is that you love me, you listen to me, and whenever we're together... you make me feel it.\" the massive vixen smiled. \"This isn't about revenge, little speck. This is more about humiliation, and about me being the much... much bigger woman. Now, I'm going to go put something on, and then get you settled in for the night. I want you to stay right here...\" Jade said as she set the tiny minkette down on a countertop, and let go of her, \"... and if you're not there when I get back, there's going to be trouble for someone. So if you value your friends, you'll stay right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Beatrice watched the mammoth vixen saunter away, going through drawers to find an outfit to wear, and imprison her within. With no one to watch, and no hope in sight, Beatrice did the one thing that she never would do with someone watching: She cried. She fell to a seated position, hugged her knees to her chest, and gently sobbed. She was defeated, her throat hurt, and she was afraid that she was going to lose her mind. Beatrice thought about running, but she didn't have the courage to move at this point. She was tiny beyond her darkest fears, and there wasn't any hope in sight of that changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade returned after selecting a snug white bra, and a button up white shirt that showed plenty of cleavage. She also selected some nice white panties, that all contrasted against her dark fur nicely. With a sway in her hips, she returned to the countertop, and near Beatrice's tiny form, she laid down something that was gigantic to the mink, but so small and simple to the vixen:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTweezers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Bea. I've seen you naked. I touched you, I admired you, but seeing you like this... it's hard for me to still remember you're a woman. A damn pretty one too, which is why I think I wanted to keep you. Not just because I think you should be taught a lesson, but because, well... I guess I'm kinda into you.\" She said with a smile, as she plucked up the tweezers and started to corral Beatrice with her other hand. Beatrice found it hard to figure out what to watch: Jade's hand, or the Tweezers. With a shriek and a scream, and probably a flipped middle finger, the mink was pinched in the hips by the metal tongs of the tweezers, and slowly lifted up to just above the level of the crest of Jade's breasts. \"Like I said, I'm kinda into you. Play your cards right, little mink, and I'll invite you into me.\" She said with a lustful look in her eyes, as she licked her lips slowly. Then, she started to move the tweezers closer to her immense cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice squirmed and screamed, but this time, the vixen had no interest in hearing what the squeaks and squeals were. She wanted Beatrice, and she wanted her now. The vixen's free hand came over, and parted her cleavage open, exposing the inner depths of the canyon between her breasts. Beatrice started to scream as she was lowered towards that gap, feeling the heat radiating off of Jade's breasts as she got closer. Soon she was lowered into that gap, the heat from the flesh all around her almost unbearable, but when the tweezers let go, and Beatrice fell a few feet (to her) to land on the soft flesh and softer fur the minkette knew her troubles were just beginning. She turned and looked up to her sky, seeing the curve of each breast beside her, the two titanic fingers holding back the walls of flesh, and further up... the underside of Jade's muzzle. Soon the fingers withdrew, and the walls came in, trapping the tiny mink between them. It was unbearably hot, incredibly tight, and worst of all, embarrassing as hell. She felt butterflies in her stomach as he entire world rose up for a moment, then settled back down. From all around, she heard Jade's voice, \"I CAN FEEL YOU, LITTLE BEA...\" and in her frustration, Beatrice beat her tiny fists against one of the soft furry walls that pinned her in place. \"You want to feel me, you sadistic whore!? HERE!!\" Her reward was a giggle from far up high, and then Jade started to walk, and Beatrice's world started to gently bob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Jade, the entire proceedure took a few seconds, as she deposited the tiny minkette deep within her cleavage, then let her breasts return to their intended positions. She then closed her eyes, and reveled in her victory. She felt the tiny mink, an insignificant pebble, or even better, a grain of sand... buried in her breasts. Oh, how her breasts must look to the tiny mink, Jade thought, as she softly put her hands under each breast and gently hoisted them up a bit, then let them settle. \"I can feel you, little Bea....\" and then she felt something else, a flurry of activity from the tiny mink. She smiled, and even giggled, before she left her bedroom to join the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way to the living room, to sit down and watch some television, and to enjoy the feeling of her new pet. Her brothers were off somewhere, doing god knows what, and honestly.... she really didn't care. She was joined on the couch by ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jade sat on the couch, now completely immersed in the feeling of victory over Beatrice. The mink was never truly Jade's rival for anything, but now, the mink's current status was such that she'd never be a rival to anyone, or anything. Jade's eyes were closed, her head leaned back, and her long legs crossed, then uncrossed, then crossed again in a slow cycle. Jade slowly opened her eyes when she heard someone approaching, then smiled when she saw it was her younger sister, Amber. \"Hey hon. Join me?\" she offered as she patted the couch next to her. Amber smiled, and slowly sat next to her sister, with a wide grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade and Amber sat in silence for a moment, until Jade asked, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Amber started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what?\" Jade countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what's she like? You know, the mink in your tits?\" Amber asked with a smile. Jade gave a smile, and gently patted one of her generous breasts, \"Oh, she's fucking amazing. You know, I was originally only going to keep her for.... oh... a week, but I think this needs to be a permanent fix.\" She said to her sister, then closed her eyes softly, \"And when she moves, and she thrashes around...\" the vixen smiled wide, her tongue peaking out to lick at the edge of her muzzle. Amber smiled, \"Holy shit, sis. She's really got you going, doesn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade took a moment to relax, and another to compose herself. \"Ever hear the story of the Princess and the Pea?\" she asked her sister, and Amber nodded, \"Well, in this case... I'm the princess, Beatrice is the pea, and instead of mattresses, it's my tits.\" she said with a gentle giggle, careful not to jostle Beatrice too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what it's like in there.\" Amber mused, while moving to get a better look at her sister's cleavage. Jade gave a smirk, \"Hey, would you stop oogling my tits?\" and Amber gave Jade a smile, \"Sorry, can't help it. They're pretty epic, and that mink must think even moreso. They must be HUGE to her.\" and Jade gave a smile, \"Oh I assure you, to her... they're mountains. Though, a little more TV, then it's off to bed. I had quite the big day today.\" she said with a smile, and Amber giggled, \"Yeah, shame the mink had to come up short.\" and they both giggled at their collectively horrid puns. \"Can I play with her, sometime?\" Amber asked, and Jade nodded, \"Once she's broken in, sure.\" Amber smiled, and sat with her big sister and watched some TV. Soon though, it was time for bed. Jade walked Amber up to her room, and gave her little sister a kiss on the forehead. \"Sweet dreams.\" and Amber smiled, \"You too sis... oh, and...\" the younger vixen leaned in towards Jade's breasts, and whispered, \"Good night, little mink.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade's eyes opened a little, and she smiled at Amber, \"She says good night back.\" which was a lie. Beatrice thrashed about against the soft flesh around her in a temper tantrum once again, but since Amber didn't see it, and couldn't feel it, she didn't know any better. After tucking her in, Jade returned to her bedroom, to prepare for bed. \"Time to get ready for bed, little Bea.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice listened with building rage from within her prison of Jade's cleavage. All around her was the hot fur and flesh of the vixen's breasts, and everytime she spoke, or breathed, or really did anything, it was only amplified for the diminutive mink. \"Go to sleep, eh? Well fuck you you big whore, there's no way I'm...\" she started, then it hit her exactly how tired she was. Being tiny must have taken more out of her then she thought, not to mention her current environs. She's never admit to it, but right now... if you took away the truth that she was incredibly tiny, and wedged down another woman's cleavage... this was actually rather comfortable, in an erotic sort of way. The scent of the vixen surrounded the mink, filling every breath she took. It was warm... incredibly warm, almost unbearably warm, and softer then any comforter she had ever owned. So soft... so warm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was careful not to jostle too much as she got ready for bed. She took off her button down shirt, and instead opted for a sports bra, then took off her white bra and was careful not to let her breasts move around too much. It wasn't comfy until it was all done, and soon Jade was laying down in her bed, in just her panties and a white sports bra top, and as she reached over for the pull chain for the light, she smiled and gave her chest a gentle pat. \"Good night, my little mink.\" and Jade blew her a kiss as she pulled the chain to put out the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, you .... big...... \" and Beatrice yawned, lulled to sleep by the humiliating comfort of her prison.</span></div></div>",

She wanted to get up and bounce but... that would probably squash Beatrice between her tits, and as arousing as that thought was, she didn't want to actually hurt the miniature mink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade ran a hand along the smooth slope of her chest, the thought of Beatrice's prison slowly arousing the vixen. Her fur and flesh started to get warm, her breathing started to deepen, her chest started to rise and fall.. she thought she felt Beatrice move... then she was sure of it. The mink's motions were a serious turn on to the vixen, and she felt even dirtier as her hand slid down along her stomach, then down under the waistband of her panties. It was just her and Bea.... then Jade smiled. \"No... it's just me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice woke up slowly, hoping that the events of yesterday were a dream, but she soon found out they weren't. She felt herself rise and fall, slowly, and all around her was hot flesh and fur, pressing in on every side. She started to pound her tiny fists against the supple mounds that imprisoned her, but Jade's booming moan from above was her only reward. \"Oh, getting off on this first thing in a morning? You whore!\" Beatrice said, as she pounded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade couldn't help but smile as she felt and almost heard Beatrice's voice. \"Morning hon. Just...mmmmm... taking care of the morning routine.\" She said, her voice a sultry echo of its calm self. \"Mmmm... One day, it'll be you down there, so take notes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Me?! DOWN THERE!! You sick bitch!\" Beatrice screamed, as she tried to climb out of this hell. Jade shivered slightly, both at her own actions, and Beatrice's. \"Mmmmm.... keep that up, hon. Almost finished here, then we..... mmmmm.... then we can get some breakfast.\" The vixen said, while her hand slid around in her panties, her thighs spread. Beatrice decided that she wasn't going to contribute to this colossal vixen's pleasure any more, and stopped dead in her tracks. This cause Jade to cast a glance down to her tits, and sigh. \"Hon, keep moving, please.

The sight reminded her of cubs playing in a bathtub. \"What the hell are they doing? Are they five-year-olds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whazzat?\" Devon said, putting his paw up to his eyes, shielding the sun from them. \"Hey, that looks like fun! Kieran, why didn't we ever do anything like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger walked up behind him, leaning his head on the otter's shoulder and draping his arms around his neck. \"Are you saying that playing with the tanks and soldiers at the army base didn't do enough for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're splashing in the WATER!\" Devon playfully whined. \"WE never got to swim in the bay as giants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did,\" Kieran thought aloud, remembering his aquatic approach to the army base a month ago. \"I think you're overselling it a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" Devon turned around and gave Kieran a quick peck on the cheek. \"Okay, guys, we have to focus now.

CHAAARRRGEEE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon took off running, leaving Kieran and Beatrice behind, a puzzled look on each of their faces. After leaping a warehouse, the otter turned back around. \"What? Aren't you guys coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Beatrice smirked, \"but not like THAT! Why is it that everyone is starting to behave like children when they become giants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Bee,\" Kieran slapped his paw on her back gently, \"might as well have some fun with it!\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran together with his boyfriend towards the port, Beatrice following behind them, shaking her head and covering her eyes with her paw, muttering. \"Crazy loons. I need to meet some new people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than a minute, they had arrived at the docks. \u00a0Jade and Chuck were having too much fun, and didn't notice the three giant teenagers until they were in their shadows. When they saw them, however, the two rose to their feet, their fur dripping, the waterline coming up to just above their knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well,\" Chuck grinned, \"I guess someone's gone and stolen something that didn't belong to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's my line!\" Beatrice glared at them. \"Not only do you steal my formula, but you steal what I say too? Can't you idiots do anything original?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Chuck shook his fur, sending drops of water flying everywhere and almost drenched Kieran and Devon.

Either we can fight each other, hurting ourselves, destroying most of the city as we do so, \u00a0and wasting away our time as gods...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon crossed his arms and tilted his head to the side. \"... Or?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or,\" Chuck continued, \"we could team up. Each group take a district, and use whatever particular brand of destruction most appeals to us.\" An evil grin spread across his muzzle. \u00a0\"I know the two of you would especially have some fun and kinky ideas,\" he said, waving a paw at Kieran and Devon. \"We could bring these stupid peons to their knees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen's eyes lit up, and her smile matched Chuck's. \"And we'll never run out of formula, because my brother can make up to twenty flasks of it a day!\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" Kieran's ears drooped, \u00a0\"we promised the city we'd only use the formula for good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where has that gotten you?\" Chuck snorted, stepping a little closer to the otter and the tiger. \"Bored to death, horny as hell, while your precious formula is left available for any thief with half an ounce of cunning to take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A thief like you two?\" Beatrice countered.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. A thief like us.\" Jade stuck out her paw to shake. \"So what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three teens eyed each other. The giant pair's offer was tempting, no doubt about it. The thought of being huge practically forever, of not having to answer to the city again... They couldn't just let that opportunity pass by, could they?</span></div></div>",

It was his and Devon's parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hi mom,\" he said, feeling like his entire body was turning red in embarrassment. He quickly climbed off of the naked otter underneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. McGrew had an incredibly sour look on her face, her arms folded across her chest. \"I can't believe what I'm seeing. It's bad enough that for whatever reason you've taken it upon yourself to grow into a giant again, and a nude one nonetheless. But now I see you humping your boyfriend out in the harbor for the entire city to see!\" She threw her arms up in motherly frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon's father stepped up beside her, a frown on his face as well, but his voice more even. \"And Beatrice here tells us that you've broken your promise to the city to help stop those criminals who are busy destroying the south side of town. Devon, I know your mother and I didn't raise you that way.

After a few seconds, it was gone, and the scowling face of Jade was in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys just don't know when to give up, do you?\" she said, snarling a little. \"I give you plenty of chances to leave, or even to join us, and you don't take them. Well, that's too bad for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Bea asked, returning a snarl almost as threatening. \"Do you really think the two of you could beat us? We're gonna knock you into the next state!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah?\" The three teens turned around, seeing Chuck come around the corner from behind a building, walking over towards the vixen's side. \"You and what army?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, this army,\" Kieran motioned to the troops circling around the three of them. Jade and Chuck both looked a little shocked when they saw the immense scope of firepower that was accompanying them, but quickly regained their composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you guys found a bunch of tanks and soldier boys,\" Jade rolled her eyes. \"Big whoop. I doubt they have anything that could harm us at our sizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe that if you want,\" Kieran said, \"but trust me, I know from experience that getting hit with a hundred missiles at once isn't a pleasant experience at any size. And I didn't have a set of opposing giants to go up against either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade looked over at Chuck, and the two exchanged slightly worried glances. As they did so, Kieran looked over Jade's shoulder towards the bay, seeing that Devon and the navy were in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Chuck said, \"you don't want to do this. Think of the destruction that'll happen to the city. Just walk away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice shook her head. \"No dice. You guys would cause way more destruction roaming free than the amount we'd cause trying to subdue you. Just surrender and get it over with. Save yourselves the trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coyote and vixen didn't answer at first, thinking the situation through and going over their options. Bea looked ready to take them on, but Kieran held his breath, hoping that they would be able to avoid a big fight.</span></div></div>",

Jade gasped and looked around for her missing boyfriend, but soon shrank away as well.  Beatrice squatted down, resting on her haunches.  She reached out and plucked the tiny coyote up between thumb and forefinger, lifting him up to her grinning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were saying?\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuck didn't have much to say in reply, choosing instead to splutter and flail.

For all we know, we may have giants start popping up all over this city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Devon's ears perked up at this last statement. Kieran looked over and saw a slight wistful look in the otter's eyes, but he quickly snapped out of it. \"Oh, yeah. That would be bad. Real bad. Horrible calamity, and all that...\" His voice trailed off at the end as he closed his eyes and started daydreaming. Kieran rolled his eyes and laughed at this, placing a hand on his boyfriend's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've thought about that,\" the general announced confidentially through his megaphone. \"The military has been hard at work since immediately after your first attack, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Beatrice snorted. \"Let's not call it an attack. It was more of a playful romp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" the general grunted, \"after your last 'playful romp' (which cost the city government alone over fifteen million dollars to clean up and repair afterwards), we decided to take a sample of the formula and do a little research on it. And I think we've come up with an answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Kieran tried his best to look hopeful, but he couldn't help but worry what this solution would end up being. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general motioned to his left, where an older-looking lemur in a white lab coat had just appeared. \"I'm gonna let Dr. Chaklas explain it from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically,\" Dr. Chaklas started, his voice cracking a bit as he adjusted his glasses, obviously nervous to be directly addressing three beings that were exponentially larger than him, \"we reverse-engineered the formula, and created it's exact opposite. An antidote, if you will\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you mean like a shrinking serum?\" Beatrice asked, scratching her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lemur shook his head. \"Not really. On any normal-sized furson, the antidote would have no apparent impact, but as long as it was regularly ingested, it would completely prevent your growing formula, or anything like it, from having any effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Devon speculated aloud, \"you could put it in the city's water supply, and it would prevent any outbreak of giants and giantesses from occurring, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely. And, what's more, on a furson of ... of your sizes ... that is to say, one who's already been exposed to the growing formula, it would cause the formula to wear off much, much sooner, meaning that within a few minutes of the giant being exposed to it, they would be back to normal size. Give or take a few inches. We can go ahead and start with you three right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three giants looked at each other, each unsure of how they felt about what was being explained to them. \"What do you think about it, Bea?\" Kieran finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I sure do like that formula, or the effects of it, anyhow,\" she sighed, \"but I suppose we've got no choice.\"</span></div></div>",

Kieran had to admit he'd hardly call it work.  He found eliminating his insectile adversaries with ease quite fun.  He was no longer a shy little teenage boy.  He was a gigantic, invincible god with the world's hottest boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting down onto all fours, Kieran powered through the ranks of soldiers and tanks flattening anything and anyone unlucky enough to get caught under his hands and knees.

His hormones raged inside, and all he wanted to do was to make love to Devon. Causing destruction and having the entire city watch as they did it simply was a bonus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a couple of minutes for the two behemoths to arrive downtown. Though it was late at night, the city was still buzzing, and shouts of panic filled the air when the giant tiger return, this time nearly four times as big as before and with a partner. The police were called, but decided to stay put after what had happened earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we've got the city to ourselves,\" Devon said as he leaned against a skyscraper. \"I don't think the army is in any shape to come after us right now. And besides--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon was interrupted by Kieran as the tiger planted his lips against the otter's, and the two melted into a hot, steamy embrace. Kieran's impressive hard-on was pressing against Devon's equally impressive one, and they began to grind against each other, putting added pressure against the skyscraper, causing it to creak. After a minute, the building started crumbling and then came smashing to the ground in a spectacular mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops,\" Kieran said, snickering. \"Guess we got a little carried away there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then,\" Devon said, grinning mischievously, \"maybe we should get a LOT carried away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter started running through the streets, his giant paws smashing cars and tail whacking against the side of the building with reckless abandon. Kieran chased after him, causing every bit as much destruction. As Devon slowed a little to round a corner, Kieran leapt out and tackled him, sending both of them flying into a warehouse, smashing it flat. They rolled around for a bit, playfully wrestling, until they came to a stop with Kieran lying on top of Devon, both of them panting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared into each other's eyes, and then both looked down at the other's erections, both instantly knowing exactly what the other wanted. Kieran slid his body down and started fingering Devon's opening, and the otter began to moan pleasurably. As he started to press harder, though, Devon suddenly sat up. \"Wait,\" he said, \"don't we need some sort of lube?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger shrugged with a sheepish grin on his face. \"I dunno.

Well, I hope he enjoy's Beatrice then. God knows how she'll treat him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started walking away, kicking some gravel on the ground in frustration. The faint sound of screams filled the air, and he heard the familiar sound of the mink's laughing coming from behind him. He didn't even want to look that way now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran started wandering away from the school. He knew he was supposed to be at time trials, but he didn't feel like going at all. \"Why did I even give that flask back to Beatrice?\" he wondered aloud. \"I should've kept it, then Devon would be with me. Stupid, stupid tiger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked along the street, making his way gradually towards his neighborhood, he heard booming footsteps coming behind him, gradually getting louder. Turning around, he saw the towering figure of Beatrice standing above him. Squinting, he could make out Devon riding on her shoulder, smiling and waving at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kieran,\" the mink said. \"I figured one of us should use the mixture, not let it go to waste, ya know?\" She had a mischievous grin on her face, and looked like she was enjoying her size way more than Kieran had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away, Beatrice,\" Kieran said, spinning away. \"I'm not in the mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on,\" the mink said, bending down on all fours, bringing her face closer to Kieran. \"Why are you so pissy all of the sudden? You're the one who said you didn't want someone who was only interested in you because you were giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Devon turned his head slightly, frowning. \"Is that what you think, Kieran?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger turned back around, scowling. \"Well, it's pretty obvious. As soon as you saw I was back to normal again, it was like a light switch had flipped and you were all cold and uninterested. Then you just go run after the next giant\u2026\" Kieran stopped as he second-guessed if he really wanted to use the word he was thinking, but decided it was best to be honest. \"\u2026the next giant Bitch that you see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Beatrice and Devon gasped, and Beatrice's brow began to furrow. \"Hey, there's no need to be nasty,\" she said. \"I was only trying to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well I don't want your help, Beatrice. Not now, not ever!\" Kieran stormed away, leaving both Beatrice and Devon speechless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill steaming mad, Kieran headed home. He barely grunted at his mother's \"Hello\" when he walked in the door, and made his way upstairs to his room. Tears starting to stream down his face, he threw himself on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Damn, Damn,\" he said, muffled by the sheets, pounding the bed with his clinched fist. \"Why does everything have to be so hard? Why do people have to such jerks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sobbed into his pillow as the exhaustion from the past two days caught up with him, and he ended up crying himself to sleep.</span></div></div>",

He threw back the drapes to see the massive Beatrice stooping down and peering in the window with Devon on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, go away.  Stop harrassing me,\" Kieran snarled, turning his back on the pair.  \"I'm miserable enough as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn it!\" Beatrice hissed.  \"We're here to apologize.

I don't want to wake your parents up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran hesitated, but sighed and opened the window and crawled across the mink's fingertips into her waiting palm.  Beatrice stood up and padded quietly down the street.  She came to a secluded park and sat down in a grassy clearing, accidentally crushing a swing set underneath her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Beatrice sighed holding the two boys in her palms.  \"We have some explaining to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you do,\" Kieran growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry,\" Devon said.  \"I'm so so sorry.

The otter began to kiss the tiger passionately on the lips and cheeks.  Kieran hesitated, then enthusiastically returned the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like my work here is done, lovebirds,\" Beatrice commented.  \"Well, I won't be huge forever.

It was a small flask, almost exactly like the ones Beatrice had used before. \"I may have cut class during third period today, and spied on Beatrice's chem class.\" He opened up the bottle, which let out a little fizz. \"I saw she looked like she was making the serum again, so I copied the ingredients she used, and snuck into the lab during my lunch break to make my own.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed the flask to Kieran, who looked at it, stunned.

He unstoppered the flask and carefully swallowed half of the liquid inside, being careful not to drink too much.  Wiping off his lip, he passed the flask over to the otter, who finished off the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should something be happening?\" Devon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes a few moments to set in,\" Kieran said.  \"Oh!

He gasped as his heart skipped a beat. He had never touched or even seen another guy's cock, and it was an amazing sensation: all at once familiar but distinctive, warm and pulsing - holding the essence of his lover in the palm of his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon leaned his head back, moaning with pleasure. He began to squirm a little, his hips wriggling about, knocking down a few trees. \"Oh, Kieran,\" he said, \"get inside me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran didn't have to ask twice. The tiger straddled his legs around Devon's lower half, spreading the otter's legs apart. He put a finger into Devon's waiting orifice, forcing a sound that was a mixture of surprise, pain, and pleasure to escape from his lips, spreading over the countryside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo an observer on the ground, it would have been an amazing, terrifying site, the two giants making love. Unfortunately, no one was anywhere around to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kieran forced his raging hard-on into Devon, his breathing began to quicken. He started purring, grabbing Devon's shoulders tight. Both of them were so horny that it didn't take too long for the inevitable to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon came first, his entire body tensing up, then his erection spurting forth a hot mess. It shot into the air, getting into Kieran's face and chest fur. The tiger didn't mind; in fact, it was better than he had ever imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the otter finished, Kieran too was close to bursting forth. Not wanting Devon to miss the sight, he quickly pulled out, standing up, his hand working furiously on his shaft. A few drivers from the street a quarter mile away later reported that they saw the figure of a titanic teen tiger in the park, but couldn't make out the details of what he was doing. Devon, though, loved it, as Kieran began cumming all over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was done, Devon sat up, and Kieran kneeled down next to him, kissing his lips tenderly. \"That was amazing,\" Kieran said, then changed his mind. \"No, YOU were amazing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise,\" the otter said, running his paw form the top of the tiger's spine to the tip of his tail. \"I'm so glad you changed your mind and took me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two cuddled for a few minutes, each basking in the after-sex glow for the first time of their young lives.</span></div></div>",

Well, as low a profile I can maintain for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran nodded his agreement.

Of course, Devon didn't exactly have a lot of experience to compare him to, but still -- he couldn't complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey broke the kiss, and both looked down at their bodies, noticing they each had gotten hard again. \"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?\" Kieran asked, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right now, hon,\" Devon said. \"I'm getting kinda tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, okay,\" Kieran said, his ears drooping a little. \"Let's go find someplace to lie down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giants wandered through the land for several minutes, heading towards the unincorporated part town. There was a large forest at the county line, and they headed in that direction. The trees in the center of the forest were huge, providing enough of a canopy to shelter them in case any rain would come through in the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the largest tree they could, a sequoia that stretched over 250 feet into the air, Kieran leaned up against it, allowing Devon to lie down with his head in Kieran's lap, draping his tail across the otter's firm stomach. The tiger was still hard, and Devon could smell the strong musk that was coming off of Kieran's tigerhood, but the otter's eyes were growing too sleepy to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night,\" Devon yawned. \"I had a lot of fun tonight with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, hon,\" Kieran leaned down and gave the otter a loving lick on the muzzle. \"Sleep well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, you too...\" Devon's voice faded away as he drifted off into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot tired yet, Kieran spent the next ten minutes watching the otter's body softly move up and down, his eyes flickering slightly. He looks so peaceful when he's asleep, Kieran thought, and he's all mine! The last thought made his heart warm up, and he closed his eyes, smiling, thinking of all the fun they had and were still going to have.</span></div></div>",

She's real cool, though. A little crazy, but lots of fun. She's the one who taught me how to make the growth serums.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Devon asked, arching an eyebrow. \"How come we've never heard of any giant activity over there then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably because she's smarter than me and knows when to use it and when not to. Hurry up, guys, it's going to be a long hike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to run, Kieran could hear the faint sounds of sirens, sounding like they were about a mile away or so. Hoping they'd stay that far away, the three remained silent, though Kieran thought to himself, 'What's Bee's Aunt going to be able to do that we haven't already thought of?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder mink's cottage was on the outskirts of town, and after a few hours of running through the woods, the three friends found themselves at her front door. Knocking on it, Beatrice hissed, \"Aunt Zha Zha! Open up. It's me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Devon noticed a pair of eyes peering at them from between the drapes, and a few seconds later, the deadbolt unlocked and the door cracked open. \"Hurry inside, my love,\" a low, gravelly female voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three hurried inside, and the door slammed shut behind them. The first thing Kieran saw was that the house was very dark, lit only by candlelight, and was filled with cigarette smoke. His eyes adjusted to the darkness, and he saw a lanky mink, dressed in a gown that looked like it must have cost a fortune forty years ago, standing before them. She seemed like someone out of an old Hollywood picture, Kieran thought to himself. \"So you must be Kieran and Devon,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they are,\" Beatrice said. \"And you need to help us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dahling,\" Aunt Zha Zha said, \"I know all about what the three of you have been doing. It's all over the radio. I suppose you want me to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you could, ma'am,\" Devon said. Kieran could tell that the otter was clearly uncomfortable, and placed his paw on his shoulder to offer some encouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" Zha Zha said, \"I wouldn't want to be caught doing anything\u2026 illegal.\" A wicked smile crossed her face, and her eyes were filled with devilish mirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the three teens heard something that startled them.

Now!  Run!\"<br>\r\n.  <br>\r\nKieran didn't need to be told twice.  He hurried after Beatrice, with Devon close behind.  Beatrice kicked aside a rug, revealing a trapdoor concealed beneath.

There was no source of light besides the few cracks in the floorboards.  Beatrice, Devon, and Kieran sat down on the cold floor, trying to keep their breathing under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, officer?\" Aunt Zha Zha asked above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have reason to suspect that you are harboring criminals,\" the officer replied.  \"We need to search the premises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think that?

So I may have given the formula to Kieran here a couple of days ago to help him out. He's always been so timid, I thought he could use the boost. I thought he would only grow a few feet, but I must've mixed the ingredients in the wrong ratio or something, 'cause next thing I know he's fifty feet tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty feet,\" Kieran corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty, fifty, whatever. The point is you were a big sonofabitch and I wasn't, and that made me jealous. I made more, and finally got to try it out myself. Boy, that was fun. And then, next thing I knew the police was after me, and these guys had pissed off some farmer, so we had to run for our lives, and now I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Zha Zha nodded. \"I'm sure that's all there is to it, but I have to ask: what did you do to make the police so angry with you, Bee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mink snorted. \"I may have played dominoes with a few buildings and knocked them down. And I think a couple of police cars may be in the bottom of the lake by now, I don't know. It's not like anyone got killed or hurt or anything, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZha Zha shook her head. \"My dear, I'm afraid I have still much to teach you.

Listen, if they're going to come in, I can't stop them, but I can give you something to help you escape. Here,\" she pulled out three vials full of liquid from a cabinet by the kitchen and handed one to each of them. \"Drink this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no,\" Kieran said, groaning. \"Here we go again!\" The vials were each solid, so that they couldn't see into them, but the aroma upon opening them was very familiar.

Now,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran barely had time to react before the pot exploded, unable to take the rapidly-expanding Beatrice.  Devon and Kieran grabbed one another and curled together defensively as they were buried under fur and rubble.  The tiger thought they were goners, but eventually the movement stopped.  Uncurling himself from Devon, Kieran looked around his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice was positively colossal.  She was easily over 1000 feet tall.  The mink was sitting in the remains of her aunt's house.  Each of her feet had landed squarely in an unfortunate neighbor's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, THIS is what I'm talking about!\" Beatrice enthused.  \"Where are you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to come up with a better response, Kieran knealed down and bit Beatrice's thigh with all of his might.  Beatrice yelped and slapped her hand down.  Devon and Kieran grabbed onto her finger and held on as they were lifted up to Beatrice's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys.

The giantess had just arrived in the downtown of the city near Aunt Zha Zha's house.  Despite, the number of large buildings, Beatrice stood head and shoulders over most of the city, and she was clearly loving it.  Making her way down the streets proved a bit difficult, as her hips and sides brushed against the facades of the buildings, crumbling them effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't mind me,\" Beatrice giggled. \"I'm just here for a bit of fun,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon and Kieran clung on for dear life as Beatrice took off in a dead sprint down the street.  Her stomping feet kicked up and cars or pedestrians unlucky enough to get caught underfoot.  The mink took a great flying leap and tackled a skyscrper as tall as she was.

I might have to use the formula tomorrow just to be able to help clean up her mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon giggled, then playfully leapt on Kieran, wrestling him to the ground. \"That's the sexy, caring tiger I know.\" He ran his paws through Kieran's hair as he licked him on the cheek. \"I knew you weren't the destructive type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran nodded and sighed, his eyes drifting past the otter's face and into the milky swirl of stars in the inky-blue sky overhead, contemplating the matter. \"I don't mind being big, I guess-- actually, I think I might end up liking it -- but I don't want to hurt anybody or cause any damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhhmm,\" Devon murmured, his muzzle burying itself in the tiger's soft chest fur. \"Well, maybe a little destruction wouldn't hurt. You know, flattening a car or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking eye contact with Devon again, Kieran couldn't help but fall in love all over again with the sexy otter. His mischievous playfullness complemented his handsome face and his killer body, and he seemed to be as enamored with Kieran as the tiger was with him - something Kieran couldn't have imagined just forty-eight hours ago. The macro obsession - was it proper to call it a fetish yet, he thought - was a bit odd, but it seemed to work out well for the both of them. Something, however, gnawed at him inside: a sense of worry or fear that this could all go very wrong very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Devon's voice interrupted Kieran's thoughts, \"Beatrice will probably not shrink back down until early morning. What do you want to do until then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Kieran said, softly purring as he wrapped his arms around his lover. \"I doubt that either of our parents would much appreciate us trying to sneak back home together.\" He closed his eyes, feeling the gentle breeze blow through his fur. \"The weather's nice, and this ground is surprisingly soft. I wouldn't mind it if we just stayed together here for the night, just like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon shimmied up on Kieran's body slightly, bringing himself face-to-face with the tiger. \"My thoughts exactly.\" He leaned forward and kissed Kieran gently on the lips, their whiskers brushing for a moment, sending a shiver down Kieran's spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to make out for a half-hour or so, both of them eventually growing sleepy. As the small clock tower at the other edge of the park chimed midnight, they drifted off to sleep in each other's arms, both of them excited about what tomorrow would bring.</span></div></div>",

He sat up slightly, running his fingers through Devon's hair absentmindedly as the otter blinked awake.  Devon sat up, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Kieran,\" he said, giving the tiger a peck on the cheek. \"Ready to get big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I ever!\" Kieran gushed.  He put his paw down by his side, where he'd set the vial the night before.  \"Wait a sec.  Did you move it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The vial.  It was right here last night.  Now it's gone,\"  Kieran said, worry entering his voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping to his feet, the tiger frantically searched his person and immediate surroundings.  Where could the vial have gone?  What had he done with it last night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Kieran?  I think I know where it went,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran looked over at Devon, who was staring slack-jawed at a point behind the tiger.  Kieran spun around and gasped.  Reclining on the grass several dozen feet away was Beatrice, just as big (if not bigger) than she had been the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say?  Beezilla wasn't quite done having fun yet,\" Beatrice shrugged, tossing aside the lamppost she'd been using as a toothpick. \"I saw you had a vial of the good stuff and I couldn't resist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beatrice!  That's--that's... not cool!\" Kieran stomped his foot. \"I wanted to use it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess rolled her eyes. \"Use it for what?  To go help those poor schmucks clean up?  Save some orphans from a burning building?  You've gone soft,\" Beatrice poked at Kieran, knocking him flat on his ass.  \"I can show you how a REAL giant does it.

Besides, I\u2019ll never pass up a chance to flaunt my hot bod,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran protested loudly as long, slender fingers wrapped around his body, lifting him off the ground. Beatrice winked knowingly at the equally upset Devon standing several feet away before standing up and striding off towards the city again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger was dropped unceremoniously  onto the giantess' shoulder as she made her way into the metropolis again.  Kieran couldn't help but be surprised by the amount of damage she'd managed to do overnight.  Buildings knocked off their foundations lay around like so many cardboard boxes.  Crushed cars and buses littered the streets.  A ferry boat had been hauled out of the nearby bay and was now beached on top of the city convention center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, where was I?\u201d Beatrice grinned  mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon sat dejectedly in the park.

But the stakes change a bit when there\u2019s also a 400-foot mink-girl using downtown as a jungle gym,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve noticed.  Now all we\u2019ve got to do is wait,\u201d Devon sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps.  But we could always do something about it.  Thing is, maybe I\u2019m Beatrice\u2019s aunt.  Name's Zha Zha.  And maybe I taught her a thing or two about making those formulas...  So maybe I  have a bit more, so somebody could be in a more, ah, influential position,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon nodded vaguely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran barely managed to hang onto the fur of Beatrice\u2019s shoulder as she tore around and through the city.

But know what?  Being giant and naked has made me pretty horny.  And let me let you in on a little secret: cars make terrible dildos.  So cold and metallic.

With little resistance, he pushed through, forming a large hole in the side that he was able to step through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to his left, he found the part of the building where the locker room was, the roof of which only came up to his waist now. \"Oh, Devon!\" he called out, as dropped to his knees and lifted up against the corner, trying to pull the roof off but causing it to mostly crumble to pieces in his hands. Nevertheless, after a bit of effort, he made enough of a hole to look down into the locker room, where most of the rest of the team still was, now looking up at the looming tiger grinning over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKieran ignored them, though, looking for and quickly finding his target in the showers.

Beatrix was a black and white holstein cow woman, heavyset in body shape but with spiky purple hair and makeup one would expect from an eighties band. The goth cow girl stomps down the hallway of the high school as her udder hangs loose between her skin tight black skirt and pierced navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrix was mad because her boyfriend, that two timing bull Anton cheated on her with one of her classmates. The cow woman wanted revenge on the bull that betrayed her, but first she had to get to the science lab, she was working with her lab partner for the project, that nerdy black cat girl Dawn. Beatrix lets out a sigh. \"Just forget about Anton. Forget about that traitor. Can't let Dawn see me angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrix opens the door to the science lab and finds her black cat friend adjusting her glasses as she works on a weird remote. \"Hey Beatrix.

I'd like that bull to get his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn shakes her head. \"Forget about him Beatrix.

I intend to use it on fish and fruit to make food more abundant.\" \"So Ms. Genius,\" says Beatrix. \"Now that you went ahead and put the thing together, what am I supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn looks up at Beatrix and holds out the remote towards the goth cow girl and Beatrix drops her jaw. \"Bad idea Dawn.

Pretty soon, Beatrix is twice as tall as before. Dawn smiles proudly, her invention a success but then it begins to smoke and Beatrix is still growing. \"Uh-oh.\" Says the cat girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrix moos loudly as she continues to grow and the ceiling above her begins to crack and finally break.

I shouldn\u2019t have.  I was just so angry with how you\u2019ve treated me in the past.  I wanted to give you a taste of your own medicine, make you feel small and helpless, like you\u2019d done to me.

How big AM I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the formula clearly inverted the process of size-changing.  So it was supposed to shrink you down to four inches tall.

You\u2019re strong, popular\u2026 handsome\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t bear the fact that you treated me so badly,\u201d he trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt had no idea how to respond.  First, he\u2019d been grown into some kind of huge giant.  Then a mink that he\u2019d devoted countless hours to torturing had confessed some sort of weird fandom-attraction to him.  To be perfectly honest, he didn\u2019t even really know why he\u2019d bullied Earl so much.  As much as he wanted to be angry and furious, Kurt couldn\u2019t help but feel scared and confused at his whole situation.  Maybe Earl could help him get back to normal.  All he wanted to do was return to normal.  He couldn\u2019t win state championships if he could fit his entire team in the palm of his hand.  <i>Okay, enough navel-gazing</i>, Kurt told himself. <i>You\u2019re supposed to be mean, right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl gasped slightly as Kurt\u2019s fingers wrapped around his torso, lifting him off the ground. \u201cAlright, mink.

The brick and cement gave way with surprising ease.  Sheltering the mink in his fist with his free hand, the raccoon stood up to his full height.  He gasped audibly as he stepped out of the locker room.  He dwarfed even the tallest building in the school. \u201cDamn, I\u2019m big,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could say that,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, which way to the golf course?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust head over that little hill and go straight down the little lane until you come to a stand of trees.

Walking as silently as he could, he still felt as if everyone was hiding behind their drapes, watching him.  The raccoon held Earl close to his chest so that the mink couldn\u2019t try to look at his butt or something.  Eventually, after what seemed like hours, Kurt made it to the golf course.  Sitting down cross-legged on the green, he set Earl on his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.  So we\u2019re here.

If you need anything, just tap on the upper left-hand window,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Kurt said as Earl slipped off his knee.  The mink cast one more sidelong glance at the giant and then walked quickly towards his home, pulling out his keys as he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Earl?\u201d Kurt called softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mink spun on his heels. \u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt said\u2026</span></div></div>",

You didn't call me anything that every other guy on the football team hadn't called me a hundred times over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon thought for a moment. \"Still, that doesn't make what I did right.\" He laid down on his stomach, resting his head on top of his now-crossed arms and bringing his snout right in front of the mink's body. \"Listen, get me back to normal, and I promise things will be different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl's face lit up as he looked into the huge brown eyes in front of him. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I can make those knuckleheads on the team listen to me, even if my little toe isn't the size of a tackling dummy.\" Kurt stuck out a giant paw, extending a finger to the mink. \"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then!\" The mink grabbed the finger with both of his hands and shook it as hard as he could, nearly falling over with the amount of effort he put into it. Stepping back, he grinned at the giant in front of him. He blushed, the red skin becoming visible through his white fur. \"You know, Kurt, this is the first time you've smiled since you've become a giant. I don't wanna make you uncomfortable or anything, but let's just say you should do it more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt hadn't even noticed that he was smiling. He attempted to stop, trying to put on a more neutral expression on his face, but the entire situation today was just too ludicrous for him not to find it at least a little amusing. \"Hey,\" he chuckled as Earl began to walk back towards the small forest that separated the golf course from the yellow house, \"just promise me you won't, like, think of me while you beat off tonight, or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mink winked back at him. \"No promises, big guy.\" Whistling to himself, he disappeared into the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt sighed, rolling on his back and looking up at the night sky. It certainly didn't seem any smaller now than when he was at his normal size. He closed his eyes, trying to clear his mind, but even with his eyes closed, he kept replaying scenes from the day over and over in his head: his bursting out of the locker room, walking naked through the streets\u2026 and Earl. The mink had half a dozen chances to run away during the whole ordeal, but he had stayed with the growing raccoon even though it risked his safety and life. \"The guy has courage, I'll give him that,\" Kurt said aloud, to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis large body tossed and turned. He hadn't slept outside like this in years, since he was camping as a kit, and the ground wasn't doing him any favors. But another overwhelming feeling had come across him, one he hadn't expected to feel, well, really <i>ever</i> in high school: loneliness. He wished there was someone he could share the night with, even if that just meant sleeping silently while pressed up against his fur. The feeling of being so different, so isolated\u2026 he hated it. A thought dawned on him. \"This must be what Earl feels like every day in school. Damn, I've been such an ass to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a branch breaking in the forested area nearby interrupted his thoughts. Turning his head quickly, Kurt's heart skipped a beat as he saw a figure coming his way. His eyes adjusting to the darkness, he soon realized that the figure was...</span></div></div>",

I thought you were... I dunno, security or something,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, it's me.  Trust me.  Nobody ever comes here ever anymore.  For all that matters, this could be a bazillion miles away from civilization.  I dunno, golf must not be 'cool' anymore or something,\" Earl replied, unfurling the sleeping bag. \"And why am I here?  Eh, I decided that if I was going to 'beat off', as you so eloquently put it I might as well have a visual aid,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt thought he saw the little mink wink cheekily.  He certainly hoped that Earl was joking.  <i>He probably was.  I'm just being paranoid</i> Kurt shook his head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you don't mind, do you?  I can go back to my house if I'm bothering you,\" Earl shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  No, don't,\" Kurt hastily replied.  Realizing that he was sounding a bit too eager, he nonchalantly added, \"I mean, it doesn't bother me too much, I suppose,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  I didn't want to drag this crap all the way back,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant raccoon rolled onto his side as Earl slid into his sleeping bag.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I didn't have a bag that would fit you,\" Earl chuckled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd certainly like to see the sleeping bag that I could fit into,\" Kurt snorted. \"That would be the day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, ah, I haven't had a sleep-over in awhile now.  Are we supposed to play truth-or-dare or something now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're at a <i>chick</i> sleep-over, dude.  Right now, I'm pretty beat.  Let's just catch some Z's for now,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've definitely got a point there.  I'm exhausted,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl was asleep almost the same time his head hit the pillow.  Kurt watched him silently for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, little guy,\" he whispered softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl snored in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt shook his head slightly again.  Earl had really gone out of his way to help him again.  Why help out an over-sized douche-bag like him?  He'd done nothing but make Earl's life miserable for years, and yet the mink came to him in a time of need and kept being kind to him.  Kurt couldn't help but smile as he thought about this kindness.  Earl really was a great guy.  He just hadn't really given any sort of effort to getting to know the mink.  Perhaps he should have.  But right now, it just felt nice not to be alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt noticed Earl shiver slightly in his thin sleeping bag.  It was a pretty chilly night, after all.  Perhaps he could help a bit.  It was the least he could do.  Gently lifting Earl into his palm, Kurt rolled back onto his back, setting the little mink down gently in the dense fur on his pectoral.  Stretching out, he closed his eyes, drifting off to sleep with a smile on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight streaming through the trees on the edge of the golf course brought Kurt gently back from sleep.  Sitting up, he stretched, patting his chest absent-mindedly.  Wait a minute.  Where was Earl?  Panicked, Kurt searched around his person and surroundings.  Had he rolled over in the night and crushed the poor mink?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeart beating quickly, Kurt looked towards Earl's home.  He breathed a sigh of relief as he saw the mink heading towards him.  Earl...</span></div></div>",

Lunch the previous day had been his last meal, and growing to a dozen stories tall hadn't exactly been efficient on the calorie-burning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez, don\u2019t worry.

I haven't heard from him much since he moved away.  And what I <i>have</i> heard wasn't good,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt cut Earl off.  \"Wait.  Blake?  As in Blake Caldwell?  My old teammate?  No fucking way,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl nodded.  \"Way.  We've been dating for awhile.  But we had to keep it quiet because his dad wouldn't be able to abide by, well, his son's choice in who he dated, hence the shrinking formula.  One of us would get tiny and... yeah. But now that he's gone, apparently his dad is getting worse and worse.  But that's where you come in.  Maybe one of Blake's old teammates could convince the old douche to ease up, much less one who's bigger than a house,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mink's stomach churned as the massive hand of Kurt encircled his torso and lifted him up into the air. \"Hey!  Would you mind giving me a heads-up before picking me up?  It's rough on a little guy like me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Kurt mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.  Blake was always the same whenever I was small,\" Earl replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his towering height, it took Kurt several hours to make the journey to the Caldwell residence.  He had to cut through the countryside, avoiding roads and other signs of civilization as he doubted his appearance would be appreciated.  As the sun began to approach the western horizon, the giant and his companion arrived near the ramshackle ranch Blake and his father called home.

Something did look a little different about him, but Kurt couldn't quite place his finger on it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Hey\" Earl attempted a smile, but Kurt could immediately tell something was troubling him. His small ears drooped slightly, and his nose twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what's going on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitating, the mink stuck his hands in his pockets, looking down at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Earl,\" Kurt was growing impatient. \"Tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Earl sighed, looking back up at Kurt and putting away any sense of subterfuge. \"Well, actually\u2026 can't you kinda tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt tilted his head and looked at Earl questioningly. He then glanced down at his body, which seemed just like yesterday: the same muscular build, the same bushy fur, still naked\u2026 but something had changed. Was the ground that far away last night? And were the trees only ankle-high yesterday?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! Have I gotten even bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl nodded, almost cowering in fear of retribution. \"Yeah. Quite a bit, actually. You're almost two hundred feet tall now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Kurt's heart started beating faster, his blood boiling. \"What did you do? You were supposed to fix this, not make it worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl shrugged. \"I didn't do anything! At least last night. I think the formula I gave you yesterday must still be working in your blood stream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt brought his paw up to his face, closing his eyes and shaking his head. Things certainly were not going the way he'd hoped. He quickly laid back down, his back slamming against the ground in frustration, causing Earl to lose his footing and fall down on his butt. Kurt thought about picking the mink up, squeezing and shaking him until an antidote popped out of his little head. <i>No</i>, he thought, taking deeper breaths and calming himself down, <i>that's not fair. Earl truly is trying to help. Sure, he may have made one mistake yesterday, but he's done more than try to make up for it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes again and tilted his head back up, seeing the mink's downturned face as he sat on the greens, chin on his paws. He wasn't crying, exactly, but there was certainly a depression setting in. Kurt wasn't one to usually empathize with others, especially nerdy fags, but Earl had become something more-- a friend, Kurt realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, little man,\" Kurt said, picking the mink up by the shirt collar and gently setting him on his chest, near the same spot where he had placed him to sleep last night, \"don't beat yourself up about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" Earl protested, \"I'm the one who screwed up! You're in this whole mess because of my mistake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt took another deep breath. \"So? We all make mistakes. Do you think I'm always perfect out on the field?\" He laughed, shaking his head. \"I'd like to think so, but Coach Westin could probably point out things I do wrong every single play. Besides, I wouldn't have even come in contact with your formula if I hadn't been so willing to accept Coach's stupid energy boost salve. In a way, this is kinda his fault\u2026 and I guess a little mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl smiled weakly, his shoulders still sagging. \"I guess\u2026 but what if I can't get you back to normal size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're a complete nerd with all this biology and chemistry crap. I know you'll be able to figure it out. And besides,\" a playful grin formed across Kurt's face as he took a finger and lightly mussed Earl's headfur with it, \"if you can't, I guess I can learn to live this way. There's worse things than being a 200-foot-tall behemoth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl chuckled as he tried to smooth out his hair. \"Or bigger. If the formula's doing what I think it's doing, we might not be seeing the end of your growth for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Kurt plucked Earl up in his paw and stood up to his towering full height. \"All the more reason to get started fixing it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl nodded and smiled, his ears now perked back up. \"Okay. Then we should probably head over to\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

I kinda assumed you had some super-nerd supplier or something,\" Kurt shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a super-nerd supplier of sorts, but you have to have a teaching certificate to buy anything from it,\" Earl laughed.

Nobody's gonna be at school, and most of the neighborhood will be in more interesting places than suburbia,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the attitude!\" Earl beamed. \"Er, want me to go and get a bunch of bedsheets from the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt raised an eyebrow. \"Why would I need that,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know, to make a... loincloth or whatever,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant raccoon hesitated.  He grinned mischievously. \"Nah, I'll pass, thanks.  I figure being 200 feet tall at the very least entitles me to wander around in the buff.  Besides, it'll give you a little eye-candy; impetus to get your tail in and out with the stuff quickly,\" Kurt swished his tail slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl tried to hide a look of excitement, but failed miserably. \"Suit yourself, big guy,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt blushed slightly as he left the golf course for the school and hopefully the solution to his problems.  What had gotten into him?  He'd beaten the shit out of this little mink not even a week ago.  Now he was teasing him and walking around with him in his birthday suit.  Wait, was he flirting with him?  Did that count as flirting?  <i>Stop flipping out about this, dude.  Focus on getting back to the school so you can stop being twenty stories tall,</i> Kurt snapped silently at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the chem lab is around the back of the school,\" Earl called up from Kurt's palm. \"I figure if you go from the big hill behind the sports fields and then hide there, you should go undetected,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good plan,\" Kurt replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAltering course slightly, Kurt strode up the \"tall\" hill in two strides.  He dropped to his knees and, curling Earl gently in a fist, began to commando-crawl towards the science hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is harder than it looks,\" Kurt grunted slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing great.  Not too far.  And I'll be like ten minutes, tops,\" Earl encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the window of the chemistry stockroom, Kurt tapped it with a single nail, shattering the glass effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're through, tiny.

It was really great to see that he cared so much about fixing the problem.  But at the same time, wasn't it taking awhile?  Kurt perked up as Earl approached the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got the goods?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Earl began hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound good,\" Kurt sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See,\" Earl sighed, \"Problem is...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What would happen?\" Kurt asked, scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl leaned on the windowsill, his chin resting on his paws. \"There would be no way for us to control how much or how fast the formula would work.

You might even get down to microscopic levels, which would make it a lot harder for me to make you big again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, just great,\" Kurt muttered. \"So my choices are either be a big and continuously growing giant, or basically disappear out of existence?\" Rolling onto his back, he covered his eyes with his arm, sighing in frustration. \"I sure wish you had planned this out better, Earl. Or that you hadn't planned it out at all,\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mink's ears drooped, and he hopped over the window sill out of the building still carrying the other supplies he had managed to gather from the school. \"Hey, listen. I'm sorry things got so out of hand. I was an idiot; you can beat the shit out of me for screwing up if you want, though I'd prefer if you waited until you got back to normal size to do so.\" He walked up to the right side of Kurt's face, shifted the supplies to one arm, and softly placed a paw on the raccoon's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt felt the mink's touch, not reacting to it one way or another, still a little upset. \"What if I can't get back, though?

I doubt that they'd be able to sack you, even if they sent all eleven guys at ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Kurt said as he brought his arm back down to his side, being careful to avoid the tiny mink, \"but I'm guessing the refs might not let me play quarterback if I can't fit my paws on the field.\" Still lying down, Kurt turned his head to look at Earl. \"Wait a minute. You know football?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" Earl shrugged. \"I'm more into soccer, actually. But I've picked up the ins and outs of football from watching you each week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each week?\" Kurt sat up, scrunching his nose. \"You come to all the games?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home and away,\" Earl nodded eagerly. \"And most of the practices, too. I told ya, big guy, I idolize you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt remained silent, not sure if he should be creeped out or flattered. Even all of the (many) girls he had gone out with didn't bother to learn anything about football while they dated him, or go to all of his games. If he hadn't spent the last 24 hours getting to know this mink better, he probably would've been freaked out by this. But something about Earl's attraction and infatuation seemed genuine, seemed admirable, seemed almost\u2026sweet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStop thinking about the stupid mink, Kurt thought to himself. Quickly shaking his head to try and clear his thoughts, the giant raccoon rose to his full height of two hundred feet, picking up Earl in his hand as he did so, bringing him up to his face. \"Okay, let's get focused back on what we're gonna do to get me game-eligible-size again. If the school doesn't have this magne-- magnesia--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magnesium sulfate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Whatever. If there's none here, then where can we get some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl shook his head. \"There's no place I can get it pure without a certificate, unless I'm willing to go through shady internet sites and wait six to eight weeks for delivery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which you're not,\" Kurt said as he tapped his footpaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. But\u2026 magnesium sulfate is the main component in Epsom salts. Any drug store should have that. We'd have to distillate though to get it the compound in its anhydrous state, and it might not work quite the same\u2026 if at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt took a moment to ponder this option. \"Well, if it's all we've got, then--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is\u2026\" Earl interrupted but then stopped, hesitating. \"There is something else we could do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl sighed. \"Well\u2026 I didn't exactly come up with this formula myself. I kinda 'borrowed' it from my ex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ex?\" Kurt's eyes went wide in shock. Though he and the rest of the school knew the mink was gay since freshmen year, he had never seen Earl with anyone other than a couple of nerdy girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Big surprise, I know, I was actually able to get someone to date me without turning them into a giant first. Whoopee.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt ignored the last part of this comment, a curiosity now burning inside him. \"Who was the guy? Someone from school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of. He left two years ago; that's why we had to break up. He was definitely a huge closet case, though. You probably know him, actually; he played on the football team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon's jaw dropped. A gay guy on his team? Not possible. \"What? Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake Cadwell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake?!!!\" The image of a tall, dark-furred, athletically-built wolverine instantly came to Kurt's mind. He knew Blake well; they had each started on the team as freshmen. Blake played wideout and quickly became one of Kurt's favorite targets, the two of them seeming to  always be on the same page. They both earned a permeant starter spot during the second game of sophomore year, a huge upset over heavily favored St. Lamskin, where Kurt hit Blake for three touchdowns through the air and pitched to him for one more on the ground. He vividly remembered how disappointed - actually, maybe even depressed - he had been when junior year started and he found that Blake's family had abruptly moved two counties over, taking the wolverine away for good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way Blake would've gone out with you,\" Kurt said, shaking his head in disbelief. \"He's not a -- a fag, or gay, or whatever you want me to say. I'm sure. Positive.\" As Kurt thought about it, though, he could never recall Blake talking dirty about girls the way the rest of the guys on the team did, and even though he distinctly remembered Blake having a girlfriend, a short, attractive lemur whose name didn't spring to mind, now that Kurt thought about it he couldn't recall anytime when the couple shared any physical contact more intimate than hand-holding. Could Blake really be\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt snapped back from his thoughts, noticing that the mink was looking up at him, a little perturbed. \"Believe what you want to believe. But we can travel two counties over and try to find Blake, then you can ask him yourself. And I know for a fact that he has all the chemicals to make this compound stashed away in his bedroom. We would always make it ourselves and then one of us (usually me) would use it, shrinking down to four or five inches tall. It was a nice enough way to have some fun while still being able to hide the other if someone came in on us. Point is, we can probably sweet talk him into giving us some magnesium sulfate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let me think this over for a moment.\" Kurt mulled over his options, trying to put his emotions and confusion aside for now and focus in on what would make the most sense and would have the greatest chance of success. It only took him a minute to make up his mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Let's just take our chances with the drug store.  I've seen the packages my mom uses and that epsom stuff definitely has the magnesiwhatever in it.  And you should be able to get it out of the salt if you're half as smart as everyone says, right?\" Kurt shrugged, starting to walk away from the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Earl replied, his tone somewhat snappy. \"You just don't want to have to deal with facing Blake.  You don't want to have to imagine the wolverine that you worked so hard with being anything but perfectly straight,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not at all what I was thinking!\" Kurt protested. \"Even as large as I am, it would take forever to walk two across two whole counties.  And if anyone saw my gigantic, naked ass?  They'd sic the army on me or something!  And I don't want to end up in that situation.  The drug store is much safer.  It's in the middle of nowhere.  I can walk nearby, drop you off, you can just go in and buy some of that shit, and we can be on our way,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.  Whatever,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as he spoke, the giant kicked himself inwardly for making his worries so obvious.  Maybe he was afraid of talking with Blake, whom he'd spent countless hours sweating and straining with on the football field, and finding out that he was actually gay.  He didn't even want to think about him playing with a tiny little Earl, doing... well, anything with him.  He was a bit disturbed and confused about this news.  Was he a little jealous, too?  Couldn't be.  No.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, there, big guy.  You nearly passed the drug store, there,\" Earl called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Sorry 'bout that,\" Kurt mumbled, his head returning to the present.  He set the mink down on the concrete. \"Look, I'll wait for you in that stand of trees over there across the road,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt sat down in the grove, his head spinning.  So much was happening to him all at once.  It was more than one guy could take, no matter how big he happened to be.  <i>Can't keep dwelling on this</i>, Kurt told himself.  <i>You gotta get your mind off all this crap, dude.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing quite cleared his mind like exercise, so Kurt rolled over and started to do push-ups.  When they didn't do enough, the massive raccoon shifted onto his back, trying to get in as many crunches as possible.  Hearing a branch snap nearby, Kurt sat bolt upright, looking around.  He shook his head slightly, grinning a bit as he saw the little mink standing at the edge of the clearing, holding a plastic bag and trying to hide the silly grin plastered across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get outta here,\" Kurt sighed, picking Earl up again and heading back towards the golf course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you saved yourself a long trip, big guy.  Because this stuff'll be perfect for what I need.  Just great,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kurt?  I'm sorry if I was a little pissy earlier.  I didn't mean to act like that.  It just kinda... spilled out,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother yourself about that.  Maybe you were right, a bit.  I don't really know.  It's just, so much has been going on that I don't know how much I can absorb at once,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Earl said as Kurt set him back down on the golf greens, sitting down heavily beside the mink. \"Hey, I can start working on this right now, but I'm kinda nabby.  I'd imagine you are, too.  Want me to scrounge us up something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would I ever.  I'm starving,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt shrugged slightly as the mink hurried off towards his house.  Minutes later, he returned, laden down with various bags and packages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness my folks buy in bulk.  I just grabbed a bunch of random stuff.  I don't know how filling it will all be, but at least it's something,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt chowed down, opening packages with a flick of the finger and tossing their contents into his open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Earl,\" Kurt said suddenly, a note of concern on his face,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Are you sure?\" the mink asked. Kurt noticed that Earl's face seemed a bit confused but hopeful at the same time. \"I mean, this stuff from the drug store should work; we probably don't need to ask him for supplies or anything. You know, if you still think you'll be too uncomfortable picturing me and him together,\" he added with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" The raccoon's face went flush. \"I mean, I don't care about that. I just think it'd be a good idea to have a backup plan, in case something goes wrong. And besides, it'll be good to catch up with Blake, see what he's been doing for the past year and a half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mink wryly smiled as he popped open a soda can. \"What changed your mind? Why were you so adamant about not going earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you! It's too risky to travel that far in the daytime. Once it's dark, there'll be less of a chance for anyone to see me. We'll be safer.\" The mink tilted his head but finally nodded, seemingly satisfied with that answer for now, and Kurt breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last of the food disappeared into Kurt's mouth, he felt a rumbling coming from his gut, which still hungered for more and knew it wasn't going to be getting anything. Trying to quiet the growling, the raccoon lay down on his stomach, its roars muffled by the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, little man, what say we get to work on that magnesium stuff. What do we need to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" the mink brought his paw up to his chin in thought, \"I have all the equipment I need to distill and mix the formula back in my room. I can go home and make it there, then bring it back to you. Should only take me an hour or so. Tops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" The raccoon's ears drooped slightly. \"Well... okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, big guy?\" Earl looked up at Kurt's massive muzzle looming over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...\" Kurt did his best to avoid eye contact with the mink. \"Just an hour alone is kinda a long time. Do you think there's any chance you could bring the stuff you need here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of surprise turned into a smile on Earl's face. \"Sure. It might take me a couple of trips, but I'll go and get everything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mink darted off towards his house, and Kurt stayed flat on the ground, cursing himself silently. Why did he have to suddenly be so needy? He never had a problem spending large chunks of time by himself before. And it's not like if anything happened he wouldn't be able to handle it at his massive size. Maybe he just wanted to spend more time with the mink....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, stop thinking those thoughts, Kurt thought. Earl is a nice guy, and he's been a great help in this situation, but he was just that. An acquaintance, someone who could get him back to normal, perhaps even, in time, a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his eyes, he saw the image of a tiny Earl crawling over Blake's naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" Kurt sat up and slapped his head with his paw. Being so big for so long was screwing up his mind. He needed to just get home and have a good night's sleep in his own bed, at a normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Earl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Motherf--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" the mink's voice hissed as he appeared from the trees. \"Keep your voice down. I could hear you all the way from my backyard.\" Kurt stared at the little mink as he skitted to a stop by his right footpaw, throwing down a heavy-looking (for Earl, anyway) backpack that landed on the ground with a loud THUD, the sound of metal clanking inside it. \"I managed to get everything in one trip,\" he said, pulling out and snapping on a pair of safety goggles. \"Shouldn't take too long to get set up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Earl with his lab equipment reminded Kurt of watching an all-star halfback weave through linemen, dodge linebackers, and hurdle over safeties, culminating in a ninety-yard-run to the end zone. A combination of wonder and disbelief gradually filled the large raccoon's mind as Earl continued to work. The mink knew exactly what he was doing, his paws nearly a blur as he quickly moved back and forth between a flask with the salts inside heated by a bunsen burner, half-a-dozen test tubes each holding their own liquids of various colors, and a largish beaker that all of the materials eventually found their way into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fifty minutes, he held up the main beaker to the light, swirling it around and examining the liquid sloshing inside. \"Well?\" Kurt asked, trying to hide the impatience in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's about as good as it's gonna get,\" Earl said, placing the beaker in the giant's outstretched paw. \"There's nowhere near enough to rub into your skin like before, so just go ahead and ingest it; the effect should still be pretty much what we're going for.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt brought the beaker to his face. It seemed tinier than a pea to the massive raccoon, too small for him to pickup between his thumb and forefinger without crushing it, so he just brought his palm up to his muzzle and dumped the entire thing in, formula, glass, and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, Kurt,\" Earl muttered, \"just great. Go ahead and eat away the rest of my equipment while you're at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Kurt shrugged, \"if you wanted to hang on to it you should have just hopped on and dumped it into my mouth yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl shook his head and grinned. \"Whatever. So how do you feel? Any different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.\" Kurt sat on the ground and tapped his fingers on the ground for several minutes, waiting to see if any changes were in store for him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You might have actually grown a couple of feet,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, fuck, damn it!\" Kurt fumed, pounding his fist on the ground a few feet away from the little mink, who jumped back in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!  I'm so sorry!\" Earl almost pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay, I suppose,\" Kurt leaned down to comfort his tiny friend. \"I know you're kinda punting here.  It's not really your fault,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" Earl's voice broke and he sat down heavily, burying his face in his hands. \"This whole thing is my fault.  If I hadn't decided to shrink you, you wouldn't be stuck like this.  I hate myself,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon scooped Earl up, bringing him to his face. \"Don't.  Look, maybe this wasn't the best idea.  But if you hadn't done this, well, I wouldn't have met you.  And, in hindsight, that would be something I would never stop regretting.  Besides, this couldn't be totally bad for you.  You <i>did</i> get the quarterback naked in your backyard, I guess,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl looked up, blinking away a stray tear. \"You--you're so hot,\" he spluttered. \"You're muscular... and you've got a nice ass,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt blushed slightly. \"So I've been told.  Look, I know you're sad, but let's put that aside for now.  We need to get me fixed,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right about that, big guy,\" Earl beamed. \"I guess the Epsom salts must not have been pure enough to do the trick.  So we'll need to get concentrated, pure stuff,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we know just where to get that,\" Kurt got to his feet. \"Let's head out, tiny.  I need to get my tail outta here,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know which way it is to Blake's, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I helped him move out there.  And now that I'm huge, I can just cut cross-country.  Shorten the trip up,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt walked in silence for awhile, holding Earl cradled in his palm.  It was pleasantly cool out and perfectly dark out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, little guy, what do you want to do?\" Kurt asked eventually. \"Want to talk about our feelings or something?  Isn't that what you homos do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, only if we're super bored, I suppose.  But I don't know if I can speak for the whole population,\" Earl replied. \"Want to play truth or dare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure,\" Kurt sighed. \"I'll start.  So, little guy, truth or dare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth,\" the mink replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... uh... how many times have you had sex?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just once, I suppose,\" Earl shrugged. \"You didn't ask for details so I don't have to tell you anything.  Ha.  Now it's your turn,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, I'll take a dare,\" Kurt said hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd asked you to go streaking, but you're already doing that.  So... ah... I dare you to crush that Mac truck over there like a soda can,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt stopped momentarily, looking down at the truck in question.  He was passing by a rest area, which was mostly deserted save for the single vehicle.  The driver, a hefty buffalo, was sprawled several dozen yards away from his truck, snoring like thunder.  Chuckling slightly, the giant leaned down and picked up the truck.  Hefting it in his palm, Kurt wrapped his fingers around the body of the vehicle and squeezed.  The metal crunched and the vehicle crushed effortlessly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy, little dude?\" Kurt said, dropping the truck to the ground as he strode off. \"Alright,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take a dare,\" Earl grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, mini-man.  I can't be the only one wandering around butt-naked.  Strip,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl hesitated.  \"Fine,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon held back a mischievous grin as the little mink in his palm slowly removed his clothing.  Earl shook his head slightly as he dropped his garments over the edge of the giant's hand. \"Happy now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn.  Nerd has a body,\" Kurt raised an eyebrow as he lifted Earl a bit closer to appraise the mink's surprisingly toned body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try,\" Earl shrugged. \"But now it's my turn.  Revenge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hit me up with a truth,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Earl looked positively gleeful. \"What is your deepest, darkest secret?  Just between you and me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Kurt spluttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, big guy.  It wouldn't be a secret if it was easy to spit out,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.

I mean, I know I wasn't too crazy about it to start with, but it's kind of... grown on me, I guess.\" He stopped, realizing what he had just said, and shook his head in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl ignored the dumb pun, however, and seemed to be lost in thought. \"Well,\" he eventually said, \"this makes things interesting, now, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting?\" Kurt blinked. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mink looked up from the raccoon's palm, a spark of an idea visible in his eye. \"You say you like being a giant. You've already shown your tendency to destruction. We could -- Oh, forget it.\" Earl turned away, hanging his feet over the edge of Kurt's hand and looking off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kurt asked, slightly indignant. \"You can't just say something like that and then stop.\" He took a finger and poked Earl in the side as gently as he could, a force that still nearly knocked the mink on his side. \"C'mon, out with it, little man. Consider it your turn to tell a truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Earl sighed as he stood up. \"But before I say anything, I'm gonna warn you that it's a really bad idea and we shouldn't even consider actually doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okaaaaay.\" The suspicious, or perhaps mischievous, way Earl was behaving intrigued Kurt. \"What is it? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's nothing big. Or, rather, I guess it is something big but nothing complicated.\" Earl toed the ground (well, the surface of Kurt's palm), obviously stalling. Finally, he sighed, saying, \"I just got this picture in my mind of a certain two-hundred foot raccoon I know going on a sort of, shall we say, rampage, crushing cars and buildings, that sort of thing. You know, monster-movie style. I kinda liked it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt's felt his heart skip a beat. He'd never pictured Earl having a dark side like this before. Then again, before the past couple of days, he'd never really known much of anything about the mink. Still, as he thought about it, Kurt couldn't help but like the mink's suggestion. He had felt an unusual, hard-to-explain rush when he crushed the truck back at the rest stop. The idea of having enough power to destroy a city or a town or whatever definitely held a certain appeal. And the fact that Earl seemed to want him to do it, at least inwardly... well, that made the idea appear even better, for some reason he wasn't entirely sure of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking up his mind, Kurt stopped for a moment, getting his bearings and plotting his course. After a few seconds, he started moving again, but had shifted his direction ninety degrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl picked up on this change in route right away. \"Hey! What are you doing? Where are we going now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt smiled, looking down at the little mink as he continued to walk. \"I just have something I want to show you,\" he said as he winked slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl's eyes bulged as he realized what the giant raccoon was up to. \"No! No way! I told you that we shouldn't even consider it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Kurt reassured Earl. \"I have a plan.\" He continued walking, taking long strides through the countryside, before eventually arriving at...</span></div></div>",

This place basically WAS my childhood.  So many good times.  Too bad they shut it down,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, can't say as I've ever been here before,\" Earl shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame me if your childhood sucked,\" Kurt teased.  He dropped Earl gently onto his shoulder. \"Hang on tight, tiny.  I've got some steam to let off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twenty-story raccoon swaggered down the midway, flattening booths into matchwood underneath each thunderous footfall.    While the truck had been fun, it was time to test out his full Kurtzilla potential.  Gaining momentum, the massive quarterback plowed clear through the log flume ride, rendering the ride unrecognizable in a matter of seconds.  He let out a laugh as he admired his handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStooping down in front of the gondola pendulum ride, Kurt poked at the little \"boat.\"  As it swung back and forth, the giant kept at it, poking at the gondola over and over until it was swinging in complete circles around its axis.  With a snap, the gondola broke off its axis, crashing to the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt stood up to his full height, striding over towards the Ferris wheel.  Though it was the tallest structure in the park, it only came up to his waist.  Leaning over, the coon tore the wheel off its axis, raising it over his head.  He let out a grunt as he hurled it as far as he possibly good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl let out an ecstatic whoop, clinging onto a tuft of the giant's fur for dear life.  He'd always idolized Kurt, studying his every movement and mannerism almost to the point of creepiness.  But now that his idol was gigantic and, well, stark naked, the experience was enhanced so much more.  The ease with which Kurt was leveling the theme park was incredible and more than a little sexy.  Maybe the mistake of turning Kurt into a giant really had its silver lining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl's reverie was brutally interrupted as a jarring shock coursed through his entire body.  Looking around, Earl saw that Kurt was on one knee, gasping with pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Kurt?\" Earl asked, crawling closer to the giant's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt...</span></div></div>",

When he looked down, he saw blood welling though the fingers he had pressed down on the wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, that looks bad,\" Earl gasped, sliding down the massive raccoon's arm to land beside his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Captain Obvious,\" Kurt grunted. \"Any ideas for how to fix this?  I think I'm a bit big for stitches,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl paced a bit on the giant's thigh, thinking frantically. \"Tie that banner thing over the wound.  I'll see what I can do from there,\" he finally said, pointing at a length of cloth proclaiming some ride or another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Kurt tore the banner off the posts, tying it firmly around his thigh.

He hesitated slightly, then picked Earl up off his leg. \"Y'know,\" he said at length. \"Thanks for being honest with me.  This whole time, I mean,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Earl asked. \"I've made a fool of myself so many times the past day or so,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Really.

Really?\" Kurt raised an eyebrow. \"I always used to go up here to, uh, do stuff.  Nobody lives here.  Far as I could tell, it was one of those sites for testing nukes back awhile ago.  But it's really nice and well-preserved and everything.  I figured I could 'do my thing' here.  All the fun of rampaging, but none of the guilt or accountability later,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow,\" Earl replied. \"But are you sure this is a good idea?  I mean, this is a military site, if everything you said is true.  Might not be the smartest thing to do,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lighten up, little guy!  Nobody's been here in years.  Decades, probably.  Just let me have my fun,\" Kurt chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're right,\" Earl said, but his tone suggested otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaming, Kurt set Earl down on the hill that overlooked the town.  Getting to his feet, the giant cracked his knuckles, trying to figure out just how he would tackle this town.  Literally.  It was a pretty respectable hamlet, considering it had been built for the express purpose of nuking it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm doing it a favor, really,</i> Kurt thought.  <i>It was built to be destroyed and that's just what I'll be doing to it,</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Kurt!\" Earl jeered from his vantage point. \"This place isn't gonna smash itself!  Just have some fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning to himself, Kurt shook his head slightly.  Clearing his throat, he let out a cartoonish roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM KURTZILLA!\" he boomed theatrically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo cars parked in a front of a ranch house were smashed as an enormous foot slammed down on top of them.  Half of the home was reduced to matchwood as the giant's other foot came down through the roof.  Gaining momentum, Kurt charged down the residential street, crashing through houses like they weren't even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA self-satisfied smirk spread across Kurt's lips as he came to a stop in front of what he could only guess was the main street, his feet cracking pavement.  Dropping down onto all fours, the giant crawled down main street, systematically flattening the shops and buildings as he went.  Brick and mortar crumbled and glass shattered.  So much for an idyllic '50s town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuilding after building fell under the massive raccoon\u2019s onslaught.  Kurt laughed aloud as yet another building crumbled under his palm.  Never before had he felt so powerful, so in hare of himself and his life.  Hell, there was something downright <i>sexy</i> about destroying an entire town.  Moreso, there was something about knowing Earl was watching his every move that made everything that much more appealing to Kurt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarious wax figures were distributed around the town, but as he turned down another street, Kurt noticed a relatively large gathering of the \"townsfolk.\"  Dropping to one knee, the giant scooped the entire group up in one palm.  Determined to give Earl a good show, Kurt tossed them into the air, catching them all in his open maw.  Though the wax tasted terrible, he swallowed, sending the entire group down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning broadly, Kurt stood up to his full towering height.

Smirking broadly, Kurt swaggered through the partially-flattened town towards the little mink's vantage point.  He squatted down, reaching out to pluck Earl off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I doing so far?  Am I monstrous enough?\" Kurt grinned.  Noticing Earl's slack jaw and wide eyes, he added, \"I'll take that as a yes,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl shook his head slowly. \"Er, look over your shoulder,\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt complied and sat down heavily in shock.  On the opposite edge of the model town, and closing in fast, was an entire fleet of military vehicles: sedans and trucks and even the odd tank.  The first vehicles came to a halt between the giant's outstretched feet.  Kurt could do nothing but gape in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand down now... giant,\" a (somewhat quavering) voice belted through a megaphone attached to a sedan. \"Put down the hostage or deadly force will be used,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're friends!\" Kurt and Earl blurted in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well--well--\" Kurt could tell that confronting a twenty-story teenage raccoon wasn't probably a scenario covered in most training sessions. \"You have been destroying military property.  What do you have to say for yourself, giant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my fau--\" Earl blurted before Kurt cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you wouldn't want to get your Godzilla on if you grew to be as big as me!\" Kurt chortled. \"I decided to go somewhere I wouldn't cause any <i>real</i> damage.  Maybe I got a bit carried away,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached slowly down to pick up the car for a better vantage point, but several bullets tore through his flesh.  Apparently movement on his part wasn't appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No moving.  How did you get so big, giant?\" the voice asked.  \"And where'd your clothes go?\" it added as a sort of afterthought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl made to answer the question, but Kurt's thumb covered his muzzle.  The raccoon didn't want Earl to get into trouble.  \"Name's Kurt, little guy.  I'm a quarterback.  Took a couple pills to bulk up.  Well... I got big, but not in the way I'd intended.  And if you can find a pair of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXL boxers, lemme at 'em.  But until then, looks like my birthday suit is the only outfit I'll be wearing,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you're under arrest for destruction of property and... being enormous,\" the voice concluded. \"You and your hostage are coming to McFarren Base for questioning and court-martial,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown creased Kurt's brow, but he knew that even at his size, he probably didn't stand a chance against the firepower of those formidable-looking tanks.  Shaking his head, he conceded his compliance.  The military personnel discussed matters for a moment and then decided the coon was far too large to transport.  So the giant followed along behind several of the vehicles on all fours, carrying Earl on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcFarren Base was only a short crawl away from the testing town, and Kurt found himself and his companion ushered towards a large empty hangar on the edge of the facility.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though I don't think I would've been <i>that</i> horrible to you if you were six inches tall like I had first hoped.\" He finally stared into Kurt's eyes, a growing sense of desire filling them. Kurt could feel his own 'desire' building below his waist. \"But wait!\" the mink exclaimed as his brow furrowed. \"You're straight! I know that for a fact! I've seen you make out with over a dozen different girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm still straight,\" Kurt nodded in confirmation. \"But, uh, I'm...\" The thought sounded stupid in his head, but Kurt said it anyways.   \"I guess I'm gay for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl fell over on his ass in Kurt's paw, nearly knocked unconscious and having lost his balance.

He bucked slightly as Earl bit down gently, arching his back and letting out a low, slow groan of pleasure.  He had never experienced anything remotely like this.  It felt so amazing, so delightfully bad.  The sensations could never stop.  And yet he felt pressure building below his waist.  Fighting off the urge to help Earl finish him off, Kurt surrendered to the experience.  With a final shout, Kurt erupted like a geyser, dousing the surrounding area with the warm, sticky flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting slightly, he plucked Earl up. Lifting the exhausted mink to his face, Kurt cleaned him off with his tongue before moving in to kiss Earl on his whole body. \"Wow.  That was--wow.  That was amazing.  <i>You</i> were amazing,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you can check 'let the whole tri-county area hear you achieve orgasm' off your bucket list, right?\" Earl chuckled.  \"But we can't sit here forever, can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right about that,\" Kurt said, standing back up somewhat unsteadily. \"Blake's place isn't too far off, if I remember correctly,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the journey passed in a blissful haze for Kurt.  The next thing he knew, he was standing over the familiar tan split-level of his former football mate, Blake.</span></div></div>",

You at least got inside the wolverine's house. Lucky bastard,\" he added with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, 'Lucky',\" Earl said as Kurt plucked him from his paw and gently placed him on the ground. \"Ya know, I can't exactly expect they're going to be happy to see me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Kurt's eyes lit up in surprise. \"Did they ever catch you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's nothing like that. We were careful enough to avoid getting caught.\" The mink looked down at the ground, sighing. \"But they never really liked Kurt hanging out with me, especially his dad.

He quickly changed the subject. \"So, do you want to go about this like how we've been doing all day? You go and hide while I run up and ring the doorbell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt looked around, scratching his head. \"Uh, I don't exactly see anywhere I could disappear to.\" Plainsborough Country was known for being much flatter and sparse than the other two adjacent counties. All Kurt and Earl could see surrounding them was row after row of nearly-identical houses. No nearby tree clusters, no hills, no lakes, or anything else that would have a shot at concealing the enormous raccoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl racked his brains for an idea. \"You could go a few streets over and lie down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Kurt shook his head. \"Nah, these houses aren't that tall.

Just go up and ring the bell, and I'll be right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down cross-legged, slouching slightly and propping up his chin with his paw. Shrugging, Earl ran up to the door and hit the buzzer. A light overhead flicked on, and a few moments later, the door opened, revealing a grizzle-faced, middle-aged wolverine wearing a yellow-stained A-frame undershirt and dirty-looking, tattered lounge pants. He seemed fairly perturbed at having visitors this late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Whaddya want?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mr. Caldwell,\" Earl started, \"I don't know--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second, I recognize you. You're... Earl something-or-other, right?\" His face seemed to be getting even more annoyed, and his eyes narrowed. \"What the hell are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl didn't seem frazzled at all by the gruff tone of the wolverine. \"I'll cut to the chase. We have a sort of mini-emergency on our paws. Can we please speak with Blake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\" Mr. Caldwell asked. \"Who the fuck's we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl gestured up to the raccoon towering overhead, who waved down with a bit of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurt?!\" The wolverine nearly fell back as he saw the giant. \"What in the name of holy fuck happened to you? Where's your clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I recently decided to become a nudist,\" Kurt rolled his eyes. \"It helps relax the muscles after a workout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Mr. Caldwell,\" Earl continued, \"we really need to see your son. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Caldwell's eyebrows furrowed as he grinned menacingly. \"Bad news for you two, then. Blake's not here anymore. Probably won't ever be back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt's eyes went wide with both shock and disappointment. \"W-what happened to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like it's any of your business,\" the wolverine growled, \"but a few months ago his mother and I found some pretty disgusting shit in his room. Faggoty things. You know what I'm talking about.\" He eyed Earl suspiciously before continuing. \"I wasn't gonna allow that kinda filth under my roof, so I threw him out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl remained stoic, not seeming surprised by any of this. Kurt, however, dropped his jaw in shock, his ears sagging. \"But... he's your son!\" he protested. \"How could you kick him out on the streets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No son of mine's gonna grow up to be a goddamn dirty homo. Besides,\" Mr. Caldwell huffed as he looked up at Kurt, \"you know how football works. What do you think his teammates or coach would do if they saw that faggot crap? They'd kick the shit out of him right there on the field. Just like I should've done a long time ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys shook their head, shocked at the horrible words Mr. Caldwell had for his son. \"I can't believe Blake seemed so calm and collected at school, living with this monster,\" Kurt thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways,\" the wolverine continued, \"if you want to speak to him you'll have to go out on the streets and find him yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to slam shut the door, but Kurt quickly pressed a finger against it, nearly breaking the door off of its hinges. \"Look,\" the raccoon said, glaring at Mr. Caldwell, \"I don't care how much of a close-minded, bigoted asshole you are. Your son deserves better than what you did to him. What's more, he's got something I need to get back to normal. So I'm going to give you two choices:\"</span></div></div>",

Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because if you don't let Earl search your son's room, I'm going to tear your roof off and have a look myself,\" Kurt snapped, his brow furrowing.  To be perfectly honest, Kurt wasn't entirely certain if he could even carry out his threat.  He was big, alright, but tearing a roof off sounded pretty hard.  The threat sounded good, though, so he let it stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolverine took a few steps back, mumbling something unintelligible to himself. \"Okay, fine,\" he groused at length. \"Just don't take too long, shrimpy!  His room's up the stairs, first door on the right,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--okay,\" Earl replied, hurrying through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt sat back up, waiting impatiently for Earl to return with the necessary ingredients.  He drummed his fingers on his thigh as the grumpy old wolverine walked over to his steps, sitting down huffily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, ah, pretty nice weather we've been having,\" Kurt shrugged, trying to break the frigid silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I guess.  You could say that,\" Mr. Caldwell replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't have kicked your son out like you did,\" Kurt said slowly. \"He's a great football player and a good guy.  You should parent him, not shun him,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk about that!\" the wolverine shouted. \"I'm his father!  I do what I want!  I don't need a lecture,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  I'm just saying that being 'faggy' doesn't make or break Blake.  I wish you would see that.  He just wants a dad and a team, I'm sure.  We're a pretty accepting group, overall.  I'm sure most of the guys would understand.  You should too,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Caldwell looked like he was about to say something, but just shook his head slightly.  Almost on cue, Earl came through the front door of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any luck?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl sighed before saying,</span></div></div>",

I don't think we're ever gonna be able to find what we need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, there, big guy,\" Earl scolded as he started to climb up the side of Kurt's leg onto his knee, \"don't give up yet. We still can go try to find Blake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older wolverine snorted. \"Good luck with that. He's been gone for a few month now; he probably fled town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt tilted his head to the side a little. \"What makes you say that? Why wouldn't he have stayed close by?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Caldwell shrugged. \"He always resented us for moving during his last few years of high school. If I were to guess, I'd say he headed back where you came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl's eyes went wide. \"Really? That's ironic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great!\" Kurt slapped his head with his paw. \"I had to walk for over an hour to get here, and now you're telling me that the one person who could help me is back where I started?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolverine spat on the ground. \"How the hell should I know? If you want to find out, go back to your own town and look for him.\" He grimaced again, clearly getting more and more annoyed. Kurt fought the urge to pick him and shake him around, or put him in his mouth just to give him a scare. It was time for him and Earl to be moving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" he glared down at Mr. Caldwell, \"we're gonna go find your son. When we do, if he wants to come back home, I'm gonna bring him back. And you'll accept him back in, or I'll\u2026 I'll stomp your house flat, without checking to see whether or not you're in it first. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt only received a grunt in response, but he took that as an affirmative, and stood up, picking Earl off of his lap and holding the mink in his paw. Turning around, he started heading back in the direction he came, hearing a door slam behind him as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad he's out of our lives, for now, at least,\" the raccoon said, looking down at Earl. \"I can't believe he's such a disgusting person when Blake's such a nice guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl nodded but didn't say anything. He seemed rather quiet; unusually so, Kurt thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to feel uncomfortable, Kurt cleared his throat. \"Well,\" he continued, \"it sucks that we have to walk another hour or two back. My paws are pretty sore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" Earl said, seemingly ignoring Kurt's last comment, \"when I said I didn't find anything back there, I wasn't telling the whole truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt could feel his heart start beating a little faster. \"What? You mean you did find something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Earl nodded. \"Not what we were looking for, unfortunately, but perhaps something more\u2026 interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Confused, Kurt scratched his head a little. \"What do you mean? What did you find?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl reached into his pocket and pulled out a small vial. \"This. It was hidden away in a safe underneath the floorboards beneath Blake's bed. Luckily, he hadn't changed the combination from back before he moved out here. It's a prototype of growth formula; the same mixture that I accidentally gave you yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" At first, Kurt couldn't help but feel disappointed, but after a few moments, he sensed himself becoming excited at the thought of using it and growing again. Maybe he had gotten used to this giant thing after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After I found out he was moving,\" Earl continued, \"we promised that we would try it out together once we were able to meet up again. I think though, that under the circumstances, he wouldn't mind if\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

Just as soon as Kurt had set Earl down between his feet, a crippling wave of nausea passed through his body. He squeezed his eyes shut and gritted his teeth, just wanting the pain to be over.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as it had subsided, Kurt opened his eyes and gasped slightly. He had more than doubled in size, towering at around 450 feet in height.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquatting down and offering the now much smaller Earl a palm, Kurt laughed slightly at the ridiculousness of the whole situation.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd better hurry,\" Earl said as Kurt began to walk off again. \"It gets light in a few hours,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't think I mind anyone seeing me naked anymore,\" Kurt replied. \"I've worked so hard toning every muscle in my body just right, I deserve to show it off,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not my worry, though you are very sexy,\" Earl blushed. \"I think you'll cause a panic if you're in town when the sun comes up. A giant raccoon? There'll be public hysteria! We need to get you somewhere relatively hidden as soon as we find Blake,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a point,\" Kurt sighed. He hesitated before caressing Earl's body with his lips.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You just about swallowed me there,\" Earl complained.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just trying to kiss you, sorry...\" Kurt mumbled.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, try to be more careful with your intimacy in the future,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duly noted. Alright, if I were a homeless wolverine, where would I go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. A friend's house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he never stopped by my place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurt, think for a second. Blake probably wouldn't visit your place trying to get a bed because he think you would just laugh in his face and slam the door. He would be just another faggot,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the truth!\" Kurt shouted, stomping on a tree and causing it to crumple like a dry leaf.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt's ears drooped slightly. Maybe Earl was right. Blake had been one of his closest friends before he'd left. But would that have changed if he'd come to him seeking refuge? He wished it weren't true, but Earl probably had his likely response about summed up. Kurt felt horrible. Things are different now, Kurt thought to himself. Blake needs help. Now.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't he go to your house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly couldn't tell you. My parents are pretty open about most stuff. I think they would've understood. Maybe Blake is somewhere else,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where? \u00a0I can't just go walking through the streets--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" Earl interrupted. \"The freight yard! There's plenty of empty shipping containers by the railroad tracks. Blake could have hunkered down there,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a genius,\" Kurt said. He picked up his pace and altered his course slightly.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the pair arrived in the deserted freight yards. They split up, Earl running from boxcar to boxcar and Kurt picking them up one by one to search their contents.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake!\" Kurt heard Earl cry and dashed over to the mink, lying down on his stomach to get a better look.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mink and the wolverine were embracing each other. Their tails coiled around one another as they kissed. Kurt couldn't help but feel a twinge of jealousy as he watched in silence.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gods, Earl. I'm so scared,\" Blake gasped between kisses.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here now. It's ok. And I brought a friend,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's jaw dropped as he noticed the giant for the first time.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KURT? Holy fuck it's you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Kurt grinned sheepishly. \"Hope you don't mind if I sorta borrowed some of your growth stuff,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so long as you didn't borrow my boyfriend too,\" Blake laughed. Kurt and Earl exchanged uncomfortable looks. \"But why on earth are you so huge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story,\" Kurt and Earl said in unison. \"Can you help us fix it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Wait...\" Blake said, catching one of Kurt's sidelong glances at Earl. \"There's something you two aren't telling me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, oh gods... we had sex, Blake. I'm really sorry,\" Earl mumbled after several moments of silence. \"I'm really sorry. It just sorta happened,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the FUCK, Earl?\" Blake shouted. \"We don't see each other for a few months and you go banging the first guy you see? I thought what we had meant something. I thought I meant something,\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't that. It was just a silly dare. I'm not trying to steal--\" Kurt realized his mistake too late. Earl had his face buried in his paws and Blake looked livid.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A DARE?\" Blake bellowed. \"That's what it takes, Earl? A dare? You fucked some godsdamn giant-ass raccoon who wanted to pretend he was gay or something--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was not pretend!\" Kurt snapped. \"I wanted it. I dunno. \u00a0Maybe I'm bi or maybe he just attracts me or I don't know. None of this shit is written in stone,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so the best way to explore would naturally be to use MY boyfriend as a sex-toy,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were trying to find you. To help you. And to help me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't even get me started on you helping you,\" Blake shouted. \"Its always been about you. Kurt the football star. Kurt this, Kurt that. Well now all you're good for is the team bus so maybe that'll teach you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, boys?\" Earl cut in for the first time. \"It would appear we've got more pressing issues at the moment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt looked around to see...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thanks a lot, asshole,\u201d Blake snarled, throwing his arms in the air in disgust. \u201cNow they\u2019re gonna catch us and arrest us. They'll probably send me back to the wonderland that is my parents' house. And YOU,\" he paused for emphasis as he pointed a finger at the giant raccoon, \"they'll send YOU off to some strange lab to be examined and experimented on for the rest of your life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Kurt shook his head. \u201cNot if I have anything to do with it! Hang on, guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on?\" Earl asked. \"What do you-- OOF!\" He stopped talking as his muzzle was covered by one of Kurt's index fingers. The raccoon reached out and grabbed both Earl and Blake with one paw, lifting them up into the air, and then took off running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! What the fuck?!\" Blake cried out. \"Let me go!! Put me down!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt momentarily ignored the screaming from his wolverine passenger as he quickly stepped over the freight cars and tried to make his way out of the train-yard, trying to be as silent as possible. Unfortunately, he accidentally hit his paw against a car, knocking it over on its side, and the loud clanging sound attracted the attention of every single one of the incoming policemen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them, near a parked cruiser, turned on a spotlight that was mounted to the top of the car and shone it directly at Kurt's face, causing the raccoon to wince and shield his eyes with his free paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Kurt heard the gruff, firm voice of one of the police officers coming through some sort of megaphone, but he couldn't make out exactly who or where it was coming from. \"Put down the two civilians and slowly kneel to the ground, paws in the air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Earl sighed, having managed to work his muzzle free. \"Just great.\" He shook his head and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa,\" Kurt called out to the policemen, turning his head around quickly as he did, his vision still obscured by the bright light in his eyes. \"I'm not trying to hurt anybody. These are my friends, I promise! This is all just a huge accident.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the officer wasn't going to hear any of it. \"I'll repeat: Release the two hostages and get down to the ground. This is your last warning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait--\" Kurt tried to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men, ready your weapons!\" Kurt heard several dozen loud clicking sounds coming from near his feet. \"Fire on three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Earl,\" Kurt looked down to the mink, \"I can't see very well right now. How many policemen are there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Earl quickly counted. \"Probably about seventy or eighty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One!\" The officer's voice boomed throughout the train-yard, starting his countdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And are they all pointing their guns at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Kurt grimaced, imagining the feeling of several hundred bullets hitting his pelt all at once. \"What should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh\u2026.\" Earl's voice trailed off as he tried to rack his brain for ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea,\" Blake screamed up towards Kurt. \"How about you either put us down like he said and surrender, or get us the fuck out of here?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His massive stature likely wasn't that hard of a target to hit and he really didn't want to find out how it felt to be hit with sixty or seventy bullets at one time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cops swarmed up towards him.  Several took Blake and Earl off to one side, questioning them loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we don't know him,\" Blake snapped at the police officer. \"I was staying over at Earl's house and this big freak... kidnapped us!  We just want to get home,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true!\" Kurt shouted, but a quick gesture with the gun of a policeman shut him up.  He cast a look at Earl, trying to get the mink to say something to rectify the wolverine's story.  It was no good.  Earl's ears were drooped and he was sitting on the curb looking dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.  You two come with Officer Baker.  He'll get you home so you can have a little chat with the parents,\" the lead policeman instructed Earl and Blake.  The wolverine cast Kurt a final withering glance before turning to follow Earl and the officer back into a car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt found himself alone surrounded by police officers.  None of them were any larger than a knuckle on his finger, but the raccoon couldn't help but feel creeping dread begin to set in.  Blake was right.  He was a giant freak, doomed to a life of experimentation in some sunless cell, isolated from everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's how we're going to do this,\" the officer instructed curtly. \"You will follow the police vehicles at a distance of 100 feet.  Remain on all fours.  Should you try anything... well, just don't.  A detail of the National Guard is arriving and they are prepared to use deadly force if necessary,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt nodded sullenly and waited for all of the cops to get back in their cars.  As the bizarre caravan set off, Kurt saw that the cop hadn't been bluffing.  Armed individuals surrounded him as he crawled down the street after the police escort.  For perhaps the first time since his massive growth spurt, Kurt felt embarrassed about his nudity.  He was thankful for his large bushy tail.  At least it protected his modesty a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This must look odd to anyone who looks out their window at this hour,</i> Kurt snorted slightly. <i>A bajillion cops, little army dudes, and a giant, naked quarterback!  Best parade ever.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the end of the \"parade\" didn't seem to be all that positive for Kurt.

Police officers fired hurriedly, following their fleeing target and trying to avoid getting crushed underpaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shit, FUCK that stings!\u201d Kurt grimaced as bullets zinged by, nicking his flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant ran blindly, stumbling as his foot made contact with the side of a freight engine.  There was no time to lose, and his nightvision was beginning to come back as his eyes readjusted to the dark.  <i>Come on, Kurt.  It\u2019s just like tire drill at practice.  Except you\u2019re four-hundred feet tall and they\u2019re train cars.  But other than that, no different,</i> the raccoon convinced himself.  He didn't stop running until he was crashing through the forest on the edge of town.  Panting with his exertion, the giant raccoon sat down amongst the trees, thankful that if they would conceal him so long as he was crouched down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, guys,\" Kurt said, opening his paw. \"Looks like we're in the clear,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now,\" Blake snapped, pacing back and forth across the width of Kurt's palm. \"Congratulations.  We're now on the run from the police.  I suppose I ought to thank you two.  Just when I thought the living hell that is my life had hit the bottom, you guys showed up to make it even worse,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry I fooled around with Kurt.  I really am,\" Earl said, sitting in the small valley between the raccoon's index and middle fingers. \"If there's anything I could do to make up for--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can shut the hell up, that's what you can do!\" Blake spat, advancing on the mink. \"How could you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was--it was a moment of weakness,\" Earl sighed, his ears drooping. \"I was depressed.  And Kurt is... really sexy, there's no denying that,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sexy?  Really?  I've seen that 'coon's cock more than enough for five lifetimes.  Every day after practice, I had to deal with him strutting around without a stitch on.  The little prince of the locker room,\" the wolverine had turned to look up at Kurt, his voice dripping with disdain. \"But as if that weren't enough, he had to show up as a naked giant!  Oh, life is just wonderful,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with you?\" Kurt asked, lifting Blake up to his face between the thumb and forefinger of his free hand. \"I came back to try and help you.  I thought I was your friend.  But all you've done is attack me and Earl.  Why are you so cruel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't come here to help.  You want to use me,\" Blake replied. \"All you want is to be little again.  And once you get that, you'll just throw me away like trash,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how to do it?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have the chemicals?\" Earl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, it's just not as simple as whipping up a batch of shrinking serum and feeding it to the big guy,\" Blake said. \"See, that growth shit is a whole different set of chemical stuff going on.  But it's not entirely undoable.  Back at my house is a vial of growth serum.  If we can get that, I can 'reverse engineer' it,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, about that...\" Earl mumbled as Kurt set Blake back in his palm. \"I kinda gave that vial to Kurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You WHAT?\" Blake bellowed. \"Well, then there's no hope.  Kurt's screwed.  And I have no intent of getting arrested,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Kurt sighed. \"I'll let you go.  You two don't deserve this.  I'll just go into hiding somewhere,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurt, no,\" Earl said. \"This is my fault ultimately.  I'm sticking it out with you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt smiled wanly. \"Thanks, buddy.  But, Blake, I'll let you go,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolverine remained silent for a moment.  Eventually, he shook his head. \"No, I'll stay.  I guess I was kinda unfair to you earlier.  I'll help you out,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great!  Thank you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.  We'll start working on this tomorrow.  But there's no point in doing anything more tonight.  I'm beat,\" Earl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt set the pair down beside him.  They went a short distance away, taking shelter under the canopy of a large tree.

Did the light just turn on, or had it been there this whole time, and he had just been too distracted (or too exhausted) to notice it? Whatever the case, Kurt thought, it warranted action. After all, if he was close enough to see it, then whoever was inside was close enough to see him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt mulled his options for a moment. He could pick up Earl and Blake, who had fallen asleep on the ground in front of him, and take them further into the woods. But that wouldn't necessarily guarantee safety, as by doing so, he could easily attract the attention of the person at the cabin (or anyone else, for that matter), and who was to say that he'd be able to find an isolated enough spot so that no one would be able to find him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother option was to just remain here and hope he wouldn't be spotted. That would be the path of least resistance, sure, but it could also spell trouble if whoever was in the cabin DID end up seeing him and decided to call the cops. Plus, at this point, Kurt was too curious to not find out just who would be living so far out in the woods like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Kurt finally decided, his best option was to go ahead and check out the cabin, seeing if the person there was going to be a problem and, if so, deal with it. He repeated those words again in his mind. Deal with it? What exactly did that mean? The raccoon didn't want to kill anybody, that was for damn sure, but the other options he had were limited. He'd just have to figure things out as they went, he guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure not to disturb the sleeping Blake and Earl, Kurt slowly got to his hands and knees and began crawling towards the cabin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit,\" he yelped as he felt the pinch of the rough pine needles scraping against his back, many of them getting stuck in his fur. Moving around as a giant was a difficult enough task; more than once he had to squeeze through two particularly close trees that didn't budge easily. Finally, though, he made it within a hundred feet of the cabin, able to see it clearly and try to figure out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed fairly small, as cabins went (not that Kurt had any experience as a realtor or anything to base that judgement on). \"Probably only one room inside,\" he mused. \"Must be pretty old.\" He tried to think back to history class, vaguely remembering that the first settlers had come to this area over two centuries ago; this building could very well be from then. Of course, it could also have been constructed just this past summer, built by a vacation homes company to give campers that \"rustic, outdoors feel\". Whatever the case, the lack of any visible power or telephone lines meant whoever was inside probably woulnd't be able to call the cops on him if they did end up freaking out (unless they had a cell phone, he realized, but he figured the service out here was probably not so good).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kurt examined the building more closely, the light from the window suddenly moved, and he heard the sound of the front door creaking open. Panicked, he tried to back away, but smacked right into a large tree. The force of his impact caused the tree to teeter, and then come crashing down, hitting several other trees and making a loud bang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for being subtle,\" he thought to himself. Looking down at the door, he saw a silhouetted figure holding a lantern looking up at him. At this angle, Kurt realized the person wasn't even as big as his foot paw. He squinted his eyes, trying to give his best shot at figuring out who was there, but it was too dark for him to even make out the gender or species, much less any details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" the enormous raccoon started, grinning sheepishly. \"Hi. Sorry if I woke you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a long, deep breath, the figure took a moment before they replied,</span></div></div>",

Well, I suppose I have the honor of being something of a catalyst,\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait, what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kurt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fancy-speak for me being the dude who kicked this whole giant party off. See, it was I who showed Earl his way around the chem lab; taught him a thing or two about the little concoctions he makes so that he hand his BF could have their little love-fests without BF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Father Dearest being any the wiser,\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you... taught him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwyn chuckled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEarl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bright boy, no doubt about that.  But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way he could have shrunk down to the size of my pinkie or, incidentally, enlarged you to the point where <i>I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m</i>  the size of <i>your</i> pinkie without my... expertise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt narrowed his eyes.  He snatched the smug badger up between thumb and forefinger, bringing him up to his furious face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI oughta crush you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he snarled.  This was the person responsible for his predicament, and Kurt was not at all happy with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHold up there a moment!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the badger replied, his tone still cool. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne thing, people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like being lifted hundreds of feet in a few seconds.  Just about lost my lunch there.  Secondly, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just resist the urge to grind my bones to make your bread for three more minutes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to help explain some of this crap to you.  See if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anything I can do.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still not happy, chow down.  But I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taste all that appealing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant raccoon narrowed his eyes, but shifted into a sitting position. \"Go on,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger shifted uncomfortably in Kurt's grip. \"Well, for starters, I'm not entirely certain how Earl managed to get you big like this.  The shit I showed him certainly shouldn't have put THAT whammy on you.  So something must've gone seriously wrong with that,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he said that he wanted to get some talcum powder to get some of the magnesium sulfate or whatever.  Said that would fix me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Owyn looked perturbed. \"He wanted to give you WHAT?  If that had happened, you'd be using those mountains over there as a backrest.  Magnesium sulfate would do nothing but exacerbate the problem,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt sighed. \"Well, shit.  Is there anything I can do?  You'd better have some sort of solution to this bullshit,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  It's not going to be easy.  I have to think about this a bit.  But in the meantime, is there anything I can get for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, I'm kinda really hungry.  And I kinda really want some clothes,\" Kurt muttered sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger guffawed. \"Do you have any idea how many yards of cloth it would take to cover your ass, much less make you a snappy polo and jeans?  Trust me.  I don't partake in the <i>sausage</i>, but I can see how you became little Earl's fantasy,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt blushed deeply, shifting uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first, my large friend, you need a bath.  I didn't need you crashing around in the woods to tip me off to your presence.  I could smell you from a mile away!  There's a pretty big lake just over there.  Why don't you go make yourself comfortable and I'll get you some food or whatever,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt nodded silently.  Setting down the miniature badger, he stood up and picked his way over to the lake.  Sinking into the surprisingly deep lake, relishing the cool water on his fur.  It had been too long since he'd taken a bath.  Glancing up, Kurt saw Owyn...</span></div></div>",

Why shouldn't I? For all I know, you just spiked the lake with another dose of growth stuff.\" Instinctively, he let out a low growl, trying to decide whether he should swallow this jerk whole, bite him in half, or just squeeze him until he popped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm actually trying to help you!\" Owyn had managed to wiggle himself into a little bit of freedom, and had now settled down a little. \"What possible reason would I have for trying to make you any <i>bigger</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt started to speak but then stopped himself.

See, I don\u2019t think most people at that game would react too favorably to a forty-story raccoon checking out the game,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... yeah, you\u2019re probably right,\u201d Kurt conceded. \u201cBut this is really important to me.  Besides being normal again, I guess.  Look, I\u2019ve got an idea.  There\u2019s a big forested hill behind the stadium at my school.  I\u2019ll hide out there and keep quiet,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwyn hesitated again. He scratched his head and fidgeted as Kurt nervously awaited an answer. \u201cYou know what?  Fine.  Go on ahead,\u201d he finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt beamed for the first time in awhile. \u201cThank you.  It really means a lot.  And I\u2019ll be careful, I promise,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, because I\u2019m really kinda busy at the moment.  I won\u2019t be able to go with you,\u201d Owyn replied. \u201cThe game\u2019s tonight, right?  Well, you might want to head over there now.  We\u2019re about five miles or so away from your school.  Just head due east until you get there.  Can\u2019t miss it.  Oh, and shut up while you\u2019re there.  Your voice kinda carries,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it,\u201d Kurt grinned as a massive sliding door was opened on the far side of the room.  He started to crawl towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me regret this!\u201d Owyn called after the giant. \u201cI\u2019m giving you a huge amount of freedom here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything about me is huge,\u201d Kurt chuckled as he stood up outside of the building he\u2019d been housed in. \u201cI\u2019ll be back afterward,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the giant quarterback about 10 minutes to reach the stadium.  Thankful that the early darkness of the late fall evening covered him, he laid down on the far side of the hill, propping his chin in his hands, just in time for the opening kick-off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt watched the game unfold with baited breath.  It was a truly intense game with his team\u2019s district rivals, and it was quite surreal for the giant watching the game being played by tiny action figures.  Every play unfolded beautifully and every down was fought for tooth and nail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the final moments of the fourth quarter, it was still a tied game.  The stands were buzzing with nervous energy as the home team prepared to make a final push.  The snap went off and the (substitute) quarterback belted the ball down the field.  The ball was caught perfectly and the wide receiver barreled down the final yards to the end zone.  They\u2019d done it.  They\u2019d won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYESSSSS!\u201d Kurt bellowed, leaping to his feet and pumping his fist, unable to control his happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire stadium fell deathly silent as Kurt realized his mistake.  Everyone was staring  at the huge giant who had just appeared over the hill, faces blank with shock and surprise.  Almost instantaneously, everyone was in a panic, pushing and running for the nearest exits.  The stands were nearly cleared in a matter of moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Kurt groaned. \u201cThat\u2019s not what...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears perked up as he heard sirens in the distance.  His blood running cold, Kurt began to run.  He had no idea where he was going or how to get there, but he knew he had to get away, and as quickly as possible.  Kurt stumbled down the hill towards the stadium.</span></div></div>",

Where was the last place you saw him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt blinked. \u201cWhat do you mean, where did I see him last? He was sleeping in the woods with Blake and I when I found your cabin! Didn't you see them there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger shook his head. \u201cNope. You, my dear raccoon, were the only soul I came across tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt smacked his head, a knot beginning to form in his stomach. Of all the dumb moves he had made so far, why did one of them have to be leaving the mink on his own (or rather, with an angry, jilted lover)? Best case scenario, he was probably worried sick about where Kurt had disappeared to. But if something had happened, if they had gotten lost in the forest or, worse yet, if the police had caught up with them, then Kurt would never be able to forgive himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go back there!\u201d he pleaded, his voice nearing a shout. \u201cWe need to make sure that he\u2019s--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't think that\u2019s necessary,\u201d he heard a voice say from behind Owyn. The badger spun around, and Kurt was relieved to see Earl step out of the shadows, Blake following behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEarl! Blake!\u201d Kurt exclaimed, his ears perking up. \u201cThank gods you two are here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well,\u201d Blake shrugged, \u201cafter we were woken up by the sound of the entire lake relocating itself all over the place, and getting appropriately drenched, Earl decided to see what was going on. Still waiting for my fur to dry completely,\u201d he added, shaking his arms and head, sending drops of water flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Earl nodded, \u201cI recognized Owyn as I saw him scurrying around your unconscious body, but we decided to stay back and watch from a distance, following as he brought you here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt smiled, happy to see his two friends okay. He felt a tremendous urge to pick Earl up and show him just how happy he was to see him, but fought it off out of concern for Blake and how he\u2019d react. Best to see how that plays out, he figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he finally said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quiet moment, Earl cleared his throat, nudging Blake with his elbow as he did so. \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Blake said, lowering his head slightly, \u201cI wanted to apologize for losing my cool with you earlier, Kurt. Earl explained things to me, and I thought back on how conflicted I felt when I was first dealing with these feelings. It's pretty selfish of me to expect you to be any less confused than I was. I-I\u2019m sorry, Kurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt felt a tiny lump forming in his throat. \u201cThanks, Blake,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm,\u201d Owyn interrupted, coughing loudly and obviously and stepping to the middle of the group. \u201cI don't mean to interrupt your tender moment, but I think I\u2019ve figured something out that you all may be interested in. Namely, how to make our large friend here get back to normal size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt nearly jumped up in celebration, but remembered the low ceiling at the last minute. \u201cGreat!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWhat do we need to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually,\u201d Owyn replied, \u201cit turned out to be a relatively simple solution once I realized exactly how the growth serum had actually activated within your body. It looked to be kinda similar to an atomic reaction, like from a bomb.\u201d All three boys\u2019 eyes went wide at this comparison, but Owyn continued without skipping a beat. \u201cThe reaction when the serum hit the bloodstream let loose so much energy that it caused every cell in your body to go into hyperdrive, so to speak, duplicating at thousands of times their normal rate, until your body was big enough to handle all that excess energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I noticed,\u201d Kurt muttered. \u201cBut, if all that energy led to my growth, how can we reverse that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d Owyn replied. \u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Kurt\u2019s brow furrowed as he started to ball his hands into fists. \u201cI thought you said you figured it out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did!\u201d The other three looked at him questioningly as he continued. \u201cActually, I didn't exactly figure out how to get rid of the excess energy. Once the reaction in the serum has occurred, it's like Pandora\u2019s Box, it can't be reversed and consolidated again. But, I realized that if we were able to redirect that energy somewhere else, then your cells would quickly rebalance themselves back to how they were, and you would (hopefully) shrink back to normal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d Earl interjected, the gears in his head spinning rapidly, \u201cwhat are you saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m saying,\u201d Owyn replied as he took a deep breath, \"that our best chance for success is to try and transfer all that energy to...</span></div></div>",

Only moments later, it was shattered by two teenagers arguing loudly, mostly drowned out by the protestations of the third, much larger one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be me,\" Earl said, face determined.  \"I'm the one who's to blame for all of this.  I should be the one punished for it all,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can take turns,\" Blake insisted, gesturing wildly. \"There's no reason we can't all have something of a normal life,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!  Don't worry about it.  I'll just... stay like this,\" Kurt interjected, pounding a massive fist on the floor.  \"I probably deserve it after how awful I've been.  Don't put it on yourselves,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl crossed over to Kurt, reaching up to put a hand on the raccoon's knee.  \"This situation isn't your fault.  It's mine.  Please.  Let me make things right for you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt shook his head, not wanting Earl to have to be alone like he was.  Suddenly, an idea--an incredibly stupid one, but an idea nonetheless--popped into his head.  \"Wait,\" he breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three looked up at the gigantic raccoon, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're saying we have to transfer the energy, right?\" Kurt began.  \"Well what if we, uh, spread it out?  Not just to one individual.  But across a bunch.  Share the wealth, I guess.  If we divided it up enough, maybe it would work...\" he trailed off, shaking his head.  \"Forget it.  It's a stupid idea,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwyn held up a hand.  \"Just so stupid it might actually work!\" he said.  \"I can't believe I didn't think of that myself,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you he wasn't just a dumb jock,\" Earl stuck his tongue out at Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all well and good, but look at the guy,\" Blake said. \"He's hundreds of feet tall.  How many people is it going to take?  And how many people would agree to do that and not just head for the hills when they see his oversized ass walking down the street?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt frowned, trying to think.  He had a point.  \"The football team!  There's dozens of those guys if you count all of the strings and everything.  That would work, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assuming it actually works, yeah.  But how would we get them all here?  How would we get them all here?  How would we explain what's going on?\" Owyn massaged hi temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy,\" Kurt grinned.  \"They have practice every afternoon after school.  I'll just pay them a visit tomorrow,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hold on a minute,\" Earl sighed.  \"That may not be the best idea.  I mean, think about it.  You don't mean any harm.  We know that.  But all they're gonna see is a gigantic raccoon heading right for them.  That might not end well,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt rested his chin on his palm.  Eventually, he said,</span></div></div>",

He hesitated. \"Transfer the energy to me.  It's my fault.  I should be the one who pays the price,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Earl, don't,\" Kurt said. \"It's okay.  I don't want you to blame yourself.  Besides, we'd still have one giant on our hands.  That wouldn't get us much of anywhere, would it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt turned his head towards Owyn. \"How safe is it?\" he asked. \"What are my chances?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger shrugged. \"I honestly have no way of knowing.  I wish I could tell you something concrete.  All I can say is, plenty of little birds walk around on power lines unscathed day in and day out.  You're, what 250 feet?  You should be able to resist a couple thousand volts,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so reassuring,\" Kurt grunted. \"But fine.  I'll do it.  We've got no other option,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Owyn beamed.  \"There's a large substation pretty close by, just a mile or so from here,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger pushed a button on the wall and a portion of the far wall opened up like an enormous garage door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt placed his hand on the ground palm-up in front of the three. \"Climb on, guys,\" he urged. \"Let's get me normal-sized,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the three complied, Kurt cupped them gingerly in his palm and turned around, crawling out of the hangar.  Once he gout out, the giant raccoon stood up to his full towering height.  <i>This is the last time I'll ever be 25 stories tall,</i> Kurt grinned to himself as he followed Owyn's directions towards the substation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe power station was fairly close to Owyn's hangar, set in the middle of the forest.  Stepping effortlessly over the chain link fence, Kurt stopped in front of the complex network of cables, boxes, and transformers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do now?\" Kurt asked, lifting the trio up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first thing, set us down,\" Owyn laughed.  \"But then see that large cable there?  Grab it with both hands at once.  Got to complete the circuit, or you'll certainly be toasted.  Simple enough,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple enough,\" Kurt sighed, setting Earl, Blake, and Owyn down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant turned to face the cable in question.  He breathed out forcefully, clapping his hands and rubbing them together out of nerves.  \"Fuck,\" he muttered. \"Here goes nothing,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kurt!\" Blake shouted up. \"Earl was certainly right about one thing: you really do have a nice ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the awesome last words to me,\" Kurt rolled his eyes.  He extended his arms, and, sucking in his breath, grabbed the cable.  </span></div></div>",

It wasn't entirely unpleasant, but it definitely was strange, and Kieran let out a small, involuntary yelp of surprise, which caused him to quickly blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Kurt?\" Owyn asked, looking up at the giant with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I think so.\" Kurt noticed that his voice had a slight abnormal vibration to it, as if he was being shaken while talking, and his vision started to blur a little. \"This definitely feels weird though. Do I look okay? Am I getting any smaller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Earl answered. \"It's hard to tell. Your fur is all standing on its end, so that makes you look kinda bigger just cause of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Kurt moaned, \"Just what I needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're definitely getting smaller, though!\" Blake shouted. \"You're already about fifty feet shorter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Kurt noticed that his surroundings looked a little bigger in comparison. His heart started beating faster in excitement (well, more likely due to the voltage flowing through it), and he began to smile. \"Finally! Something I do to try to fix this works!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued shrinking for about a minute. Once he got to a little over two hundred feet, however, the lights dotting the perimeter of the power station began to flicker, getting brighter and then dimmer in rapid succession. What was worse, though, was the fact that the tingling feeling was quickly growing increasingly painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's-- what's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't know!\" Owyn started to panic, running over to the boxes and hastily examining them. \"I think their might be an overload on these transformers. Hang on, I'll flip the safety shut-off!\" He ran around in a panic, as Blake and Earl rushed over to try and help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt's body began to convulse. He tried to just drop the cables, but the muscles in his hands and arms seemed to be paralyzed; he didn't seem to have control over any part of his body at the moment. <i>So this is it</i>, he thought to himself, <i>I'm about to die while still a giant. I hope they can find a place with enough room to dispose of my body in a somewhat respectful fashion.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found it!\" he heard Owyn cry out. \"Hang on!\" Kurt heard the loud clunking sound of a switch being moved, and the lights immediately went out, cloaking them in darkness. But, thankfully, the electricity quickly ceased flowing through his body, and the pain quickly reverted to the tingling feeling, which soon faded away as he quickly fell down to the ground with a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger, mink, and wolverine quickly ran up to Kurt's feet, looking up at him with hope, worry, and fear. Shaking his head and opening his eyes again, he tried to give a weak smile. \"Let's not try that again anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurt!\" Relief washed over Earl's face as he saw the raccoon was still alive and in relatively good health. \"Thank gods you're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Kurt said as he sat up, beginning to regain his strength, \"It'll take more than one power station's worth of electricity to sideline this raccoon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Owyn said, \"you've definitely lost some of the height you had, but you're still around two hundred feet tall or so. If you're up for it, there's a power station a little closer to town that we could head to and try this again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt shook his head. \"Not tonight. Maybe in the morning. C'mon, let's head back to your lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked the three up in his paw again, which was a little less roomy than before but still plenty big to carry them. The walk back to Owyn's took a little bit longer than before, but the cool fall air was pleasing enough, especially against his frazzled fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something wasn't right. As Kurt got closer to Owyn's, he began to realize what was happening.</span></div></div>",

I just need to enter in a key code,\" Owyn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all your high-tech gadgetry and stuff, you'd think this door would just have a giant-sized motion sensor or something,\" Kurt said, gesturing emphatically in the direction of the hangar door. \"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant and his three companions gasped in unison as the hangar door opened of its own accord. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird,\" Earl muttered as Kurt entered the facility and sat down cross-legged on the ground, setting the trio on the ground in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, like me being the size of an airplane isn't weird enough as it is,\" Kurt laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is just adding a whole new layer to the weird cake that is you right now,\" Earl replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think I'm weird?\" Kurt grinned, rolling onto his stomach and resting his chin on the backs of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're not weird.  Just huge,\" Earl replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you two just shut up?\" Blake complained. \"Owyn's got an idea,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt shifted his gaze to look at the badger. \"Well, I think that you must have gotten those... abilities from the electrical shock back at the station.

I'm really sorry about your stepdad.  Really.  I understand you're sad and angry, but I can't just--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Understand?  UNDERSTAND?\" Blake virtually exploded. \"You don't understand what it's like to be kicked out over something you have no control over.  You have no clue,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meanwhile, I'm sure my parents would be totally fine with their son being too big to fit into the godsdamn house!\" Kurt replied, shifting so that he was crouched on all fours, the tip of his nose virtually brushing up against the furious wolverine. \"I'm sure they'd be in love with the idea of their son traipsing around the countryside twenty stories tall and completely naked!  A development, which, if I remember correctly, I had no control over.  You can thank Earl for that,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!

He tossed and turned on the rough, cold concrete floor of the hangar-room, stewing in his own guilt.  Sure, he was pissed about Blake's demands, but did that give him an excuse to (almost literally) bite the wolverine's head off?  Probably not.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the raccoon gave up the pipe dream of sleep altogether, sitting against the wall and staring aimlessly at the wall.

How is it even possible for Blake to call up the National Guard?\" Earl leaned over the edge of Kurt's thumb. \"I thought only the governor or whatever could do that,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwyn was too worried to ponder the finer points of National Guard summoning.  \"Look.

I'm probably no match for several dozen cops, but one schmuck with a shotgun can't take me out.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabin-owner didn't have time to reach as the giant suddenly rocked forward into a kneeling position, scooping him up and enclosing him completely in a fist.  Kurt lifted the owner up towards his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't seem like the brightest idea to threaten a giant, does it?\" he snarled. \"Y'know, I haven't had anything to eat all day.  Makes a little morsel like you that much more appetizing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause, then came a muffled response. \"Hey now... We can talk this over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt smirked to himself.  His ploy had worked.  Opening his fist, the raccoon examined the stranger.  He was a middle-aged bobcat, slightly grizzled in appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?  And why on earth are you so big?\" the bobcat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, it's kind of a long story,\" Kurt mumbled. \"But I have two friends with me and was wondering if they could spend the night in your cabin,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimey.

Soon, he could no longer hold the mink in his hand.  Yelping in surprise, he loosened his grip.  Earl twisted through the air, clothing shredding off and eyes screwed shut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook as a gigantic mink a mere head shorter than Kurt landed thunderously.  Earl blinked and looked around, gaping at the minuscule forest arrayed around his ankles and the miniature landscape.  He suddenly became aware of his nudity, blushing as he moved to protect his modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" was all the mink could manage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ashamed.  You're beautiful,\" Kurt grinned running his eyes over the new giant's svelte frame.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could scarcely believe he was using those words to describe another guy, but shrugged inwardly and decided to just go with it.  Taking a step closer so that he was practically toe to toe with Earl, Kurt lifted the mink's chin upward with a finger.  He met Earl's lips with his, closing his eyes.  Earl stiffened in surprise, then kissed the raccoon back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaintaining the lip lock, the massive quarterback lowered Earl onto the ground.  The mink giggled as he felt the sensation of countless trees turning to matchwood under his unimaginable weight.  As Kurt slipped him a bit of tongue, Earl inhaled deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurt...\" he mumbled. \"I have a boyfriend,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt smiled, lying down fully on top of Earl.  \"Your point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really into you.

Yoga?  Look.  Blake obviously made this stuff so you guys could get huge and then get it on.  Might as well make good on that,\" Kurt replied smoothly, dragging his fingertips down Earl's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one thing, we were actually gonna take a road trip down to Metro City and turn it into our sexy playground, not this lame forest,\" Earl grinned mischievously.

Screwing his eyes shut he clutched his side.  It felt as if he was being torn into a million different pieces by a million little hooks.  But the pain was over as quickly as it began.  Opening his eyes slowly, Kurt took in his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.  The.  Fuck,\" Kurt said slowly.  He had certainly changed, though not as he had anticipated.  The gigantic raccoon now towered at more than twice his earlier stature, easily surpassing 450 feet in height.  A snarl erupted from Kurt's lips as he snatched Earl off the ground, bringing him up to his enraged face. \"Fuck it, Earl!  Can't you manage to do anything without fucking something up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--I'm so sorry.  I don't know what went wrong,\" Earl stammered, terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I oughta crush you,\" Kurt snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't take looking at the mink anymore.  Dropping him back to the ground, Kurt stood up to his full height and stormed off.  Trees smashed and pavement cracked under the massive quarterback's heavy footfalls as he strode away from Earl and the golf course.  He had no destination in mind, but his feet led him perhaps instinctively back to the football field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down heavily on top of the bleachers, Kurt buried his face in his hands.  He wanted to cry, but he couldn't manage it.  He was going to be a giant forever.  There was no way around it.  No more football, no more driving around with his friends, no more friends, period.  He would have to hide somewhere.  The mountains would do.  He could hide out, subsisting on the local vegetation and wildlife.  Perhaps he could steal from campers and hikers on occasion.  Or, he could throw subtlety to the wind and enslave a town, forcing its inhabitants to carry out his every whim.  Maybe that would be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.  Do it,\" came a faint voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt looked down to see Earl standing by his hip. \"What do you mean, 'do it'?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill me.  Crush me, eat me, I don't care.  I don't deserve to live.  I'm a failure,\" Earl mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt picked Earl up, regarding him closely.  The mink's shoulders were slumped, his ears drooping, and his cheeks were damp with tears.  He looked like he was trying to be determined, but fear and sadness kept seeping through. <i>Maybe I should.  The little fucker put me in this horrible situation</i>, Kurt thought. Part of him wanted to drop the mink into his mouth and swallow him whole, ensuring a slow and excruciating death.  But the pit of anger seemed to be gone, for some reason. \"Earl, little guy, I can't do that,\" Kurt finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill me!  Kill me!\" Earl sobbed. \"I'm a miserable fuck-up.  I can't even make you normal again.  This is all my--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt kissed Earl.  Closing his eyes, he caressed the mink's tiny body passionately with his lips.  Time seemed to freeze before he slowly broke away, cupping Earl in his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.

I mean, it was... amazing, but... why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Kurt said again. \"It just seemed like the right thing to do,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl blushed furiously.  He hesitated, then looked up at Kurt. \"I want to apologize for my mistake,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already did,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean really apologize,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you know,\" the mink's tone was becoming more confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt's eyes widened. \"Oh...</span></div></div>",

I suppose,\" Earl sighed. \"He's pretty much a genius.  If anyone can figure out how to shrink you back down, it's him,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll certainly be great to be back in the single digits in the height department,\" Kurt replied. \"Now where is this 'crazy inventor' friend of yours' house at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Milford Wood, right?  On the edge of town?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course.  He lives by there?  Should be easy enough to get there.  Your pal must be loaded!  Plenty of really nice houses in that area, if I remember right,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not exactly,\" Earl shifted slightly in the giant's palm. \"See, Owyn's something of a recluse.  He lives in a cabin in the middle of the woods,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt raised a brow. \"Well, <i>that</i> makes life a bit more interesting.  Let's get going,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're not going to leave now, are you?\" Earl called as Kurt began to head towards the woods and the inventor's cabin, covering dozens of feet with every purposeful stride. \"What if you're seen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt gave Earl a reassuring nod. \"It's early in the morning on a weekend.  We should be fine.  Besides.  Even if someone were to see a 20-story 'coon, what could they even do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'd call the cops!\" Earl replied, a hint of panic in his voice. \"And what would the cops do with a quarterback the size of Godzilla?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try not to find out.  And I'm not as big as Godzilla.  Not yet,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContrary to Earl's fears, the rest of the trip passed uneventfully, and soon Kurt was wading through trees that reached as far as his chest on his way to Owyn's cabin.  He grunted slightly as leaves and pine needles brushed roughly against his naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Earl hissed suddenly. \"His house is right down there.  Set me down and I'll get Owyn out here,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, immediately in front of Earl was a clearing with a somewhat run-down wooden cabin thrown together at its center.  The giant sat down cross-legged and set Earl back on the ground.  The mink hurried up to the door, but didn't even have to knock, as the stocky badger was already exiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earl.  What on earth have you done this time?\" Owyn bellowed, staring wide-eyed at the massive raccoon sitting sheepishly before him. \"Who is this, anyway?  Your new boyfriend?  I'm no expert, but he certainly is a looker, I suppose,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt blushed deeply and Earl made several nonsense noises in his throat.  Recovering slightly, the giant scooped the pair up in one hand. \"Earl's just a friend,\" he laughed. \"But look.  Could you, er, make me less huge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been getting bigger and bigger off and on for the past day or so.  And the formula didn't wear off like it always did.  I figured you'd be able to help me out,\" Earl explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwyn scratched his head. \"Well, it didn't wear off?  Damn.  That makes things more difficult,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit,\" Kurt breathed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said 'more difficult', not 'impossible',\" Owyn insisted. \"We'll figure something out.  I just need you to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was impossible for him to get comfortable on the uneven surface of the golf course, and every breeze that happened through the area ruffled his fur.  The giant fumed silently at predicament, and moreso at Earl.  That damned mink was entirely to blame for him being a twelve-story monstrosity.  Kurt just shuddered to think what might have happened if things had actually ended up according to the mink's plan, and he'd ended up an insect in Earl's palm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the same, Kurt couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt at his behavior.  Sure, Earl had turned him into a giant.  But then, he'd stayed around and made a genuine offer to help.  Despite this extension of goodwill, Kurt had spurned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined to make things right, Kurt began to make his way on all fours towards the house Earl had indicated as his.  Crouching low, the giant peered first in the lower level windows.  He froze as he saw a middle-aged male mink and a slightly younger ferretess engaged in a verbal brawl in the kitchen.  Fortunately, they appeared to be too engaged in one another to notice the massive raccoon right outside their back door.  The argument didn't last long before the pair disappeared from Kurt's field of view.  He heard the front door slam and a car drive off while the other individual ran off down the street after it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging a bit to himself, Kurt sat up a bit more as he found Earl's window.  The mink was sitting at his desk, working furiously at his homework (if such a thing were possible).  He started, dropping his pencil as Kurt tapped gently on the window, unintentionally shattering the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops,\" he mumbled sheepishly. \"But look.  I'm really sorry for just brushing you off like that.  It was really cold for me to act like that.  So if you promise to fix me, wanna just call it blank slate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mink looked as if he were enduring a massive internal battle of emotions, but in the end opted to burst into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt was taken aback. \"Er, you okay, dude?  Here, climb onto my palm.  What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl clambered over his windowsill and onto the surface of the giant's hand. \"Thank you.  Really.  We'll work this out,\" he replied, calming down. \"I'm sorry about this.  It's just... well, I'm sure you saw my parents fighting,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda hard to miss,\" Kurt smiled thinly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl laughed softly. \"I suppose so.  But that's all my fault.  I got back super late, and they were worried and... well, it got worse from there.  They're usually not like that.  I feel awful,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen.  Don't beat yourself up, little guy,\" Kurt said kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Earl shook his head slightly, Kurt decided to...</span></div></div>",

Ingrid herself was a hippopotamus anthro with gray skin and short dyed purple hair. She had a huge stomach that reached out several feet with a pierced navel and a behind that could take up a whole bench. She was a smart girl with good grades but she was also beautiful, for a girl well over three thousand pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Ingrid had one slight problem, namely another student by the name of Zap, a lecherous crocodile anthro who was constantly stalking her, watching her every move, waiting for her by her locker, getting too close to her at lunch and at one point, he even stole her laundry. One day that reptile when too far and squeezed her behind. Ingrid turned around only to see that crocodile laughing at her with lustful eyes and trying to feel all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was more than Ingrid could take, she had to get rid of that lip smacking lizard somehow and she knew just how she was going to do it. Late one night, she put her intelligence to her advantage. She worked all night constructing a strange remote. When she was finished, she cracked a slight smirk. \"Success,\" the hippo girl said to herself. \"Now to put this baby to the test on a certain lizard face.\" Ingrid let out an evil laugh and stroked her own massive stomach. She was going to destroy Zap once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Ingrid went to school early before classes had even started. She looked around the corner to see that predictably, Zap was right at her locker waiting for her. \"Where are you my dear Ingrid?\" asked that crocodile in a singsong voice. \"I can't wait to wrap my claws around every inch of that hot air balloon sized body of yours and sink in my teeth.\" Zap laughed but Ingrid let out a smug smirk before taking out her remote. \"Let's see how you like this sucker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid held out her remote and pressed a button as it fired a strange ray that struck Zap as he grunted in slight displeasure. \"What the...?!\" As the beam struck Zap he begun to get smaller and smaller. When he stopped shrinking, Zap was only half an inch tall. \"Yes!\" yelled Ingrid. \"It worked.\" \"What...?\" asked the now minuscule Zap as he looked at his surroundings. \"Where am I? What's this...?\" Suddenly the ground shook and Zap couldn't keep his footing. He looked up to see something large and wide blocking his vision. As Zap stepped back Ingrid lowered her head and looked it over her stalker, giving him an evil look as he panicked and tried to run off. But it was no use for he was only half an inch tall and Ingrid being the large hippo she was, was twelve feet tall. She grabbed Zap by the tail and pulled him up in front of her huge face.</span></div></div>",

Ingrid immediately snaps her mouth shut and swishes her tongue around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZap is pushed through the mouth and Ingrid keeps snapping her teeth, nearly crushing the crocodile in her mouth before she slams Zap into the roof of her mouth. \"Come on Ingrid! This isn't funny! Let me out!\" But outside, Ingrid smiles evilly and then she tilts her head back and lets out a big gulp. A small bulge goes down her neck as Zap screams inside the bulge, but his screams are muffled before he lands with a splash in Ingrid's big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Zap looks around in shock, Ingrid swallowed him. Outside, Ingrid herself can't believe what she had done and is absolutely giddy. \"Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! He's really in there.\" Ingrid smiles and pokes her large protruding stomach. \"I've got a croc stalker in my belly. This is fantastic. Zap runs to the stomach wall and pounds on Ingrid's stomach, making small bulges appear under her belly button. \"Okay big beauty. Now you can spit me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid shakes her head and burps again. \"Sorry Zap, but you're not getting out. Ever.\" Ingrid lets out yet another burp and shakes up the stomach before giggling to herself. \"Sorry, I guess crocs make me gassy.\" Ingrid burps again and Zap is shocked. \"Ingrid!\" he yells as his fleshy prison begins to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ingrid ignores Zap's screams. All her life she had been an herbivore, but now she had a carnivore in her tummy. Her stalker was going to be digested in her three thousand pound body. She held up her shrinking ray and was thinking of the possibilities. She could just eat anyone who gave her a hard time now. So what does she do?</span></div></div>",

Zap was hardly the only annoyance in her life, after all--she was already thinking of a few other thorns in her side that she could dispose of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer prodigious stomach made a low gurgling sound that was loud enough to startle her and look down at her belly--digestion was kicking in, as her stomach reflexively reacted to food. Only this time, said food was very much still alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her stomach stopped gurgling, Zap went into a frenzy. Ingrid giggled again as his struggles tickled her gut; it actually felt like getting a massage from the inside. Idly she wondered what he was doing in there--was he beating on her stomach walls with his fists, begging to be let out? Was he running around in a berserk rage, clawing away like a madman? Or was he just squirming around in pain, already melting into sludge from her acids?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid didn't really care, though. As far as she was concerned, Zap was getting what was coming to him.<br>\r\nPatting her stomach once more, she headed for the library to kill time until classes started, Zap's frantic struggles still tickling her gut. \"I'll admit Zap, for a perverted stalker you sure are tasty!\" she quipped as she all but skipped down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Ingrid was in the library, idly reading through a detective comic about an anthro bat P.I. tracking down a Mafia-funded casino. All the while, Zap's movements had slowly grown weaker and slower--which only made Ingrid smile. Zap would finally be out of her hair, permanently. As she read, an idea came to her: why should <i>she</i> be the only one to enjoy her shrink ray? Her friends had problems of their own--an ex-boyfriend here, an annoying neighbor there; they deserved to get in on the fun, right? Right! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, the girls could probably come up with even better ways to dispose of their victims...especially Jasmine. That fox may have been sweet and pleasant as you could be, but there was a reason for the saying \"Beware the Nice Ones\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, there was no reason <i>not</i> to share this with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to herself, Ingrid put down the comic and got stood up from her chair--classes were about to start. As she headed out of the library, she felt one last, weak struggle from Zap...and then, nothing. Her stomach gave one last gurgle, and she burped once more--though this time Ingrid remembered to cover her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye-bye, Zap. You made a better snack than a would-be boyfriend,\" she said under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, this was going to be <i>soooo much fun</i>....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>===After School===</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid found that she had lucked out that day: according to a note left by her parents, they would be spending a few days out of town, apparently to help take care of a friend who'd caught a rather nasty case of the flu. That was good; Ingrid wasn't ready for her parents to find out about her shrink ray just yet, especially not by happening to hear her talk about it to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she'd learned that the house was hers, Ingrid immediately called her friends and asked them to come over. Her only reason given was, \"I've got something freaking awesome to tell you, just come over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, all her friends were there. The girls were now sitting at Ingrid's dining-room table, with Ingrid herself at the head.<br>\r\nBella spoke up first. She was a tan cow anthro who was a bit on the chubby side (but nowhere near as heavy as Ingrid) \"So, what's got ya all worked up, Ingrid?\" she asked, a slight Texas drawl flavoring her speech. \"Ya sounded real giddy on the phone, that's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather was next.  \"Yeah, what's so important that you had to call all of us?\" She was a blue anthro iguana with black stripes, and unlike Bella and Ingrid, her figure was slim and toned. No surprise, given how she spent her weekends working out and jogging. <br>\r\nHer forked tounge briefly stuck out once she'd finished speaking before shooting back in her mouth--a habit of Heather's when she was nervous or excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine rose an eyebrow, her tail swishing behind her a few times before she spoke. \"You mentioned Zap on the phone, said you'd 'dealt with him' or something. What was all that about?\" the silver anthro fox questioned, looking interested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella cocked her head. \"Zap? Ya finally got that stupid galoot off your oversized back? Well, good goin', but why'd you tell Jazzy here that and not me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or me, either?\" Heather added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid giggled, but cleared her throat to get rid of the laugh. \"Oh, well telling Jasmine about Zap was an accident, really; didn't mean to spoil the info,\" she confessed. \"But now that we're all here, and since mentioning Zap is as good a cue as any....\" she took her shrink ray out of her pocket and put it on the table. \"Girls, this little gadget is a genuine, honest-to-God shrink ray. Made it myself. This morning, I went to school early and used it on Zap. The twerp shrank down to the size of an ant!\" she chortled remembering the look of fear on the alligator's face when he found himself looking up at a colossal hippo-girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends looked gobsmacked, then they started to laugh. \"Oh, I wish I could have been there!\" Jasmine whooped, slapping her knee. \"What did you do with the little prick after that? Are you gonna keep him as a pet or something, or did you just shrink him to put the fear of God into him, then turn him to normal and let him run?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather chimed in next. \"Hey, maybe she sat on him with that big rump of hers!\" the iguana-girl chortled, her tounge shooting out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid just smiled. \"Well, sitting on him may have been fun...but I didn't do that, or turn him back to normal. Or keep him as a pet, for that matter,\" she answered in a smooth voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends' laughter died down. Something in Ingrid's voice seemed...off.<br>\r\n\"Well, what <i>did</i> ya do, then?\" Bella asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn answer, Ingrid leaned back in her chair, lifted her shirt up just a bit, and patted her exposed stomach where her friends could see. She rose an eyebrow and smirked to drive the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends all stared, before they finally got it. Jasmine was the first to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...<i>ate him?</i>\" the vixen asked, eyes going wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid just nodded, still smiling from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>But what do Ingrid's friends think of her eating Zap alive?</b><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Break my heart, you get my stomach...all four of 'em!\" With that, she dropped it onto her tongue and closed her mouth. She mooed and savored the taste; \"Mmm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid cheered. \"Nice one-liner! ...But remember, don't chew!\" Ingrid reminded her. \"Around an inch or so, they're small enough to swallow whole, and chewing them is too quick. Just enjoy his taste for a bit, and remember to tilt your head back when you gulp him down.\" Ingrid had been adamant about that. Bella had wanted to chew on her ex and other victims tomorrow, but Ingrid had on gulping them down whole. Bella rolled her eyes, but nodded and did as she was asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little gulp, the red candy vanished down Bella's throat as a little bulge in her neck. The cow-girl traced its path with a hand. \"Mmm...that feels mighty good, Ingrid. Took a while ta get over feelin' like I needed to cough, but now I see why ya didn't want me to chew.\" She patted her ample belly. \"I can't wait fer that to be him for real. So, ya think ya found the best way ta sit on 'em? What to wear an' such?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid giggled as she stomped on a yellow gummy she'd dropped on the floor. \"I think so, Bella. Heh, almost wish I sat on Zap instead. <i>Almost</i>.\" The hippo-girl picked a notebook off the coffee table. \"As for what to wear; the tighter or skimpier, the better. Skinny jeans, spandex shorts, a bikini...that'll let you feel 'em under you ass the best. Great for teasing the bugs, too--especially if they're some perv who's always ogling you. And as for bra and panties...\" both girls let out evil sniggers, \"same thing. Tight and tiny is the way to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella snorted, imagining the cheating tiger's expression as her gigantic rump crashed down on him, clad in the very same checkered bikini he'd bought for her on her last birthday. And maybe his stupid drinking friends too, while she was at it. Poetic justice, that moment deserved to last...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any special way to sit down?\" Bella asked, shaking her hips. \"In case we wanna feel 'em squirmin' around for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid smirked. \"Easy, just sit down slowly and try to pin the bug under <i>one</i> cheek. You can still crush them if you wiggle or bounce on them, but you won't break everything at once just sitting. If you really want to, just wait until they suffocate under there...otherwise, just slam your ass on them and they're a red smear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella rose an eyebrow. \"Girl, you got all that from gummy-bears? You <i>sure</i> you didn't shrink some other folks and not tell us about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid giggled. \"Nope, just the gummy bears. I just sat on them different ways,and some were flatter than others. Just guessed after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella thought about it, then shrugged. \"Works for me, Ingrid. Well, it's gettin' late; best get some shut-eye. We got a...heh, <i>big day</i> tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls shared another evil laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come tomorrow, which girl shall we follow?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All she was wearing underneath was the very same checkered bikini that her ex gave her. She slept in it to make sure it was extra sweaty for when she sat on the tiger. She let out a laugh as she held out the shrink ray and kissed it. \"It was so nice of Ingrid to build this thing to give Pat what's coming to him. I think I'll let her eat one of the jerk's asshole friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella kissed the shrink ray again and then walked out. She looked at her watch to see that it was 6:30am and smirked. It was Saturday, she knew that Pat and his friends would most likely be at the beach surfing in half an hour so she got in her car to drive towards the spot where she would ambush her ex. Along the way, a red car cuts her off at a four way intersection. Bella gave a glare but then she gave an evil smirk and fired her shrink ray, turning the red station wagon into a toy car as she let out a giggle and continued to drive. She felt powerful. She may be a cattle type anthro, but she was done being an herbivore. She wanted to be the apex predator and it looked like she'd get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella didn't see an open parking space at the beach, so she made one by shrinking a small pink coupe and parking right above it before stepping out. She walked towards the beach and hid behind some bushes of beach grass as she let out a moo. Bella heard laughter and turned her head to see a muscular bengal tiger man holding a surfboard. That would be her ex. Just looking at Pat made her snort. However, upon closer examination, he wasn't alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was with...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A small entourage of anthro guys followed in Pat's wake, the lot of them laughing and chattering as they carried their own surfboards. Bella recognized them immediately: Pat's meathead friends, who'd all also raised Bella's ire even before their ringleader had dumped her. \"Well, whaddya know,\" Bella hissed, drumming her fingers on the shrink ray. \"A whole herd a' stupid just pulled into town. Just mah luck.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite a bunch of scumbags, really: there was Hank, a thuggish aligator anthro and Pat's close second in the group. He was a bully, plain and simple--Bella had heard him bragging about wrecking some poor nerdy eagle's science fair project a few years back, and he wore his multiple suspensions with pride. Rumor had it he'd even threatened someone who'd caught him cheating on a test with his claws, just to avoid getting told on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was James, a rich dingo anthro who acted like a proper gentleman when it suited him, but really just seemed to hate everyone besides himself and his fellow goons. He'd made plenty of snide remarks about Bella's weight when Pat wasn't around that left her caught between punching the Aussie sleaze in the face...and crying. He didn't have the muscle Hank or Pat did, but he could beat you down <i>verbally</i> just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Dan. He wasn't an outright thug or bully like the rest of the group, but he still went along with their idiotic antics. Bella hadn't seen him offer any stronger objections to Pat and the others' ways of acting like douches than mild annoyance. Not once had she seen him try to stop Hank's bullying, James' verbal abuse of anyone he pleased, or Pat just being an ass to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella worked her jaw, trying to get the bad taste seeing these guys brought to her mouth. Smirking devilishly she stood, moving the shrink ray behind her back as she slinked over to her targets. \"Heya, boys! Long time, no see!\" She called out, putting on her best smile. \"Hittin' the waves early, eh Pat? Guess little ol' me splittin' didn't rock your world <i>too</i> bad. You're even usin' that surfboard I bought you!\" Mentally, she added <i>Then you broke up with me the <u>next day</u>, you son of a bitch!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group all stopped, staring at her in surprise...well, surprise in Pat's case. The others just looked at her with contempt, or (in Hank's case) mouthed <i>Fatty!</i> at her. Bella simply smirked and idly licked her lips--they'd <i>be</i> the fat on her belly and rump before long. \"Bella? What are you doing here?\" Pat interrogated, walking over to her. \"I thought you said you didn't want to be near me or the guys again...something that was mutual, come to think of it,\" he added with a glare. \"So, what're you doing here on our surf day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella didn't even blink. \"Just enjoyin' the sunny weather, <i>Pat-Cat</i>,\" she purred, dropping the old nickname that always made Pat blush under his fur. Her ex looked shocked for a moment, then glared at her again. \"Don't call me that, especially not now!\" he snapped. \"I swear, I don't know why I even--!\" His rant was cut off as Bella moved the shrink ray from behind her back and fired at him. She cut loose with a mooing laugh as her hated ex became a glowing shilloette, then rapidly shrank  down to the size of an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up to find Pat's three friends stomping towards her. Hank was in the lead, jaws open and claws glraming in the sunlight. \"Bitch, what the hell did you d--\" the bully aligator was next, shrunken within seconds. James and Dan soon followed. Bella cackled, throwing off her jacket and revealing the familiar checkered bikini. \"Mmm...this is more like it. I think we'd have stayed together with <i>this</i> set-up, Pat!\" She laughed again, bending down to snatch them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the shrunken quartet, it was like some bizzare nightmare. One second, the annoying bovine girl Pat had gotten rid of showing up to ruin their fun...then in a red flash, she was--<i>gigantic!</i> Huge! A skyscraper of a heiffer; the plump belly, breasts and behind they'd all stared at..and sometimes pinched, in the case of her butt..looked like they could crush buildings under their weight. Profane shouts and high-pitched screams flew from the guys' mouths when they saw Bella, now a vengeful bovine goddess to their tiny perspectives, bending down and reaching for them. They tried to run, but disorganzied and terrified as they were they had no chance. Bella's hand slapped down into the sand when they were all clustered together, then closed in around them, shrouding them in darkness and the sheer pressure of her fist, held open just enough to not crush them outright and let the sand fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hand soon opened into a palm, and Pat and his friends found themselves looking right at Bella's giant smirking face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella snickered, savoring her captives' looks of terror. \"Surprised, ya jackasses? Well, any of ya remember Ingrid, the hippo? Well, she built us some shrink rays to get some good old-fashioned payback. Nobody's gonna push me an' the rest of the girls around ever again! And as for the four of you, I have somethin' planned and it ain't pretty.\" She tilted her head and eyed Pat. \"Especially YOU, <i>Pat-Cat</i>. But I'll save ya for last, just 'cause of all the <i>great</i> times we shared. Oh, and here's a choice: Gut, or Butt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat trembled, all of his bravado gone as he looked up at his titanic ex-girlfriend. \"W-what? B-Bella, what is this even--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I asked, Pat!\" Bella chided, shaking a finger at him with her free hand. \"Just pick one: <i>Gut</i>...or <i>Butt</i>?\" she poked her belly, then her rear as she spoke, as if talking to an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...B-Butt.\" Pat stuttered, terrified of what might happen. \"W-what was th-that a-a-about, Bella...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella mooed in wicked delight. \"It was about how Ah get rid of ya <i>for good</i>, you little sidewinder! And since ya chose 'Butt', Ah'll sit on ya!\" With her free hand she roughly pinched the screaming, begging tiger between two fat fingers and held him close to her face. \"That's right Pat--when I'm done with your idiot friends, the last thing you'll ever see is gonna be my big bovine booty <i>squishin' all nine lives outta you</i>. Fittin', since you were always starin' at it.\" With one last laugh she flicked her finger, sending Pat rocketing head-first into her ample cleavage, screaming all the way. She gave him one last push to make sure he couldn't get out, then looked back at her three remaining captives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all cowered away, but Hank seemed to get some of his composure\"Y-You bitch! You psychotic lard-ass BITCH!\" the aligator snarled, standing up. \"You get dumped, and you think you can <i>murder us with your over-sized ass?!</i> Pat should never have even dated you, you grass-eating cu--\" He cut himself off when Bella licked her lips. Hank trembled, his green scales turning white as he stumbled back on her palm. \"N-No...y-you wouldn't....!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i><b>would</b></i>, gator-boy. You called me a 'grass-eater'? Well, not anymore! No more bein' an herbivore for <i>this</i> heiffer...Ingrid ate that twerp Zap, and now it's my turn to have a snack. A girl needs her protein, after all!\" She winked at the trio, who were now all wailing for mercy at the top of their lungs; Bella ignored them. All she could think of was <i>how</i> to eat her first victims...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The gator tries biting on Bella's finger, but it barely hurts and only tickles the bovine titans. \"Now,\" she said. \"I didn't bother to ask Ingrid what Zap tasted like. I think you'll taste no different, what with the whole alligator-crocodile thing. Bella then tossed Hank into her mouth and slowly closed it. The gator tried desperately to climb the tongue but Bella tipped her head back to make him slip and fall screaming down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan and Pat looked in pure fear as a screaming bulge went down Bella's throat. \"Two stomachs down,\" said the giant cow as she patted her bloated belly. \"And two to go.\" Dan tried to jump off of Bella's finger. The hedgehog boy figured it would be better to fall to his death than become part of the cow girl's bloat, but Bella grabbed him by the legs with her mouth and sucked him in as Pat gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce three of the bullies were eaten, Bella let out a loud belch in Pat's face. \"Now,\" she said to the cringing tiger. \"What should I do with you, Pat Cat? Your choice, gut or butt.\" Pat was too scared of his now massive girlfriend to speak and the cow enjoyed it as her belly, breasts and udder shook. \"Fine, I'll decide for you.\"</span></div></div>",

Ignoring the shrunken tiger's pleas for mercy, she gleefully slinked over to a bench--stopping for a moment to enjoy the unlucky thugs' struggles in her gullet--and rose Pat up to her face, giving him one last wink and a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy the view, you flea-bitten thug.\" With that she slapped Pat's form onto the bench, pinning him in place with her hand as she turned and sat on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>pop-crunch!</i> The sound was soft and a bit muffled by her ample rump, but Bella heard it..the sound of Pat's bones crunching under her weight. She let out a mooing cackle at her ex-boyfriend's plight, savoring his pitiful struggles tickling her bikini bottom and the sound of his muffled screams. \"Not so keen on pinchin' it <i>now</i>, are ya Pat Cat?\" She taunted, looking downward. Not that she could see him, Pat was so tiny--and Bella's behind so big--that he had all but disappeard beneath the crushing, fleshy mass. She smirked evilly, twisting and wiggling her cheeks on the bench, setting off more of those <i>lovely</i> little crunching sounds and more muffled groans and screams from Pat--and another cackle from Bella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always knew the way you and your lughead friends treated girls would come back an' bite y'all in the ass!\" She patted her belly, which had started to softly gurgle as digestion set in; already the three bullies' struggles were becoming weaker. \"Didn't think the <i>bite</i> part would be literally, though. Or that it'd be MY ass bringin' the pain. Not that I mind, I'll take THIS over anything else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella kept up her booty-based torment for a bit later, about ten minutes, when she noticed Pat's struggles had gotten a lot weaker. He was still ALIVE, but he wasn't squirming around like he'd been before, and Bella heard far less nice crunches when she bounced or grinded onto him. \"Guess my toy's startin' to break,\" she mumbled with a sad look. She looked down at her belly and gave it a pat, \"Even the Terrible Trio are on the way out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, she could barely feel her snacks moving anymore, and their taste had long since faded from her tongue. \"Well, guess this is the end, or just about, Pat Cat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella decided to...</span></div></div>",

He could not believe it. This was how it ended. \"If I knew how psychotic she was,\" thought the tiny tiger weakly. \"I would've never even interacted with her at all. Where the hell did she get that damned shrinking device anyway?\" Pat tried to claw Bella's behind but it was no use because of how tiny and weak he was and because of how thick Bella's large butt was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there that Bella's behind proved dangerous in another way because at that very moment, the cow titaness let out an enormous fart that Pat was at ground zero of. The foul air struck the shrunken tiger and caused him to mentally scream as his eyes watered and even turned red. \"Oopsie,\" said Bella with a giggle. \"I guess your jerky friends have made me gassy. You shouldn't have hung out with animals with such a spicy attitude.\" \"Sadistic witch!\" thought Pat to himself. \"Just get it over with already.\" Pat grunted in pain as Bella continued to bounce up and down on him and then continued to smother him as she wiggled her behind and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Bella was having her sadistic fun, she failed to notice that her shrinking device had fallen out of her pocket and landed in the sand by her feet and she had inadvertently pushed it further into the ground. But Bella had no idea that she had dropped the shrink ray. Surely Ingrid wouldn't be happy about Bella losing the shrink ray but Bella was having too much fun to think about what would happen and then got up with Pat scrunched into the back seat of her pants. She sat on him for so long that he was plastered to her rear. He was still alive, but he was in such bad shape that he couldn't move. Bella laughed like a noblewoman and then looked back at Pat still stuck to her monumental booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"You're right where you belong Pat Cat. Now, let's take the torture elsewhere.\" Bella grabbed and squeezed her cheeks as she walked away, making sure that there was no way that Pat could escape. But as she was walking away, she had walked away from the shrinking machine, leaving it on the beach where anybody could find it. At that moment there were two girls who were walking by and were about to find the shrinking ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first girl who was walking up to the shrink ray was Selena, a copper-furred moose girl dressed in a punk-style outfit, complete with a skull t-shirt and a red jacket. She was so busy reading a book on her phone that she wasn't paying attention to where she was going. The other girl walking forward was a red haired goth girl ostrich named Morgan who was carrying an umbrella to avoid being caught in the sun as she cast a shadow over everywhere she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who finds the ray gun?</span></div></div>",

The bubbles tickled her forked tongue, just like she always loved and the flavor made her smile--it was even the soda flavored with real fruit juice, her favorite. Finishing off the glass bottle, she smacked her lips and flicked her tongue a few times and stared at the ceiling, slitted eyes squinting. \"Thanks, Jasmine. I kinda needed one of my old favorites; some pop always helps me think.\" The iguana girl set the emptied bottle down on the granite counter-top with a little <i>clang</i>, but not without making sure it was free of leaks first. Messing up a house as swanky as Jasmine's always made her feel like a slob. She laid back in the chair, idly patting her pocketed shrink gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine chuckled and answered, \"Hey, what are friends for? I know you love the stuff, plus it makes great floats when you get bored with root beer.\" The vixen was bending over her opened refrigerator and presenting her silver-furred behind to anyone who would walk in as her tail swished from side-to-side. \"Besides, you wanted to talk to me about, heh, tomorrow?\" she giggled on the last word, backing away from the fridge with a plate of sandwiches in her hands. With a quick rump-bump, she closed the fridge door and walked over to join Heather. \"It's gonna be fun, seeing those jerks the size of ants...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather hissed as Jasmine joined her, taking a pastrami sandwich. \"That's just it, though...I'm gonna do this, those damn racist bastards kicked me off just because I have scales!

Zap was a creep and a sleaze; he was gonna get <i>something</i> for all the times he bothered Ingrid or any other girl, but...Ingrid's first thought was to <i>eat him alive?</i> She always had a temper, but I never thought she'd do anything like that! And Bella cheered her on for it! You were the only one who said you were against unnecessary killing, Jasmine; I could only bring this up with you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine's expression was calm. \"You think this'll go to their heads. That they'll do something stupid, like shrink and eat random people for no reason,\" she surmised. She couldn't help but smirk when Heather perked up; Jasmine liked it when her intuition was right. \"I wouldn't worry about it too much, Heather,\" she consoled, putting a paw on Heather's scaly hand. \"Ingrid seemed pretty keen on keeping this a secret, and I don't think there are many people she hated as much as Zap. Same with Bella and her ex-boyfriend. Besides, they never said we <i>had</i> to just eat or squish anyone we shrink. We could just keep 'em as pets, like I'm gonna do with that thug <i>Professor Ivan</i>--\" she growled at the mention of the stubborn, hostile Chemestry teacher, but got control of herself quickly. \"--And remember, Ingrid built a reverse button so we can grow folks back to normal. And no, it can't make us big; just un-shrink.\" She smiled at her iguana friend. \"Nobody said you had to <i>like</i> them eating the poor saps that piss them off. I'm a carnivore, and I'm put off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather grinned, sighing as she let her tension go. \"...Thanks, Jazz. I needed that.

Characters can grow or shrink to any size and everyone should remember, turnabout it fair play! :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurnabout is one thing i really enjoy, especially herbivores getting their own back on carnivores :D<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease leave a review and hopefully a comment!  Would be nice :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Authors Notes:  If you are looking through my story and see a storyline which isn't fully finished and you have a suggestion/idea on how you would like it to continue or end, feel free to send me an email to get me to post for that chapter.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo anyone who wants to can give me a poke if you want a chapter added in a particular place as they were get priority in my updating. :) </td>",
