As you near the building, you see that there's a window open on the ground floor. You double check that no-one's around and you jump through the open window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you land in the hallway on the other side, a blue beam engulfs you from the wall, which you see as what appears to be a security camera. Only the beam isn't hurting you. You quickly dash into a nearby darkened room to hide. As you close the door, you realise it's the main entertainment room, and then you drop to your knees.....you feel so weak, it's hard to regain your footing, and your eyes close, really slowly. As you fall unconscious you feel like you're in a elevator that won't stop going down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come to, your head is pounding, you must have hit it when you fell over. You try and regain your bearings, and then it hits you.<br>\r\nYou're in a giant entertainment room.....no, wait....you're tiny in a normal sized entertainment room!<br>\r\nYou see a enourmous overturned sneaker on the floor and walk over to it, mesmerised by the size of it. As you get there, you see the size tag on tongue. SIZE 12. You can't believe that this shoe is a size 12. You realise you must be around two inches tall, and you're in a celebrity's house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to make a decision about what to do now, when you hear a lot of shouting and jeering. The house's owner is throwing a party it would seem, and they're coming this way. You hold your breath and jump into the upturned sneaker for cover, as the door swings open, and the mansion owner walks in, followed by his other famous guests.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who is it?</span></div></div>",

He is followed into the room by another giant English soccer player, Steven Gerrard. His flip-flop shod feet are also in full view too. He's not followed Wayne into the room fully and is just standing there, leaning against the wall in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Wazza!\" Steven says, \"What time the others gettin' 'ere?\"<br>\r\nWayne smiled, \"It's not often I get the house to myself from Colleen, so they'll be here shortly, go get some beers out of the kitchen!\"<br>\r\nSteven nodded and left the room, his flip-flops going THWACk-THWACK-THWACK as they go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention back to Wayne, and you decide you gotta get his attention, so you climb out of the sneaker and walk towards the huge man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach him, he's putting on a CD, he's kneeling down, with his feet behind him, resting his butt on his heels. You see his massive soles before you and his ten enourmous toes there too. You're about to make a decision about what to do, when the decision is out of your hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your hearts stops and you stand with your jaw dropped as your hero, Aaron Carter walks into the room, closely followed by his friend, fellow teen idol Jesse McCartney. The two look like gods as their long, pillar-like legs stomp almost in slow motion across the room. You notice that Aaron is barefoot, as he likes to get around that way. Jesse is dressed casually in jeans and sneakers, and follows Aaron around the room like a puppy dog waiting for attention from its owner. Aaron calmly switches on a cd, then wanders to the centre of the room.. If you didn't know better, you'd think he was enjoying the attention from Jesse, which he is atleast pretending to ignore so far. You can't help but notice the intriguing chemistry between the two. \"Wow..\" You say in total awe of the giant celebrity, who happens to be standing under a light which illuminates his golden blond locks beautifully. You wish you could look half as angelic and handsome as Aaron.. \"I can't believe I'm standing on Aaron Carter's bedroom floor.. If I could only work up the courage to get a little closer, I'd be able to say I'd touched Aaron Carter's foot!\" You struggle with the idea, unsure how Mr Carter would react if he saw a two-inch fan fondling his bare feet.. Aaron turns to Jesse, who is now sitting self-consciously on the corner of his friend's bed, and says: \"Damn, I'm getting cold.\" Aaron's feet are starting to turn- What if he walks away? What if he SEES you?? It's time to make a move..</span></div></div>",
