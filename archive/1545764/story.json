She had a date with Leo tonight and was just getting ready. She looked at her reflection, with her hands on her hips, twisting from side to side to see her little red dress from all angles. It was a while since she'd worn this dress, now that she thought about it. Was that really her bum? Did this dress always make it look so...round? She knew she hadn't put on weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her concerns to one side for the moment, she pouted at her reflection, gently applying lipstick. She rolled her lips to cover them completely. Perfect. She grabbed her purse and left the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I *love* the dress.\" Phoebe told her in the hallway, stopping to look. \"It really shows off your figure, too.\" Piper almost frowned at the compliment, since it came dangerously close to what she'd been thinking about her weight. She shrugged it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Phoebes.\" She looked over her shoulder at her sister and waved as she left the house. Leo was going to meet her at the restaurant since he'd be orbing in from the Elders anyway.</span></div></div>",

She hadn't dared bring it up yet. And this was the night. If she couldn't convince him that letting her gain would make her look even better and wouldn't interfere with her duties, then she'd just leave it alone. She was willing to make that sacrifice for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo orbed into the bathroom and joined Piper at her table. She was absentmindedly finishing of the last of the bread sticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo!\" Piper exclaimed in surprise, shocked out of her daydreaming when Leo leaned over and kissed her cheek. \"Leo, I've got something to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds ominous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's not.

The great swell of spaghetti had faded, although she still wasn't very hungry after such a stuffing. Nevertheless, the enticing scent of bacon had wafted up from the kitchen and she was beginning to wonder whether to luxuriate in her warm, cozy bed for a while longer or head downstairs for bacon. She was still trying to decide when Leo entered the room quietly. He smiled to see that she was awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you might like breakfast in bed.\" Leo smiled and passed her a tray piled with far too many bacon sandwiches. Even if she was hungry, she'd never have finished all of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted me to pig out, so you brought me bacon?\" She laughed. He blushed. \"Okay, then. I'll be your little piggy this morning. But I don't think I'd ever be able to eat all these.\" She picked up a sandwich and bit into it. Oh, wow! That was the finest breakfast she'd ever tasted! It was like a wedding in her mouth, between her tongue and this perfectly cooked bacon. She took a much larger second bite, as though trying to fit the whole thing into her mouth. In fact, that was exactly what she was doing. It was so good! She finished and took Leo's face in her hands and kissed him, passionately. \"Have I told you how much I love you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo looked deep into her eyes, brushed a hand through her hair and said \"Show me.\" He looked down at the tray of bacon in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was truly, absolutely finished, there was just a little over half of the sandwiches left. She felt like she had just swallowed a bowling ball. Her belly sat in her lap, stretched and tight, beneath a loose-flowing pair of pyjamas. She breathed in and out heavily, very carefully running a hand around her sensitively swollen stomach. Leo leaned down a little and kissed her. On a daring impulse, he spoke to her lovingly. \"That's my little piggy.\" </span></div></div>",

The gain was growing so noticable that she had felt the need tell Paige and Phoebe about the plan to avoid any awkward 'diet' advice. Phoebe had taken it really well, while Paige had actually mentioned some feeder ex-boyfriend who she would have gained weight for herself if he hadn't turned out to be a complete sleazebag for other reasons. Since then, they'd had a night of sisterly bonding over takeout to which boyfriends were not invited. Pheobe, who was ordering, had even doubled Piper's order without asking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the second-most noticable thing about her constant stuffing. She had grown inured to enormous meals and snacks in between. No longer was a single large pizza enough to make her sleepy. Now, she was on her way home from a date with Leo at which she had eaten a large chicken salad for a starter, a sixteen-ounce steak for the main meal, a large slice of hot chocolate fudge cake with whipped cream and now that they were almost home, she was thinking that she might manage to also eat a snack before bed. Not much, just a pint of ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, before anyone saw that, they saw her figure. It was as womanly and curved as it had ever been, with an almost ever-present swelling in her belly from the food she was regularly stuffing it with, and a large, well-padded seat cushion of a backside. She didn't waddle yet, which was something she looked forward too, but her legs did rub together when she walked. Her jeans had all been getting so tight that she needed to replace them and her other clothes were beginning to show themselves more and more often. Even in this dress she was wearing now, the seams around her hips were about to go. This would probably be the last time she wore this without bursting out of it at some point in the night. </span></div></div>",

She was always attractive of course, in a slender sort of way. But now! Now she was a voluptuous vixen! She was a sultry seductress! She was finally starting to get a tiny bit of a potbelly and a really big bubble-butt, if nothing else. He hugged her, mostly as an excuse to press himself against her soft, supple stomach and let her feel the erection that she had produced while fully clothed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my! Well,\" said Piper, \"I didn't realise that we were staying in tonight.\" She kissed his lips. The kiss gave him an after-taster of a creamy sauce, the remnant of her pre-dinner snack. \"Which take-out should I order first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I would like to talk first.\" Leo told her. He smiled to let her know that it wasn't anything serious. \"I want to talk about the fact that you have finally done what you set out to do.\" Piper looked up at him and realised what he was asking. They may have agreed on a size ten, but that was a whim, almost a joke except that they followed through with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to know if I want to keep getting fatter, even though I've already reached my goal.\" She wasn't asking, but he nodded anyway.

She wore the same \"baggy\" pyjamas that she had worn when Leo persuaded her to eat half a tray of breakfast for the first time. But now, they were starting to get snug. They used to be one of the loosest items of clothing that she had. Now, she could feel a draft over the top of her buttocks, where they peeped out between the top and the trousers. Her buttocks were like a pair of bowling balls made of jelly, gently sloping down into her overstuffed cushion thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo had bought a large chocolate cake, to celebrate. Even with the way her stuffing had increased these last six months, she still thought that this was a bit much when he told her that it was all for her. She had been slowly shoveling it in, one spoonful at a time. Since he was watching, she made a show of it, moaning as though in orgasm. By the time she finished the cake, her t-shirt had ridden up over a hemisphere of taut belly. As she was sat with him in the living room, her fleshy backside had spread, filling out her seat like never before. Her soft, yielding flesh brushed up against his firm muscle. As she cradled her stuffed stomach in one hand, she heard Phoebe arrive and sit down. Phoebe looked over at the loving couple enviously after a date with Cole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, I wish Cole would ask me to stuff my face.\" She licked her bottom lip. \"That chocolate cake looked so good. And you got to eat every little bit of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper looked over at her and back to Leo. Licking the chocolate butter-cream off her lips, she said, \"You know what? You're right.

They\u2019d been seated at a table for four, so that she could spread out on the bench-side instead of worrying about her ass overwhelming a single-seat chair. When Leo fetched her tenth plate, she\u2019d finally felt too stuffed to eat anymore and they left, stuffed and horny, to make careful, tender love at the manor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came down to find Paige in the living room, watching a cheap, crappy comedy. It was something about spies in costumes or whatever. They didn\u2019t really pay much attention, sitting on the biggest sofa and cuddling. Leo barely took up any room, but Piper\u2019s thighs were so big, he was still half-squashed by the weight of her fat. He was happy to sit there and rub a hand along her huge hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass was bigger than she'd even dreamed of before she started really gaining. Her buttocks flared out into a kind shelf of pure fat, drawing in Leo\u2019s eyes with their jiggling whenever she stood up. Her long legs had swollen, spilling across seats and splitting more than a few pairs of tights. She\u2019d had to replace her whole wardrobe again, obviously, but more so than anything else, she\u2019d repeatedly been forced out to buy more pants. Even the stretchiest of her old pants had been a snug fit when she tried to put them on last, and that was a couple months and several pounds ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs had begun rubbing together, which combined with the heavy jiggling ass to make her waddle just a little when she walked. When that had first begun, she thought about maybe slowing down her eating habits a little, till she saw Leo\u2019s excitement when he watched her climb the stairs to bed. On the contrary, she\u2019d decided, now was the perfect time to increase her eating habits dramatically\u2026</span></div></div>",

She'd had another burst of inspiration when she realised that she was only a dozen pounds short of three hundred with a whole month left before her 300lbs anniversary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a month of drinking thick double-cream like it was milkshake, and eating nine meals a day, she was ready to weigh herself. She'd grown such a fat ass that she couldn't sit in any single seat in the house. Her and Leo barely fit together on the two seat sofa, leaving his lap and her armrest half-covered in th heavy, jiggling fat of her thighs. Her upper half was merely plump, edging into the lower end of fat. But from the level of her waist, she exploded outward in all directions, a shelf of fat that wobbled as she waddled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something new, too. She didn't walk anymore, she waddled. Her legs got in the way of themselves when she tried moving, so she had to roll her thunder-thighs around each other. Embarrassingly, she found it kind of a turn on, so anything more than a short stroll to the table left her a little horny. And when it was a short stroll to the dinner table, the prospect of food had now been so linked with her gaining that it had the same arousing effect...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, she suspected that Leo might have designs on several dozen more, before he would even bring up the idea of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever the sisters ate together, if it was Piper's turn to cook, she had found that Phoebe and Paige struggled to finish the portions she served. Where Piper had once eaten only at mealtimes, by now she had a near constant appetite for small amounts of junkfood. Her stomach seemed to have almost an endless appetite, as long as she indulged in varied food, never gorging herself only on a single flavour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing in her closet that fit was any older than about three months, since she regularly grew out of the comfortable range of her clothes. She kept hold of some for the sexual thrill of teasing Leo with a six-month old pair of trousers clinging like a second-skin or a nine-month pair, with the buttons long since popped off and now unable to even wiggle past the widening midthighs. She had grown a little potbelly. Her breasts, though not small to begin with, had begun to seem small, if only by comparison as they were steadily ignored in favour of her bottom half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Piper sat in once familiar chairs, she felt so cushioned that she was aloft. When she walked in the house, she was often greeted by the doorframe, brushing one of her hips even though she remembered the seeming gulf that had once passed between her on either side of doors. Only the wide and generous halls of the Halliwell manor still felt like halls. When she walked in lesser buildings, if she tried to stand aside while others passed by, she could still feel them, pushing into her plush, warm backside, rubbing against it whether they wanted to or not. Her swollen thighs had begun to force out her legs as she walked, giving her a slower, waddling gait that made her bulbous buttocks wobble. Leo found it almost as much of a turn on as watching her eat, and she had to admit that it felt strangely sexy. </span></div></div>",

An extra large triple cheese, stuffed crust, deep pan pizza should do. A plump waitress came and took the order, and she had begun to turn away before Leo said, \"And the linguini for me please.\" She looked at Leo with mild surprise, then, as though suddenly realising something, she smiled at Piper. When she turned away to go, Piper noticed that her buttocks were like two basketballs in a small sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the sort of thing you meant? Chubby girl in the front, sofa in the back?\" She smiled coyly at Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, broadly, yes. But I wouldn't exactly mind if you gained more evenly. Ghetto booty is great, but belly rolls are almost as good.\" He took a sip of cola. \"But I do think you're the sort of girl who grows a, erm, cushion for the pushin'.\" He seemed a little embarrased now that the shock of finally coming out of the closet wore off. He was raised in a the very early twentieth century, and it felt strange to be telling his date about growing 'a cushion for the pushin'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" She said, ignorant of his inner squirming. \"because I can't promise I'll be able to send it all to my butt. I might have to get kinda fat, before I get close to that sort of size.\" She was actually getting excited. Who'd have thought it? She really did find this whole thing a real turn on. And not just ghetto booty, either. She was getting excited by the prospect of just getting fat.</span></div></div>",

She perused the menu, considered the starter menu, but dismissed it and decided to get to the main course right away. She chose a large bowl of Duck pasta, slathered in a rich plum sauce, that she never let herself eat because it was so fattening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she was feeling the slight stretch of her almost full stomach as she swallowed the last mouthful, licking a stray patch of plum sauce off her hand. Her other hand rubbed the small bulge of her belly, pulling at the dress. She knew that Leo felt as aroused by the sight of her eating as she was by the act, just seeing the look on his face as he watched her rub that little faux-pregnant belly. She calmly waved over a waiter to order dessert, knowing that it was a perfectly innocent request, but feeling just a little like she was ordering a post-meal stripper. She loved the look of surprise on the waiter's face when she clarified that, no, she didn't want a 'slice' of the vanilla cheesecake, she really did want 'a vanilla cheesecake' in its entirety. She told him to bring two spoons, but she knew perfectly well that Leo wasn't going to want to eat any of it, if there was any chance at all of watching her eat the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was even larger than she'd expected, actually. She might actually struggle to eat it all. But the first, decadent mouthful was enough to convince her otherwise. The rich, thick texture filled her mouth like pure, solid decadence. She could just imagine her stomach swelling with fat, even as she ate it. She was halfway through the cheesecake when she realised just how full she was. She really couldn't get any more food in. They had the bill brought and the rest of the cheesecake was boxed up for them. They headed home, peeled her out of her dress and made very tender love. She found that too much movement, even if it was pleasurable, jostled her bulging belly painfully. So Leo massaged her and gently brought her to climax. Afterward, she felt a little less full and ate more of the divine cheesecake, beginning a pattern that continued till she had actually managed to finish the whole thing and simply fell asleep where she was, lying in Leo's arms, utterly satisfied in every way.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was all too aware of how easily she gained weight.

And I tried to do it subtly, only occasionally would we go somewhere that might be fattening, but slowly I started to get, well, over-excited.

What potential? Other than being a witch, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. \"You haven't read the second chapter of your Book Of Shadows, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"It always has the information we need, so it never occured to me to study it for it the sake of studying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are witches right?\" She nodded. \"And you know that, as the Charmed Ones, you have the combined magical power of several generations of powerful witches, right?\" She nodded. \"So why do you always need to resort to the Power of Three? That isn't the power of the Charmed Ones. That's just the power of three witches putting their magic together. Okay, so it works better for you three than any random witches off the street, but that would be the same for any three siblings who were witches, putting their magic together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you saying? That we all need to get more powerful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you see, witches have power that comes from within. Not like wiccas, who draw from the earth, or wizards who learn to force their will onto reality, You tap yourselves for your magic. And so many witches with a large amount of power must have enough self, literally, to channel the power. It's not a matter of gaining weight making you instantaneously more powerful. You still need either a source of magic, like inherited power or something enchanted, or lots of practice to build up the magic. But if a powerful witch tries to stay slim, her magic potential has nowhere to go, only a little trickle can be used. It's like pouring a gallon of water into a pint glass. The majority just spills. But if you have a bucket large enough, then the water fits perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So being the most powerful witches in the world...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would mean that if you want to use your full potential, at least one of you should become the fattest witch in the world, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fattest witch in the...Hey, what do you mean 'one' of us? Won't we all need to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually, like I said, the Power of Three can carry the magic of all three of you. So only one of you really needs to channel it, the other two just need to be there to supply their magic and chant. Of course, you should know, as the eldest, it would be you that needs to channel the power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why are you only telling me this now?\" She asked. She was frowning and rubbing her slender waist. She'd worked hard to stay slim, only to be told 'Stop it, you need to be the fattest witch in the world!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't ask me. I've wanted you to gain weight since we started dating. The Elders are the ones who are obsessed with observing the prophecies about the Charmed Ones. Of course, I didn't necessarily want you to develop your powers more, I just thought that you'd look really good, if you started gaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, that's just fantastic for you isn't it.\" She replied, a little upset that she had wasted all that time at the gym. The thought of not getting fat didn't even occur to her, since it might put innocents at risk. But she did wonder what Pheobe and Paige were going to think. \"I'm sorry, I'm just getting used to the idea. I suppose I should be grateful, not having to go to the gym anymore and being allowed to chocolate whenever I want to. And if you're serious about wanting to see me get fat for you, magic or not, I guess there's really not much reason for me to stay thin anyway.\" Her eyes widened. \"Oh, and I've got all those clothes that are too big right now, but I guess I'll grow into them.\" She sighed. \"And then right out again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know, gaining weight to serve innocents is probably grounds for a clothing growth spell. It's not personal gain if it helps the innocent indirectly.\" Piper smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, bring out the brownies and wheel in the waffles! Big momma's getting fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo laughed. \"Glad to see you're getting in to the spirit of things.\"</span></div></div>",

Not instantaneously, of course, it just makes you gain faster than you normally would. That way, normal mortal victims don't realise that something supernatural is going on. At least, not at first. They blame themselves, for not exercising enough, or faulty nutritional information on whatever they've been eating. Then, when they start dieting and exercising, they realise that something's going wrong, because they still gain. Not as quickly as when they were eating a normal amount, but still gaining. By this point, they're really getting chubby, so when they try telling people that something wierd is going on, most of them just dismiss it as an excuse for letting yourself go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why fatten people up? And why me? Surely they know I'm a Charmed One, so I'd realise something was up right away.\" Piper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do it for two reasons. Firstly, they like the taste of fear, and there is no fear stronger than the feeling that there is something going wrong inside you, inside your very body, and that you can't even understand what it is, let alone stop it. They don't even need to hang around afterward, they can just absorb the fear where-ever they go. And secondly, because they can take a Human form, but only one the same rough size and shape as their own. And all adult Sarden's look about the same as a Human who weighs about 200lbs, with around 100lbs of that being pure fat. Quite a limited shapeshifting ability. Fortunately, they also have their ability to make more Humans gain a hundred pounds of fat. That brings us to why they would fatten a Charmed One, who wouldn't be afraid of a little thing like fat, and will be quick to discover the cause. I think that it may just be a kind of 'tagging' for a younger Sarden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tagging? What, I've been marked for assasination or something?\" Piper asked, her worries banished and replaced by amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean, like a grafitti artist.\" Leo explained. \"They try to find good spots, very public spots, to put their work and sign it with a pseudonym. Then their work can be seen by millions of people. The more public and dangerous the spot, the more likely they are to get caught or killed, and the more prestige they build up by putting their name there. The Sarden's see fat women as more attractive, so the teenagers often look for beautiful thin women to make them fatter and therefore, in their eyes, more beautiful. They see powerful witches, famous figures and very beautiful people as being the most prestigious targets. You are a Charmed One, so you are one of the three most powerful, and famous, witches in the magical world and you are an astonishingly attractive woman. You would be to the Sarden taggers what Helen of Troy was to the Trojans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm the Helen of Troy of fat-loving demons?\" She asked sardonically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just take the damn compliment.\" Leo kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do I stop the gain?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't. Not without using magic for personal gain. But think of it like this. You can starve yourself, and do a lot of sweaty exercise, and gain weight for the next five years anyway. Or you can eat as much as you like, drop all the exercise, and you'll gain a hundred pounds like...\" He snapped his fingers. \"...that. And then, if you want to, I'll show you some potions that help slim you down. Or you might learn to stop worrying and love the bum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, not likely. But wouldn't a slimming potion count as personal gain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potions don't count. Some rituals don't count. Magic has to have *some* benefits, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case...\"</span></div></div>",

I think its not that complicated.\" Leo replied. \"I think they just wanted you. And they wanted you fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what? They like slaves, and they think that if they make their slaves get fat, then they won't be able to run away so easily?\" Piper asked, confused. \"Because that's what shackles are for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite. You see, you are a very attractive woman, and they recognise that. But some people have different standards of what is and isn't attractive. I, for instance, would love you at any weight, although I think you would look good with a bit of a butt.

Wouldn't that be hot?' and left it at that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know, they *are* evil. They try to break rules all the time. The rules about 'no personal gain' are probably the first that they learn how to break. Remember that time the slime demons kept trying to break in to the manor? When Pheobe said 'Why can't all demons be hot topless men in their twenties?' If you were evil, you loved fat, hot women, and your main enemy was a hot woman who dieted and exercised, what would you do?\" Leo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper sighed. \"Good point. Probably fatten them up, even if all it did was annoy them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So don't let it annoy you. Think about it. You are going to gain weight anyway, so you might as well stop dieting and eat what you like. No more sweaty gyms, and all the cannoli's you want. And if hot, fat women attract these guys, then hot, fat women also distract these guys. The fatter the better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about you? Aren't you going to be a bit put off by all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love you at any weight, but you should know, I'm what you might call a chubby chaser.

He looked faintly amused. \"Okay, panic over.\" He said. \"The Elders have told me they're the ones responsible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why? What difference does my weight make to the Elders?\" Piper asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they wanted to make your magic more powerful.\" Leo replied. \"See, as a witch of your lineage, your magic is *within* you. And when you use the power of three, one of you must channel the power of the others. So, you see, the more of *you* that there is, then the more magic you produce. The Elders want you fatter so that you can be more powerful. And I think I agree. The problem with being a Charmed One is that you will be a beacon of magic to all demons, warlocks and other malignant beings. And if you cannot access that magic, it puts you at a disadvantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're just fine with me looking like a blimp?\" Piper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hon, you've got a long way to go before you could even be called chubby, let alone fat. And you certainly won't start looking like a blimp any time soon. Even if you did, I'd still think you were beautiful. If you were a blimp, that would mean a lot more of you to love.\" Leo said. \"But I don't think that the Elders will take it quite that far.\" He paused. \"Unless you'd like to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Phoebe? And Paige? Are they going to gain too?\" Piper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they are Charmed Ones, so they probably will. But as the eldest sister now, you are the one who will channel the other's energy in the power of three. So you should gain more than them. And since the gain will be smaller, but take the same time, their gains will be a lot more subtle. They might even just brush it off as sympathy gain if you don't tell them why you're gaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is sympathy gain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when one person gains, a lot of the time, the people around them also put on some weight. If you gained because you stopped dieting, and exercised less, then you would begin to leave junkfood around the house, and if your sisters hang out with you, you have them sat on the sofa, watching movies with you, and eating *your* high fat snacks. They start to put on a few pounds, but next to you putting on a lot, they don't notice the difference. They check their weight, and they've gained, but then they hear how much weight you've put on, and by comparison, their weight gain is miniscule. By the end of the year, they've put on the freshman fifteen, only they aren't freshmen. And they still don't notice, because everyone else at home has gained it, except you. And you've put on fifty pounds or so. They see how happy you are, because you were gaining intentionally. It makes them think that aybe they don't need to lose that fifteen pounds. Which means that they keep eating the way they have and, of course, they see you sat enjoying yourself, while they go and get exhausted and sweaty at the gym, so they start getting sick of exercise. So they give it up. And they keep gaining and gaining. You gain more, but your sister gain a lot, without intending to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case...\"</span></div></div>",

She always found the constant pressure to be slim kind of a bore. \"Fatten up for your your beloved husband, 'cause all men love a lot of meat on your bones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole laughed. \"Something like that, yeah. You see, it just wasn't right for a rich nobleman's wife to look thin! It was what most people looked like, because they had no access to fatty foods. The fact is that there are lots of women who preferred to look like they could afford so much food, that not did they not starve, they actually got twice the size of their servant girls. And if you were rich enough, then maybe you could afford to feed you servants as well. So, if your handmaidens were fat, but you were even fatter, then you simply *must* be a Queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper thought about that. \"Well, that does make sense.

What potential? Other than being a witch, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. \"You haven't read the second chapter of your Book Of Shadows, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"It always has the information we need, so it never occured to me to study it for it the sake of studying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are witches right?\" She nodded. \"And you know that, as the Charmed Ones, you have the combined magical power of several generations of powerful witches, right?\" She nodded. \"So why do you always need to resort to the Power of Three? That isn't the power of the Charmed Ones. That's just the power of three witches putting their magic together. Okay, so it works better for you three than any random witches off the street, but that would be the same for any three siblings who were witches, putting their magic together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you saying? That we all need to get more powerful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you see, witches have power that comes from within. Not like wiccas, who draw from the earth, or wizards who learn to force their will onto reality, You tap yourselves for your magic. And so many witches with a large amount of power must have enough self, literally, to channel the power. It's not a matter of gaining weight making you instantaneously more powerful. You still need either a source of magic, like inherited power or something enchanted, or lots of practice to build up the magic. But if a powerful witch tries to stay slim, her magic potential has nowhere to go, only a little trickle can be used. It's like pouring a gallon of water into a pint glass. The majority just spills. But if you have a bucket large enough, then the water fits perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So being the most powerful witches in the world...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would mean that if you want to use your full potential, at least one of you should become the fattest witch in the world, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fattest witch in the...Hey, what do you mean 'one' of us? Won't we all need to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually, like I said, the Power of Three can carry the magic of all three of you. So only one of you really needs to channel it, the other two just need to be there to supply their magic and chant. Of course II might be biased,\" Cole wrapped his arms around her from behind and kissed her neck. \"But I think it should be you that gets to channel that much power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why am I only hearing this now?\" She asked. She was frowning as he rubbed her slender waist. She'd worked hard to stay slim, only to be told 'Stop it, I want you to be the fattest witch in the world!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't ask me. I've wanted you to gain weight since we started dating. The Elders, and that damn Whitelighter of yours, are the ones who are obsessed with observing the prophecies about the Charmed Ones. Of course, I didn't necessarily want you to develop your powers more, I just thought that you'd look really good, if you started gaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, that's just fantastic for you isn't it.\" She replied, sarcastically. The thought of not getting fat didn't even occur to her, since it might put innocents at risk. But she did wonder what her sisters were going to think. \"I'm sorry, I'm just getting used to the idea. I suppose I should be grateful, not having to go to the gym anymore and being allowed to chocolate whenever I want to. And if you're serious about wanting to see me get fat for you, magic or not, I guess there's really not much reason for me to stay thin anyway.\" Her eyes widened. \"Oh, and I've got all those clothes that are too big right now, but I guess I'll grow into them.\" She sighed. \"And then right out again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know, gaining weight to serve innocents is probably grounds for a clothing growth spell. It's not personal gain if it helps the innocent indirectly.\" Cole smiled. \"There are all sorts of loopholes to that 'Personal Gain' rule if you know what you're looking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are you waiting for? Magic up some chocolate cake! It's for the greater good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole laughed. \"That's my little piglet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little piglet?\" Phoebe asked, sounding annoyed. But before he could apologise, she grinned. \"I'm a pig, not a piglet. There's gonna be nothing 'little' about me!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not instantaneously, of course, it just makes you gain faster than you normally would. That way, normal mortal victims don't realise that something supernatural is going on. At least, not at first. They blame themselves, for not exercising enough, or faulty nutritional information on whatever they've been eating. Then, when they start dieting and exercising, they realise that something's going wrong, because they still gain. Not as quickly as when they were eating a normal amount, but still gaining. By this point, they're really getting chubby, so when they try telling people that something wierd is going on, most of them just dismiss it as an excuse for letting yourself go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why fatten people up? And why me? Surely they know I'm a Charmed One, so I'd realise something was up right away.\" Pheobe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do it for two reasons. Firstly, they like the taste of fear, and there are few fears stronger than the feeling that there is something going wrong inside you, inside your very body, and that you can't even understand what it is, let alone stop it. They don't even need to hang around afterward, they can just absorb the fear where-ever they go. And secondly, because they can take a Human form, but only one the same rough size and shape as their own. And all adult Sarden's look about the same as a Human who weighs about 200 to 300lbs, with around 100 to 200lbs of pure fat. Quite a limited shapeshifting ability. Fortunately, they also have their ability to make more Humans gain till they are as fat as the Sarden itself. Unless you gain some weight yourself, in addition to the fat they give you. That brings us to why they would fatten a Charmed One, who wouldn't be afraid of a little thing like fat, and will be quick to discover the cause. I think that it may just be a kind of 'tagging' for a younger Sarden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tagging? What, I've been marked for assasination or something?\" Phoebe asked, suddenly much more worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean, like a grafitti artist.\" Cole explained. \"They try to find good spots, very public spots, to put their work and sign it with a pseudonym. Then their work can be seen by millions of people. The more public and dangerous the spot, the more likely they are to get caught or killed, and the more prestige they build up by putting their name there. The Sardens see fat women as more attractive, so the teenagers often look for beautiful thin women to make them fatter and therefore, in their eyes, more beautiful. They see powerful witches, famous figures and very beautiful people as being the most prestigious targets. You are a Charmed One, so you are one of the three most powerful, and famous, witches in the magical world and you are an astonishingly attractive woman. You would be to the Sarden taggers what Helen of Troy was to the Trojans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm the 'Helen of Troy' of fat-loving demons?\" She asked sardonically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just take the damn compliment.\" Cole kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do I stop the gain?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't stop it while it's still working. If you do so using magic, it'll count as using magic for personal gain and you'll just gain twice as much in the end. But think of it like this. You can *starve* yourself, and do a *lot* of sweaty exercise, and *still* gain weight really slowly for the next five years anyway. Or you can eat as much as you can, drop all the exercise, and you'll gain a hundred pounds like...\" He snapped his fingers. \"...that. And then, if you want to, I'll show you some potions that help slim you down. Or you might *grow* to love your potbelly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Not likely. But wouldn't a slimming potion count as personal gain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potions don't count. Some rituals don't count. In fact, if you would like, I do know a few ways to skirt around the whole 'No magic for personal gain' rule. After all, there have to be *some* benefits to the darkside or no one would join up, would they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case...\"</span></div></div>",

Then he starts dating you, working away at your self-esteem and lowering your defences.

Remember, Warlocks tend to do things on a flight of whimsy.

Even if she'd eaten a full belly of food at the buffet, that gain was fast. She didn't even remember indulging herself that much. Was it something she'd done wrong with her magic? But what? Was it a demon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole would know. She rang him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe? What's wrong?\" He sounded concerned. She tried to calm down, trusting that he would know what was going on. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cole.\" She bit her lip. \"I've gained weight.\" Before he could dismiss her complaint, she continued. \"I've gained too much for this to be normal. 6lbs a day! I was wondering if you knew anything about any fat demons or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I'll look into it. Don't worry. I'm old fashioned. I prefer plumper people. And you'd wear it so well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right. Anything I should look out for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd suspect this to be a benign thing.

It's a benevolent genie, so this is what the wisher intended, and it's really is heart's desire, or at least it is going to help someone achieve that. But it obviously can't tell us whose wish it was, nor do we know whose heart the wish is about. The wish is an ancient magic. Not even the Charmed Ones have the power to reverse or stop a benevolent wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was incredulous. \"So you're saying that I'm stuck getting fat? Becuase someone wants me to?\" She rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole tried to sound reassuring. \"Whoever it is, they had to have everyone's best interests in mind. That's the only way for a benevolent wish to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe sighed, and looked down at the stretchy fabric of her cotton pyjamas. \"And this is in my best interests?\" She asked. \"Or is it secretly 'my heart's desire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole shrugged, though Phoebe couldn't see him over the phone. \"It <i>is</i> possible. Not even a Charmed One can truly determine what they really want until they get it or they lose it.\" He said. \"A genie's wish doesn't just take into account your life so far, it also considers life yet to come. Perhaps, when you have gained eighty pounds, you will suddenly realise that you really like being that size and that you no longer want to diet or to exercise. But you never would have known that if you hadn't suddenly gained eighty pounds against your will. Or maybe 'Heart's Desire' is Paige's desire for you and Piper to survive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe interrupted. \"And you think gaining thirty pounds is gonna help me fight demons and win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Cole replied, \"it will actually inhibit you more than it would have done to your sisters, since most of <i>your</i> combat abilities come from actual skill at fighting, rather than just being a witch. And it may be that in a month from now, you must fight a demon that sucks the flesh from a human body, and you will only be able to survive because you have a few dozen extra pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if this <i>is</i> a benevolent wish,\" Phoebe declared, \"then it is a magical gain and dieting or exercising won't make a difference. Well, if that's the case then I might as well take the opportunity to indulge myself.\" She put a hand on either side of her softened belly and sighed. \"Alright, little tummy of mine.

When they met for the first time, Derek seemed surprised that Jesse was so thin, since the only picture anyone had of this mysterious assassin was a high school photo taken when she was eighteen and weighed two hundred pounds. Jesse said she only lost weight because it helped her balance on the motorcycle she used for escaping. Then Derek said it was a pity and suggested she should get a car and put some of it back on.<br>\r\nAt the end of the movie, after the credits rolled, a bonus scene showed them checking through a border to Canada with fake IDs to settle down with the millions they stole. Derek had just grown a beard but Jesse was much plumper thanks to a fat suit for Jolie, and the camera panned to the back seat full of fatty food.

He'd taken her out three times, to various restaurants, ordering the tastiest food she'd ever had, then he'd come out of the closet. The Feeders closet (It was more like a pantry really). He'd loved the way she looked but, he admitted, he was hoping that she would be willing to get fat for him. His fondest fantasy was that each time they went out, she'd eat till she was stuffed. Then he'd order some more, and she would eat that too, just to please him. And if she was willing, maybe she could weigh herself before each date, so he could see how her weight was creeping up and up and up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been intrigued by the idea. It wasn't that she didn't like her figure, as slim as it was. It was simply so tempting to think of just letting go. Never booking another gym membership, never turning down dessert anymore, being happy every time the scales said she was getting fat and lazy. She would have been happily fat by now if Sean hadn't turned out to be a liar. He wasn't lying about loving her figure or about wanting her to get fat. He was lying about not having two other women at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharlene was a dark-skinned woman who weighed 130lbs when she met Sean for the first time and 315lbs when she met Paige for the first time, when she found out that Sean had other women. Apparently she'd been with him for five years, on and off. They'd gotten back together a week before Sean asked Paige out for the first time. Then they'd stolen Sean's phonebook and found another 'current girlfriend', Lo Ping. She weighed 104lbs when she met Sean, and now, only ten months later, she already weighed 197lbs. She'd been living with him for the last month, so they waited up for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the end of that bad relationship. Paige had only gained 10lb, so it wasn't a complete change from most bad relationships, except that this time, thanks to Lo Ping and Sharlene, Paige had been introduced to the BBW subculture. She'd remained penpals with them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, they'd both seemed really happy to have gained. Even if Sean was a bad case, Fat Admirers and Feeders in general seemed to be pretty cool people, from what her penpals told her. She'd envied them the freedom to eat anything, every time they visited each other. She'd be grazing on a salad, and they'd be gorging on multiple burgers, and stopping off for snacks between meals. In fact, Sharlene had gained another 152lbs, just because she loved the feeling of being bigger. Lo had gained 16lbs but that was because she ate so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she thought of Angelina Jolie, in that fat suit, with all that junk food. That did it. She'd decided...</span></div></div>",

Puberty had never brought her any sexual desire for growing a muffintop or gorging herself at a buffet. But she also never saw any appeal in the endless string of diets and gyms that seemed like the popular alternative. She was a junk food junkie, and she knew that, so she kept herself a little softer than other women might have. When she'd met Sean, and he'd said that all she needed to do to make him the happiest he could be was to eat a little more than she would have done, she'd felt a bit giddy at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what if he <i>had</i> turned out to be a scumbag. Plenty of guys were scumbags. Probably more scumbags would have called her fat and demanded that she go to a gym and sweat till her muscles hurt and her clothes stank. Like Sharlene and Lo before her, Paige was beginning to realise that getting fat would be easy and enjoyable just for it's own sake, without trying to please a guy. She could eat all she wanted to and not only would she not feel bad, she could actually be even more pleased if she <i>did</i> burst her jeans open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige parked in the drive with a new resolve. She picked up the phone and cried out to the manor. \"Hey, guys? I'm thinking about ordering takeout! Does anyone want anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe wandered out of the living room. \"Piper's out to eat with Leo, remember? What were you gonna order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Hu Chins? I fancy Chinese.\" Hu Chins was an pretty good restaurant nearby that delivered quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just make sure you get noodles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, believe me, I will...\" Paige said, drawing an odd look from Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, the dining room table was festooned with empty cartons. Paige could feel her belly stretched like it had never been stretched before. Phoebe, who had been shocked at the sight of so much food, had given in much earlier but continued to sit with Paige, cradling her own stomach and uttering the nonverbal moans of the pleasantly stuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man,\" Phoebe enthused. \"That really hit the spot. About seven times, in fact. I don't know what gave you the idea to order so much Chinese but you were <i>soooo</i> right! Jesus.\" Phoebe looked at her stomach, then at her sister. \"I ate so much, it actually almost hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige smiled. \"That, Phoeb's, is <i>exactly</i> why we did what we just did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaat?\" Phoebe looked at her stomach. \"I am confused. And fat. And happy. But mostly fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. We are <i>not</i> fat. After about a year of this, I'm probably <i>going to be</i> fat. But not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe looked at her, brow furrowing. \"Do you <i>want</i> to get fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not particularly. But I think it's pretty much inevitable, if I want to keep eating like this.\" She gently rubbed her swollen stomach and covered up a quiet burp. \"And I definitely want to keep eating like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay.\"</span></div></div>",

But even then, those two months were happy memories for Paige, marred only by the thought of Sean.

Some were fat, some were thin; some liked eating, some liked feeding. And if she did feel like getting fat, then these were the people to ask! In fact, it was well-past time that her old friends visited her new home, met her new family, and found out about her new life. Or, her new <i>lives</i>, she should say. Her new witch - whitelighter - feedee - feeder lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she did when she got home was to ask Phoebe about possibly inviting some old friends over and explaining their shared history. Phoebe was delighted by the idea of meeting people from her sister's past. Piper was out, on a date with Leo, but she was sure to say that she didn't mind company for a few days. The manor was more than large enough for guests. Even such large guests as Paige's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige then told her about the feeder community. And her potential involvement in it. Phoebe was intrigued, having known that some people preferred much bigger people but never having considered it that much. They talked for a while, till Paige had to admit that her own knowledge of the subculture was limited. Phoebe fetched down her laptop and they began to surf the internet, with extreme care, to satisfy their curiosity. That was how Piper came to walk in on her sisters skimming through a forum for 'Hefty Honeys' and the 'Handsome Hunks' who love them. After she was somewhat caught up on the conversation, she added her own consent to allowing Paige's guests to stay at the family manor, and the conversation drifted onto more general talk of their pasts and what it was like growing up with or without sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige made the calls to her fat friends, while Phoebe and Piper mocked one another over who had most embarrassing teenage years. Sharlene was due some vacation time and Lo was working freelance quite successfully, so they both agreed enthusiastically, eager to meet this new family and see the manor.

And what your body doesn't realise is, I used the biggest plate they had but I only filled a quarter of it. So you feel like you haven't even eaten a first starter yet, except the soup. By the time you start to think about getting up for more, I'm already there with another plate, a quarter full of BBQ ribs. The real fatty pork kind. And you start eating, and I just take the first plate back up for more, so you can't compare how many ribs I eat, to how many you eat. I come back with the plate and some meatballs and pasta. I take the second plate back for more, even though you would normally feel full. And by the end of the night, you've finished off about two and half of the enormous plates without realising it, and you were full twenty minutes ago, but you only just start to feel it now.\" He rubbed his hand on her belly then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we take you home, and we have to tease the clothes slowly off you, and I massage your stomach. That night, you fall asleep in my arms. And all that food starts to digest, and you get ever so slowly bigger. Then we do it all over again. And again, and again, till you say so. And these,\" He grasped her breasts gently from behind, \"begin to swell and grow, and when I try to hold them, they fill my arms. You get bigger, and softer and I lose myself in you, in your lush fat body.\"</span></div></div>",

In fact the witch who was previously merely cute now radiated a goddess like beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cassie read it seemed there was no way to know in advance if a particular witch in her bloodline would be granted this great power only that when the time was right their power would begin growing exponentially and as her power grew  so would her body to accommodate her increasing power. </span></div></div>",

Well, they might serve food and she really should ease her way into things. Like maybe two dozen chicken wings. For a starter, at least. The bar was nearly empty but an attractive brunette woman was already serving. Asking if they had a food menu, Simone put out a hand to stop the bartender from giving it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just have one of everything.\" Simone said, already eager to start. </span></div></div>",

When they'd been together for a month, he'd admitted to being something called a feeder. As strange as it sounded, he actually liked women gaining weight. In fact, he asked her to gain weight for him. He wanted her to get fat. Since she'd only been dating him for month, this was a little sudden, in her opinion. She'd turned him down and said that if he didn't like her the way she was, then maybe they should see other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd turned nasty, saying \"If you won't get fat for me, you can go get fat by yourself! And when you can't lose weight and no one else will have you, you'll be begging me to take you in.\" He'd thrown some kind of powder in her eyes and run off. She'd just dismissed him as crazy and thought no more of it till recently. But now she was worried. She hadn't felt like this before in her life. She was craving cheesecake, fatty fast food, greasy spoon cafes and ice cream milkshakes. Not only that but she was giving in to the feeling enough that she already had a gut!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis can't be right, but what to do about it?</span></div></div>",

She'd just been on a vacation to Hawaii and she'd gained while she was away. She meant to, of course. She loved the feel of her clothes getting tighter around her, squeezing around rolls of fat that hadn't been there before. She had gone to Hawaii on an all inclusive vacation to intentionally try and gain a little weight, but even then she had no idea how much she could pack on when she was there. She was a little shocked, but in a pleasant way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a mouthful of M&amp;Ms from her carry-on luggage. Now she'd worked up an appetite again. She'd see how much weight she'd gained. She'd reward herself with a visit to The Cheesecake Factory if she'd reached her ideal gain of ten pounds, which seemed likely from the way her belly felt, like a big bag of custard. She stood on the bathroom scales. She watched the dial spin past her pre-vacation weight of 123lbs, and right past her expected weight of 143lbs. It bounced a little, but it settled on 150lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 27lbs gain? In just over two weeks? Was that possible? Could she have gained that much? She did have to squeeze into her clothes to get them on to fly home in. And these used to be baggy, didn't they? She fished out a tag on her jogging bottoms. No wonder she hadn't noticed her rapid gain! She'd been wearing clothes two sizes larger than she thought she was! But how had she gained so much? </span></div></div>",
