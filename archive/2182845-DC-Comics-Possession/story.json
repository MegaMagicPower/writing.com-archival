On this special day, you were hit with a magical blast of energy from out of the blue. The blast left you without injuries, and instead gave you a special ability without compare. You had gained the ability to possess any super hero you wished to, the only restriction was that it must be a woman, which you didn't even consider a downside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never tried this power out until today, a day you were particularly curious about the female body. You were without instructions on how to use this power, but you felt that simply thinking of a super heroine would allow you to possess her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choice to you was obvious, Wonder Woman would be the perfect test subject! Her beautiful black flowing hair, her long and tone legs, her gracious curves, all of these were just perfect to fulfill your desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes to focus your thoughts, leading them toward the image of Wonder Woman in your head. You felt a tug in your chest as you began to feel disoriented and your head felt fuzzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, you felt your soul tear from your body and rocket to an unknown direction at thousands of miles an hour hitting a sudden stop when entering a blurred figure. You gasped a shaky breath as your vision returned to you. You took a few minutes to let yourself get orientated with your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in a room full of ancient, modern, and advanced weaponry as well as practice dummies. A bed lay against one of the walls, but other than that it was almost bland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it wo-HOLY CRAP!\" You covered your mouth as you heard a female voice escape your lips. You looked down for the first time and saw two well sized mounds of flesh covered by a patriotic looking bathing suit. A wide smile ran across your face and a cheer left your mouth as you leapt into the air with a fist to the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had done it! You were now Wonder Woman! And oh just how wonderful it felt to be in her! Her long luscious black hair, toned legs, magnificent figure, all at your hands. You felt strength run through every part of your body as you flexed every muscle you could. You kept getting warmer as you admired Diana's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do with it?</span></div></div>",

That blast must have screwed you up pretty bad, you didn't even... feel like.... \"AAAAAAH!\" You let out a girlish scream as you finally get enough of yourself together to notice that you certainly weren't where you fell asleep, and you<i> really </i>weren't feeling yourself. You spring up out of the bed and run to the room's nearest mirror, clutching the sides of it as the manic looking blonde woman in it shoots you a look of crazed shock and fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly problem, you were very quickly aware that the blonde woman in her bed shorts and tank top was <b>you</b>. \"What in th' HELL happened t' me?!\" You yell out loud, noting very quickly your girlish Brooklyn twanged voice. \"Okay Charlie, calm down, ya gotta chill...\" You tell yourself, trying to find comfort in your reflection but failing due to... well, it not being YOU in there. \"Aaaaaaaw DAMN IT! Why th' hell am I <b><i>HARLEY FRICKEN' QUINN?!</i></b>\" This would be the most insane thing of your life... and it was, but you were now a wanted man- woman?
