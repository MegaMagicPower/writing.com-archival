The wand isn't spontaneous, It will either always be in a plus mode in universe, and minus mode in the other. The wand can only work if there is an opposite to the desired out come. I would like to make it so that every story in one universe has a parallel in the other universe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Plus universe will have the character continue as the true intentions are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minus universe will continue as though the consequences of the wand was what the user wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am going to begin with one male character as the protagonist, but will add more later. </td>",
