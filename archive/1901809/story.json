Born with the \"Hands of the Sun\", his naturally warm digits can ferment the dough faster and better than normal bakers. Not exactly the sharpest guy around though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: Tsukino: The second (and illegimate daughter) of the son of the founder and owner of Pantasia. She is the current president and harbors a crush on Azuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: Kyosuke Kawachi: A less than talented baker with a lot of guts and a sharp taste (leading to many ridicolous reactions). Known to scream, \"What do you mean?!\" a lot. Trained himself to have the \"Gauntlets of Sun\", hands that have been warmed through muscle training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4: Shigeru Kanmuri: A genius food scientist and baker with a mastery of yeast. Also has a pretty face that looks Tsukino's close up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut we have more if none of these are for you</span></div></div>",

Is that Tsukino?\" asked Azuma, as he, Kyosuke Kawachi, and Shigeru Kanmuri had been talking about new ideas for breads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Its me! Now please open it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...but why? Its unlocked so you...\" began Kawachi, walking over and opening it. What he saw next made his eyes widen and a very familar phrase come out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"?!!!\" went Azuma and Kanmuri, as Kawachi was bounced back and a huge figure squeezed through the door and waddled into the room. It was like a giant sphere with hands and feet, and light green colored skin. It had a puffy, yet familar face, with two bows in its hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TSUKINO?!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me...\" whimpered Tsukino, looking like a gigantic human melon. She jiggled slightly and when she moved even a bit, there was a rumbling like she was full of some kind of juice. The added mass had not only made her incredibly wide, maybe around 4 or 5 feet, but she was now taller. She probably even beat the giantic Manager in height by at least a foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like a giant melon!!!\" shouted a stunned Azuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah...the writer just said that...\" sweatdropped Kawachi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" asked Kanmuri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mizuno...she did this to me!\"<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** *************************<br>\r\n(Earlier)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...this is good!\" smiled Tsukino, as she and her little (half) sister, Mizuno, sat under a tree outside the Pantasia baker's main office. She was eating a new melon bread that her sister was experimenting with. She wanted to see if this could become a good product. \"The melon paste you put in is definitely delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it...and there's a special surprise...\" smiled Mizuno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What is it?\" asked Tsukino, before Mizuno reached into her bag. \"A mirror? I don't get it...\" blinked Tsukino, looking. Her eyes widened when she saw that the end of her nose had turned light green. \"What the? My nose...\" she began, stunned, before realizing the green color was spreading. Tsukino watched in horror as her entire nose turned green, then her face, followed by her neck, chest, stomach, arms, legs; eventually her entire body had turned green. \"Mizuno! What did you do?!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, ha, ha! Like it?! It's my new Udon Melon Bread!\" laughed Mizuno, rolling around in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Udon? But how...wait...\" began Tsukino, \"Udon...sounds like...Uxon....Uxonka...OH NO!!!!\" screamed Tsukino, realizing what Mizuno had done. She knew what was happening as she felt her body getting heavier. It didn't feel like like she was getting fatter and larger...more like she was filling up with...<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ******************************************************************************** *************************<br>\r\n\"Juice!\" grinned Azuma, as he had wiped a little droplet off Tsukino's finger and licked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azuma!\" went Tsukino, turning a bit of red. \"That's my sweat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it tastes like melon juice,\" smiled Azuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, yeah it does,\" said Kanmuri, doing the same. \"You've turned into a giant melon girl...maybe all your bodily fluids have become melon juice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop drinking from me!!!\" shouted Tsukino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you know how I felt when they were eating me when I was a monaka...\" thought Kawachi with a sweatdrop. He then spoke, \"So...why did Tsukino turn into a giant melon girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's simple, Kappa Boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"?!!!\" went Kawachi, turning his head to see the muscular afro-clad manager walking in. He had a man tied up and gagged over his shoulder. \"You know? And...who is that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This? Don't mind him. He's just someone I need to convince of why he should accept a deal with my boys,\" said the Manager. (He was currently the head of a Yakuza gang...long story. Read the manga or watch the anime). \"Anyway...it may not be what a traditional Japanese person knows. Let me ask you this...did Mizuno by any chance use high wheat flour in her melon bread?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! That's what I figured too!\" shouted Tsukino, jiggling a bit as she looked down at the Manager (a first in her life). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH!!! So that's it! Wow...that's a bit of a stretch...but that works out when you think about it!\" shouted Kanmuri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't get it...\" said Kawachi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kawachi...she called it Udon Melon Bread. And udon is made from high wheat flour...\" sighed Kanmuri, \"Udon sounds like uxon...uxon is part of the name Uxonka,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uxonka...wait...that's a candy company...\" commented Azuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uxonka is the Japanese name of the Wonka candy company...a company that was opened conciding with a famous movie: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" added the Manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...I didn't see it. Its a foreign film and my family didn't see it...but I think I heard about a moment a girl who turned into...huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup...a blueberry...\" said Kanmuri, \"Filled with juice and turned a different color...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...melons aren't berries...so how did Tsukino have this reaction?\" asked a confused Azuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the fetish for berry girls started with girls turning into giant blueberries like Violet Buregard did in the movie. But eventually the term became general for any character who turns into a giant ball-shaped fruit filled with its juice...\" explained Kanmuri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kanmuri...how do you know that?\" sweatdropped Tsukino, the drop landing on her tongue. \"Hey...that is good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanmuri turned red as a beet and went, \"That's not important now! What matter is we have to fix this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the movie, they fixed Violet by juicing her...I don't think that may be a good idea to do a real person...\" said the Manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...but we turn into stuff all the time from food...do physics even apply now...?\" sweatdropped Kawachi, before the group went to discuss ideas.</span></div></div>",

If my calculations are correct, my Filler Pan will be a perfect bread for dieters. Not only is it low in calories, but its carbohydrate balance will fill people up and make them snack and eat less. And it'll provide energy for athletes like pasta does. This will bring Pantasia some well-deserved attention...and my genius will be evident again,\" Kanmuri looked around and realized the store was just about closed. Kazuma, Kawachi, the Manager, and Tsukino had left for the day and he was responsible for locking up because he stayed behind for his new bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hey...what about me...?\" frowned Kinoshita, as the mushroom headed man was shadowed in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Guess I'm testing this bread...\" said Kanmuri, before he cut a slice and took a bite. \"Mmm!

He had an earring on his left ear and a shaved head except for a point at the front, making him look like a kappa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess...Azuma made a bread with honey and you ate it?\" asked Kanmuri to the bee, \"I'm right, aren't I, Kawachi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" sighed the bee man, \"Now I get excited when I see bright colors,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's normal. Bees are attracted to bright colors because of flowers,\" said Kanmuri, turning away. \"Anyway, don't touch anything.

I call the Strato-Yeast,\" said Kanmuri, holding up the vial of the bright red powder he was holding. \"Even you know that yeast is required to make dough rise...without boring you with the details, this yeast has this action super-activated to do it at 50x the rate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!!!\" screamed Kawachi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure that's surprising...you see...\" began Kanmuri, before he felt a tugging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it to me!

I need bright things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two struggled back and forth until Kanmuri finally grabbed a nearby newspaper with a free hand and swatted Kawachi away. However, Kawachi letting go caused Kanmuri to go tumbling back and the vial to go flying. Incidentally, Kanmuri landed on his back with his mouth open and the vial just happened to be uncorked accidentally by Kawachi...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGULP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...Kawachi!!!\" growled Kanmuri, feeling the dry powder slide down his throat. \"Do you know how much work went into that?!!!

She was Heidi, the assistant to the great judge, Dave Hisuguchi. Dave was the main judge of a predigeous baked goods contest, being called upon for his exceptional taste. However, years of decadence and gluttony had turned him into a gigantically obese man too large to move under his own power. Not to mention since his mind was shot from his lifestyle, Dave was completely helpless and needed Heidi's help for everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little maid crawled up her boss's huge body like a monkey, and placed a pair of ear protectors over her ears. Other did likewise; if they didn't have protection, they simply covered their ears with their hands and backed away. Dave's method of judging was based on how loud he screamed; the louder, the more he loved the food he just ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, Dave...\" said Heidi, feeding Dave a slice of the pie whole into his huge mouth. Dave chewed happily and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone expected some kind of scream, but that was not the case today. Dave remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? This has never happened...he always react in some way...\" said Heidi, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong? Was the pie bad?\" asked the MC, before jumping back when he saw Dave gag and his head tilt over. Bloody foamy salvia was oozing out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave?!!! DAVE!!!!\" screamed Heidi, trying to shake her beloved boss awake.<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ******************************************************************************** ***********************<br>\r\nIt took some doing (And some heavy lifting equipment), but Heidi and some emergency people were able to get Dave to the hospital and worked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out Dave's pie had been poisoned by some angry contestant. Apparently he was in a contest that Dave judged before and would have won if not for Dave's ruling. This man didn't take it well and decided to try and get revenge on Dave by entering this contest to poison him. Luckily, Dave's huge obesity had saved him this time. His body's enormous size had slowed down the path of damage it caused long enough for Heidi to get help and get him to the emergency room for a stomach pumping. But Heidi was still plagued with guilt since she was the one who fed Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...This wouldn't have happened if I checked the pie beforehand...Dave is a very important man...and some people may not accept his rulings and such,\" said Heidi, as she looked over her boss in bed. An idea then came to her and she nodded it was for the best. \"I will taste test everything Dave eats from now on!\"<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ******************************************************************************** ************************<br>\r\nHowever, that was easier said than done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis declaration meant Heidi had to taste everything Dave was going to eat. Not just at contests, but whenever he ate something. She had to make sure someone didn't slip something in to poison or otherwise harm him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a normal meal for someone like Dave would easily feed a family five times over. Even taste testing just enough meant Heidi had to eat a ton of food to the point she felt like she was going to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd naturally, Heidi soon started to be not so little anymore...</span></div></div>",

I feel this series, with all its wacky food-caused transformations, fits with this genre. But first! Some rules!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: No huge massive instant exansion (No 20,000 lbs in one post!) or sudden desire to become that way. Build up the story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: No short posts. Try to go for at least one paragraph of content!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: No \"or maybe instead\" posts! When you add to the story, you must follow the choice. Do not add \"or perhaps...\" instead! Example: Choice 1: Go to Red Door. Choice 2: Go to Blue Door. Choice 2 should not lead \"Or maybe you choose the green door instead!\" Every link must continue the story! If I see any \"Or maybe instead\" additions, they are getting deleted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4: Put some kind of joke with all food-based reactions. I understand some people may not be as skilled with this, so its not as heavy a requirement as the other rules. But at least give it a shot. if you're confused on this, let explain a certain early situation in the series. When Kuroyanagi ate Kawachi's noodle dog submission, he dropped down to the ground to make the kanji for \"human\" in a body position. He even had a dog sitting where the dot would have been. Another time, when Kawachi ate a tanaka loquat, he turned into a monaka (a Japanese pastry filled with red bean jam) with arms and legs. The joke can be how it sounds in english or Japanese, the ingredients used, and/or the baking method.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5: Don't be afraid to be ridicolous! In the series, people turned into all sorts of wacky stuff just from eating good food. Go nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6: No sex stuff. I don't mind romance (even same-sex if people wish, but no force coupling, ok?) But anything that would sound more like a hentai, keep it to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7: Other people can change and expand during another's arc, but make their arc about them. I don't want Kanmuri's arc to suddenly to be all about Azuma or Kawachi.</td>",
