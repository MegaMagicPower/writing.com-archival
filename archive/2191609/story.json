            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kristen rolled out of bed, dreading going to class today. She went to school at the local college near her house so she could continue to live near her parents. Her mom ran a Gym which is also where Kristen worked and her dad was an inventor who worked mostly out home. Although Kristen now lives in her own apartment, she is only a few blocks from her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen sat up on her bed, pulling the covers off her. She stood up and walked across the hallway to her bathroom, running her hands through her messy hair to try and straiten it. She had shoulder length red hair that she usually had either down or in a pony tail as she didn\u2019t care much to style it. She pulled back the shower curtain and began to remove her PJ\u2019s. After a quick shower, she dried of and went to the kitchen for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nicest part of living alone was being able to walk around naked without the fear of anyone seeing her. Although she never really had a reason to be self conscious. She was skinny at her height of 5\u20196 with a nice pair of large C-cup breasts and respectable hips making for a round butt. 2 bowls of cereal later and she was full. Kristen headed back to her room to get dressed. Opening the dresser, all she saw was a bunch of tank tops. \u201cUgh, I really need to wash my other clothes.\u201d She mumbled to herself. She hated wearing tank tops as she hated guy looking at her cleavage as she walked to class, but would have to deal with as they were her only clean tops, she grabbed the blue one as blue had always been her favorite color. She luckily found a clean pair of jeans to go with it so she wouldn\u2019t have to wear her running shorts to campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she opened up her delicates drawer and began scrounging around for a pair of panties and a bra. Unfortunately, like with her jeans and tank top, she was able to find a nice pair of boy shorts to wear, but the only clean bras she had wear push-up\u2019s she had bought when she used to date her old boyfriend. \u201cscrew it, I\u2019m already wearing the tank, might as well make my pillows look good in it.\u201d She groaned. After getting dressed, she collected up all her school books and stuffed them in her backpack. Throwing it over her left shoulder, she grabbed her favorite purse and threw it over her right. She checked her phone as she was on her way to campus. to her dismay, she had a text from her mom saying her dad wanted her at the house today before going into work. As usual, she was sure this meant he had some new invention he wanted to test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 hours of classes later and she was done. She decided to head strait over to her parents house and finish whatever her dad wanted with her so she could just get to work. Opening the front door slowly, she called out for her dad, \u201cDad! Where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister Karen Walked out and said, \u201cHe\u2019s in the basement Kristen.\u201d Karen and Kristen had never really gotten along in the house, Karen was 16 now and thought she was queen. She was always dying her hair different colors, today she was a brunette. But Kristen had always been the more well behaved child and Karen always blamed her for when she got in trouble for her grades or other thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thanks sis\u2026\u201d Kristen replied. Karen just stared at her the whole time as she walked by to get to the basement door. Each stair creaked under her as she went deeper into darkness. Finally at the bottom, there was a glimmer of light coming from under her dad\u2019s work area door. She walked into his lab to see no one inside. On his workbench she found a note saying: \u201cI\u2019m at the gym with your mother right now be back in 10 minutes. Instructions for the new invention are on it.\u201d She turned to see an odd looking machine that was fairly large. It had a screen on one side with two holes on each end about the size of a loaf of bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen walked over to the machine and examined it. A message pops up on the touchscreen when she tapped it. Next to the entry hole, you will find a blue bar, it is not a candy bar! This machine takes a special kind of material I made that is very malleable and turns it into anything you want. So choose what you want the bar to become and then insert it into the machine. In 10 seconds or so the finished product will pop out the other side. Just make sure not to lose that blue bar, I could only manage to make one. Kristen flipped through idea in her head of what to test first. Finally she though, \u201cHow about another tank top? Ha!\u201d She entered it in and walked to the front of the machine. She stuck the bar in quickly and pulled her hand out quick. She could see inside the machine and was afraid what kind of gear and what not could be in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt roared into life making lots of noises till finally she heard it go \u201cBeep boop boo\u2026\u201d She walked over to the screen and saw an error message. Not enough material, please add more \u201cUgh, Dad wants me to test it and then doesn\u2019t give me enough blue stuff, just like him!\u201d She moved to the front of the machine and looked around for some sort of reverse switch to get it back out. Reluctantly she stuck her hand inside to feel around for it and hopefully grab it out. Unknown to her, the moment she put her hand inside, a message came up on screen, Material found, finishing process. It roared into life again latching hold of her arm. \u201cOh no, this looks bad\u2026\u201d she spat out before it tugged he to the entrance. It continued to pull on her barely getting past her shoulders till her chest reached the bread loaf sized entrance and got stuck. \u201cThank goodness for this bra, it might just save me.\u201d She said with her head inside the machine. \u201cMachine jam, applying compression formula\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what was that?\u201d Before she could find out a nozzle opened above the machine\u2019s entrance and strayed a blue liquid on to Kristen. \u201cBeginning hard entry sequence.\u201d \u201cWhat? That sounds painful!\u201d She screamed. The machine roared into life twice as loud and began to pull hard. To her surprise, her body began to get through the entrance, only now it was getting crushed into a perfectly rectangular shape as it went in. She could feel a bunch of rollers and other things against her body as she was inside the machine. She then felt herself get dropped on some sort of conveyor belt where she saw herself on a piece of reflective metal, her entire body now in the shape of a large rectangle when suddenly she stopped, unable to move or talk. \u201cCombining Materials\u2026\u201d \u201cOh great, what now?\u201d she thought. A hand went past her head and into an opening returning with the blue bar. I moved it down and set it on the center of the flat top of her body that once was her chest. A second later a roller came out and smoothed the blue bar into a sheet that covered most of the Kristen bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conveyor belt began moving the blue covered Kristen bar. As she went along, many hand type things would come down and squish and move her body about. The first few time felt very odd, but it began to feel more normal over time. One of the hands even shocked her as it did its work and that didn\u2019t seem to phase her. \u201cProduct finished!\u201d The machine announced as the exit hole opened up and a shiny blue tank top shot out into a tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, Karen had gotten very anxious as to how long Kristen had been downstairs. Karen Figured that since Kristen had been down there so long, their dad must have made something cool for once and she was hogging it. Karen ran down into the basement quickly, knocking open the lab door in her haste. She looked around for her sister but no one was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen could hear Karen come in and knew she needed her help. She tried as hard as she could to resist, but couldn\u2019t and managed to say from her form, \u201cHey Karen, little help here!\u201d Karen heard her sister but didn\u2019t know where it came from. \u201cUmmmm, on the other side of the machine, in the tray.\u201d Karen heard what she said, but it all sounded so weird. She figured she look there though. Walking around the large machine, Karen came to the exit when there sat a shiny blue tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked it up and said, \u201cUmmmm, ok, do you want me to have it or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo you can\u2019t have me!\u201d Shouted Kristen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren looked over the tank slowly, \u201cUh, Krissy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes its me! Dad\u2019s stupid machine did this to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt turned you into a tank top? But\u2026 how\u2026 I mean, your just like a piece of clothing now. You feel kind of like skin, but also like rubber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god? I\u2019m a tank top\u2026 and I don\u2019t know how it did this to me, I got my hand caught inside and it just grabbed me and used me for material. I don\u2019t even know how I can talk or see and hear right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I have no idea what to do with you, but I know exactly what to do with this tank top!\u201d Karen smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No! I just look like a tank, you can\u2019t just use me!\u201d Kristen shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Sis, all my tanks are dirty and I need to hit the gym.\u201d Karen balled up Kristen into one hand and ran upstairs to her room. she took off her top and jeans and slipped on a pair of shorts and her sister. \u201cYou\u2019re not very big Krissy, you should have made yourself a bit bigger, but at least your stretchy enough to work.\u201d From upstairs the sisters could hear the door to their house open and close as there dad finally got home. He went downstairs to look for Kristen. When he couldn\u2019t find her he searched for Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cKaren, where are you?\u201d He called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn my room Dad!\u201d She shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened her door and saw her standing there in her running outfit. \u201cHave you seen your sister? I can\u2019t seem to find her and want to know how the test went. And where\u2019d you get that new top?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad! It\u2019s not new! Its me!\u201d Kristen pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, Krissy! Don\u2019t tell him, not till I work out in you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad! I got caught inside your machine and it mixed me with that blue bar stuff and spat me out like this. Karen found me and thinks just cuz I\u2019m a tight tank top that she can work out in me! Tell her to take me off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I need to find out how the machine did this to you. But as long as you got sprayed with the compression fluid and have enough of the Blueium in you, you should be fine. But until I figure out how to fix you, it\u2019s probably a good idea for Karen to keep a close eye on you, and wearing you seems like a great idea!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren looked down at Kristen, \u201cAwesome! Lets go for a run Sis.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd make sure to tell your mother the whole story so she know why Kristen won\u2019t be there to work the desk\u2026 Although, if the machine did to Kristen what I think it did, your sister could have tons of new jobs to do at the gym. Now go while I try to figure all this out.\u201d Karen kissed her dad on the cheek as she ran past on her way to her parents Gym wearing her Kristen-tank-top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren figured she\u2019d get some use out of her sister in case her dad did find a way to fix her, so the second she was out the from door, she was jogging. Her goal was to move about as much as she could with Kristen on to punish her sister for always being such a know it all. \u201cHey Sis, why don\u2019t you turn it down a notch while I\u2019m here supporting you!\u201d Karen just chuckled and kept on jogging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir dad quickly went to work in his lab trying to find out what had happened. He looked through all the logs on the computer for the machine trying to figure out exactly what it did to turn his daughter into a shirt. After looking into the logs for an hour or so, he was sure he had it figured out. The Blueium bar he made has the ability form into any shape without getting damaged or worn down. And the compression fluid, when sprayed onto something allows that substance to be compressed without doing harm to its structure. Somehow the fluid allowed Kristen\u2019s body to be crushed a little bit without being hurt, and once the Blueium touched her, the fluid must have reacted with it and during the molding process mixed it deep into Kristen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he was right, she should still be herself just with properties of Blueium (being molded without injury) and of the compression fluid (and become any size). The only thing he couldn\u2019t figure out was that if she was one with the Blueium, she should be able to change her shape freely, he didn\u2019t get why she was stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 2 hours later, Karen returned home sweaty after a long and hard workout. Although warn out, Kristen was still mad she had to be her sister\u2019s gym clothes. The only thing had to be happy about was that when they left, their mom said that Dad had called and he thought he had it figured out. She was ready to be normal again. \u201cCome on Karen, take me down stairs, lets see what Dad\u2019s come up with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know, I\u2019m going\u2026\u201d Karen said panting from her work out. She slowly made her way to the basement where her father was eagerly waiting. \u201cHey Dad, any luck?\u201d Karen said uncaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I have it. I figured out that it was a mix of the compression fluid and the Blueium that allowed the machine to do this to her. And I found some wiring hanging out near the exit of the machine. Blueium reacts oddly to electricity and shocks. If it gets shocked, it loses it ability to form shapes properly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I felt a small shock towards the end right before I came out!\u201d Kristen blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I figured. If so, all we should have to do is do it again and you\u2019ll be like new!\u201d He pulled a small handheld device out of his pocket and touched it to Karen\u2019s chest. A small bolt shock shot through Kristen and into Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch Dad! Give me some warning next time!\u201d Karen yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry honey, but please take off your sister now.\u201d She did so reluctantly, setting Kristen on the floor. \u201cAlright Kristen, I need you to concentrate really hard and try to move.\u201d Just like that, the Kristen tank began to move around a bit on the floor. \u201cGood, now concentrate as hard as you can on being you again.\u201d Slowly the tank top began to expand and move, growing arms and legs and eventually a head. In under a minute Kristen was laying on the floor in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh, it worked!\u201d Kristen squealed! \u201cThanks so much Daddy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now Kristen, your not totally back to normal you see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Kristen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ve just taught you how to restore yourself, You are still a Human-Blueium hybrid. Your form can be changed at anytime with enough force or the right machine. If you wanted, you could put yourself right back into the machine and become anything else. Which you can do if you want now that I\u2019ve fixed that pesky wire. Just remember, if your form gets changed and you get shocked, you\u2019re stuck till you\u2019re shocked again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen looked down at her hands, \u201cCool!\u201d she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRace you upstairs sis.\u201d Karen said as she took off running. Kristen turned and run behind her up the stairs. Karen barely made it upstairs first and right as Kristen was about to go though the doorway, Karen slammed the door shut and her sister ran into it at full speed. Karen opened the door to find her sister flattened thin as paper against the door but now she had a blue tint to her. \u201cHaha, got you!\u201d She peels her off the door and holds her out in front of her. \u201cLooks like you go blue when you\u2019re not you, interesting\u2026\u201d Karen said. She then crumpled up her sister and threw her aside. She walked away laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen\u2019s dad came up the stairs to see a crumpled up blue ball on the ground. He picked it up and undid it to see his daughter\u2019s blue face on it. \u201cGuess when anything happens, the Blueium kicks in and keeps you fine.\u201d He then throws her over the couch and walks away saying, \u201cYou still have work in 15 minutes, so I\u2019d fix yourself up and get going!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arriving home from work at the gym, Kristen threw off her shoes and socks and flopped over onto the couch on her side. Her red hair falling over her face. After a few minutes, she finally began to fall asleep when suddenly the front door swung open and Kristen\u2019s sister Karen, now sporting blonde highlights in her hair, came in with a bunch of her friends. The group was talking so loudly, it was impossible for her to fall asleep. All she wanted was a short nap before heading back to her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked through the living room and sat down around the room in the chairs continuing to talk loudly. Kristen was about ready to to sit up and shout at her sister and her annoying friends when suddenly they all stopped talking and Karen said, \u201cHey Kristen, we\u2019re all going to a party tonight, wanna come?\u201d She thought that maybe this was her sister\u2019s way of repaying her for wearing Kristen as a tank top for working out. Which maybe seem odd, but Kristen had accidentally fallen into one of her father\u2019s new inventions and it had a drastic side effect. Her body could now be molded into almost any size and shape imaginable, at which point she would turn blue due the Blueium that had been in the machine and had mixed into her. That was when she found out that she could change her form fairly freely, but would get stuck if she got any sort of electric shock. But hearing her usually annoying sister invite her to a party was a shock of a whole different kind. Kristen propped herself up on the couch with a smile and looked at her sister and her friends. \u201cWe thought it would be cool to have you there.\u201d Karen told her sister in an honest sounding tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her sister was younger than her, Kristen didn\u2019t go to very many parties. \u201cUmm, sure, I\u2019d love to come!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk good! All I ask is a small favor\u2026\u201d Karen said as if she was some kind of mob boss. Kristen immediately dropped the smile and stared at her sister. She knew that ever since the accident her sister was going to take advantage of her new abilities and was sure this had something to do with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess, you want me to be something for the party?\u201d Kristen said glaring at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the party is formal thing and you have nothing to wear, so I was going to make you into something that wouldn\u2019t be noticed at a party.\u201d Kristen then realized thather sister was actually trying to be nice when she offered for her to come along. She really did want to go to the party with them but had nothing even close to formal. And since the accident her dad had told her to make sure to \u201cexercise\u201d her abilities so she could get used to them and learn to control them better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but under two condition. I don\u2019t want to be worn by you or one of your friends and you can\u2019t just leave me sitting around, you have to carry me around. And did you tell your friends what happened to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, it doesn\u2019t need to be a secret Sis, the more people that know about it, then the more people that can use you if they need to. After all, I bet you could be really useful in a lot of situations, not to mention games.\u201d Karen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we\u2019ll have to see about that.\u201d Kristen replied. \u201cSo when is the party?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts late tonight, but I had some things I wanted to test with you before then\u2026 which is also why my friends are here.\u201d Right after Karen said that, her and all her friends stood up and walked over to the malleable girl. Kristen knew that this was not a good sign. Before she could react, Karen and all of her friends dog piled on top of Kristen, crushing her into the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe all slid off the pile one at a time and as Karen, being the last to get off, moved aside, they all looked down. Each of them were speechless, except of course Karen, \u201cSee, I told you she was malleable now.\u201d She said as she picked up the flat piece of blue material in the shape of her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s really your sister?\u201d one of the girls asked shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, I told you she was like rubber now, she can be molded into any shape and we even have a machine to make her into complex stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen finally oriented herself and looked at her sister who was easily holding her up with one hand. \u201cYou have to warn my before you flatten me! That\u2019s what dad said. Especially since it still take me like 10 minutes to fix my body shape after you mess with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ll be fine Sis, stop over reacting. And since you want a warning, You\u2019re about to become a lot more stretched out\u2026\u201d Just as Kristen said that, their dad walked through the front door and looked at his youngest daughter holding up a large blue thing in the shape of a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you all are having some fun, I heard about the party tonight. Just make sure to be careful and be home before 12, we\u2019re taking a family trip to the beach tomorrow and I want us to be up early for it.\u201d He then walked past the group of girls and headed into the basement most likely to work on his latest invention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad! Ugh\u2026 great, and what was that about stretching?\u201d Kristen asked her sister a bit annoyed that again her dad didn\u2019t care what Karen was doing to the rubber girl as long as they kept it safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019ll be fun, don\u2019t worry, and I\u2019ll actually be able to use this as a way to make you into something for the party, Hehe.\u201d At this point, Kristen knew she wasn\u2019t going to be able to get out of this situation since she promised to go to the party with her sister but not as herself, hopefully she would have an easier job that when she was the tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren rolled Kristen up tight and stuck her under her arm walking into the kitchen. Then, Karen, with the help of her friends laid Kristen out flat on their parents huge marble countertop. Kristen tried to move in her flattened state but it was to no avail, as when she finally started to get her head up, Karen just set the toaster on top of it and pushed it back down again. Now only being able to hear, Kristen could make out the sounds of her sister rummaging though the drawers obviously looking for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she could hear all the drawers close, Karen lifted the toaster off her head so the malleable blue girl could see her soon to be fate. Karen and two of the friends had rolling pins in there hands and another had a spatula. \u201cDon\u2019t look so worried sis,\u201d Karen said even though she couldn\u2019t see her sister\u2019s face in the blue, she knew what she was thinking, \u201cI\u2019m not going to bake you, just make you a bit skinnier, you should thank me really\u2026\u201d Before Kristen could even get in a response they started working on her, pushing done hard with the rollers going up and down her body making her feel taller, skinnier, and worst of all, flatter all at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a few minutes they stopped with the rolling pins and backed away. She felt very odd now, like her body was only a few feet wide and like her head was now just two feet from her head. The girl with the spatula quickly went to work on one of her corners and had it pried up quick. Karen grabbed hold of it with one hand and pulled hard. SLLUURRPPPPP! He body come off the counter with the sound of rubber being silly putty being pulled off a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be just about the right size. . . Here Jenny, you were in girl scouts, can you tie her for me?\u201d Karen handed the new shiny blue ribbon over to Jenny, who, before Kristen could even ask what she meant by tie, had pulled out a hair band and proceeded to tie Kristen around it in a neat bow. Jenny then handed it back over to Karen who took a second to look it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen was now incredibly mad at her sister. Making her a pancake is on thing, but flattening her like that and then tying her in a bow just felt wrong, not to mention she couldn\u2019t seem to speak with her body in such an odd shape. \u201cYou\u2019re so shiny when I mash you up sis, its like your meant to be made into clothes!\u201d Kristen just tried to ignore that comment and remember that all of this was so she would get to go to the party. Sure she wouldnt be able to meet anyone as a bow on a head band but it was better than sitting inside all night and after all, her dad did say she needed to practice her abilities, something Karen was glad to help with. She could especially tell by the way Karen was looking at her while holding her in her hands. \u201cOh, you\u2019re the best sister ever, look how pretty you are! I cant wait to wear you, but first things first, we need to do our hair. And just for your protection\u2026\u201d Karen pulled out a small object that looked like a flashlight but was only the side of her thumb. \u201cOne of dad\u2019s new inventions, to make sure you stay safe while you\u2019re not you.\u201d Kristen knew what was coming and closed her non existent eyes as lightning shot out of the device and into her. \u201cThere, now your just a bow till the end of the night, now stay here while we get ready!\u201d Karen said tossing the hair band with its new bow onto the coffee table as her and her friends ran upstairs to get ready in her bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ugh, I wouldn\u2019t mind my sister using my abilities for fun if she did\u2019t treat me so much like an object when I\u2019m changed. Sure I look just like a regular hair band, but there is a very flat girl twisted up on it. Then Kristen heard the front door open and close, but couldn\u2019t see who it was because of her current situation. All she could hear were soft foot steps all the way over to the coffee table when she suddenly felt herself getting picked up. It was her mom, who was the only one in the family that didn\u2019t know about Kristen\u2019s abilities yet as she had forgotten to tell her when Kristen had worked her last shift at the Gym their parents owned. All her mom say was a shiny blue hair band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really wish the girls wouldn\u2019t just leave this stuff lying around the house. Although, come to think of it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen this before, must be new. That bow is really pretty too, I\u2019ll have to ask her where she got it. Oh well, I\u2019ll just put it back on the table so she knows where it is.\u201d Kristen\u2019s mom then tosses the blue band onto the table and walked away as it bounced once and then landed on its side with the Kristen bow aiming towards the staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess this is better now that I can see when they come back down, but Mom really should be nicer to our stuff, especially anything shiny and blue now\u2026 Finally Karen and her friends began to emerge down the stairs, all of them looking very fancy with their hair done up and dresses on. Karen walked over and picked up the her sister-hair band and slid her over her head and down past her ears getting her snuggly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her hand up and patted the shiny living bow on top, making sure it was in the right place. \u201cAh, now my outfit is complete and I\u2019m ready for this party! So girls, how do I look?\u201d Karen asked to her friends who were all standing around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing!\u201d One of them said. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d another added. \u201cKristen really pulls the whole outfit together.\u201d A black haired girl said. Which for some reason made Kristen a bit happy on the inside. She may have hated being treated like an object but she did like it when she did a good job as what ever she was. And when they were leaving and Karen passed by the mirror on the way out, Kristen got a glimpse of herself and realized that they had all be right, she was a really shiny blue bow, and for the first time she didn\u2019t really mind being used by her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a tank top had been really hard work for Kristen and she was also acting as kind of a sports bra then, but now, she could just relax on top of her sister\u2019s head. Once they were all at the party they started having a really great time, all the girls were chatting up the guys and Karen was getting really friendly with this one guy Brad. They had been talking for over and hour and Kristen could tell that Karen liked this guy, even while she couldn\u2019t see her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Brad and Karen were sitting on the couch and began making out. Luckily for the disgusted Kristen, as brad ran his hand through Karen\u2019s hair he knocked the lovely blue bow off her hair band and Kristen fell to the floor beside the couch without Karen even realizing what had happened. After a few more minutes, Karen and her new boy toy moved to another room and left poor Kristen just laying on the floor. Finally Mel, one of her sister\u2019s blonde friends walked past and noticed the bow. \u201cOh my, how did you get separated from Karen? Oh well, I\u2019ve got you now, hope you don\u2019t mind if I test something on you. The second Karen told us about your abilities I\u2019ve wanted to see if you were really like rubber. But first I have to make you morphable again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel walks with Kristen in hand over to an electric socket and sticks the end of the bow in for a brief second and pulls her out the second she gets jolted. \u201cWow, that hurts, but I bet you\u2019ll get used to it. Plus I hope this will feel a lot better.\u201d Mel says as she slowly unravels the bow-girl and then crushes the ribbon in her hands to make a small ball about half the size of a ping-pong ball. \u201cAll\u2019s good so far. Now for the fun part\u2026\u201d She takes a near by pen and pushes a hole into her new clay ball friend. Setting the pen aside, Mel brings her lips to the hole in the bottom and begins to blow with all her effort, forcing air into the rubber girl. Kristen could feel the air push on her and she quickly felt her body begin to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver and over Mel would blow all her air into Kristen and then come up for big gulps of air. As Kristen begin to spread out and become thinner and thinner, it become easier to inflate her. As she started getting to a respectable size though, Mel noticed that Kristen\u2019s malleable body was too heavy and she would just end up like a basket ball. So she carefully let all the air out of her and brought her into the other room where there was a helium tank. \u201cPerfect! This should make you nice and buoyant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving the nozzle inside of Kristen, she opened the tank and waited as the helium flowed in expanding her body out quickly. This sensation sent wave of intense feeling through Kristen as she could feel herself get larger and larger and yet thinner. But the weirdest feeling of all was that she was now beginning to float all on her own. In just another 30 seconds she felt like she was about to pop, and right at the moment, Mel turned off the helium and took out the nozzle. She tied up the bottom of Kristen where the nozzle had been and just like that she was a balloon bobbing around in the air. Mel quickly attached a string from a previously popped balloon and let got of Kristen so she rushed up through the air and stopped suddenly hitting the end of her string causing her to bounce a few times up and down till she settled with just the air in the room blowing her about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would shock you again to keep you this way too, but I don\u2019t know if that will pop you, but that\u2019s ok, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll try and turn back like this anyway.\u201d Mel said as she tied the string around her wrist and began to talk to other party-goer\u2019s. Kristen was just barely starting to get used to the feeling of being flat, let alone tied up with herself, and now she was dealing with what was turning into the pleasure of being inflated. She liked the feeling of all the gas inside her that was trying to escape and the odd sensation of flying but having no control over where you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another few hours at the party, Mel finally had to go home, so she went around until she found a sharpie marker and wrote \u2018Property of Karen\u2019 right on the side of the balloon, unknowing to Mel that it was right over Kristen\u2019s chest. The balloon girl was too happy though to care that someone had just written on her. Mel then took untied the string off of her wrist and tied it to the banister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Kristen, it was getting time for Karen to need to head home. Brad from upstairs with her and kissed at the top of the stairs as Brad headed home. Karen noticed the note on the side of the balloon and din\u2019t get why someone had writing that the balloon was her property on the side. After a moment though, she reached up to her hair band and noticed the missing bow. Walking close to the balloon and pulling it close to her face she whispered, \u201cUmmm, Krissy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey Karen, I didn\u2019t notice you all the way down there, Hehe.\u201d Kristen said taunting her sister over her new flying ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be too cocky, I could just pop you\u2026 or let all the air out and watch as you buzz around the room deflating into a tiny piece of rubber.\u201d Karen Retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare! now tie me around your wrist and lets head home.\u201d Karen did as her sister said and walked out the door with her sis bumping her balloon-y body on the top of the door frame. \u201cOof! Watch it!\u201d Kristen shouted and her sister just snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were home, Karen got out the mini-shocker, but before Kristen had a chance to tell her that Mel had already reversed the shock, Karen activated it and a bolt of electricity shot through the air and hit Kristen. Before either could react, a loud POP shot through the house and Kristen\u2019s shredded body dropped through the air and landed on the floor while Karen was still stunned at what happened. \u201cOUCH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god Sis, are you ok?\u201d Karen said as she dropped to her knees picking ups the popped balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I think I\u2019m still in one piece thank goodness. And actually Mel shocked me earlier so now I\u2019m back to being stuck, so if you wouldn\u2019t mind giving mt a quick jolt so I can reform myself.\u201d Karen quickly pulled the mini-shocker back out and gave her sis another jolt. \u201cJust please deflate me next time\u2026\u201d Kristen told Karen as she began to reform herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her much longer than she expected to turn back as she was having trouble figuring out where parts of her body were. When she finally felt back to normal, she looked up off the floor to see her sister trying to cover herself laughing. \u201cWhats so funny?\u201d Karen just kept laughing and pointed at Kristen\u2019s breasts. The reformed girl looked down to see \u2018Property of Karen\u2019 written across her chest in black marker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I own \u2019em now, Hehe.\u201d Karen said giggling. Kristen just stared at her, got up and headed to the bathroom to wash up for the night and head to her place to go to bed, ready to go to the beach tomorrow and see what fun she could have there, as long as Karen doesn\u2019t mess it up\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kristen woke up nice and early. She couldn\u2019t wait to go to the beach today. Her family had been planning this trip for a while and she could believe it was finally time. She had always loved the beach as a little girl, even when her sister would try to force her into the water to swim around. Kristen wasn\u2019t a big fan of swimming, but that was ok, because today she was just going to relax on the beach. Kristen chose her favorite swim suit, a blue bikini with a lovely flower pattern. And then threw on her flip flops and a towel around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Kristen lived by her self, she could leave when ever she wanted to, but she still wanted to get there as soon as possible so she just threw on a white dress over her bikini and headed out the door without even bothering to straiten her hair like she usually does. Kristen\u2019s parents and her sister Karen, had left much earlier in the morning, so she knew they would already be waiting there for her. Kristen hopped in her sporty little hatchback and took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just under 30 minutes she was there. She parked along side her parents car and began to search for them on the beach. She looked all over and couldn\u2019t seem to find them anywhere, but she was also starting to get hot so she decided to head back to her car and drop off her white dress and search for them in the near by markets. She figured that maybe they had gone to get some food since it was almost lunch time. She wandered about through the markets looking and calling there names, getting looks from all the farmers while she did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a break from looking for a second and stood in a back alley trying to think of where they could be. Without noticing, a figure came up behind her and lunged at her. Luckily for Kristen, it was just her sister, unluckily though, Karen had some new device in her hands. Kristen turned around just in time to see her sister shove the new device towards her, it making contact with her side. A shock shot through her body and she froze in place. \u201cHmmm, I wondered what might happen if you got a shock while still human. Looks like dad was right though, it has the same effect, you just get stuck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren, who for the beach had dyed her hair blonde, walks around her now frozen in place sister admiring the fun she knew she\u2019d be able to have now that she knows this. \u201cWhat is that thing?\u201d Kristen can barely get out through her frozen lips, \u201cIt looks different than the mini-shocker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh this thing? Its Dad\u2019s upgrade on the mini-shocker. He calls it the Micro-Electric Zapper, but I just call it the MEZ\u2019er for short. It works just like the mini-shocker, except for two things. The first is that the zap is much less painful, and the second is my favorite part. It was actually my idea that Dad added to it as a way to keep you even safer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren had already convinced their dad that wearing Kristen was a good way to keep and eye on her, so she knew that keeping her safe was not a good thing for her. \u201cAnd it will actually save you some walking too Sis,\u201d Karen said as she held the device about an inch away from Kristen, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this should be fast.\u201d Karen pressed a button on the side of the MEZ\u2019er and one of the ends opened up and a white glow came from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen then felt a very odd sensation, like her whole side was being stretched. She quickly figured out what it was doing though as it continued to suck on her, drawing her body into the device. In only about 20 seconds almost all of her was in it and all she could do was look out with a frozen face of terror as it crushed what was left of her into its compartment. Then the front closed up and it dropped to the ground rolling to its side till Karen picked it up. \u201cWow, Dad really is good at this stuff. This little thing about the size of a lightsaber from StarWars can not only shock you but also suck in your whole form and compact it into a small tube so I can carry you around\u2026 I mean keep you safer, hehe.\u201d She laughed a bit at what she had almost said. Karen then dropped the MEZ\u2019er (which now contained her very compacted sister) into her bag and headed to meet up with their parents at an Italian restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the table she dropped her bag by her chair and sat down about getting ready to eat when she noticed her Dad giving her a nasty look. \u201cOh yeah, sorry, forgot I had her.\u201d Karen blurted out. She russled her hand about in her bag till she pulled the MEZ\u2019er out and hold it over the table. Just that morning, there Dad had spent a long time explaining to their mother about Kristen\u2019s new abilities. She still wasn\u2019t sure what to expect though. Holding the device aiming down, Karen pressed a button on the side of the MEZ\u2019er and out dropped a small blue tube about twice as big as a AA battery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Karen! Thats really small in there\u2026 seriously, some warning or something next time!\u201d The little blue tube shouted at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cK-Kristen?\u201d Their mom mumbled, a bit in disbelief. \u201cDad told me what happened, but, just wow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, I was gonna tell you eventually but I didn\u2019t want you to freak out. But\u2026 yeah. So I\u2019m pretty malleable now. I can be all sorts of shapes and objects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObjects?\u201d her Mom asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I can be formed into all sorts of things, and whenever I\u2019m all malleable, I turn blue. And I hate to ask, but Karen, do you mind showing her what you can do with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask!\u201d her sister said jokingly. Karen didn\u2019t hesitate to pick up Kristen and quickly tore the blue cylinder in half. \u201cand before you complain, I checked with Dad, and his research says that all we have to do is bring the blueium back together and you can reform.\u201d Kristen still would have complained if Karen hadn\u2019t already gone to work on one half of her flattening her out into 2 triangles with string coming off them and connect at one corner. Karen then went to work on the smaller half of the blue cylinder that was left and just made it into two triangles connected at one corner and then she tied the other two corners. \u201cBe right back mom!\u201d She said as she headed to the bathroom to change real quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came back to the table, she was still wearing her white top and skirt, except she was now holding her regular bikini in her hand, and her Mom could easily notice the blue straps going around Karen\u2019s neck. \u201cAnd just like that I can take Krissy with me where ever I go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo even thought Kristen doesn\u2019t like the water, she can still go in the ocean with you there to support her!\u201d Their Mom said excitedly realizing now that Kristen\u2019s abilities could actually be helpful. \u201cThen what are we waiting for? Lets get into the ocean!\u201d Their Mom grabbed Karen\u2019s arm and practically dragged her away from the table she was some exited. Karen Barely managed to grab her bag and she got out of her chair and they headed to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir Dad just said there looking unsurprised and asked for the waiter to bring the check figuring he\u2019d give them and chance to bond over Kristen\u2019s unusual situation. Karen and her Mom quickly made it to the beach but took them forever to find a place to set up their towels, so when they finally did, they were both to tired to swim and just laid down to relax for a bit. Karen then took off her top and skirt and set them aside so her Mom could see Kristen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, shes so shiny when shes not herself.\u201d Kristen\u2019s mom said, staring amazed that her daughter was currently just a bikini. \u201cWait, the other night there was a shiny blue bow on the table, was that\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, that was me.\u201d Piped up the swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, well you looked lovely honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Mom.\u201d was the only way she really knew how to respond to her mother saying she made a lovely accessory, even though she did like when she was good looking as whatever she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir Mom was finally getting over her daughter\u2019s new abilities and laid down to relax. Karen spent the first 30 minutes tanning and talking to her Mom, till their Dad finally found them. Karen went ahead and left her parents alone and headed out into the ocean. \u201cI know you were always scared of going into the ocean Sis, but its not that bad. I bet you\u2019ll even like it.\u201d Karen stepped into the water feeling the coldness on her feet and having a chill run up her spine. \u201cOk, so its gonna be a bit cold, but I doubt you\u2019ll even notice it aside from maybe my nips pointing through, but I trust you to stop them showing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, then I trust you wont lose your top in the ocean like you did last year.\u201d Kristen retorted. Karen had almost forgotten about that incident and realized that if that happened again, it would be way worse than having to run to shore covering herself. Karen just tried not to think about it as she headed further and further off of shore to the point where there was a few feet of water between her and the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen would have been trying her hardest to get back to shore right then if it weren\u2019t for the fact she was stuck as her sister\u2019s swimsuit. \u201cCome on, lets head back, the water is really deep right here. What would happen if my bottoms slid off and fell to the ocean floor, I don\u2019t know if you can swim that deep.\u201d Kristen said scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh calm down scaredie-cat, your tied around me tight. But if you really want, we can head back to shore, but I\u2019m going to tan my back after this which means I\u2019m going to untie you.\u201d Karen knew Kristen wasn\u2019t happy about the idea either of the wind picking her up and carrying her off.</span></div></div>",

And just as promised, Karen laid face down on the beach towel and untied her sister from around her back and neck. But that especially please Karen because, in this position, Kristen\u2019s mouth was on the front of the bikini, which was currently being smothered, meaning she didn\u2019t have to listen to her sister and could just relax for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, her Mom woke her up saying that their Dad had apparently figured something out that he thought Karen might like. The only condition was that Karen had to leave Kristen at the beach with her Mom while she and her Dad headed home in their parents car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren couldn\u2019t care less about losing her bikini, she just couldn\u2019t wait to see what her dad had in store for her. She new it had to be a new invention or something that would help her to have some fun with Kristen. So she retied Kristen around her back and neck and headed to the nearby changing rooms with her bag returning in a few minutes back in her regular clothes with an aver clothe bikini under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren gave the MEZ\u2019er to her Mom and headed to the car with her Dad. Kristen\u2019s Mom went to the changing rooms and hung up Kristen on the hooks on the walls. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind Krissy, but your just so pretty, I have to try you on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I get tomorrow off of work them?\u201d Kristen bartered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal!\u201d Her mom said, \u201cBut you look a bit small for me, I\u2019m gonna need to change that.\u201d Her mom gave her no time to react as she grabbed Kristen\u2019s bikini bottoms of a hook and stretched them out in her hands. Setting them aside, she did the same with Kristen\u2019s top, although it took a bit longer to get there right shape. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Krissy, I took pottery in college, this is almost the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen just groaned as her Mom stretched her into the right shape to be worn. Once she was ready, her Mom, got out of her one piece and slipped on Kristen. She stepped outside, and even with the light of dusk, Kristen still shimmered. \u201cYou make me feel so young again. I bet you be just as useful at the gym, but doing other tasks that only you could do.\u201d Kristen knew that once her Mom figured out about her blueium secret, she would want to use it to help out the business. But being honest with her self, Kristen thought I might actually be kind of fun to use her abilities at work to get things done or help people out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you getting used to this?\u201d Kristen\u2019s Mom asked her bikini as she walked along the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m getting used to it. And to be honest, it can be fun, but usually not when Karen does it without asking.\u201d She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but she\u2019s just teasing you, she secretly jealous you have an ability that no one else has.\u201d It made Kristen feel a bit better about her situation knowing that her sister just wants to be like her. After over an hour over talking while walking back and forth on the beach, her Mom changed back into her regular clothes ready to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know your not a big fan of this, but you are easier to carry this way\u2026\u201d She trailed off as she stuck her hand into her bag, Kristen didn\u2019t realize what she was talking about till she pulled out the MEZ\u2019er and put it against the bikini bottom and top that were laying on the dressing room floor. In a moment, Kristen was sucked up into and squashed up tight. \u201cYou father also told me to press this button.\u201d Kristen\u2019s Mom pressed a button on the outside under the storage button labeled compression storage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing the button, the MEZ\u2019er vibrated into life for a few seconds and then stopped making a beeping noise saying it was done. Kristen now felt very uncomfortable and didn\u2019t know why. \u201cWow, that made you a lot lighter, awesome!\u201d Her Mom tossed the MEZ\u2019er into Kristen\u2019s car\u2019s glovebox, and headed home using a spare set of keys for Kristen\u2019s car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drove to Kristen\u2019s apartment and before getting out of the car decided to open up the MEZ\u2019er. Out dropped a small blue coin about the size of a dime. \u201cWell that explains why you got so light, you just 10 cents of your former self.\u201d She laughed to herself, \u201cWell I hope you haven\u2019t had too much of the water yet, you make not work at the gym, but you\u2019re baby-sitting your cousin Kim and you know how she likes swimming. And I was going to let you turn back, but to be honest, I don\u2019t want to figure out how that stupid device works tonight, and you can just go in my purse till tomorrow.\u201d She stuck the MEZ\u2019er back in the glovebox and headed inside dropping the newly minted Kristen coin in her purse as she walked over to the couch and passed out after a long day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After over-sleeping much past when she was planning on waking up, Kristen\u2019s mom finally rolled off the couch in her daughter\u2019s apartment. She lumbered down the hall to the bedroom and looked inside to see if Kristen had woken up yet. Peering inside, she saw that the bed was still in the same condition it was in the night before when she was trying to decide where to sleep. Which is when she remembered where Kristen was, or more, where she had put Kristen. Heading back to the kitchen, She opened her purse and pulled out the now familiar blue coin. \u201cAlmost forgot you were in here, That would have been bad if I would have spent you huh? Hehe\u201d She chuckled. \u201cWell I better make sure I don\u2019t forget you in there again, I\u2019ll have to keep you on me though.\u201d Her Mom moved the coin around her back and Kristen already knew where it was going before her Mom had even begun to open her back pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile held in place by the tightness of the pants pocket, her mom proceeded to gather some clothes for Kristen to wear once they were home and she could figure out how to make Kristen regular again. \u201cWe gotta get you home and changed back fast, I have to drop you off at your cousin Kim\u2019s house for babysitting in an hour.\u201d It was then that Kristen recalled she had to babysit her annoying cousin and knew then that being a coin in someone\u2019s pocket was probably not the worst thing that was going to happen to her today. After a 20 minute drive home stuffed between her mother and a car seat, she was finally pulled out of the now very stuffy and sweaty pocket and into the light of day again, holding her in front of her dad. \u201cSee Jack, the compressor worked just like you said, look how small and light she is, demonstrating so by flipping her in the air to which her currently passing by sister jokingly said \u2018Tails!\u2019 not even realizing what it was that her mom had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dad swiped Kristen out of the air quickly before Karen could get a good look at her. \u201cHey, Hun, I\u2019ve got an idea, follow me.\u201d Kristen\u2019s dad, Jack, said to her mother, Jennifer, and he headed to the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d His wife asked immediately after he had closed the door to the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, most of Karen and Kristen\u2019s time together is just good fun, but I don\u2019t want Karen to get carried away with Kristen so vulnerable. Then we would have to search every vending machine for a mile to find her. At least not till my Blueium Finder is finished.\u201d Well that\u2019s reassuring, Kristen thought. \u201cNow come on, I\u2019ll show you how to make her normal again. \u201cIt actually quite easy once she is in her compressed form from the MEZ\u2019er.\u201d He walks to the side of the machine with the control panel and points to a small slot on the side, the perfect size for a quarter, or something the size as one at least. \u201cNow watch closely.\u201d He slid his daughter lightly into the slot and began going through a few menu\u2019s showing his wife what to press.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom inside the machine, all she could hear was her dad mention something about making sure to press restore and not recycle and that the process would take a few minutes. At this point, Kristen was just happy that soon she wouldn\u2019t be able to be lost between the cushions on the couch. Soon enough after her parents had left waiting for the process to finish, she heard the machine buzz into life as a latch released and she rolled down a number of chutes on her side before coming to rest in the depths of the machine. Luckily for her it quickly got to work, flattening and stretching her, adding steam and pumping her full of air. It wasn\u2019t the most comfortable thing in the world, but she could feel her size increasing and quickly. As she had heard, it took just a few minutes and she could move all of her limbs again. In moments a large door opened and a slide dropped down as a piston behind her pushed her out. She slid down, and unfortunately again, the machine had not restored any clothes along with her and she landed on the cold floor. She clenched up quickly as the cold shot through he uncovered bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEep!\u201d She squeaked, shooting up off the ground and onto her feet. \u201cAt least I\u2019ve come out of that machine as me for once and not some piece of clothing. It feels almost odd being this size again.\u201d She looked around and sure enough, he dad had left out the pile of clothes out for her to change into so she wouldn\u2019t have to walk through the house naked to get dressed. Her mom had grabbed one of here swimsuits, a plain white top, and some plain jeans and a belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon headed upstairs to grab soon food before she had to head over to her aunt and uncle\u2019s house to babysit Kim. Seeing the clock, she knew she only had 5 minutes to eat, so she make up 2 pieces of toast and got to eating. She overheard her Dad saying something to her sister about \u2018It\u2019s ready\u2019 and then they both headed to the basement. She didn\u2019t think much of it and finished her meal before her mom came in and told her she had to leave. The whole drive to her relatives house, she was dreading how annoying Kim was going to be. Kim was the kind of child that always got everything she wanted and was a complete prima donna. The only thing she could take comfort in was that Kim had no idea about her new abilities, so as long as nothing triggered them, she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about being a dress or anything for Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she arrived, her aunt and uncle were just leaving and shouted out of their car window \u201cHave fun you two!\u201d and drove off down the street. Kristen Turned around to find Kim right next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Kuz, ready to have some fun?\u201d Kim shouted in a high pitch only she could hit. She was wearing a yellow bikini and huge sunglasses looking to swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, yeah, why don\u2019t you head back to the pool and I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d Kim just made a happy squealing noise and ran off to the backyard. \u2018Its only for a few hours Kristen kept repeating to her self. For over an hour Kristen just sat at the edge of the concrete and grass in their backyard and watched her Cousin have fun in the water. At least every five minutes, Kim would ask her to join her in the water, but each time, she would say she was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Kim got tired of this and decided she was going to make her have some fun with her. \u201cKrissy, if you don\u2019 t have some fun in the pool with me, I\u2019m going to tell my mom that you had a boy over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen just glared at Kim knowing that her aunt would of course believe her own daughter over her teenage niece. \u201cFine\u2026\u201d She began to strip down to her swim suit and headed to the edge of the pool. \u201cBut when your parents get back, you tell them I was great, ok?\u201d Kim just nodded. Kristen lowered herself into the pool and waded around a bit till the brat was satisfied. At which point, Kim went back to diving around the bottom of the pool follow the automated pool cleaning around the base of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen was just happy that she hadn\u2019t had he powers showcased yet, but that was all about to change. She wasn\u2019t paying attention, and while standing in the shallow end of the pool the automated cleaner ran into her. She didn\u2019t notice at first until she tried to move and couldn\u2019t. Looking down into the water, she saw that her foot had disappeared in the machine. She trying to move away but her other foot just slide along the pool floor and it also got caught by the machine.The evil robot was obviously expensive as her legs didn\u2019t stop it and it continued up her body and all she could do was keep herself afloat with her arms. Kim came out from under the water and and just stared at her baby sitter. \u201cKriss\u2026\u201d Kim had been watching it all happen from underwater and didn\u2019t know what to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell you parents about this.\u201d The now half eaten girl said as it continued it journey up her body. \u201cI\u2019m going to need your help to get out of this.\u201d She continued, but Kim just kept staring till it passed her waist only made the slightest stutter as it worked past her chest. Finally at her neck, Kim regained her movement and swam to the edge of the pool. She ran to the cord in the wall ripped it out. Unfortunately, she wasn\u2019t fast enough and the evil machine had already sucked in her head and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled on the automated cleaned by the cord and reeled it in to the edge of the pool where she pulled it out and set it on the ground. \u201cUgh, Kuz, you in there?\u201d Kim said hesitantly. Light mumbles where the only sound Kristen could make, but it was enough for Kim to know that she had really just seen her cousin get sucked in by the pool cleaner and she hadn\u2019t imaged it. Although, being how young Kim was, she only had one response. \u201cCool! How\u2019d you do that?\u201d Mumbles were all she could hear again. \u201cOh yeah, better get you out.\u201d Although Kim couldn\u2019t fathom the machine, she kept working at it till one of the sides popped open and she pulled out the filter, to which a blue glob was stuck to. \u201cEwww, whats that?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally being released from her prison, she was able to speak, \u201cOh, yeah, that would probably be me\u2026\u201d Kim held the filter with the blue mush in front of her and inspected it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, doesn\u2019t look like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it is. Its a bit of a long story, but since we\u2019re already here, I might as well tell you my body is quite malleable now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re ok? You can just be mushed up and you\u2019ll be fine?\u201d Kim ask seeming very intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, its not totally comfortable, but I\u2019m alright.\u201d Kristen tried to reform herself but felt bogged down. \u201cUgh, looks like I absorbed quite a bit of water, an ideas?\u201d Kristen asked a bit scared about the answer, although Kim didn\u2019t reply. She just began peeling her babysitter out of the the filter. She made quick work of it though and in no time had all the blue goop in her hands. She rolled her into a small blue ball and headed inside, going straight for the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom has an old antique wringer that\u2019ll be prefect.\u201d Opening the door to the basement, she hit the light and walked about until she found the machine. It really did look old, at least 100 had passed since it had been used, but worst of all, the space in between the rollers liked impossibly thin. But at this point, she knew nothing was impossible for her. Kim pushed her to the edge of the rollers and began to crank. As she was pulled through, Kristen could feel the immense pressure on her from the rollers but it did feel as if it was doing its job and soon enough a much more disced Krsiten dropped out of the back on the floor with a splat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s much better, I don\u2019t feel so full of water now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, but you\u2019re not quite thin enough.\u201d Kim said flatly standing over her blue disc of a cousin.\u201d If Kristen has eyes, they\u2019d be wide at that comment. Kim moved back over the the wringer and adjusted the rollers so they were so close the looked as if they were touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, why do I need to be MMmmmm\u2026\u201d she said as Kim stuffed her back in the wringer and turned it watching as a paper thin blue disc came out the other side about the size of a plate that fluttered to the ground and landed in a heap. \u201cHey, what was that all about? I felt fine after the first run through!\u201d But there was no one there to hear her, Kim had already disappeared. \u201cgreat, leave me in a pile on the floor, guess I\u2019ll try and reform now\u2026 OUCH!\u201d She felt Kim stick her with something that felt like a needle. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you didn\u2019t look like you were having much fun in the pool before and I want to change that.\u201d Before Kristen could even respond she felt a burst of air shoot into her, then another, and the air continued to floor till her body was more of a saucer shape and she could see what Kim had, and it just confirmed her worst nightmares. A bicycle pump. Kim kept pumping for what felt like hours and Kristen could just feel her less than paper thin body stretching and ever expanding along with the air. She knew there was no resisting it and figured it was as good a time as ever to maybe try and enjoy some time with her cousin for once. After 15 intense minutes of pump, a quite bouncy and slightly lighter blue ball was sitting on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, fine, lets have some fun.\u201d Kim\u2019s eyes went wide with excitement. She grabbed Kristen and sprinted back to outside giving the ball a good kick sending her across the porch and into the pool where she bounced off the surface a few times and came to a rest by the far edge where she could clearly see Kim jumping into the pool in a classic cannonball form splashing water everywhere and sending wakes through the pool then Kristen could feel lifting her up and dropping her back down again. Oddly enough, the kick didn\u2019t even hurt, she hardly felt it. Kim came up from under her knocking her into the air with her head and proceeded to practice her volleyball skills with her Cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter at least 2 hours of playing, Kim had thoroughly tired herself out and took a break holding tight onto Kristen so she wouldn\u2019t float away. \u201cWow, that was actually pretty fun.\u201d Kristen said as best she could with her mouth up against her Cousin\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, its much funner to practice when the ball talks back even if you are a bit bigger than a regular volley ball.\u201d Kim said giggling. \u201cNow its time to relax, well at least for me. I really want to see what else I can do with you like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d Kristen responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell to be honest, I was kind of wondering how far you can stretch\u2026\u201d Kristen could see that Kim was actually a bit embarrassed to ask the question, but she figured that since she was having a good time so far and she knew one day she would need to know just how far she could go, she said something she never thought she\u2019d say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo for it. Go as far with me as you can and ignore what ever I say while you\u2019re doing it.\u201d Kim\u2019s eyes lit up with excitement. She hopped out of the pool and grabbed Kristen from the water. Kim looked at the ball and Kristen could see thoughts going through her head. After a second more of ideas passing through her mind, she reaches behind her head and pulls out a pin from her hair. Unlike a regular hair pin though, this one looked quite sharp on one end. The blue ball of a girl knew that as much as she was about to have what was going to happen, she knew it had to be done to get the air out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim brought the needle down slowly into her rubbery skin though and pressed it in just a bit to make a hole and let the air out slowly. Kristen thought for sure she was about to get popped and either send shards of her all of over of she would fly around the back yard like a balloon. But the slowly leaking air didn\u2019t actually feel that bad, like most things that day, it actually felt kind of good. She was starting to wonder if maybe it had always felt good, but she never noticed being too preoccupied with the whole body being reformed into an object thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a little while, but soon enough she looked just like a deflated blue basket ball. Kim set her in the center of the large grassy area in the backyard and ran inside. She came back out with the air pump from before, the water hose, a blow dryer, and camping steaks. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you wont feel like a vampire.\u201d Kim said knowing the Kristen was probably have some reservations after seeing the spikes. She stuck on into the ground to begin with and stretched a piece of Kristen and tied it around it so she would stay in place. After get a firm hold on her cousin, she began to slowly back away, stretching Kristen. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but after five feet, her world began to feel a bit skewed. At ten feet, things began to feel very odd. At fifteen feet, her mind was shout to stay stop, but she held it in as best she could all the way up to twenty five feet where it seemed that Kim had finally hit her max as well and couldn\u2019t pull her any further. She stuck a steak in the ground and tied a strand of Kristen around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to pull out from the center of the long blue, Kristen strip, in both directions making a square shape and then proceeded to make sure they were tightly in place as well. The whole Kristen\u2019s mind was going crazy. She had never even been close to this stretched before, and know that here was only more to come. \u201cHalf way there Cuz, Well at least with the stretching, hehe.\u201d At least Kim was having fun. After four more spikes in four more directions, Kristen was spread out into a nice blue octagon on the grass. \u201cStep two!\u201d Kim said happily. She returned shortly with the blow dryer, which must have been battery powered as there was no cord Kristen could see. Kim then went to work blowing super heated air all around the edge of Kristen\u2019s stretched form about a foot in. The malleable girl realized that she was in fact still hollow from when she was a ball and that Kim was creating some sort of seal. But it all became clear when Kim finished and went back for the air pump. She began to pump air into the sealed edge and soon Kristen was not just a flat piece of plastic, but had a large inflated ring around the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost done!\u201d Kim piped in after finishing inflating the tube around Kristen\u2019s edge. She headed back and returned with the hose, water already flowing out of the end and onto her rubber surface. As the water began to spread, Kim walked around Kristen and undid all of the spikes. As the water began to rise, Kristen realized what she had done, the clever girl that Kim was. As the water got higher, her inflated ring would float on top and rise her edges up. Unfortunately it took over and hour to fill her with water, in which time Kim had left, eaten some food, watched an episode of her favorite show on tv and changed into another bikini. But she returned just in time to turn the water of and pull the hose out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft sitting in the yard, was no longer a some small thing that Kristen had been crushed into, for the first time, she had been stretched way beyond what she though was possible. What was left was a large inflatable pool.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an intense feeling for Kristen. Not only have she become something bigger than a car, but she was full or water and could feel it slosh about inside her walls. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m a pool.\u201d Kristen said a bit still in disbelief. Kim just stood next to her with a look of pride on her face. \u201cWell hop in why don\u2019t ya?\u201d Kristen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim shook her daze of happiness to move back a feel feet. She got a running start and jumped over Kristen\u2019s edge and dove skillfully into the water. Even her artfully done dive though caused the water to slosh about much more than before, and Kristen could feel it moving her whole form around till it finally settled. Being in a good mood, Kristen found she could gain control over her new form much easier and was able to splash the water around and soak Kim. This escalated into a game quickly with Kim diving under the water and Kristen trying to figure out where she\u2019d come up so she come splash her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving so much fun though, the two lost track of time, and before they new it, there was a sound of a car pulling up in the driveway. Both girls went silent realizing that Kristen\u2019s mom was back to pick her up, only problem was that she was still a swimming pool. Kim hopped over the edge and ran into the house to get the door. The second she was out of site, Kristen began to try to reform herself, but she had no luck. She had learned how to move quite a bit but couldn\u2019t get her floating rim past the water. After ten minutes of being gone, Kim and Kristen\u2019s mom came outside and all she heard was her mom saying, \u201cWhat do you mean I can\u2019t see her\u2026\u201d she stopped short seeing the blue pool in the middle of the yard. She walked up to edge and cautiously said \u201cKrissy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey mom, hehe.\u201d Her mom just reached her arm out and felt her side. \u201cYeah its me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe whole pool?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it was a bit of a test to see of big I could get and we got a bit carried away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can tell, but we really should be getting home. Any idea how to drain you?\u201d Her mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim\u2019s eyes lit up again with obvious light that she had an idea. She ran off and came back with what looked like a hose, but was attached to a little motor. Sticking one end into the water, she turned it on and it went to work sucking all of the water out of Kristen and spraying it across the yard. Unlike when they were filling her though, this went much quicker, and before they knew it, Kim flipped the machine off, her and Kristen\u2019s mom looking at a pile of rubber in the obvious shape of a pool. \u201cDidn\u2019t happen to bring the MEZ\u2019er with you, did ya mom?\u201d Kristen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, nope, I expected that even if you had gotten into some other shape you\u2019d be at least a bit easy to take with me. Think you can pull yourself back together?\u201d Kristen tried a bit to pull herself in, but it appeared that the water holding her body up had made moving easier, and although she had gained more control over her body, she was no where near prepared to fix herself from this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like a no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim and her aunt just looked at each other shrugged. \u201cGuess there\u2019s only one option then.\u201d said Kristen\u2019s mother. She looked over to Kim and nodded to her, Kim just nodded back. Then they each got to one side of Kristen and began to roll, trying to keep her in as tight a circle as possible. It took a bit of finesse with Kim holding her tight and her mom rolling, but soon enough Kristen was rolled up into a nice tight tube, that they then folded over twice till she was only about as big as a canoe. \u201cNot as easy as the MEZ\u2019er, but it\u2019ll do. Thanks for the help Kim.\u201d Kristen\u2019s mom said as she threw her daughter over her should and headed back to her car. She tossed her on top of her station wagon and tied her down to the roof racks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink dad will be able to fix me?\u201d Kristen asked, a bit worried for once. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to be an inflatable pool for the rest of my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father is brilliant, you know he\u2019ll be able to figure it out. And worse comes to it, we could always use you at the gym.\u201d She said snickering as she secured the final ties. She knew that if she was joking this much about it, there wasn\u2019t anything to worry about, after all, she was a malleable girl thanks to her father\u2019s \u2018genius\u2019.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon enough the mother and daughter were home and Kristen\u2019s Mom began untying her from the roof. After Kristen had let her Cousin Kim test her stretching abilities and she had become an inflatable pool, she was in not position to complain about having to be rolled up and stored on the roof of the car for the ride home. She was just hoping it wouldn\u2019t be something she\u2019d have to do again any time soon. Her Mom had reassured her that her dad would be able to restore her though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing Kristen over her shoulder, her mother brought her inside and laid her down in the living room at which point her dad walked in and took only a second to figure out what had happened. \u201cWow Krissy, you really have gotten your self stretched out haven\u2019t you? Good thing Karen went to the convention early or she\u2019d have a ball with her new, uh\u2026 never mind, Lets just get you fixed up.\u201d Quickly her mom skipped over to her dad and whispered something in her ear. \u201cYeah I could attach them, what were you thinking?\u201d he asked her. She then whispered some more in his ear and he nodded along as she spoke to him without Kristen being able to hear a word. \u201cAhhh, yes, well I\u2019m up for it if she is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Mom then turned around and smiled at Kristen, who was still rolled up laying on the floor. \u201cSomeone mind cluing me in to what you guys are talking about?\u201d Kristen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you know that convention that you and your sis are going to?\u201d The convention was one for any sort of comic, sci-fi, or video game nerd where they got to see upcoming projects and can dress as their favorite characters. \u201cWell I flipped through some of your comics a few weeks ago and got really into this one about these four super heroes. Long story short, I really connected with the mom and was wondering if I could come to the convention with you guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen was confused as almost everyone who went wore a costume of their favorite character, and by the sound of it, her mother wanted to do the same, but she hadn\u2019t ever seen her working on a costume or anything. \u201cWell ok, but we need an extra ticket then and what was all the whispering about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as I\u2019m sure you know, her outfit is a nice shiny blue with a few black bits on it, and well you are the perfect shade of blue!\u201d That\u2019s when it hit her. Her mom wanted Kristen to be her costume for the Con. It would solve the issue of needing an extra ticket for her mother to come along, but Kristen really didn\u2019t want to spend the whole time being worn and was still a bit confused as to how they would attach the black bits. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about the black parts, that\u2019s what I was asking your dad about, he has an adhesive that should attach some of the extra black rubber from your costume and we can remove it when ever you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you think I could become me again during? After all, I\u2019ve already made my costume.\u201d Kristen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, after all, I\u2019m pretty sure your sis has something to show you. But first, we\u2019ve got to reduce you a bit. So, Jack?\u201d She looked to her husband. He just brought his hand to his chin and thought for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it!\u201d He said. He ran into another room and came back with the MEZ\u2019er and another weird looking device. \u201cThis will probably be pretty warm Kristen, but this is going to be the only way to get you down to size so you\u2019re going to have to trust me.\u201d He then handed the MEZ\u2019er to Kristen\u2019s mother and activated the other device which suddenly began to glow. As he brought it down to her side, Kristen could feel the heat of it working away at her and realized it was some sort of super heated knife and it was cutting right through hwe like a hot knife through butter, or more like rubber in this case. It took only a minute to cut of a slice that was about 1/6th of Kristen\u2019s full pool form. He pushed the rolled up slice over to Jennifer, his wife and said, \u201cNow that should be small enough for the MEZ\u2019er to compress and store. As he began on the next piece, Jennifer began to suck the slice into the MEZ\u2019er and have it set to work on compressing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the strangest feeling Kristen had ever experienced since she had gained her new abilities. She was being crushed, and smashed and sucked on all at once, all in different places. It was actually quite thrilling, but soon enough he had finished cutting the last piece in half and her mom sucked both into the device she was getting all too familiar with, and felt that same feeling of getting smaller and smaller till there was a light ding and she dropped into her Mom\u2019s hand, the size of a AA battery. \u201cGood as new, eh Krissy?\u201d Her mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Kristen, her father had designed the MEZ\u2019er in such a way that in this compressed for she could still talk and responded with, \u201cWell not quite my original form, but the machine downstairs should be able to work me into a nice costume in no time. Don\u2019t forget to do your hair and everything though mom, you\u2019ve got to look the part too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, thanks!\u201d Her mom burst out and tossed Kristen to her dad as she ran down the hall into her bedroom to get ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess lets get you ready kid-o.\u201d He took her down stairs and put her into the entrance of the machine along with the extra bits of black rubber left over from her costume and one piece of gold fabric that must be his own addition. Oh, this machine can form regular rubber as well? Wish I would have though of that when I had to make my costume. She though as the rollers started up and she fell into the machine. He father really had been improving it as it took only minutes for the finished product to fall out of the completion chute nicely folded and ready to be worn. Only seconds lately her mom came down the stairs to show off her new look ready for her costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband almost had a heart attack when he saw that she had cut her hair incredibly short for her character. \u201cCould you possibly design something to regrow hair while we\u2019re out Hun?\u201d She asked of her still awestruck husband. \u201cThanks Hun, gotta go!\u201d she said, not even giving him time to answer and grabbing Kristen from the tray, heading out the door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arriving at the Con, her mom switched out of her street clothes in the bathrooms and slid Kristen on. It was a tight fit for the both of them, but after a bit of shimmy-ing, The costume was in place. Heading out of the bathroom, Kristen saw her mother and her in the mirror and figured out that she must have been planning to ask for some time, because the costume, her, was so well done, it must have taken her soon time to design on a computer and put in the machine. She just wished her mom had put a bit more around her chest as the second she hit the convention floor, she was getting swamped by guys and photographers asking for photos of and with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven being is such a constrained form, Kristen was having a good time knowing she would end up in tons of pics on blogs and sites and she didn\u2019t have to do anything besides being worn and trying not to let one of her mother\u2019s nips show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter and hour or so, the crowds died down and they could finally begin exploring the booths. Of course the first one her mother looked for, was the one of the series of which she was currently wearing a costume for. Unfortunately for the both of them, its was on the other side of the complex. For Kristen\u2019s mother, the walking is what was killing her, but for Kristen her self, it was that of trying to control the bounce from her mother\u2019s ample breasts that was tiring her out. It reminded her of her day as a sports bra for Karen only times ten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making it across the entire center and getting the signature of the creator, her mom figured it was time that she could go back to normal. She she found the closest bathroom she could and headed in with her street clothes and Kristen\u2019s costume. After sliding her daughter off slowly, she got back into her regular clothes and detached the black pieces from Kristen so she could restore her self without having bits of rubber stuck to her all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Kristen\u2019s previous forms, it had always been hard for her to become normal again without the help of the machine due to her odd shapes, but for once, she was already in a fairly human shape, and after working for a bit, her mother watched in amazement as she began to move about, connecting parts of herself together and extending bits out to become her hands and feet. It still took her about 5 minutes, but it was fine for Kristen as it was the first time she had restore herself without any help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom handed her her costume and left the bathroom so she could change in piece. In no times she was in her Black Spider outfit and ready for the Con. She had to make the most of it since, although it was 2 days long, only Karen had a ticket to the second day. She wandered though the booths looking for any actors or writers that she recognized to get their autographs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when she saw her sister, Karen, across the room getting the signature of an actor who played her favorite villain. She was happy that her sister hadn\u2019t had the pleasure of seeing her as the Invisible-Maid\u2019s costume, although she knew at some point she would see the pictures online. Karen soon saw her as well and the met up through the crown of people. \u201cSeen anyone cool?\u201d Karen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few, yourself?\u201d Kristen responded, happy to make small talk with her sister for once, although still wondering what her parents were talking about when they said she would have something to show Kristen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo of my favorite villains.\u201d Karen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to make small talk till eventually the question ate at Kristen enough that she had to ask. \u201cSo Mom and Dad said you have something new to show me? Is it what you left the beach for early that one day to do with Dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren then got a devilish smirk on her face. \u201cThat is it. He saw how much I liked what you could do and wanted it to be fair.\u201d Kristen has always suspected that Karen was a bit jealous of her abilities, but never knew Karen had talked to their dad about it. \u201cBut you used up all of Dad\u2019s Blueium, so he had to make something new that would work in a similar way. Fortunately you acted as a good test for the properties of Blueium and he was able to make a new substance in no time. So he made Redium, and using a safer method of combining than what you went through, he put it in me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen was blown away. Her sister now had abilities like her, although with something called Redium. She just couldn\u2019t believe it, \u201cNo way, then what can you do?\u201d she asked Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust watch!\u201d She pulled Kristen aside and next to a potted plant. \u201cCheck this.\u201d She backed off a bit and then ran at the potted plant suddenly becoming transparent as she got close. Her form appeared to merge with the pot and it turned a bright shade of red. \u201cUnlike you, I don\u2019t change my form, I can merge with any other non-living object and we become one.\u201d She said as she shook the plant back and forth. Now Kristen was a believer, although not very surprised, as her father is quite the brainiac. She was happy for her sister now though, after all, maybe without the jealousy there, she wouldn\u2019t be as tempted to use Kristen as clothing or a play thing. Probably not, but she could hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what gets you stuck in your form, like electricity does for me?\u201d Kristen asked a bit jokingly to see if there was a way she might be able to keep her sis as a pot for the rest of the convention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor your information, me and Dad don\u2019t know what caused that effect to Redium, but even if I knew I would never tell you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Kristen said kicking the plant almost knocking it over as Karen steadied her self at the last moment. \u201cHehe.\u201d Kristen giggled a bit, starting to understand the feeling that Karen might have felt all the times she had played with her in her Blueium forms. Karen Quickly unmerged with the pot after that and just looked at Kristen angrily. \u201cOh calm down, getting played with as an object is something you better get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft, I\u2019ll play with you\u2026\u201d Karen said under her breathe as Kristen turned around. She then ran up behind her sister and merged with her costume turning it a bright shade of red. Kristen could feel the force from behind her as she looked down and saw her new outfit. Karen tried to move Kristen\u2019s arms, but a rubber suit was no match for her and she easily pushed through her sister. \u201cStop resisting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Now you know how I feel, you have no control as clothing, trust me.\u201d At that moment, a girl walked by spraying hair spray all over her massively poofy hair, and a bit went to the side and got on Kristen\u2019s costume. Immediately Kristen could feel Karen as her costume tighten it up all over her body. \u201cOof, ok that\u2019s a bit tight, might loosening up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, that\u2019s not me\u2026\u201d Karen said blankly. \u201cAnd I feel weird now, I gotta get outta this thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen just looked down and stared at her red body suit. \u201cOk, then get to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m trying! I feel like its holding me in, whats up with your suit?\u201d That\u2019s when it hit Kristen. The hair spray must have had some effect on the Redium and it causes it to hold it\u2019s merge. She assumed it must be something in the compressed aerosol but stop thinking about it quickly realizing her sister who had always tormented her was now her outfit, and she could really show her what it felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess we know what your electric shock is eh?\u201d Kristen said giggling. Karen\u2019s heart dropped as she knew that now she was in the hands of her sister, who was ready to get some payback. \u201cThis will certainly make it easier for both of us to use you ticket tomorrow. And just like me, I\u2019m sure Dad wont mind me keeping you like this for a bit as he works out a solution. Karen had only had her powers for a little while but she already knew how Kristen had felt being so vulnerable and so used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen spent the rest of the day exploring the Con finding some of her favorite actors and buying a few limited edition comics. When the end of the day finally came, their father showed up to pick them both up and Kristen told him exactly what happened, and like she expected he said she could keep Karen for a bit as he worked on some ideas as to what would reverse it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home, Kristen changed out of her sister, neatly folding her and sticking her in her dresser, much to Karen\u2019s dismay, but once the drawer was closed, she could hardly hear her moaning about it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kristen woke up bright and early ready for the second day that she never thought she would get a chance to go to. She took a nice hot shower, making sure not to make it too hot, as a day down the drains would certainly not be pleasant. During her breakfast though is when she had to do what she had planned since last night. Eating his food was the only time their father had left his lab and so Kristen would get a great chance at something only she had had the pleasure of experiencing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heading upstairs and pulled Karen from her dresser and crept past her dad so he wouldn\u2019t she her go into his lab. She quickly ran over to the machine and put in the disk from her computer of a design he had made a long time ago. Setting Karen\u2019s bodysuit form on the entrance, she pressed the obvious green start bottom and watch as her sister dropped into the machine shouting, \u201cNooooo\u2026..\u201d the whole way done. It was a moment Kristen hadn\u2019t though she\u2019d ever get to see. Watching the machine work from the outside. Although she did think it was quite a bit more interesting on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the ding went off and out dropped her masterpiece. Picking up Karen, there was no longer any yelling about how she would pay or that she hated being folded, it was just silent. \u201cThat\u2019s more like it, guess just a bit of alterations to you will shut you up, hehe.\u201d She rolled up all the parts of Karen and headed to her room to get ready for the day. She put Karen is a backpack so her dad wouldn\u2019t see what she had done to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had been dropped of, she quickly got changed into her new outfit: The Crimson Witch. The machine had done great work on Karen as it not only changed her form but slit her up into multiple pieces, including a bikini bottom, cape, corset, gloves, hat, and pair of heels. It took Kristen a bit of time to get all the parts on and get the corset tightened correctly. Once every part of Karen was situated though, she headed out to the convention floor. Like her mother the day before, people swamped around her asking for pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew the outfit was going to look good, but it had turned out much better than she expected and she got to be the one in the costume being asked for photos instead of the costume. She finally made it out of the hordes after a few hours and went to look about all of the booths she had missed from the day before. Unfortunately for her, a guy, who was apparently a huge fan of her character asked for a picture with her and she didn\u2019t want to disappoint so she posed with him on her right. He stuck his arm around her, cell phone in his hand as another gentleman took the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after the flash, as he pulled his hand away, a small shock shot across the air from his phone and went right into Kristen. Although he was too busy ogling his new screensaver to notice she wasn\u2019t moving, and it wasn\u2019t by choice. Oh no! Kristen thought to herself, A shock while I\u2019m transformed means I lose control, but I guess it works the same if I am shocked while human. Now I can\u2019t move or speak, and neither can Karen as my outfit, uh-oh\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs people walked by, they noticed her unmoving form and figured that she was just some realistic mannequin set up by the company to promote the comics. Now every minute of so someone would come over a take a picture with her, and every one in ten would grab a feel just to see if it felt as real as it looked. Eventually though, someone who must work for the Crimson Witch comics saw her and figured she was a misplaced prop. Getting another guy to help him, they took her back over to their booth and set her next to a stand of some of the rarest comics from the series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards the end of the day though, the manager of the booth noticed the new mannequin and asked why it was there. The employees apologized and took the mannequin to the front at the lost and found. Kristen spent the next 4 hours standing completely still till the Con had ended and most of the people had left. Her dad was supposed to pick them up over and our ago as well, but how was he supposed to know to look in the lost and found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for the stuck girls, he did eventually think of the idea something may have happened and checked there. He recognized Kristen but not what she was wearing. He had noticed her leave during breakfast that morning and figured that that was what she must have been doing. It still took him 15 minutes to explain to the security guard that it was his \u2018statue\u2019 and had been stolen, but after showing photos of the \u2018statue\u2019 before the Con, he let him take it home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course he had to wait till they got home to use the MEZ\u2019er and shock Kristen back to herself. She immediately fell to the ground as the fatigue in her legs hit her. \u201cYou\u2019ve really got to watch out, you could have just as easily been sold to some guy and put up in his comic book store. As for your sister, my research indicates that the substance in the aerosol combines with her molecules and the best way to break them apart is a bit of detergent and water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen got the idea and stripped Karen off handing her to her dad ask he walked to another room and she could hear the washing machine rumble into life. He then came back over to Kristen and said, \u201cI know it can be fun, to be something or use your sister, but you really do have to watch out, if any one knew about your abilities and wanted to get you, all they\u2019d need is a little shock.\u201d Kristen nodded at her father, taking his word of warning. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to tell you sister the same thing when she gets out of the wash, but for now, just go to sleep, and rest up. Who knows what you kids will get up to tomorrow.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the last few weeks, Kristen\u2019s Family had been seeing less and less of her. Her parents didn\u2019t mind much as they just assumed she was busy more than usual, but Karen, was suspicious as an younger sister would be. She knew there had to be a boy involved and she wanted to find out who he was. She had been spending a lot of time getting used to her new Redium powers that her father helped her get. She could now just freely in and out of items, which would turn them a shade of bright red and give her control over it. The most fun she had been having lately was merging with her old Barbies and exploring the house as a miniature person. The only down side was that hairspray, of all things, would not only prevent her from leaving what ever she was merged with but also disable her ability to move. \u201cBut honestly, how often will I get hit with hair spray?\u201d she always thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a plan worked out to find out about Kristen\u2019s secret boyfriend. She would sneak into her apartment using the spare key her parents had to Kristen\u2019s place, and merge with something that was already red, so it wouldn\u2019t change. Then she would hide out till she brought him home and catch her sister red handed! She texted Kristen asking what she was up to, and getting a response of \u201cI\u2019m busy brat, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d she knew something had to be going down that night. Kristen was usually pretty honest about her nights, and would only ever go into mean older sis mode when she was hiding something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren started walking to Kristen\u2019s, which was only 2 miles away, but she got tired quickly and wanted an easier way. She merged with a rock nearby waiting for the next person to pass by, and lucky her, it was a girl with a backpack on. He\u2019d never notice if it changed colors for the next couple of blocks. She popped out of the rock for just long enough to get her composure and merge into the backpack, turning it a nice shade of red. Karen transportation turned off onto a different street about a block from Kristen\u2019s, so the Redium girl came out of her form before the bouncing made her go crazy and finished the journey on foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren knew Kristen had gotten out of class around 10 minutes ago, so she would be home anytime. She got to work looking around the apartment for something red and centrally located to make sure she would get a good view of anything that would go on. But the problem wasn\u2019t finding something in a good location but finding something red at all. She was hunting throughout the entire apartment and could find a single thing even colored red aside from clothes, but unluckily for her, Kristen always kept her clothes either in her dresser or in the hamper, so that wasn\u2019t much help. She checked the last room she was willing to, the bathroom, as she heard the door open. She looked around quickly and saw her sister\u2019s red toothbrush. Guess I don\u2019t have another option right now, She thought to herself. She become one with it before her sister walked past the bathroom on her way down the hall to her bedroom. She unmerged with the toothbrush, which she now realized was probably filthy and peeked a glance at her sister in her room changing clothes. For a redhead, she sure doesn\u2019t have much red around, Karen mumbled to herself in her own head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then it hit her, her only option. Kristen was a RED-head. She wasn\u2019t even sure if it would work, but she didn\u2019t have any other options unless she wanted to be used to clean her sister\u2019s teeth, and at least this way she would get a good view of what ever her sister did and where ever she went. Karen waited till Kristen had her back turned and open the door just enough to slip in and closing her eyes she jumped into her sister\u2019s red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen flipped around quickly, swearing she heard someone walk up behind her, but no one was there. She calmly brushed the hair out of her face and turned back around to finish putting on her jeans, and pairing it with a grey top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess now begins the waiting game, Karen, knew she could speak aloud or her sister would know something was up, and would no doubt use her Blueium abilities to get back at Karen. So Karen just patiently waited on her sisters head as she did random chore about her place. The only thing she could do to amuse herself, was every few minutes she would move back in front of Kristen\u2019s eyes so she would have to push her hair back over her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the the things Karen had become, this was by far the weirdest, but somehow the most enjoyable. She rather liked the way she would waved back and forth in the wind and how she would slide down over her shoulders when she would bend down. She didn\u2019t even mind it when she would slide into her sister cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a couple of hours, she had moved into Kristen\u2019s face one too many times and her sister did what an girl with common sense would do, she tied her hair up in a bun. Aw, way to ruin my fun, Karen thought. Now though as well, she was bobbing around while up, but unlike the bouncing of the backpack earlier, she didn\u2019t mind it too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting into being an up-do too much though as she almost missed her sister getting a text from someone about meeting up that night at a concert. Perfect, now I will finally get the see this anonymous guy now. Kristen got to work stripping down and hopped in the shower getting ready for her date tonight. All the pleasantness of being hair disappeared after she was soaked in the shower and just stuck to herself and her sister\u2019s naked body. While in the shower, Kristen was experimenting with her powers, stretching her arms out watching them become blue and them bringing them back to normal. She even shortened her legs for a bit till she was only three feet tall. Karen always wondered when Kristen would practice but wouldn\u2019t have ever thought the shower. Soon though she had returned herself to normal and was out of the shower, drying herself off. Last of course was the blow dryer which Karen thoroughly enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately she enjoyed it a bit too much. She didn\u2019t notice when her sister picked up a can off the counter and shook it in her hand. But she sure did notice when Kristen Sprayed it all through her hair. In moments, Karen went from having a jokingly good time to becoming very serious. She tried to move, but it was to no avail, she couldn\u2019t even pick up a single strand of hair. Damn her and her blow dryer! Kristen finished up her routine which included a brush of her teeth, with Karen suddenly wishing she had gone that route instead of ending up stuck as hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen then spend a few minutes looking through her drawers, pulling out all her nail polish. \u201cHow do I not have any blue nail polish?\u201d she said aloud to her self. \u201cWait!\u201d She held her nails out in front of her and watched as the lengthened a bit right before her eyes also turning a shade of deep blue thanks to the Blueium in her. \u201cWell, that certainly saves me ever having to buy blue nail polish again.\u201d She then added a clear coat on top so the had the regular sheen to them. As he left the bathroom, she turn and her hair got in her face again and she brushed it away. Looking up into the mirror, her face lit up with and idea. \u201cOh, I bet Jessica will just love this!\u201d Kristen continued to talk to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica? Isn\u2019t she that photographer chick that Krissy was friends with? Why would she care what Krissy looks like? Karen would find out later tonight, but right now she had other problems on her hands. For instance, right now Kristen\u2019s hair, Karen, was shorting itself and turning more shades of blue by the second. In just a few moments it was about 2 inches shorter and was a lovely shade of purple. \u201cPurple?\u201d Kristen said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Purple!?! Karen realized. The mix of Blueium and Redium had produced a purple product, her only hope was that Kristen wouldn\u2019t figure that out. \u201cWeird, It\u2019s not my usual shade of blue I become. I didn\u2019t think my hair was red enough to cause something like this, but oh well, it is a nice color.\u201d Whew, crisis averted, thought Karen, God knows what she would have done is she knew I was not only her hair but also unable to fight back. Adding a bit more hair spray, Kristen got her hair exactly as she wanted and then headed to her room to get dressed nice for her meet up tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting on a loose top and tight skirt, she found a nice pair of heels to accompany her outfit and then redid her make-up for the night. Looking down, she realized she could do something she had never thought about before. If a part of her body was covered up, then she could morph it freely and no one would be able to see the blue-ness. So she did what any other curious girl would do in her situation and added a couple of cup sizes. Her shirt went from being loose, to suddenly quite tight, but it was still covering her chest, so no one would wonder why the girl with big breasts had them dyed blue. She did nothing to her hips, worried it would rip the skirt if she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe met up with Jessica about a half hour later at the entrance to the venue. They give each other a quick hug which Karen expected, but then they kissed each other on the lips and it lasted even longer than the hug. Karen, didn\u2019t know what to make of it. She had always assumed it was a guy that Kristen was seeing, but it would explain why she was keeping it secret. Their parents wouldn\u2019t have a problem with it, but she could understand her not wanting to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Karen had found the information she wanted to find on her adventure, she was still stuck till her sis next washed her hair. And she was really beginning to regret becoming Krissy\u2019s hair. Kristen on the other hand was having a great time at the concert, dancing around, although not bouncing as much as she usually would because she had a bit more that would bounce with her now. Jessica as well was having a fantastic time, she didn\u2019t even mention Kristen\u2019s obvious size change and instead just copped a feel here and there, and those were just the one Karen notices with bouncing around, lucky not moving too much, thanks in part to the unnecessary amount of hair spray her had sister used on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 2 full hours of dancing some electronica music, it ended and everyone started the leave the auditorium. Being a photographer, Jessica had connections, and as such they were quite close to the front and the last to leave. They both got into Kristen\u2019s car and headed off, but from what Karen could remember of these roads, it wasn\u2019t towards her sister\u2019s apartment. \u201cYou remember the deal right babe?\u201d Jessica asked Kristen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I know, it should be interesting, and should save you quite a lot of time clothes shopping for your next shoot.\u201d Karen had no idea what they were talking about, but seeing as they weren\u2019t going back to Kristen\u2019s, she knew she wouldn\u2019t be restored as soon as she might like. They arrived as a large building in downtown that was obviously filled with high class condos. Karen could only assume it was where Jessica lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was proved correct when her sister and her girlfriend walked in and took the elevator to the 7th floor where they got out and entered a very nice looking suite. They both entered and almost immediately began stripping down, but before the now busty Kristen took of her top, Jessica grabbed her and said, \u201cleave em big, I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re blue.\u201d Kristen smiled and took off her top revealing her two large blue breasts barely contained in her bra. Both girls fooled around a bit but were too tired to do anything dirty, much to the relief of Karen having to witness this all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came, and once Kristen had woken up, breakfast was ready for her. Afterwards she began to do a few stretches in the middle of the room which really confused Karen. \u201cThe model is 5 minutes away, Ready to be my wardrobe babe?\u201d Jessica asked politely. If Karen still had eyes, they\u2019d be bulging from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup. I\u2019m here to help you sexy, just tell me what you need me to be.\u201d Kristen responded. So not only are they dating but they have some sort of business deal where Jessica hooks Krissy up with cool stuff in exchange for using Kristen as her entire wardrobe during shoots\u2026 That I didn\u2019t expect. Karen thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets start with a nice shiny dress, low-cut, and have the hem be quite high if you would.\u201d Jessica just said, winking at the end. Karen could feel herself being pulled in as Kristen began to constrict and reform her body on command. First, every part of her mixed together into one, and then she began to split apart and form the different sections of the dress. Soon she was just a small purple dress laying on the ground. Jessica picked her up as she door bell rang and she ran over to get it lightly tossing her girlfriend, now dress onto her shoulder before she could mention that she was purple instead of the usual blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn walked a beautiful blonde woman with petite proportions, but was still very sexy. She was greeted as Sara and they made light chat until Jessica pulled the dress of her shoulder and pointed down the hallway to her left, \u201cBathroom is on the left, third door down.\u201d Once the Karen/Kristen mixture of a dress was being put on, and Sara looked at her self in the mirror, both girls realized the full extent of their situation. Uh-oh, I\u2019m totally mixed with her now\u2026Karen thought, and to her surprise, someone responded. Karen!? Kristen said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat, you can hear me now? Obviously, but more importantly, now I know why my hair was purple instead of blue. I think whats important right now is getting us unmixed! Karen said to her sister. We can figure it after the shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara walked back in the living room and sat on the couch. The shoot proceeded just like any other photo shoot until it came time to change. At which point, Jessica had Sara take of the dress, and while Sara wasn\u2019t looking, she had her become a small mini skirt. More shots ensued and so did more transformations, everything from purple heels to purple bras, and even a corset. Each time Kristen altered their form thought, Karen could feel herself mixing deeper into her sister\u2019s form, and after each one, the shiny-ness of their bodies began to reduce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the shoot, Karen just felt like one piece of Kristen and Kristen felt the same. Now they were just a matte purple tank top with a basic logo on it. The worst news was yet to come. As they were finishing up the last of the pictures, Sara was getting tired and kept sliding lower on the couch. All of this slide lead to the inevitable. A small stock shock built up and shot through Sara\u2019s pants, through her body, and into her top. Kristen was shocked, she had always compared herself more to a rubbery compound when she change, but Karen had some how changed that and she was more like regular clothing now, allowing her to build up a static charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee what you\u2019ve done Karen! Me? I just wanted to do a little spying on you last night, I didn\u2019t know you practically coat yourself in hairspray when you go out or I wouldn\u2019t have gotten stuck there. There is one major problem though. During these shoots at the end, my way of telling Jessica I\u2019m finished is to force one of my should straps to fall of, but I can\u2019t do that now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on queue, Jessica said \u201cAlright, We\u2019re all done here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which Sara responded with, \u201cGreat, that was a lot of fun, and you\u2019ve got some super comfy clothes for the talent, mind if I keep this tank? I\u2019ve never had something this supportive yet stretchy before, I wonder what its made of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica didn\u2019t want to come off mean, after all, many models are allowed to keep some of the clothing from shoots so she just said, \u201cWell as long as it doesn\u2019t just fall of you now\u2026\u201d Obviously giving a hint to Kristen to expand and fall off of Sara, but of course nothing happened. \u201cI said, as long as it doesn\u2019t fall off you\u2026\u201d Jessica was starting to look a little mad now. Kristen had never told her about her electric weakness and was just assuming she was disobeying her to spend time on the model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, guess its just meant for you!\u201d Jessica said in a huff. \u201cKeep her, err it, I don\u2019t want IT any more.\u201d Sara was a bit confused at first but then squealed with joy and collected her belongings before heading out the door. Jessica just glared Sara\u2019s top the whole time until the door shut behind her. I can\u2019t Believe this, my girlfriend broke up with me because she thinks as ran away with some model as her clothing and I am stuck mixed with my dorky little sister! Hey, I can hear you, you know! I know, but I\u2019m just mad. Besides all of that we just got added to some woman\u2019s closet and no one even knows where we are\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once home, Sara merely spent the rest of her day cleaning her house, which was mostly just a lot of bending over. Luckily not a lot of work on the tank top sisters. The next day though they were in for quite the treat as Sara decided to go for a run in the morning and workout in the afternoon, both in her new favorite top. The day after that was easier on the purple tank as she left it on its hanger in the closet. But just sitting there and not doing anything was almost worse than the work out. Lucky for them, on their third day in her wardrobe she wore the top out shopping, which wouldn\u2019t have been so bad were it not that she wanted to try everything on at least once. So she was constantly taking her top on and off in different dressing rooms and the first few times she hung it up, but eventually she just tossed it on the ground till she needed it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Kristen was over getting dumped and her and Karen both agreed they just wanted to be normal again, or at the very least split up. This next day was something both were hoping wouldn\u2019t happen though. Sara invited her boyfriend over, and like and guy, he was a bit too touchy-feely with Sara\u2019s lady parts. Although her top seemed to mind more than she did. Fortunately they were ripped off (luckily without ripping) and tossed into another room and Sara had her alone time with her boy toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning the guy left with hardly a goodbye, but worst of all, on his way out, he stepped right on Kar-sten. About an hour later, Sara came out to see the top laying on the floor with a foot print right on the logo. She picked it up and looked right into it. \u201cOk, that\u2019s probably enough abuse for you two.\u201d Karen and Kristen were speechless. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve known all along. Your dad hired me to try and stop you from staying with that career Kristen, although when I told him the outfit I got was purple, he said his other daughter, Karen, must have mixed somehow and told me to teach you both a lesson in what could happen if you got taken away like any other object and no one knew where you went.\u201d Kristen and her younger sister could even be mad a time like this though, they were just glad they wouldn\u2019t be forever stuck as some woman\u2019s tank top. \u201cBut although I would love to stop, the box your father is shipping over to send you guys back in hasn\u2019t arrived yet, so I\u2019ve still got a few more days. And I would just ship you in any regular old box, but he wanted to use one with a GPS on it in case you get lost in the mail. So I\u2019m going to hand-wash you with water to make sure not to break either of your holds, but then its back to business as usual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Sara never once spoke to them again while they were in her possession, but she was a little nicer now, only working out once more in the top, and always wearing a nice bra with it so they wouldn\u2019t have to do so much work. Its the little things when it comes to being a tank top they realized. And after a little more than a week, a special box arrived in the mail and they were packed up and most any other clothing is, thrown into the box and sealed. Soon, they would be back home and hopefully their dad would be able to work his magic as usual and put this right. And by soon, its of course 5-7 business days to ship\u2026</span></div></div>",
