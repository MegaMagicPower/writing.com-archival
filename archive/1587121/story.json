Allow me to introduce myself, the name that I tell others is Jack Troop but that is only a lie. The true name, my birth name is Richard Maximo from the rich family that lives far, far away on an island known as Imail Downs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know why my grate, grate, great, great grandfather was place a curse on him by what my mother told me was by a witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's the curse you ask? Well I didn't believe it myself when I first heard of it and according to my mother that only the one of the men of the Maximo family in every generation. It was I whom was effected by the curse, cause it I didn't, then those that are reading this will not know anything about my life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the curse since those that are reading are still wondering then I might as well tell you, the family curse is that it slowly shrinks a man with the blood of Maximo. I lost three inches, since I've got this curse and my mother begged me to leave and never to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy does she want me to leave well it because her family is the head of the Maximo and if word got out that I'm shrinking then it would bring shame to us. So on the night that I've left, I looked back at the mansion that I once grew up in, and left without looking back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince that is out of the way, I might as well begin my tale,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a cold night as I walked through open fields of Imail Downs, feeling every chill that went through my body. I kept on walking, following the light from the full moon. When I reached the very top of the field, I looked out and I could see a camp fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that I can get some warmth, I rushed myself down there which only took me about ten minutes to reach. As I got there I saw that it was a group of four young women, each one looked at me as I walked towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you want?\u201d asked one of the woman whom has white hair and gray eyes. \u201cOh I'm sorry to intrude but may I join your campfire as you see, its very cold out here\u201d I answered. \u201cThose are fancy looking clothes you have, you from here?\u201d asked another woman with long blond hair and light blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought for only a moment but to me felt like a life time. I didn't know if I should answer the truth or lie. I took a deep breath and answered, \u201cNo...I'm not from here, I'm a traveller\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really? What's a traveller like you doing out here?\u201d asked the third woman with ginger hair and red eyes. \u201cWell, I don't have any money and I've just got kick out of an INN not so far from here\u201d I lied again. \u201cI take it that you wish to sleep here for the night?\u201d asked the fourth woman with long black hair and brown eyes.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be nice\u201d I said. \u201cIs that alright girls?\u201d asked the black hair woman as she looked at the others. The three of them smiled up at me and said it was alright. The four of them introduced themselves, the woman with white hair is Sheryl, the long blond hair  is Lene, the ginger hair woman is Scarlett and the long black hair is Alair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I made my way to sit down near the fire to keep warm, not knowing that when I wake up I would be all alone but with only one of the four women waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sheryl took out a plate, place an egg and slices of cooked bacon onto it and handed me it. \u201cThank you\u201d I said as I took the plate from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was eating, I noticed that the other three women were nowhere to be seen. \u201cThey left\u201d said Sheryl as she took out a plate for herself and put the rest of the egg and bacon on it. \u201cI'm sorry?\u201d was all I said when I looked at her confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat look you had...the others have gone their own way\u201d answered Sheryl as she began eating. \u201cOh...I thought they were your friends?\u201d I asked as I began eating. \u201cThey are, we meet up every now and then. We planned the next get to gather which will be across the sea\u201d  answered Sheryl as she finished eating her breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy what's across the sea?\u201d I asked pretending not to know the area. \u201cHmm, you really don't know this area do you? Okay then, across the sea is another island known as Dali, it is known for the home of the Witch of the Shade\u201d answered Sheryl as I finished eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWitch of the Shade?\u201d I asked as I've herd of the name before. \u201cYou haven't heard about the Witch's War here at theses Twilight Islands?\u201d asked Sheryl as she took the plate from me. \u201cI heard stories  about witches waging war with each other for something\u201d I answered  as Sheryl put the plates away inside the her rucksack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the war is over and it leaders are dead. Now then, I shall take my leave\u201d said Sheryl as she stood up and put her rucksack on. Not wanting to be alone, I shot up and said, \u201cHay wait a minute\u201d \u201cHmm, something a matter?\u201d she asked as she turned round to face me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I travel with you?\u201d I answered as I walked towards her. \u201cYou sure you want to travel with a merchant?\u201d asked Sheryl as she looked down at me as I noticed that she was around five inches taller than me. \u201cPlease, I would really like to travel with you so that I can learn about theses islands\u201d I answered. She smiled down at me with a nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the two of us headed off towards the the island of Dali, home to the Witch of the Shade. As we were walking I noticed that my clothes are slightly big and I hope that my travelling companion wouldn't notice me shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe took the first boat that sailed us to the island which wasn't that long really. It only took us till twelve to reach the port of a town known as Fishing Roo. I looked up at Sheryl and asked, \"So where are going now?\" She looked down at me and answered, \"Well I need to stock up on a few goods so that I could sell, so I like to go and look...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
