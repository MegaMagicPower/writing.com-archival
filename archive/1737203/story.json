You had been talking to the girl who's house you were going to be staying at; despite your mom's arguments but, free school was an offer she couldn't refuse. The girls name, Eva the most beautiful Eevee you'd ever seen. She's 17 about a year older than you. Her chest would be a large c cup if scaled down but, you were more interested in her character rather then her body. She was happy, energetic and shy all at once which mezmorized you. Before bed you opened your E-net account to see a message from Eva, It read.<br>\r\n    Dear, Jack <br>\r\n       I can't wait to meet you in person. Oh I'm too excited to wait. Um...please don't tell your mom this but, my parents rented me a flat in the city so I could be closer to the school. We lived too far away otherwise. They still come up or I go home on weekends but, other than that It'll be just you and me. Also a few of my friends come over now and then. Sorry I waited so long to tell you, I um ... well forgot sorry.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n       Love, Eva<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     P.s. See you tomorrow at ten.            <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Uour cheeks redden immediately at the thought of you alone with Eva, you've barely avoided saying how attractive you thought she was and this won't help at all. After that you logged out and went to sleep although you had trouble sleeping of course as thoughts whirled around although you were finally able to fall asleep. </span></div></div>",

She blushed and said \"Well you also look handsome\". Jack also blushed. \"He asked well where is the apartment you were talking about\". She responds \"Well I just left my house and walked for 10 minutes then you showed up\". \"Well I want to see the apartment.\" Jack replies impatiently. She says \"Ok I'll run to there, but I'll put you somewhere safe.\" She then picks Jack up and blushes tomato red and places you in her cleavage. She starts to run and Jack feels really happy that this is who you are living with. After 20 minutes Jack feels a sudden stop. Jack comes out the top end and looks around, he asks Eva \"Where are we?\" She then says, \"We are at...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bring!\" </i> My Ipod alarm sounds of in my pocket. <i>\"Wow, I didn't even realize I was meditating for that long.\"</i> I rush upstairs and grab my bags and head into the living room. I sit down and wait for the car to come pick me up for transportaion. I turn on my Ipod and listen to my favroite song. After about fifteen minutes the car comes and stops at our house. I hang a note on the front door and walk to the black armored car. Two beffy men were standing outside the car. Guns visable. They wore jet black suits and I could see their ear pieces. \"Your Roy M Hills?\" The first one says. \"Yes sir, thats me.\" He opens the back seat door and I get in. A hour later we make it to the research lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Mr.Hills, we have been waiting for your arivle.\" A thin scientist walk up to me saying. He was bald with a lab coat and glasses. A typical sterotypical scientist. I look around and see many gards with guns. \"Whats with all the security? I mean why so much for this?\" \"We have one of the only teloporters on earth, and many poeple want to eather take information or stop the entire project for resons unknown. Anyways, follow me and we'll go get you ready for the teloportation.\" I follow him to a glass room where people in lab coats were checking data and examining th equmpment. \"Alright Mr.Hills, before you go in we need to tell you things you may expect to see in the teloporter.\" \"Ok then, like what?\" \"Well, you may halusanate, vomat, and...\" <i>\"BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR\"</i> \"Whats that?\" \"Oh no...\" \"Oh no? Ho no what? What wrong?\" \"Someones broken into the buliding. Come on we got to get you out saftly.\" The scientist grabs my hand and rushes off torward the teloporter. \"Crash!\" The door explodes open and ten huge beffy men walk through the smoke. \"Start the portal!\" The man you we're with yells.\" The portal wirls up and glows bright white. The men start shooting others and the scientist pushes me through the portal. \"Whoa!\" I start to spin and I black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the boy out.\" \"Hahaha, y-you cant he's gone for good now. He's on his way to the other world, and you shot the power suply trying to shoot him, you cant even go after him.\" The old scientist coffes up blood and spits at the main gunner. \"Oh don't worry, I'll get him and your going to help me. The men walk out of the lab and drive off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It scared you a bit knowing that you were going to be somewhere with only Pokemon that were bigger than you, but the girl you were supposed to stay with had made you feel a little less nervous about the whole thing. \u201cHey Roy, are you there?\u201d \u2018Speaking of her\u2026\u2019 You thought as you replied with a pathetic yes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the computer and see Serene, the Espeon you were going to stay with. The name fit her personality perfectly and went so well with her looks. Her blue fur was absolutely gorgeous and looked so soft. You first would look at her adorable ears and would follow them back to her head, then to her forehead. The red orb on her forehead you found cool and you really wanted to touch it, at least once. Then your eyes would shift to her long, silky light blue hair that fell to her shoulders.  She had a great figure, with what looked to be a pair of D\u2019s, but you never really cared. You were always more focused on her face or that double-ended tail of hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe always was waving it to where you could see, almost as if she did it intentionally to get your attention. She would occasionally walk to move around. She moved with such grace and coordination. Serene was always nice and never seemed to get angry. Her voice was always so calm that it helped you relax, even if you were already relaxed. Overall she seemed perfect, even after talking to her for months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you talked to her through messages, because you were a bit timid. But as you warmed up to her, you slowly started talking to her via video chatroom. Over the course of a few months, you had become excellent friends with her, even with your shy personality. You had even thought about asking her to go out with you at one point, but quickly got rid of that thought as she was probably way out of your league, not to mention size. \u201cHi Serene.\u201d You said as you took a seat. \u201cRoy, why are you still so nervous? You know I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got a bit depressing knowing she could tell how you felt, but at least she wasn\u2019t abusing that ability. \u201cIt\u2019s not you I\u2019m worried about. It\u2019s everybody else. I\u2019m small enough that they could take me out with a single hit.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t let anyone get close to you or even let them try and hurt you.\u201d \u201cThanks Serene, but what about your family? They\u2019re going to be a lot closer than anyone at school and they\u2019re related to you.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019d try and hurt you. Besides their nice for the most part.\u201d \u201cIf you say so. I just hope they\u2019re as nice as you.\u201d It looked as if she blushed a bit, but it was hard to tell. \u201cWell I\u2019d thought I\u2019d let you know that I will probably be doing most of the talking for you, since we both know that\u2019s not your specialty.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid back and breathed a sigh of relief. You had a hard time with talking to people and others often thought it was just you being rude. This had to be a dream, you would be staying with a girl as nice as Serene and she would help you out. It seemed too perfect to be real. \u201cThank you so much Serene.\u201d \u201cNo problem Roy. I can\u2019t wait to see you tomorrow.\u201d You didn\u2019t say anything, but you nodded your head and you blushed a bit. You never had a girl actually wanting to see you and that struck you as a bit foreign. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you either\u201d You said and you both shut the E-Net off. You checked your bag once more and when you were sure you had everything, you laid down for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you had gotten up early, thanks to your alarm, and got in the shower. You had told your friends goodbye last night and your family goodbye this morning. Afterwards, you had a big breakfast and waited for your ride to come and get you. What pulled up was a mid-size pick up truck. \u201cYou are Mr. Roy, correct?\u201d You nodded and threw your bags in the bed. He drove off and the whole way you wondered why it was a truck that came and got you. Was it to attract little attention? Did they not feel like paying for a limo? Regardless, you sat there and shifted from thinking about the vehicle to thinking about Serene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to be huge, but how huge? And what about everyone else, were they going to be kind or jerks? You started to panic a bit at all the talking you would have to do, even if Serene would help you out a bit. You eventually reached the site of the dimensional gate, got out of the truck and grabbed your bags. As soon as you got out of truck, seven men in black suits stood around you and escorted you in to a room with the gate. The men left and a scientist walked in. \u201cIt is good to see you, Mr. Roy. Are you ready?\u201d You nod and he fires up the portal. You took in one deep breath and ran through the gateway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around a few seconds later and see that you have made it. The grass was about to your waist, but you walked through it with ease. That\u2019s when you look ahead and see a blue object in the grass. You walk over to it and notice it\u2019s soft and has three parts, one part being a lot longer than the other two. \u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d You ask yourself as you start stroking it. Whatever it was moved a bit, then returned to staying still. You were about to stroke it again, but something lifted you in the air. You felt nothing grab you and you started to flail about. You still had your duffle bag in one hand and that\u2019s when you noticed both you and the bag were coated in some pinkish glow. Then you remembered the time Serene showed you how she made things levitate and the object had the same glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfirming your suspicions, you looked up to see a huge face looking at you. When you were about eye level, the glow faded away and you were caught in large hands. You looked at all of her and said nothing. She was pretty big and that left you stunned. \u201cHi Roy\u201d Serene said. Her voice seemed a little deeper and louder, but it really didn\u2019t change that much. \u201cH-Hi Serene\u201d You stuttered out. \u201cIs my size intimidating you?\u201d She asked. \u201cK-Kinda, but it\u2019s more the shock of your beauty from this size.\u201d You said, trying not to let the fear mess with you. \u201cThanks\u201d She said as she started to pet your little head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt soothed you and you almost wanted to sit down. \u201cI-It\u2019s nice to see you in person.\u201d You said. \u201cAs it is you\u201d she responded. Her fur felt just as soft as you imagined and it was such a beautiful blue too. You sat there before she stood up, with you still in her hand. \u201cAre you ready to go my home?\u201d Serene asked as she looked at you with her big eyes. You nodded and were once again floating. She set you down on her head and she began walking presumably home.</span></div></div>",

It just didn\u2019t seem like a city without the cars, but there weren\u2019t cars anywhere in this world. You had to admit, though, it was pretty nice not having somebody speed right by you. Eventually she got to a house that was massive (no pun intended). \u201cHere we are.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, but why does it seem so big?\u201d \u201cAssuming you mean from my point of view, it\u2019s big because my family is so big.\u201d You remembered how she told you about her three sisters, three brothers, and her parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all managed to live in this house. \u201cSo how do you all fit?\u201d \u201cWell luckily we each get our own room. My parents have their room, poor Andrew has to stay in the basement, and everyone else gets their own room.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s Andrew?\u201d \u201cI never did tell you who was who, did I? Forgive me for that. Andrew is my twin and he is an Umbreon.\u201d \u201cI forgive you, but why doesn\u2019t he have a room?\u201d \u201cWell everybody wanted their own room and whoever didn\u2019t get one had to make the basement their room. None of us were willing to give up a room and it drove our parents crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he said he would take it.\u201d \u201cHow did you guys get a place with so many rooms? It seems so expensive.\u201d \u201cIt is, but that\u2019s part of the reason why we signed up for taking you in, so we could get a better home. The other reason is because I wanted to see if you were as cute as I thought, and I was right.\u201d You lowered your head onto hers and sighed. She again managed to embarrass you. She walked in the front door and headed towards some stairs. She went up them and to a bedroom with pink walls. You assumed this was her room and looked at everything it contained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pink bed to match the walls, a standing mirror, and some various plushes lying on the floor. She also had a desk with various things scattered on its surface, one of which being a laptop and what looked to be a model house. \u201cSo you know whose room this is, good\u201d she said as she shut the door behind her. She obviously knew that from sensing your emotions. That was one thing about her you were glad about: She could only read emotions, not your mind. \u201cWell welcome to my humble abode, even if it is just a part of this house.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the desk and grabbed you in her hands. She set you down by the house and opened the door for you. You walked in and saw that it was made for someone about your size. It was only a single story, but that was more than enough for you. \u201cAnd that is your domain\u201d she said as she peered in a window. She startled you, but you looked around the house until you found a bedroom. There was a bed and a dresser with a mirror. You set your bag down and began putting everything away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything had a spot, you walked back out to see Serene waiting for you. \u201cThank you. It\u2019s great.\u201d \u201cYour welcome, but isn\u2019t there something you want to ask?\u201d \u201cUm, yeah. Where will I shower and use the facilities?\u201d \u201cWe have an entire bathroom set up for you in our upstairs bathroom, but isn\u2019t there something else?\u201d She asked moving her face closer to you. \u201cN-n-not that I can think of.\u201d \u201cYes there is. I know it from talking to you. You can ask, I\u2019m not going to be rude about it.\u201d You stood there a little scared from her staring at you with those massive eyes and you had no clue what she thought you were going to ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking to her, you only had two real questions: Why she was nice to total stranger not even of the same race as her and\u2026 would she go out with you. That\u2019s when it all clicked into place. She had sensed the care you had for her and kept it a secret this whole time. You felt weak knowing whatever you felt couldn\u2019t be kept secret. \u201cOh please don\u2019t feel that way. I just like to make sure someone is happy and sometimes those kinds of things get sensed.\u201d \u201cWell here goes, even though I don\u2019t see a point in asking. Serene, would you go out with me?\u201d \u201cOf course\u201d She said as she wrapped you in a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did your best to hug her back, but it was so hard with her size compared to yours. A knock interrupted your hug and she loosened up on you. \u201cSerene, are you there?\u201d \u201cYes mom and I have our guest.\u201d \u201cPlease come out, we would all like to meet him.\u201d \u201cOkay mom, just a second.\u201d She gave you a quick kiss and levitated you to the top of her head. She then walked over to the door and you saw the entire family waiting at the door. Your eyes got really big at seeing eight different faces and fear spread over you like a veil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them, looking at you, and you would have to talk to all of them. \u201cWell let\u2019s all get to know each other where we aren\u2019t crowding each other out\u201d A male Eevee said. Everybody started walking downstairs and Serene followed behind them. \u201cHey, everything will be okay. They won\u2019t tear you apart. Remember, we\u2019re not evil, we\u2019re just bigger than you.\u201d Serene whispered up to you. Although you were still frightened, her words helped to soothe you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You held on to Serene as she walked down the stairs and into a room with a large round table (Again, no pun intended). She took a seat between a Vaporeon and an Umbreon. You looked around and saw everyone seated there:  Andrew the Umbreon, Serene, a Vaporeon, a Jolteon, a Flareon, a male and female Eevee, a Glaceon, and a Leafeon. All of them looked at you and you tried your best to get as low on Serene\u2019s head to try and avoid being the center of attention. The female Eevee kept looking at you until a timer sounded. She got up and went over to shut it off. Then she pulled out some food from an oven and walked it over to the table. She set it down and looked at everyone, then at Serene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Serene, since you have our little guest, why don\u2019t you start off this meal?\u201d You put your face flat against Serene\u2019s fur. You knew you were smaller and weaker than everyone present, but it still hurt to know you were small and weak compared to them. She levitated you off her head and set you down by her plate. She reached out to grab some of the meat and vegetables that had been cooked. She set them on her plate and started cutting each peace into small enough pieces that you could bite off of. Everyone else grabbed their food in an order of some sort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dEverybody this is Roy. \u201c Serene said as she lifted you far above her head with her abilities. You almost tried to swim in the pink aura, but to no avail. The Glaceon gave a little giggle and you felt like a mini sideshow. Everybody said hi in some tone of voice and you waved back, knowing they probably wouldn\u2019t hear you anyway. She lowered you back to eye level and moved you over to Andrew. \u201cRoy this is Andrew, my twin.\u201d  \u201cNice to meet you, Roy.\u201d \u201cA-as it is you.\u201d She then moves you over to the Leafeon. \u201cThis is one of my younger sisters, Lily.\u201d You both said hi and you were levitated over to the Glaceon. \u201cThis is my other little sister, Sarah.\u201d She gave a shy hello and you replied back with a nervous hello. You were already having a hard time saying a simple hello without stuttering and you weren\u2019t even halfway through yet. You were moved over to the female Eevee. \u201cThis is my mom.\u201d Serene said \u201cH-hi Mrs. Variform\u201d You said to her mother, to which she responded \u201cJust call me Kathy. If you need anything, just let us know.\u201d \u201cO-okay\u201d You were passed around the table from Kathy to Marcus, Kathy\u2019s husband and Serene\u2019s father. From there, you were passed to Serene\u2019s older siblings, Greg the Flareon, Matt the Jolteon, and Ashley the Vaporeon. Finally you were set back down by Serene\u2019s plate and you exhaled deeply. Even though it really wasn\u2019t all that difficult, just talking seemed like such a task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone voraciously ate their food. Your introduction to the three brothers, three sisters, and the parents had obviously stirred an appetite in everyone, including you. You would walk up to Serene\u2019s plate and grab a piece of either meat or a vegetable and eat it as though it were an apple. You finished a lot quicker than everyone else and watched as they ate. When they were finished, everybody stretched and put their dishes in the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone came back to the table and started asking about your world. You told your answers to Serene and she said them for you. Then the questions switched from being about your world to being about you and your family. They ranged from \u201cwhat was it like living with your family\u201d to \u201cwhat\u2019s it like being near someone so big\u201d. Although it seemed weird for them to be taking such an interest in you personally, you still answered. Finally everybody stood up and stretched, about to head their own way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Serene\u2019s parents told everyone good night and made their way to bed. Ashley went to the living room and turned on the television. Sarah and Lily pleaded to watch their own show, and when faced with Ashley\u2019s refusal, they headed to their own rooms. That left Serene, you, Andrew, Matt, and Greg standing in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene was about to lift you off the table and head upstairs when Andrew put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cSis, can we talk to Roy alone?\u201d \u201cWhat about\u201d Serene asked, casting a suspicious glance at her brothers. \u201cJust a little talk, man to men.\u201d Greg said. \u2018More like man to giants\u2019 you thought to yourself as you fearfully awaited her decision. \u201cI guess, just no hurting him or scaring him. He\u2019s already scared as is.\u201d Serene said as she looked at you with caring eyes. You gave her a face that almost showed abandonment. She walked over to you and moved her face in close to yours. \u201cThey aren\u2019t going to hurt you and try not to let them intimidate you.\u201d She said as she stood up straight and walked upstairs. \u2018Yeah, don\u2019t be intimidated Roy, they\u2019re just a lot bigger than you, more powerful than you, and it\u2019s three to one. What do you have to be afraid of?\u2019 you said in your mind as the brothers all took seats close to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how are things Roy? Everything working out alright?\u201d Greg said as he put on a smile. That smile made you nervous and you nodded your head, unable to utter any words. \u201cBoy she wasn\u2019t kidding when she said he was scared. Are you sure we should be doing this? Dad doubts his abilities and trusts him.\u201d Andrew said. \u201cWhile he may be small, there should be no doubt about his abilities. I don\u2019t want my sister to be hurt by his kind because we underestimated him.\u201d Matt said as he shot you a flash of those sharp teeth. You felt a little hurt by that stereotype and shocked by their knowledge of you and Serene\u2019s companionship. \u201cThat looks tells me you\u2019re a bit shocked. If it\u2019s about you and Serene going out, we knew that long before you asked. She told us all about how you liked her.\u201d Greg said. That was one question out of the way, but they still had their stereotype going against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSo why did you want to come here?\u201d Matt asked. \u201cB-because I needed to go to sc-school and thought I\u2019d try for here.\u201d \u201cSure, but what makes our school so special? Is it because you can stay with our sister?\u201d \u201cN-no\u201d You replied, watching as Greg and Matt slowly moved their faces closer to you. Andrew just seemed to be there for support of their obviously-successful fear tactic, but what he said next soon took away that hope. \u201cSo why should we trust you? I mean your kind does harm and kill each other for no truly worthy purpose. So how do we know you won\u2019t try that here?\u201d You weren\u2019t sure how to answer or if you even could answer. Sure, there were obviously bad people, but how could you tell them about the good people? Not many of those good people were put down in the history books, only those who lived off wealth or had done some massive crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all waited for an answer, but not a single response came to you. \u201cJust as I thought, here to do harm and no good.\u201d Greg said as he quickly shut his trap. You noticed it looked like his mouth was glowing and that\u2019s when you knew he was about to attack. Anywhere you could run was open space and the other two could always get you if Greg missed. You cowered and waited for something. You laughed in your mind how you thought coming to this world would be so cool. Full of huge, anthromorphic pokemon and you got to stay with one. \u2018Oh, how quickly the tides turn\u2019 you said in your mind as you braced for the hit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d Ashley said as she stood at the doorway.  You looked at her and so did the brothers. \u201cWe\u2019re making sure he doesn\u2019t hurt Serene\u201d Greg said as the attack he had charged seemed to be lost. \u201cBy attacking him? You\u2019re going to hurt Serene worse than you ever can ever hurt him.\u201d She said as she walked over to the table and picked you up. She held you close to her heart and you heard the massive beating. Even if it was louder than yours, you had her dominated in how quick it was beating. \u201cWhat are you doing?! He\u2019s a human and you know what they\u2019ve done!\u201d \u201cYes I do, but I doubt all of them are like those examples you\u2019ve heard of. Besides Serene is smart and would only choose someone she knew she could trust. You were there when she refused to go out with Jared.\u201d Greg growled in defeat and Andrew seemed to be thinking. Matt sat there with electricity arcing over himself. Ashley turned around and you held tight to her. You weren\u2019t sure how easy it would be to be held and walking, and you had been so frightened by Matt, Greg and Andrew that you were shivering. She started to walk out when Matt said \u201cYou\u2019re making a big mistake. He\u2019s only going to hurt somebody!\u201d \u201cMaybe, but there is only one way to find out. Besides, he's cute and doesn\u2019t seem evil.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes and held tight to her, feeling that if you loosened up even a little, the three brothers would be there to bring you harm. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019re going to go see Serene and everything will be alright.\u201d Ashley whispered down to you. You didn\u2019t open your eyes or flinch, you just clung to her. Her hand soon surrounded you as you felt her move up the stairs and knock on the door. \u201cYes?\u201d you heard Serene ask. \u201cIt\u2019s your big sis, open up.\u201d She did and saw her sister standing there. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ashley opened her hand that held you and Serene saw you. You were still clung tight to Ashley\u2019s breast, but you were trembling with fear and had an irregular breathing pattern. \u201cI think I should come in so we can talk\u201d Ashley said and Serene stood aside. As soon as both sisters were in the room, they both sat on the bed and Serene closed the door with her psychic powers. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Serene asked. \u201cOur brothers wanted to make sure that he didn\u2019t hurt any of us, especially you.\u201d Ashley said as she stroked your back. It felt good, but you weren\u2019t ready to move yet. \u201cSo did they\u2026\u201d Serene was cut off by Ashley. \u201cThey were about to. They scared the life out of him, and when he didn\u2019t answer a question, Greg took that as an admission of evil intentions. They only did it because they care about you.\u201d Serene started to cry and went to remove you from Ashley, but when her hand got close, you jerked a bit. \u201cRoy, are you okay?\u201d She asked through the tears. You didn\u2019t respond. All you did was turn your head more into Ashley\u2019s chest. \u201cI think right now he\u2019s paralyzed with fear and unsure of whom he can trust. I\u2019m going to stay here because he\u2019s both attached to me and he needs to have someone else he can trust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You all sat there and after a lot of having your back stroked, you started to loosen up on Ashley. \u201cDo you feel a little better?\u201d She asked as she looked down on you. You nodded and walked over to Serene. She held a hand out for you and you walked onto it. \u201cSo what was the worst part of it to you?\u201d You looked at Ashley, then at Serene. \u201cHe\u2019s paralyzed because he was afraid before of us before and I told him that we weren\u2019t anything to fear.\u201d Serene said. \u201cIs that true\u201d She asked, and you nodded. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk?\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk because he has problems with speaking to people and the fear of us thrown onto that.\u201d \u201cOh so it\u2019s not you being rude. I wasn\u2019t sure what to think. Sis here said you were quiet for one reason, and tonight seemed like it was just you being rude.\u201d You dropped your head and sighed. \u201cWhat, did I say something wrong?\u201d Ashley asked as she cocked her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just that people always thought the same exact thing back in his world and he was hoping here would be different.\u201d \u201cOh\u2026 I would like to know how you know so much about him.\u201d \u201cBecause everything I know he told to me or explained when I asked.\u201d Ashley nodded and Serene wrapped you in a hug and began stroking you.\u201d \u201cThanks sis.\u201d Serene said. \u201cNo problem. Somebody had to be on his side along with you. Besides, Matt, Greg, and Andrew weren\u2019t thinking the way they should have. Do YOU trust me?\u201d She asked looking at you. You broke away from Serene to smile and say yes. Ashley was a bit surprised that you talked, but nonetheless accepted it. \u201cGood night\u201d you all said to each other and Ashley left Serene\u2019s room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry they did that to you.\u201d Serene said as she kissed you. \u201cIt\u2019s okay and it\u2019s like Ashley said, they did it because they care about you.\u201d She looked like she was going to say something, but kept her mouth shut. \u201cOne thing I have to ask, where is the restroom in case I need to use it?\u201d She set you on the floor and sent you off towards a hole in the wall. \u201cThrough there is a bathroom made for your size and no one can disturb you there. It\u2019s got everything you\u2019ll need.\u201d You nodded and walked through the hole. You looked for a light switch and when you found it, you flipped it up. The bathroom had been bathed in light and you saw it was more than big enough. It had a nice shower and a bunch of other good things. \u201cHow did you do this?\u201d You yelled out for her to hear. \u201cVery carefully. I had to use my powers to build everything in there. You turned on everything and saw that it worked. \u201cWhere is this even at? You said it was in your bathroom.\u201d \u201cIt is. It\u2019s just behind the cabinet to where nobody can get to it. Is it good?\u201d You walked out and gestured for her to get closer. You kissed her and said it\u2019s excellent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climbed up her desk to go to bed and you were stopped halfway up. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d \u201cTo bed\u201d She laid on her bed and levitated you over to her. \u201cYou sleep with me, Roy.\u201d \u201cYou blushed and replied \u201cReally? What do your parents think?\u201d She cuddled you up in her arms and started to drift off to sleep. \u201cWho do you think gave me permission?\u201d You were in the valley of her chest and you both drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up and stared into the darkness that surrounded you. You were unsure of why you woke up and you didn\u2019t feel like you would be asleep anytime soon. Slowly, you maneuvered out of Serene\u2019s chest and walked down to the foot of her bed. Searching for a way to get down, you noticed her sheets touched the floor. You scurried down them and soon both feet made contact with the floor. You wandered off into your bathroom to use the facilities as well as take a soothing shower, hoping it would help relax both mind and body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n That\u2019s when you realized the reason you had awoken was because of your fear; the fear if this world would be as harsh as Serene\u2019s brothers had been. Would this entire world think of humans as a living evil? Sure Serene and Ashley trusted you, but what if nobody else did? They may attack like Matt, Greg, and Andrew wanted to and Serene may try to take the hits for you. You didn\u2019t want her hurt because of what you were, even if neither of you had control over it. You finished your shower, got dressed, and wandered back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing had changed during your shower: Serene was still asleep, darkness still enveloped everything, and the moon still gleamed through the window. You wanted to look outside and see what it looked like, but there was no way you were just going to get to the windowsill. That\u2019s when you noticed her desk was close enough that you could climb the desk and just walk to the window. You indeed found a way to the flat of the desk and moved over to the window. The moon looked dazzling and the world looked so different. That\u2019s when your thoughts came back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What if this world really is that bad? What if nobody trusts me? I don\u2019t want an entire school hating the only human there. Is there some way I can change their thinking?\u2019 You shook the thoughts off and ended your thinking process with hopes: Hopes this world will trust you, hopes you can make friends, hopes that things will be better than you thought before. Soon you heard some noises and looked over to the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoy.\u201d Serene said in a sleep state as she touched the region on her chest where you were sleeping. When she felt nothing but herself, she sat up, snapped awake and looked around. \u201cRoy?!\u201d She called out a little louder than before. \u201cI\u2019m over here, by the window\u201d You said as you waved a bit. She noticed your silhouette and levitated it back to her bed. Although you liked being by the window, at least now you didn\u2019t have to climb back down and then up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? I can tell you\u2019re afraid, but why? My brothers didn\u2019t scare you again somehow, did they?\u201d \u201cNo it\u2019s just I\u2019m worried, worried if everyone else will think of me as your brothers did.\u201d \u201cOh Roy\u201d Serene said as she hugged you as tight as she could without hurting you. She just sat there and hugged you until she spoke up again. \u201cRoy, I don\u2019t think many of us here think of you guys as evil. There may truths to what is said, but most know that only a slim few are evil. I know a bunch of my friends think you were pretty cute and not evil.\u201d \u201cYeah and Ashley does too, but what about Greg\u2019s friends? You and your friends see me as nice, but what about him and all his comrades? That\u2019s what scares me.\u201d \u201cWell, you said it yourself that they were mean for my protection, so everyone else should be less caring about you than they were. Let\u2019s go to sleep, it\u2019s late and we\u2019re both tired.\u201d You indeed were tired and you snuggled up in her warm fur. Soon you had both drifted off to sleep for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning soon came and the sun was evidence of that. You flinched at the sight of the sunlight, but Serene only seemed to want to bathe in it. \u201cMorning there, cutie\u201d She said as she giggled. \u201cGood morning\u201d You said as she stood up and stretched. She laid you back down and started to stroke you. It felt so good, but it seemed to paralyze you. \u201cRelaxing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d You only nodded and smiled up at her. \u201cGood. Well let\u2019s get the day started. I\u2019ve got to go take a shower so I\u2019m not waiting all morning. I\u2019ll see you when I get back.\u201d She said as she set you near your bathroom and winked at you. You blushed and quickly went into your bathroom. You got in the shower and enjoyed this time around more than you did last night. This time, your mind was clear and you were completely awake. You finished up and got ready for your first day at school with Serene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in your \u201chouse\u201d and about to walk out when you saw an Umbreon, a Flareon, and a Jolteon. You quickly run back in and hide in some crevice, hoping that if they were here for you, this spot would keep you hidden. \u201cHey Serene, we want to talk.\u201d Andrew said. \u201cI bet she\u2019s already in the bathroom. Great, now we\u2019ll have to wait!\u201d Matt said as he bolted out of the room. \u201cNo patience whatsoever. I guess he\u2019s right and we\u2019ll have to wait to talk about our little guest with her until later.\u201d Greg said as both he and Andrew walked out of her room. You slowly breathed out in relief as Greg\u2019s tail snaked around the doorframe. You waited a few more seconds just to be sure they were gone before you came out of hiding. How would breakfast go when you were at the same table as them? Your thoughts were interrupted as a door shut and you were bathed in a pink glow. Serene laid down on her bed and brought you over to her. \u201cWell, I\u2019m back. Did you miss me?\u201d Unsure of why she would ask that, you just played along and said yes. \u201cAw, well I missed you too.\u201d She kissed you and sat in her room for a little while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how many bathrooms are in this house?\u201d \u201cThree, one for my parents, one for us girls, and one for the guys. But I guess there is one more\u201d She said as she looked at the hole in her wall.  You both sat there for a few more minutes before she spoke up. \u201cHey, why are you nervous again? Did my brothers come in here while I was gone?\u201d \u201cYes they did, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m concerned. I know you can see the future, so why didn\u2019t you see your brothers going after me?\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t like to see the future because there\u2019s no fun in it. It\u2019s kind of like reading a plot summary of a book before you actually read the book. So I try and avoid looking in the future unless absolutely necessary. But I guess that did cause some problems.\u201d You nodded in understanding and cuddled up in between her breasts. \u201cSo what did my brothers want?\u201d \u201cTo talk to you about the little guest.\u201d She grumbled and started petting you. \u201cI won\u2019t let them lay a paw on you.\u201d You just let her run her fingers over your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey kids, it\u2019s time to eat!\u201d Her father yelled up the stairs. Serene sat up and moved you to her head. She was about to get off her bed when you stopped her. \u201cSerene, can I ask a question?\u201d \u201cSure, what is it?\u201d \u201cCan I touch the orb on your forehead please?\u201d \u201cOf course, but why?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of cute and I always wanted to touch it.\u201d \u201cSo\u2026 you don\u2019t think I look weird with it?\u201d \u201cOf course not. Why would you think that?\u201d \u201cWell you lived in the human world and nobody there had things like fur or tails or anything we have. So I thought that you might think we look like freaks.\u201d \u201cOh Serene, that\u2019s what makes you guys so cool. We don\u2019t have unique things like tails and that\u2019s what makes Pokemon like you so cute and cool. Besides, you flicked your tail enough during our conversations to know I liked it.\u201d She turned her head a bit as she looked like she was blushing. She lowered you off her head to give you a kiss and then moved you to her red orb. You slowly touched it and sort of rubbed it. You liked touching it and she set you back on her head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe walked out of her room and stood at the door for a second before walking down the stairs. \u201cSo what makes us so cute?\u201d \u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know. There isn\u2019t any specific thing. It\u2019s everything. No part of you really is better than another.\u201d She giggled as she walked in the kitchen. You looked at the table and saw that everybody was looking at you and Serene, especially Greg, Ashley, Matt, and Andrew. You knew she would have to take a seat by Andrew, but she had Ashley on the other side. You whispered in her ear, \u201cIf you would please, can I stay on your shoulder and you pass food to me so I\u2019m not in your brothers\u2019 sights as easily?\u201d She didn\u2019t respond. All she did was sit down and lower you to her shoulder that Ashley was near. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how did you two sleep?\u201d Kathy asked. You were still trying to get it in your head to call her Kathy and her husband Marcus rather than Mr. and Mrs. Variform. \u201cWe slept great mom. No problems at all.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. Well everybody dig in.\u201d Soon everybody had plates filled with breakfast and slowly the food disappeared. Serene indeed passed you food and you stayed out of Andrew\u2019s sight. Though you sort of wished you would have picked the other shoulder as occasionally you would look up and either Matt or Greg would be looking at you. Then either you would quickly look back down at your plate and ignore those eyes, or Ashley would move her head so they couldn\u2019t see you. When everyone was finished, they set their dishes in the sink, said goodbye to their parents and went off to school. The walk there a little unnerving as one of the brothers would try and keep up with Serene. You climbed up to her head and just laid your face flat down, acting like no one was there. Soon enough you looked up and saw what you assumed was the school. She stopped outside of the school and took you up in her hands. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lily and Sarah kept walking, presumably to a grade school. They had to be eight graders, or really big for whatever age they were. Greg, Matt, Andrew, and Ashley all went in while Serene just looked at you with her gorgeous eyes. \u201cUh\u2026 W-What do you want?\u201d She seemed to snap out of a trance before she spoke. \u201cSorry, you just look so cute. I was going to tell you about how the day is going to play out. Well you were going to have to make a speech, but I knew you wouldn\u2019t be able to do it, so I convinced our principal to let you skip it.\u201d You immediately looked up to her and smiled. The only words that came out of your mouth were \u201cthank you\u201d. She gave a giggle and put you back on her head, and then she spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou\u2019re very welcome. Instead there\u2019s an article in our school paper about you. Anybody with questions is supposed to come and ask me.\u201d  \u201cSo what am I going to do most of the day?\u201d You asked as you were unsure of how your classes were going to play out with your miniature size. \u201cWell, I think you\u2019re supposed to pay attention to the lecture, but you\u2019re either on me or my desk. So no dozing off during class.\u201d You sighed after she said that, but you knew there was no way to get a nap in even if you wanted to. Either she would wake you or someone else would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I kind of would like to hide in your luscious locks until first hour. That way I\u2019m not the immediate center of attention.\u201d \u201cThanks for the compliment, but why would you want to hide in my hair? Don\u2019t you like my chest?\u201d \u201cWell yes, but\u2026 it\u2019s just kind of\u2026 you know, strange.\u201d \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s something nobody else can experience. But I guess that does make a little strange. I\u2019ll let you in my hair for now, but just know I don\u2019t have a problem with you being so close to my heart.\u201d She levitated you up to her head and you soon moved her silky hair around so you could hide in it. As soon as there was enough to hide you and little enough to see through, you went prone and just waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked in and your ears filled with voices, both male and female. There was another question answered: this school was for both genders. Everybody looked at her and a few asked her about you. She didn\u2019t reveal your location, but she explained a little about your personality. They understood and looked depressed when they didn\u2019t get to see you. You felt like a jerk, but your fear kept you pinned in your position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She walked into a room that would appear to be the office. An anthromorphic Gardevoir sat behind the desk and stopped writing to look up at Serene. \u201cAh Serene, how nice to see you. Where is our new student?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s here, but he\u2019s a tad bit shy and decided he wanted to hide.\u201d \u201cAw, but we won\u2019t hurt him.\u201d You couldn\u2019t but laugh at her comment. Serene\u2019s brothers had cast doubt on that theory. \u201cI heard him, but why was he laughing?\u201d \u201cWell, Mrs. Sytes, we had a little incident that kind of scarred him and he has a hard time believing no one will harm him. Roy, you should know better. We talked about this.\u201d \u201cWhat happened? Did he get hurt?\u201d Mrs. Sytes asked with concern. \u201cI\u2019d rather not say, but the only injuries he took were mental.\u201d Serene stopped as seemed to pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon you felt yourself being pulled from her hair and soon you were out in the open. The only person there was Mrs. Sytes and she stood up and walked over to see you. You were slowly lowered into Serene\u2019s hands and looked up at her face with a crossed expression. \u201cSorry, but not everyone is going to hurt you. You\u2019ve got to believe me.\u201d Serene said as Mrs. Sytes looked at you carefully. \u201cI certainly won\u2019t hurt you. You\u2019re as adorable as Serene said.\u201d She went to reach for you and you cringed a bit. She pulled her hand back, then slowly extended it until it was touching you. \u201cThere. Is that so bad?\u201d She then picked you up and examined you carefully. She set you back in Serene\u2019s hands and smiled. \u201cSee Roy, no harm done. As you\u2019ve heard, I\u2019m Mrs. Sytes and I\u2019m the secretary.\u201d You waved and Serene started to speak. \u201cLike I said, he\u2019s timid and not got much to say.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s okay. You should probably go see Mrs. Blaze. She\u2019s been waiting to see you both all morning. We\u2019ll see you two again some time.\u201d \u201cOkay bye Mrs. Sytes.\u201d You said goodbye, but obviously in a voice too quiet for her to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell back in Serene\u2019s hand as you felt so pathetic and weak, like you were actually an infant with high school kids. Serene obviously caught on to it and gave you a dirty look. She shifted you over to one hand and with her other, opened the door to where you assumed Mrs. Blaze was. Indeed, as the door cracked open, a figure looked up from her desk. You got a good look of Mrs. Blaze: she was a tall anthro Typhlosion that had a great figure, but she didn\u2019t look as good as Serene. Her flame collar-thing was a nice touch. Hopefully Serene wouldn\u2019t get offended with you looking at other females. You didn\u2019t look in a bad way. You were just curious how anthro Pokemon look. \u201cAh, Miss Variform, how good it is to see you. And there\u2019s the little guy in your hands.\u201d You tried not to show any reaction physically, but you really didn\u2019t like everyone pointing out your size. \u201cGood morning Mrs. Blaze and yes, here he is. Meet Roy.\u201d She lifted you up closer to Mrs. Blaze. \u201cNice to meet you Roy.\u201d \u201cYou nodded and gave a little wave. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to talk about your world to the entire student body? It sure would help us understand more about you.\u201d You just lowered your head and gave an uncomfortable shake. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry Mrs. Blaze, but he\u2019s timid and has a hard enough time talking to one new person. I don\u2019t think he could handle our entire school.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s quite alright Serene. I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s easy talking to someone so much larger than you, even without being shy. Could excuse me a moment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mrs. Blaze stopped and held her head a little higher. She opened her mouth shot a little flame stream out. Then the image of Greg wanting to incinerate you flashed in your mind and you cowered in fear. Mrs. Blaze immediately stopped and looked down at you. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d \u201cYes I think he\u2019s alright, just a little afraid of your fire.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I do that just to clear my throat.\u201d You were still afraid and cowering. She reached down to stroke you when she stopped. \u201cIs it alright if I stroke him a bit?\u201d Mrs. Blaze asked. \u201cI think so, just be slow and gentle.\u201d Serene said as she breathed slowly. Mrs. Blaze leaned in for a closer look at you as well as to calm you down. She moved her head away when she had taken a good look and moved her hand in closer. You tried not to move away, but it seemed like such a challenge. Finally her gentle fingers slowly glided down your back. They seemed so calm and caring, as if she knew exactly how to pet you. You slowly loosened up and felt soothed by her finger movements. \u201cThere you go. I\u2019m sorry if you were at all frightened. Oh look at the time. Serene, you and Roy should be on your way to class.\u201d\u201cYes Mrs. Blaze. We\u2019ll see you later.\u201d You waved and Mrs. Blaze gave a little wave back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked out of the office and towards her first hour class. \u201cSo Greg scared you with his fire?\u201d You nodded as she set you back on top of her head. The hallways were empty, probably as all the students were in class. \u201cI wish he would just trust you. I don\u2019t intend to be mean, but you\u2019re too small to do any real damage.\u201d You had to agree with her, but you wished she could\u2019ve worded it a little better. She walked until she stopped at a door. You looked around until you saw a sign on the door. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You watched as the door that read \u201cBattle Strategies\u201d and \u201cMr. Shartney\u201d was slowly pushed open. Inside was a class of about twenty students and an anthro Raichu as the teacher. \u201cAh good morning Serene. Please take your seat.\u201d The Raichu said and Serene obeyed. She walked towards the back of the room and took a seat left of the middle row. You sighed knowing that she wouldn\u2019t be in the middle of everyone, leaving you as the center of attention. Serene had an empty desk in front of her, a Sceptile to her left, and an Aggron to her right. \u201cClass, I have been informed that after this lecture, you will have time to meet your new classmate. Anything else you would like to know about him will be in the school paper.\u201d You cowered as every face but three looked at you: Those three being Serene\u2019s face, the Aggron, and Mr. Shartney. Everyone slowly turned back around and you just as slowly relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class went on and you attempted to pay attention, but you really weren\u2019t sure how you would be able to use of any of these strategies, as most of them involved some ability you lacked. You would occasionally look over at the Aggron, wondering why he didn\u2019t stare at you as everyone else had. He would look at you for a little, then quickly flash back to the lesson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a lot of talk about how to attack efficiently, Mr. Shartney sat behind his desk. \u201cWell class, that concludes today\u2019s lesson. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all curious about Roy, but I think you need to be calm and patient. Remember he\u2019s smaller than you and not capable of defending himself as you might be. Let\u2019s get some kind of line to meet him so there\u2019s not a swarm around him. Alana, you\u2019ll start and we\u2019ll snake through the class.\u201d Alana, a female Absol, stood up and walked back. You grunted, knowing that meeting Serene\u2019s family was a challenge, but this would be worse. Serene lifted you off her head and set you on the desk. Alana walked back and bent over to get a better look at you. \u201cHi Roy. I\u2019m Alana.\u201d You nodded and gave a little wave. She looked at Serene with a dirty grin and walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, everybody greeted you and added something with it. The girls would mention something about your appearance and the guys would attempt a handshake. Finally it came down to the Sceptile, Serene, and the Aggron. The Sceptile reached over and stuck out his hand. \u201cName\u2019s Clay. Nice to meet ya.\u201d You shook his finger as a handshake and you couldn\u2019t help but feel like he had a cowboy vibe to him. Serene was next, but all she did was wink. You smiled at her and turned to the Aggron. He spun around in his chair and looked at you. \u201cI\u2019m Mathias. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d You shook his hand, but something about him seemed\u2026 familiar. He turned back swiftly and looked at the teacher. \u201cOkay class, now that we all have met him, wait for the bell.\u201d Mr. Shartney would occasionally yell at someone to sit down, as they were trying to sneak back and talk to you or Serene. You climbed onto her open hand and laid down on it. Talking to so many people had exhausted you for some reason. Maybe the pressure of talking to people had gotten to you. \u201cThe bell\u2019s about to ring. Remember to check the paper for stuff about Roy.\u201d The bell rang and as Serene was about to walk past, Mr. Shartney stopped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSerene, could you please give me a second to meet Roy myself?\u201d She nodded and past you from her hand into Mr. Shartney\u2019s. \u201cNice to meet you Roy. I\u2019m Mr. Shartney and I\u2019m the Battle Strategy teacher. I know this class seems a bit hard for you to learn anything from, but try and pay attention. If you need anything, you should let one of the staff members know.\u201d You nodded and waited for what else he had to say. \u201cSerene has told us about your social issues. It\u2019s not going to be easy avoiding conversations, but try your best and not let your problem constrict you. Thank you Serene for your time and good luck with your classes.\u201d \u201cThank you Mr. Shartney.\u201d Serene said as she accepted you back into her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was the first class, cutie?\u201d \u201cUm okay, but hard to stay focused. Can I ask a few questions?\u201d You asked. \u201cWell of course.\u201d Serene said as you assumed she flashed a smile. \u201cWhy did that Absol Alana give you that weird smile?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s my best friend and when I told her that you were going to be staying with me, she got a little jealous.\u201d \u201cOh. Why did Mathias seem familiar?\u201d You asked and Serene gave a little laugh. \u201cWell I wondered what you would think of him when you met him. It\u2019s kind of ironic because he\u2019s just like you; Quiet and nice. The only real difference is that you\u2019re with me and he\u2019s not.\u201d She gave you a little kiss and you turned away with embarrassment. \u201cO-Okay last few. What\u2019s the next class?\u201d \u201cAnother one where you will be bored: Combat class.\u201d Your jaw dropped and you were hoping that you wouldn\u2019t have to battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLast one and I hope you don\u2019t get mad if I ask. You\u2019re the most beautiful girl I\u2019ve seen here and I know I shouldn\u2019t, but are you mad that I look at other girls? I don\u2019t mean to in a bad way, just out of curiosity.\u201d She stopped walking and looked at you with a serious tone. \u201cI don\u2019t like you looking, but I know that you aren\u2019t checking them out. You\u2019re just looking at how we all appear with our different features. Besides, it\u2019s not looking that will get me mad at you, but the emotions you feel. Just hope my brothers don\u2019t notice.\u201d She was about to kiss you, but you quickly kissed her lip before she got you. \u201cThanks gorgeous\u201d You said with a smile. She finished her kiss and grinned. She then walked down the hall towards the next class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked through some double doors into what seemed to be a stadium. Over near the far wall stood all the students, with what appeared to be a Lucario and a Ditto. \u201cWell the Lucario is the teacher, Mrs. Taoshen, and the Ditto is the assistant, Mr. Kainen.\u201d You nodded as she ran over to where everyone was, leaving you hanging on to her hair. She stopped and whispered \u201cSorry\u201d. You took some deep breathes and waited for the introduction. \u201cOkay class, nice to see you all. Roy, although you are a student, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re capable of fighting here and will be sitting out.\u201d You sighed in relief, knowing that you could sit back and watch the fights. \u201cOkay, without further ado, let\u2019s get started.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody cheered, but they were interrupted by Mr. Kainen. \u201cI think I know a way for Roy to fight without his opponent having too many major advantages.\u201d Everybody gave an eager look except you. Mr. Kainen started to change forms and when he finished, he looked all too familiar. Everybody got closer when they saw he had transformed into a larger version of you. Every girl, even Mrs. Taoshen, mentioned how good you really looked. \u201cAlthough it makes a great show, it still would be a bit too unfair of a fight.\u201d Mr. Kainen laughed and returned to his normal self. You were still trying to get your jaw off the ground. \u201cHey, I still think you look a lot better, even if had a perfect transformation.\u201d You appreciated the compliment, but you only hoped that Serene kept a watchful eye on you. Those girls sure eyed your mirror image and there was no telling what they would do if they could get you alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You watched everybody fight, from Clay fighting a female Bayleef ironically named Bailey to the Plusle and Minun twins Jake and Blake dueling each other. The final fight was announced to be Serene Versus Mrs. Taoshen. Before she left you looked up to her and said \u201cTry not to get hurt. I don\u2019t want to see you get hurt and I can\u2019t do a thing about it\u201d \u201cAww. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t. I\u2019ll leave you with Alana while I\u2019m gone. She\u2019s nice, so don\u2019t be afraid of her.\u201d You nodded and watched Serene walk towards the field.  Alana picked you up off the ground where Serene had left you and carry you over to a side of the stadium. She sat down and held you in one hand and gently stroked you with the other. \u201cHi Roy.\u201d \u201cH-Hi Alana.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be scared. I won\u2019t hurt you. I\u2019m Serene\u2019s best friend, plus you\u2019re too cute to want to hurt.\u201d You turned your head away, blushing and laughing to yourself. \u2018Too cute? Too bad Serene\u2019s brothers didn\u2019t go with that\u2019 you thought as Serene had started fighting. The battle was intense and no one seemed to have an upper hand. \u201cSo how are things between you two, because if they aren\u2019t good, I wouldn\u2019t mind going with someone like you.\u201d Alana said as she smiled down at you. \u201cThings are okay, I guess.\u201d \u201cDarn, but at least she found someone like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cH-How many people has Serene gone out with or at least had asked her out?\u201d \u201cWell she\u2019s never dated anyone, but had a lot of guys ask her out.\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she go out with them? She couldn\u2019t have been waiting for me the whole time.\u201d \u201cWhen you started talking she did, but before that no. The reason is because the guys who asked her out usually were just in it for the sex. I unfortunately dated some of them. I just wish I could have someone like you.\u201d You sat there in silence until a thought crossed your mind. \u201cWhat about Mathias?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d You cringed a little as she dropped her head towards you rather than the battle. \u201cSorry, didn\u2019t mean to startle you. Now what about Mathias?\u201d \u201cW-Why don\u2019t you go out with him? Serene said he\u2019s just like me, except that he\u2019s more similar to you than I am.\u201d \u201cYou think he would go out with someone like me?\u201d \u201cI-I don\u2019t see why not. You seem a lot like Serene and when she finally mentioned us going out, it felt great knowing she would go out with someone like me. Maybe he wants to go out with you, but is just afraid of hearing no. Ask him, but be nice. If he is like me, he will be happy to go out with someone like you.\u201d \u201cHe is cute and does act like you. Maybe I should. For someone so timid and afraid, you sure do have some good advice.\u201d  Finally, Serene won. She helped Mrs. Taoshen up and walked back to Alana.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alana handed you back to Serene with grateful, yet envious eyes. \u201cThanks Serene. It was nice to be able to hold him for at least a little while.\u201d Alana said with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome and who knows, maybe if they send another human through, it could end up with you.\u201d Serene smiled at Alana, then returned her attention back to you. \u201cI missed having you by me and look, not too many scratches like I told you.\u201d You smiled up to her and she brought you up to her face. You gave a hug to the best of your abilities and she rubbed you gently with her face. Her fur felt so soft, a softness that almost sent you into a peaceful sleep. Soon though, she broke away, set you on her head and turned to look at Mrs. Taoshen and Mr. Kainen. \u201cExcellent job today class. Although there are some things that need to be worked on, you all still are doing well. Continue all your hard work and reach your pinnacle. Until next time, farewell.\u201d Mrs. Taoshen and Mr. Kainen both gave a slight bow, as did the entire class. When Serene gave her bow, you fell off but stopped in mid-air when she caught you with her psychic abilities. You landed back atop her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A bell sounded and everyone walked out of the class, but once again, Serene was stopped by the teachers. She walked over once again for a more personal introduction. \u201cHello Roy, as you\u2019ve probably heard, I\u2019m Mrs. Taoshen and this is Mr. Kainen.\u201d You waved up to them and smiled. \u201cAs I\u2019m sure Mr. Shartney told you, although it\u2019s almost useless to you, you should still pay attention. We\u2019ll try to find a way to get you involved so you\u2019re doing something, even if it\u2019s not directly what the rest of the students are doing.\u201d You dropped your head somewhat and Mrs. Taoshen laughed, presumably at you wanting to do nothing. \u201cRoy, I hope you weren\u2019t offended in any way by my taking your form. I heard you were a little timid and thought you may relax a bit.\u201d You shook your head in \u201cno\u201d gesture and looked back at him. \u201cGood, well Mrs. Taoshen, I think they should be off to their next class, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cHow right you are. Serene, Roy, good luck with the rest of your classes and we will see you both later.\u201d You waved as Serene walked away and out in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHave fun with Alana?\u201d \u201cMeh, I talked but I don\u2019t think she likes me being afraid of her.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of her? But she\u2019s my best friend.\u201d \u201cYeah and your brothers care about you greatly, yet they still wanted to hurt me.\u201d You turned away, feeling the pain of her brothers once again assault you. The pain always seemed to come back at the worst times. Worse yet, something inside started to point to her as being part of your problem. She soon levitated you down from her head and forced you to look at her. She was about to speak, but instead put you between her breasts. She hugged you and you hugged her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The pain you felt about feeling she was a source of your pain was just as intense the pain you mentally felt inflicted by her brothers. You tried to repress the emotion and let the love you felt for her be the emotion she sensed rather than the pain, even though she had probably already sensed it. \u201cRoy, I know it hurts and you partially feel a bit angry at me. But you don\u2019t blame your all pain on me, do you?\u201d \u201cNo. Something tells me to blame you for leaving me there, but I don\u2019t want to. I know it\u2019s not your fault. I just wish\u2026 I just wish they would\u2019ve at least let me have a chance rather than eliminate before they knew anything.\u201d You plunged your head deeper into her chest, feeling it helped a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLet\u2019s just get to class and just in case, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Serene pulled you from her chest and cuddled you next to her face. \u201cSo am I.\u201d You said as you hugged her face as tight as you could manage. She set you down in her chest and you looked up at her with confused and concerned eyes. \u201cI know it seems a bit strange and uncomfortable, but I want you to be close to my heart and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s warm and comfortable. Plus you\u2019re out of sight for the most part, except to the perverted guys.\u201d You did like being between her breasts and it was a safe and comfortable place, but even touching a woman\u2019s chest was a bit strange, yet Serene liked having you there. Was she personally enjoying having you there or did she really like having you close to her heart. She did seem like she wanted your entire being, not just your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you snapped out of your trance and looked to see the third class of the day. She walked into a classroom full of students with a female Dragonair as the teacher. The teacher\u2019s eyes seem to say \u201crelax\u201d and you did. \u201cGood morning you two. Please take your seat Serene.\u201d Whoever she was, she sure had a gentle nature. You noticed Alana and Mathias were in this class. You kept looking, seeing no more familiar faces except\u2026 except a familiar face that belonged to an Umbreon. \u201cSerene, get me out of here before Andrew sees me!\u201d You yelled up to her so she could hear, but nobody else. She whispered down to you so only you could hear. \u201cRelax, he can\u2019t hurt you and when we get home, I won\u2019t let him or my other brothers get near you. Besides, he should know that I have more control of where on my body you are.\u201d You settled in a bit more, but with a stressed mind. \u2018Yeah, but every plan has its flaws.\u2019 She took a seat in the first column on the right and the middle row. Unfortunately, all the kids you thought were trustworthy were on the other side of the room and Andrew was a seat back and to the left of Serene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plucked you from her breasts and set you on the desk. \u201cSo what class are we in and who is she?\u201d \u201cWell this is our math class and she is Ms. Passel. She\u2019s really good at math. I just wish I was as good as she is.\u201d You notice she lowers her head a bit and you walk as close to her as you can and gently stroke an area of it. \u201cWell I\u2019m good at math and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to help you. I think it could help me make it up to you for being so adorable and kind.\u201d She instantly raises her eyes to look at you and she blushes a bit. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018making it up to me\u2019?\u201d \u201cWell you\u2019ve done so much for me and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair if you do stuff for me and I give you nothing in return.\u201d \u201cBut\u2026 you give me love and respect and that\u2019s enough for me.\u201d \u201cBut you give me the same things, yet you\u2019re still giving more. If we\u2019re giving the exact same things and you\u2019re giving others that I can\u2019t, I feel like I\u2019ve got to make it up to you somehow, even if I am smaller.\u201d She blushes even more and gives you kiss. \u201cI don\u2019t need anything except that loving personality and kind attitude of yours, cutie.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile up to her and turn around, ready to see what this math class had to it. \u201cWell let\u2019s resume that trigonometry we\u2019ve been working on. For those of you that haven\u2019t yet met Roy, we will have some time after class.\u201d Most of the kids gave some gesture as to joy, except those who had already seen you and someone a few seats behind Serene. You tried to see who or what it was, but from the desk, there was no way to see who it was. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about him. That\u2019s Jared and since you can\u2019t see, he\u2019s a Shiftry. But you\u2019ll have time to meet HIM later.\u201d Serene seemed irritated for some reason and a growl came from behind her. \u2018Is that the Jared that her brothers were talking about? The one that asked her out and she denied?\u2019 You finished your thought and looked over at Andrew. For some odd reason, he was looking at you at the same time and nodded. You shuddered with fear. Could he tell what you were thinking, or was this another part of the fear tactic? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Passel started the lecture no too much later. You smiled when you realized when you had a useful class. You watched Ms. Passel write an equation on the board, then turn around and help Serene understand what was going on. You never felt like you were all that good of a teacher, but with the faces she made, you were better than you thought. You would notice Andrew looking over at you and you would do your best to not let his glare get to you, but it was a bit overpowering and you would stutter out of fear. Serene would take notice of your fear and look over to her brother, who would look away at just the right time, though Serene seemed to hold the suspicions in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like a little bit, the lecture ended and the class swarmed you and gave a greeting, except for the ones who already met you and Jared. Ms. Passel watched all the students to be sure none of them brought you any kind of harm, but she looked shocked when the Shiftry remained in his seat. \u201cJared, don\u2019t you wish to meet the new student?\u201d Jared looked up with hatred showing in his face. \u201cMe, talk to that little piece of trash? Not going to happen.\u201d \u201cWhy? Are you jealous that he\u2019s actually going out with me?\u201d Serene said with that mellow voice of hers, yet something about her seemed different. Jared almost flew out of his seat when Serene said this. \u201cWHAT?! No, but I do find it bull shit that he\u2019s able to touch your boobs without any grit and you won\u2019t even let me touch your hand!\u201d \u201cWell he cares about being close to my heart, unlike you, just wanting to get close to my\u2026\u201d \u201cAlright class, let\u2019s settle down.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, like back in the human world, none of the students even cared what the teacher said. You were still on the desk when Serene stood up and looked directly at Jared. Everyone moved away from Serene. Although you couldn\u2019t tell what others felt, you had to be a complete moron not to feel the hostility in the air. Jared seemed to ready an attack, and Andrew stood up and stepped in front of Serene. \u201cAlright Jared, relax.\u201d Jared didn\u2019t seem as though he wanted to and he held his attack position. Now you were a possible target and had no shield of your own. You looked for a way out, but it was too far to fall and there was no safe place to jump to.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You watched as Jared\u2019s hatred only seemed to rise. Serene looked at him with eyes that never shifted. Whether she knew Jared wouldn\u2019t hurt you or she was just playing the odds again, you were abandoned on the desk. Whatever the case, you trusted her to know what she was doing. She may have a nearly costly error once, but she had said herself she would not allow the same incident twice. You shifted your eyes to Andrew, whom seemed only to stand in front of Serene without a concern of his own safety. Andrew seemed to care the most for Serene, as it seemed that he was the \u201cnicest\u201d one of Serene\u2019s brothers at the table last night. \u201cAndrew, what are you doing?\u201d Questioned Serene. \u201cProtecting you.\u201d Responded Andrew. \u201cHe won\u2019t do anything to me, not if he even wants a chance to be with me.\u201d \u201cThat may be true, but nothing is guaranteed and I really ain\u2019t feeling too lucky.\u201d \u2018Yeah, neither am I\u2019 you thought as you dropped into a stance, prepared for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow come on Jared, let\u2019s just relax a bit.\u201d Andrew spoke in a tone that would normally invoke peace, but Jared seemed far too infuriated to even listen. \u201cSCREW YOU, YOUR SISTER, AND THAT LITTLE PIECE OF SCUM SHE\u2019S WITH!\u201d You started to lose your confidence with every second that passed. The tension only seemed to increase and Jared seemed only more volatile. Yet, even with the loss of confidence and Jared\u2019s escalating hatred, your hope in Serene remained solid. You watched as Jared seemed to rapidly cock his arm back for a punch. Just before he launched it, Mathias stepped between the desk where you stood and Jared. \u201cWhat do you think your doing?!\u201d \u201cTrying to solve this problem without much trouble.\u201d Mathias said, obviously trying to keep the peace. \u201cFreaking pacifist\u2026\u201d Jared let his fist go, presumably attempting to smash Mathias\u2019s face in. Yet, although you couldn\u2019t completely see what had happened, you could tell Mathias had caught Jared\u2019s punch and you noticed Mathias pull his free hand back. He let it go and you could hear the impact of Mathias\u2019s fist with Jared\u2019s face. Seconds later, Jared hit the ground with a loud thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room gasped, except Mathias and the now unconscious Jared. \u201cMa-Mathias, go to the office.\u201d Said Ms. Passel with fear across her face. Mathias sighed, but obeyed. Just before he passed you completely, he looked down at you and you thanked him, feeling as though he had somehow had done it for you and Serene. He found some way to grin and nod. After he had left the room, an anthro Chansey rushed in, picked Jared up off the floor and hauled him away. Before you knew it, you were being levitated to Serene\u2019s head, whom had now returned to her seat. \u201cYou alright there cutie?\u201d She asked in her tranquil voice. \u201cY-Yeah.\u201d You also noticed Andrew had returned to his seat as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class shifted to an awkward peace and just before the bell had rung, you were called up to Ms. Passel\u2019s desk and Mathias had walked through the doors. He returned to his seat, not exactly smiling, but nowhere near pained. Ms. Passel made your acquaintance and you hers. You occasionally would look back to see Andrew attempting to talk to Mathias and when he had finished and made it back to his desk, Alana had casually walked over to his desk. She started talking to him and when she had stopped, Mathias gave her a stunned look. Apparently Alana decided to ask Mathias as soon as she could. After a long pause, he said something and Alana\u2019s face lit up and she wrapped her arms around him. You grinned to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang not too long afterwards and Serene walked out with Alana almost rushing to catch up. Some people blocked her path and she soon vanished from sight. \u201cSo where are we going next?\u201d \u201cWe have lunch, then homeroom, science, and cooking.\u201d \u201cWait cooking, as in like with a stove and stuff?\u201d \u201cYeah. Why, is that a problem?\u201d \u201cWell, I can\u2019t cook with such big utensils and I\u2019ll be small enough to eat.\u201d \u201cNobody\u2019s going to eat you. Not even my brothers would be that cruel to you.\u201d \u201cSo can you please explain to me what the deal with Jared is?\u201d She didn\u2019t respond right away, but you could feel something out of place. \u201cLater.\u201d She responded briskly. You remained silent and still as she grabbed a tray of food. She took a seat at a table with Alana, Mathias, a female Ninetales, a female Lanturn, a Latias, and a female Milotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHey guys. I\u2019m here with Roy.\u201d Serene sat in between the Lanturn and Alana. \u201cSo Mathias, what made you decide to sit with us today?\u201d He looked as though he were about to say something, but was cut off by the joyous Alana. \u201cWell he decided to sit here because of me and that\u2019s because I had a little help from Roy!\u201d You felt Serene\u2019s face shift to what could be assumed surprise. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d You were about to tell her, but Alana cut you off. \u201cWell while you were fighting Mrs. Taoshen, I mentioned how I wanted to be with someone like Roy and he said maybe I should ask Mathias. So I did and now we\u2019re going out!\u201d All the girls looked excited and you lowered yourself closer to Serene\u2019s head. \u201cDid you really?\u201d \u201cYes. Where does Mathias usually sit?\u201d You whispered into her ear. \u201cOver there.\u201d You looked to where she pointed and all you saw was an empty table. You couldn\u2019t help but grin after realizing how similar you and Mathias really were. \u201cWhat are you smiling about?\u201d Serene asked, obviously sensing your joy. You didn\u2019t respond, but you did slowly raise yourself from her head. \u201cYou did the exact same thing in your world, didn\u2019t you?\u201d You responded with a \u201cyes\u201d and climbed down to her shoulder. You looked over to see Mathias lower his head and chuckle. The girls looked at the two of you and shook their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had climbed down Serene\u2019s arm and stood on the table when you were suddenly pulled upward with a pink aura all around you. \u201cI think you should meet everyone before we get too far into lunch.\u201d You had to agree, although eating seemed better than attempting to socialize. You had already met Alana and Mathias, so she sent you the opposite direction. You first stop was to the Lanturn. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Cecilia.\u201d You said hello back. You were shifted over to the Ninetales next, who seemed intrigued by you. \u201cHello there. My name is Vienna.\u201d You gave a greeting and once again were moved, this time to the Milotic. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. My name is Anastasia, but everyone calls me Stacey.\u201d You nodded, said hi, and then you were levitated over to the only person you hadn\u2019t met yet, the Latias. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Rose.\u201d You said hello and while you were floating back toward Serene, you asked a question loud enough so she could hear. \u201cD-Do you have a brother?\u201d \u201cYeah, his name is Antonio, and he\u2019s over there.\u201d  She replied. You looked to where she pointed and you saw a large figure standing there that resembled a Latios. Your jaw dropped when you saw the large muscles on his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene carefully set you down on her shoulder and everyone immediately started eating the food in front of them. Occasionally, someone would stop and ask you a question about yourself, to which you would tell Serene your response and she would tell the inquiring person. After everyone had finished their lunch, all the girls shot you a cutesy look, to which you gave a shocked and confused look back. All the girls then giggled and, along with Mathias, walked away, except Serene and Alana. Most the girls looked good, but just in case Serene was testing you by saying she didn\u2019t care, you avoided thinking anything like that. You climbed down from Serene\u2019s shoulder to stand on the table and stretch. Alana tugged at Serene and after Alana giving a \u2018let\u2019s walk over there\u2019 gesture, the two of them walked away. Although they moved far away enough you couldn\u2019t hear a thing they said, they were only a few of their-size steps away. Even though you could still see them, they seemed so far away and you felt so alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventually they came back and sat down. You expected Serene to say something, but rather than hearing Serene\u2019s voice, you felt Alana\u2019s hands envelop you. All you saw was her large face glaring down at you, which caused you to feel a little intimidated. She said \u201cthank you\u201d and gave you a kiss. She carefully set you back down on the table and ran to catch up with Mathias. You watched her run away and you wanted to say something, but you couldn\u2019t complete a single word. Serene only laughed, picked you up to her face and gave you a kiss. Now you had received two kisses from two different girls in less than two minutes, and that left you frozen in a state of confusion. Serene laughed when she pulled you away and you looked at her with even more confusion. She held a mirror so you could see yourself, and all you saw was how red your face had gotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene put you back atop her head and started to walk down the hall. \u201cAre you okay up there Mr. Popular?\u201d You were still paralyzed with confusion and you couldn\u2019t even respond. She only giggled and kept walking. \u201cI still love you more than anyone else can.\u201d \u201cA-A-As do I, gorgeous.\u201d \u201cSo how did you know Rose had a brother?\" \u201cI knew because of a movie from back in my world.\u201d \u201cReally? How did it go?\u201d You wanted to tell her, but you really didn\u2019t feel like explaining the whole thing and ending on the loss of Latios. \u201cUh\u2026 I\u2019d really rather not say.\u201d She seemed determined to get an answer, but she respected your answer and backed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo can I ask you some stuff when we get home?\u201d \u201cSure, but why not here?\u201d Questioned Serene. \u201cBecause I\u2019d rather be with just the one I deeply love and trust.\u201d She stopped to give you a kiss and had a wide smile on her face when she set you back on her head. \u201cI love you more.\u201d \u201cOnly because you\u2019re bigger and have more room for love.\u201d You said with a grin. She giggled and headed toward her next class or whatever homeroom could be considered.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Serene kept walking through the crowded hallways and eventually stops at a classroom that seemed relatively small compared to the others. When she walked in, you noticed how there were only a few seats in the room. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does this room seem smaller than the others?\u201d You whispered into Serene\u2019s ears as she filled an empty seat. \u201cThis classroom is used for advanced science, and not many people take it. Right now we have homeroom and later we\u2019ll be back for science. A little tip: The teacher in here is Mr. Necroen and he\u2019s against humans, but not to the point of pure hatred.\u201d You nodded while putting that little fact in the back of your head. Serene sets you down on the desk, walks over to a table to grab a newspaper and heads back to her seat. She levitates you in the air, long enough so she can lay the newspaper on the desk. When she has the paper and you on the desk, she leans in to read some of the front page articles. Serene seemed more focused on an article towards the bottom of the page, so you walked further up the page to read little tidbits, like the name of the paper and such. \u2018Inside the Ball\u2019 reads the title and your palm instantly covers your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the students walk in just as the bell rings. A large Honchkrow, presumably Mr. Necroen, walks in and quickly looks over the class then he too gets lost in the paper. You look back down to the paper and notice the names of the authors: Antonio and Rose. It took a minute for things to click that the Latias and Latios you saw were the authors. You heard a giggle behind you and look up at Serene. You chuckle, shake your head, and then look around the rest of the room. You see a bunch of new faces, except for Clay. You look at the article Serene is reading and notice your picture. Your eyes get bigger with surprise and you walk over to read the article.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when you noticed that the article is titled \u2018Debate: Welcome Roy\u2019. You look up to Serene with questioning eyes. She at first seems lost in the ink, but then her eyes look down to you. \u201cYou\u2019re wondering about this article, aren\u2019t you? Well in every paper, there is a section that involves a debate of some sort and since today is your first day here, they figured how we see you would make an excellent article.\u201d You look at a chart that shows your overall percentage of likes to hates to uncertainty. Most votes were in the liked column, the second most in the unsure column, and very few were in the hated column. Then you look over at the article itself and notice lots of sections, one of them being other\u2019s comments. You were curious to see what Antonio and Rose wrote about you and what the article said about your personal life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you had started reading however, you felt Serene gently nudge you. You look up to see Mrs. Sytes standing in the doorway. Serene was halfway standing when Mrs. Sytes gestures for her to sit back down. Serene gives a puzzled look and Mrs. Sytes lowers herself to a suitable talking level with Serene. \u201cHow are you two doing so far?\u201d You look at Serene and she looks back down to you before responding \u201cWe\u2019re okay.\u201d Mrs. Sytes smiles a little more, but then looks Serene dead in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMrs. Flame wants to have a word with you both, but\u2026 right now she needs to speak just with Roy.\u201d You feel deeply fear stricken, but Serene\u2019s face is one more of concern and curiosity. \u201cBut why just Roy? Why not me too?\u201d Mrs. Sytes looked away briefly, then looked back to you and Serene. \u201cLet\u2019s talk in the hallway for a bit, so we don\u2019t disrupt the class.\u201d Serene picks you up and follows Mrs. Sytes out into the hallway. Thoughts about what was happening swirled in your mind and left you feeling paralyzed in confusion. Going to the office without Serene was going to be terrible, no matter why you were there. Mrs. Sytes and Serene both stopped in the middle of the hallway and both you and Serene stared uneasily at Mrs. Sytes, awaiting an answer to your burning question. Mrs. Sytes stayed silent as she seemed to ponder amongst the field of her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she takes a deep breath and turned to face the both of you. \u201cPlease hear what I must say before you jump to any conclusions. We understand that you and Roy are a little bit better than just friends, but you two can not be together in homeroom.\u201d Serene looked almost crushed, as if her most precious childhood possession had just been taken with no chance of getting it back. You too stood there stunned, eyes shifting from Mrs. Sytes to Serene, then back to Mrs. Sytes and finally the hands on which you stood. You didn\u2019t know why, but it hurt so much knowing you two would be apart from each other. Serene was about to say something, but Mrs. Sytes spoke first. \u201cOn the request of a teacher, you two should not spend homeroom together and unfortunately, we have no choice but to go along with it.\u201d This is when the power behind her words struck the hardest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You felt a moment of weakness and fell to your knees, with your hands stopping you from falling flat on your face. The pain just stung, but no matter what you wanted to say or do, four words stopped you from doing anything: All because of you. You weren\u2019t guaranteed but you guessed because you\u2019re human, you two would end the day apart from each other. Soon teardrops that felt as heavy as your heart splashed off your backside. Again the words circulated through your mind, knowing because of your being, Serene was now letting tears fall like a spring rain. The pain had taken you both down so quickly and Mrs. Sytes seemed to want to give you your space and only when you both had calmed down a bit did she speak. \u201cAlthough you two may not spend homeroom, you must be back together by the time of the following class. So for right now, I\u2019ll take Roy with me to the office so he may speak with Mrs. Flame. Return to class and in the future think of someone you trust who will be in your next hour class and allow them to watch over Roy from the beginning of homeroom to the beginning of the next class. Then he avoids causing problems in homeroom, but he can be back with you afterwards.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough neither of you truly liked the idea, you knew it was the only way. Through the tears, Serene nodded, gave you one last, embracing hug before she handed you over to Mrs. Sytes. She quickly walked back to the classroom and after watching your stricken love walk into the classroom, you quickly spun around and closed your eyes. You felt Mrs. Sytes walk back towards the office with you carefully held in her hands. \u201cWe honestly did the best we could to keep you two together the entire day, but no matter what we tried, homeroom was always the bump in the road.\u201d You said nothing, for you felt it was best to keep your emotions sealed inside and say nothing rather than let your emotions out and say the wrong thing. Besides you never really were the one to let your anger get the better of you, or speak what was on your mind. You merely lay deep in your own thoughts as Mrs. Sytes walked into the office and in through Mrs. Flame\u2019s door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mrs. Flame immediately looked up to Mrs. Sytes face and then down to yours. \u201cThank you Sarah. How did they take the news?\u201d Mrs. Sytes just shook her head, conveying the negative emotion shared by you and Serene. Mrs. Flame\u2019s head fell slightly at the response and when Mrs. Sytes set you down on the desk, she immediately left and the room\u2019s atmosphere had not lightened any. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Mrs. Sytes already told you, but we did the best to keep you two together.\u201d Your head was still was facing your feet, but you slowly nodded your head in comprehension. She slowed her breath and after a brief pause, spoke in a quiet tone. \u201cI\u2019m going to try and make this as much of a one-way conversation as possible, to help keep you out of the spotlight. I only ask that you come a bit closer.\u201d You obeyed and slowly walked closer towards the massive figure that sat before you. \u201cI\u2019m afraid things from here on out will be a little more complex, but hopefully not too much. As you have heard, you\u2019re no longer to be in the same homeroom as Serene, but you can be together after that. However there was one little detail we wanted to wait until you were here to inform you of, and that detail is this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the tip of her finger rests a grey cloth, one that was roughly about your height. She motions you closer to take the cloth and you comply. When you take it off her finger and move it around, you recognize the forms of sleeves and shortly after that, the form of a hood. You recognize it as a cloak, but hold it out with a perplexed expression. \u201cIt\u2019s for your class with Mr. Necroen. He wanted to have you permanently banned from his class, but we talked him into letting you be there as long as you were enveloped in a cloak. We wish there was another way things could work out, but he\u2019s the only teacher who can teach advanced science and we can\u2019t change his beliefs.\u201d Although you didn\u2019t like the idea of being this grey figure on Serene because of one teacher, at least this was a way to avoid a little grit. You threw on the cloak and noticed its comfort and how it didn\u2019t make you feel at all warm. The cloak offered excellent shade as well as a few internal pockets and a front that could be divided and cast over your shoulders, plus it was that shade of grey you liked. \u201cWe know it will be strange to wear this all day, but we made it as pleasant as we could.\u201d You smiled as best as you could manage and gave a bow as a sign of gratitude. She smiled and replied \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rings and suddenly, you\u2019re lifted into the air and set on Mrs. Flames shoulder. Feeling a bit unsteady and uneasy, you kneel on her shoulder. Her shoulder was a bit higher than Serene\u2019s, but you quickly adjusted.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Author\u2019s note:  I made a major mistake with a name. In the last chapter, I meant Mrs. Blaze, not Mrs. Flame. Forgive me.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held on to Mrs. Blaze as she slowly departed from the office and through the hallways. No one was out in the hallways, even when just a few brief minutes ago the bell had rung. Mrs.Blaze said nothing the whole way back to Mr. Necroen\u2019s classroom, but she did seem to walk with a certain determination, as if she was going to save a life. Before she opened the door to Mr. Necroen\u2019s room, she whispered to you \u201cDon\u2019t forget the cloak\u201d. You immediately pull the cloak across your body and the hood over your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mrs. Blaze walks in and greets Mr. Necroen. He replies with a recessed tone and Mrs. Blaze walks to where Serene sits. You look at her from within the hood to see her eyes are dried but not without a mark of past tears. You exhaled as Mrs. Blaze squatted beside Serene\u2019s desk. \u201cHere\u2019s your fellow classmate back. After school today, I\u2019d like to see the both of you, ok?\u201d You move from Mrs. Blaze\u2019s shoulder to Serene\u2019s desk. You and Serene both simultaneously nod. Mrs. Blaze offers a smile and quietly whispers \u201cEverything will be fine\u201d. You make no facial expression as it really doesn\u2019t matter, but Serene half-heartedly smiles at you. Mrs. Blaze turns away, apologizes to Mr. Necroen then walks out of the room. Serene looks down at you, but you look away. She reaches to pull away your cloak hood, but you put your hand up to stop her finger. She gasps, and pulls her hand away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class goes by quickly. The class was basically chemistry, but you didn\u2019t pay much attention. In your mind it really didn\u2019t matter whether you gave every second of your life to this class or not a single breath, the teacher didn\u2019t care about you either way. You could be killed and all he would feel is joy. After the bell rang, Serene swept you up and stormed off to her next class. You wanted to say something, but in her current state, it was impossible to determine what was the right or wrong thing to say. You merely watched as she was almost running away from Mr. Necroen\u2019s classroom. She ended up in a large room, one half with desks and the other half with miniature kitchens. Serene sets you down on the desk and walks away. You look at her as she sits in kitchen area, with her eyes once again revealing her hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now completely paralyzed. She was letting her emotions fly out, but she didn\u2019t want you anywhere near her. This was a tip, a tip that you had done something wrong. What it was though, you had no clue. You lied down and turned to face the other way. Shortly afterward, however, you were poked in your back. You turn around to see Ashley looking down at you with a concerned face. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d You sighed and replied \u201cI think I did something wrong. I just have no clue what it is.\u201d Seeming to understand your position, Ashley nods and walks back to Serene. After a brief conversation, Ashley is soon standing over you once again. This time, she picks you up and carries you back to Serene. Serene says nothing, and Ashley takes a seat next to her. Everyone else comes piling in the room almost instantaneously. You don\u2019t pay any attention to who each person is because the only person who matters is the one crying across from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a tone no one else can hear, Ashley tries to settle the issue between the two of you. \u201cSo by my understanding, Roy knows he did something wrong, but he has no idea what. Serene, you feel like Roy doesn\u2019t truly like you.\u201d  Serene nods and your jaw drops. You instantly reach up to your hood and pull it down. \u201cW-Why would you think that?\u201d Serene just turns away, and Ashley puts you close to her mouth so she can whisper in your ear. \u201cShe said last class when you looked away from her and pushed her away, she felt like that was a good enough sign.\u201d Your jaw lowers even more and now you feel terrible. You motion for Ashley to move you closer to her ear. She complies and you whisper what you hoped could clear this whole issue up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLet me explain things from my perspective. In homeroom, I was called down to the office and told I can no longer spend homeroom with Serene. Then they gave me this cloak and explained why I need to wear it. They said on Mr. Necroen\u2019s demands I either wear the cloak so he doesn\u2019t have to look at me or I get forced out of the class. When I was dropped back with Serene, I felt terrible knowing I was the cause of this whole issue. I dared not to look at those crystal eyes which I cracked, nor could I let her touch the beast that tore apart her heart. I also thought she was going to pull the cloak away and I didn\u2019t want her to get yelled at by Mr. Necroen.\u201d Ashley pulled you away from hear and looked at you with appalled eyes. \u201cThey separated you two from each other in homeroom?!\u201d Serene nodded with a calm nod, having temporarily stopped her tears. \u201cHey sis, I think maybe I should explain to you what he just told me, because I think your missing one major part.\u201d Ashley sets you down on a nearby table and whispers into Serene\u2019s ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems a long time, Serene\u2019s looks at you with a surprised face. You spread your cloak over your shoulders and look up at her with arms spread wide. She immediately presses you into her breasts and starts crying again. You hear whisper \u201csorry\u201d repetitively, and you just cuddled up to her. When she pulls you up to her face, you decide to make the first move. You cling to her face and say \u201cI love you Serene.\u201d She quickly pries you from her cheek and kisses your torso. \u201cNot as much as I love you Roy.\u201d You two both thank Ashley. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s just hope the other three didn\u2019t see Serene crying and you separated from her.\u201d Your body swells with fear and sure enough when you scout out the classroom, Andrew, Greg, and Matt were all in the class with you. You immediately pull your cloak across your body and the hood over your head, then curl up into a ball. Soon your cloak is pulled away and you notice a familiar pink aura. \u201cThey won\u2019t hurt you. Remember, I promised I wouldn\u2019t let them.\u201d The tension you felt slowly faded away and you smiled up to her and gave her a nod in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the hood down, but pull the cloak back across your body. Serene gazes with questioning eyes, but disregards your actions and sets you on top of her head. Both her and Ashley shift over to another kitchen area. When they take their seats, you notice the teacher walks through the door. His arms are packed with cooking supplies, so his appearance was a bit clouded. Nonetheless, a deep, masculine voice booms from behind the boxes in his hands. \u201cGood afternoon class.\u201d \u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Cullins.\u201d Mr. Cullins set all the boxes on lone table in the kitchen section, and then walked back to the front. That\u2019s when you noticed he had an appearance similar to a Hariyama \u201cI\u2019m sure you all know we have our human student Roy with us today, so after we\u2019re done cooking for the day, you can meet him. Right now, everyone to the kitchen so we can start on our food.\u201d Everyone moved to the kitchen and divided into groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg, Matt, and Andrew all sat in one area, while everyone else divided up into pairs. Mr. Cullins ordered everyone to grab their supplies and afterwards instructed what they would be working on: Pizza. When Ashley, who went to go retrieve the supplies, came back, both Ashley and Serene instantly opened the boxes and sorted out the supplies. For safeties sake, you climb down from Serene\u2019s head and stood away from the work area and the stove. You looked at everyone cooking, mainly the brothers and the sisters. The brothers were quicker at getting everything together, but the sisters seemed more organized. You noticed everyone almost simultaneously start tossing their pizzas into the air, so you figured it was safe enough and wandered over to the bowl where they mixed the pizza dough. You climb into the bowl and see little bits of dough left over. Pooling together the remnants, you find you have enough to make a pizza your own size. You climb out of the bowl and rip a square off the one of the boxes so it can hold your pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You look over at the groups and see while one person is stirring the tomato sauce, the other person is getting the toppings ready. Then, while Serene is pouring the sauce on her pizza, you slip yours under for a short enough time span to get sauce to coat your pizza. Then you walk away with your pizza and wait for Ashley to start sprinkling the cheese. Nobody in the class seems to notice you, but that was alright with you. Ashley mixes up three different bags of cheese into one and sprinkles it onto her pizza. You grab a strand of each of the flavors, then rip them up as small as you can so the cheese can cover your pizza. Then Ashley and Serene started to add toppings like pepperoni and sausage, but that\u2019s when you gave up with extra ingredients. At some point in time, everybody put their pizza in their ovens. Everybody except one group and that group was Serene\u2019s brothers. They had Greg cook the pizza with his fire breath, then leave it out to cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout seven minutes later, Serene pulled out their pizza and set it on the counter to cool. You took advantage of this and laid you pizza on their pan so it would cook without being overcooked in an oven. After a minute or so, you quickly pulled your pizza from their pan onto your cardboard. You took in the scents of all the pizzas and enjoyed most of their fragrances. A few were slightly burnt, and that odor carried through the air as well. Mr. Cullin walked around and examined every pizza. He then cut each pizza into slices and after he was finished, he stood at one end of the room and looked amongst the students.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mr. Cullins seemed to be waiting for some momentous event to occur, while everyone else grew either nervous or eager. Finally, a door opened and all eyes shot towards the sound. In through the door walks a Mightyena wearing some reading glasses, Mrs. Blaze, Antonio, and Rose. Each person walking in greeted Mr. Cullins and to each person, Mr. Cullins respectively replied their name back. You overheard Mr. Cullins say the name Mr. Lupinel. \u201cThank you all for showing up,\u201d Said Mr. Cullins, \u201cNow go ahead and eat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the cooking students stood back as one of the guests came around to cut up the pizza. Mr. Lupinel headed towards the opposite end of the room, Mrs. Blaze took a table close to Mr. Lupinel, Antonio took Serene\u2019s brother\u2019s table, and Rose took your table. You watched as Rose carefully cut Ashley and Serene\u2019s pizza. \u201cSo how did you get out of class?\u2019 questioned Serene. Rose finished cutting the pizza, then looked up to Serene. \u201cAntonio and I have publishing last hour and since there is no real teacher, we got pulled out of class.\u201d After every pizza had been cut, each guest took a piece and ate it. Each pizza had been sampled by everyone and only twice had someone\u2019s face responded cbitterly to the taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter confronting Mr. Cullins and him scrambling something on a sheet of paper, each taster talked to the groups while the groups ate a piece of their own pizza. You looked at your pizza and as it was now beyond cool, tried to figure out a way to eat it. You had no knife and it seemed useless to ask for one. Finally, as seeing no other options, you decided to fold the pizza in half and eat it like that. The taste wasn\u2019t anything amazing, but it was pretty good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in mid-bite when you heard footsteps coming up from behind you. You released the pizza from your teeth and turned around. When you spun around, you saw the towering figure of Mr. Lupinel talking to Serene. \u201cGood afternoon Ms. Serene.\u201d \u201cGood afternoon Mr. Lupinel.\u201d You set your pizza on the cardboard behind you and took a quick look over Mr. Lupinel while he was standing here. He seemed to have a fair build, his glasses were obviously necessary, and the air around him gave a professional, yet free feel. \u201cHow are you today, Ms. Serene?\u201d \u201cI am fine and how about you?\u201d \u201cI am well and how is the new student?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attention of both of these titans shifts from each other to you. You shift your eyes from Serene to Mr. Lupinel. \u201cHe\u2019s alright\u201d Serene said, seeming as though she was entering a deep state of contemplation. Mr. Lupinel extended his hand, more specifically his claw out to you. You took the claw and gave an attempted handshake. After you released his claw, he took a seat and offered Serene to do the same. Serene accepted and after they both had taken a seat, Mr. Lupinel smiled then started up the conversation. \u201cAs you know my name is Mr. Lupinel and the subject I teach is creative writing. Serene told me she wished to take my class with you, but she took the course last year. I wish she hadn\u2019t taken it last year though. I would like to see what human students write about. Do you do any free writing?\u201d Although you occasionally wrote a poem, it was not everyday and you rarely wrote anything else, so you shook your head in a \u201cno\u201d motion. He didn\u2019t seem happy, but he gave you a grin. \u201cThat\u2019s alright. Some people just love to write and to others, it\u2019s not so natural or pleasant. I must return to my classroom. Until we meet again, farewell.\u201d Serene waved with emotion, but you just raised your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene winked at you and went back to talking to Ashley. You quickly turned back around and once again had the pizza in your mouth. Once again footsteps approached your from behind and you put your pizza back on the cardboard. When you turned around this time, Rose\u2019s face was right there. You jumped a little at how close her face was, and after you jumped, she pulled her face away and started to giggle. You obviously didn\u2019t enjoy it as much as Rose did and you sat there looking at her while trying to catch your breath. You then looked to the left of Serene and noticed Antonio standing there looking down at you. You started to fear the massive anthromorphic Latios that stood in front of you, and the only reason was his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed the least bit threatening and his face showed of gentleness, but no matter how you put it, his sheer size left you paralyzed. Serene looked over her shoulder and noticed Rose and Antonio looking down to you. \u201cHi Rose\u201d Rose looked away from you and turned to Serene. \u201cHi Serene. I thought they should meet each other.\u201d The two of you were locked in a stare down. He stood with crossed arms and you stood in a tense stance. Neither one of you shifted a muscle, and the only movements made were the air you breathed. Serene and Rose looked between you with concern, but you knew what this was all about. This was just another greeting, just one with a bit more grit and less grace. You\u2019d met people back home who did the same thing, just without his size or power. You grinned and slowly loosened up and stuck your hand out for him to shake.  He grinned as well and accepted your handshake. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Antonio.\u201d \u201cThe pleasure is mine Antonio. My name is Roy.\u201d Antonio released your hand and looked to his sister. \u201cWe should probably get back to writing the papers. Nice to see the both of you.\u201d \u201cOkay. Bye Serene. Bye Roy.\u201d With that, Antonio and Rose walked out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you hurried up and ate your pizza. You looked to your side halfway through and saw Serene looking at you somewhat intrigued. You smiled in between bites, but she only looked more curious. Finally, after you had completely eaten, you slowly turned to face her. She looked, but said nothing. \u201cWhat? I was hungry.\u201d \u201cBut what was that?\u201d \u201cA pizza for me.\u201d Serene shook her head and looked around the classroom, seeing Mrs. Blaze heading your way. She stopped at your station and knelt on the ground. \u201cI\u2019ve asked Mr. Cullins if you may leave this class early to come and talk with me and he said you may as long as you clean up your area here first. I\u2019ll be in my office waiting.\u201d You both nodded and Mrs. Blaze walked off. Ashley and Serene did most of the cleanup, and you did the best you could. After all had been cleaned, Serene waved goodbye to everyone. You put the cloak so it was across your chest and over your head, then climbed onto Serene\u2019s shoulder. You waved to Ashley and looked from behind your hood to Serene\u2019s brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Serene walked out of the class and down towards the office. \u201cSo how are you doing?\u201d You asked. \u201cBetter now that we\u2019ve got everything worked out. How about you, cutie?\u201d \u201cAbout the same as you. You had me afraid I made a terrible mistake somehow.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. I guess\u2026 I guess I jumped to conclusions.\u201d \u201cBut why? You know I love you unquestionably.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s talk about this at home, okay?\u201d \u201cOkay\u201d you finished and Serene picked up the pace slightly and soon she had reached the office. She walked directly in to Mrs. Blaze\u2019s office and took a seat. \u201cGood afternoon Mrs. Blaze.\u201d Mrs. Blaze looked up from whatever she had been reading and focused her attention on you and Serene. \u201cGood afternoon Serene and you too Roy. I hope you two have had an excellent first day.\u201d Serene set you down on the desk and looked at you. You shrugged. \u201cIt could have been better, but we can make tomorrow as good as we wanted today.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a good attitude to have. Is there anything you need from me or the staff?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene pondered a bit and at the same time, you took down your hood. \u201cWell, is there some way where he doesn\u2019t have to wear this?\u201d Serene stated as she pointed to the cloak. \u201cUnfortunately we\u2019ve already done the best we could about that and what you see is that effort.\u201d Serene\u2019s ears lowered and her head did the same. You walked as close as you could and touched her nearby breast in an effort to get her attention. \u201cI\u2019m not gone and this isn\u2019t a way of avoiding people. This is just\u2026 a little test of our relationship.\u201d Serene\u2019s eyes instantly shot towards you. \u201cW-what do you mean?\u201d \u201cUm, well, I guess this is just another obstacle we have to overcome and hold on to each other through, kind of like with Jared or\u2026 your brothers.\u201d \u201cYou think so?\u201d \u201cI guess.\u201d Serene suddenly lit up and gave a big smile. \u201cThen I guess I can\u2019t let you go for a heartbeat.\u201d \u201cJust like I would never let you go.\u201d  Mrs. Blaze smiled and spoke up. \u201cYou two really do work well together. I asked the teachers what they thought of you and all gave good reports, except for one, but we\u2019ll ignore the one since it did seem a bit\u2026 irrational. I\u2019m glad you two work well together and I hope to see this performance in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mrs. Blaze looked at a nearby clock, then back at you and Serene. \u201cThere\u2019s about five minutes until dismissal, but I think for today, I\u2019ll let you out a bit early. Head home and relax, because tomorrow will be bigger than today was.\u201d Serene smiled and levitated you back onto her head. \u201cThank you Mrs. Blaze. We\u2019ll be ready tomorrow.\u201d \u201cGood. Bye Serene and bye Roy.\u201d Both you and Serene waved as you walked out of the classroom. Serene then headed out the front door, heading undoubtedly for home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The walk home had been swift and eventless, though looking at the scenery proved to be interesting when you really looked at it. There were no streets, no garages, or anything that could be related to vehicles. This world seemed almost lifeless without the sound of a car driving by or looking up and not seeing a single aircraft. Yet, the peace was not unwelcome, nor was the fresher air that came with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you came upon the fortress that Serene called her home. She walked in to the dead-silent home and went upstairs to her room. Serene lied down upon the bed and carefully set you atop her bosom. \u201cSo how are you doing?\u201d Serene asked as she delicately ran her finger down your back. Her finger had a way of relaxing you and it felt so good, it took you a moment to respond. Finally you mustered your thoughts and responded. \u201cI\u2019m great. How are you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m good. Do you want something to eat?\u201d Serene said as she grabbed you, sat up, and set you on the bed. You looked confused and shrugged your shoulders. \u201cWell, I was going to get some tea. How about I bring some for you too?\u201d You nodded in approval and she pressed her fingers to her lips and then to you. She winked as she walked down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You crawled down her bed sheets and went over to your personal bathroom. You took care of some personal matters and took a quick but hot shower afterwards. A shower always was a way of helping you to relax and today, it just seemed too perfect. Finally when everything in the bathroom had been attended to, you walked over to Serene\u2019s desk and climbed up it. When you had reached the flat of it, you walked into the miniature house. You got a change of some more comfortable clothes and went over to one of the other duffle bags and sorted through it. Sketch pad, drawing supplies, a book of quotes, laptop and its components\u2026 and there it was. You finally found your mp3 player with its new attachment. To protect it, you got a durable case. The only other problem was how to keep it powered and that problem had been addressed too. At the base was an adjustable solar cell, one that collected a fair amount of power and didn\u2019t interfere with its performance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hung up your cloak and set your clothes from the day in an organized pile. You threw on the sleeveless tee you had and put on some lounge pants and put in the headphones. Music was always one of your favorite things and you rarely let a second pass where it wasn\u2019t going. But after a loud knocking sound rang out, you shut the music off and took out the headphones. You figured it was Serene, so you wrapped the headphones around the mp3 and set it by your other stuff. But when you went by the door, you saw Serene\u2019s brothers at the entrance of her room. You quickly dropped back into the shadows of the house and pressed yourself against an internal wall. \u201cSerene? Hey, you here Serene?\u201d The voice obviously belonged to Greg, but that had little importance. You stayed in your position and slowed both your heart and breathing in an attempt to blend into the shadows. You heard the brothers walk in the room and you only hoped Serene had the brew done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour plea had been answered when you heard a lighter pair of feet climbing the stairs. You peered from around a corner and saw Serene standing at the door with a mug of steaming tea and with an appalled expression. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d Serene exclaimed as she went into her room. Her brothers looked surprised and promptly turned around. \u201cHey Serene. You uh\u2026 mind if we talked?\u201d Serene looked furious and set the mug down on a near by table. \u201cSure. Now tell me what you did to Roy!\u201d Each brother looked to each other. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything, honest! He wasn\u2019t here when we walked in.\u201d \u201cSo Greg and Matt, where\u2019s your books?\u201d Serene asked, obviously trying to repress the hatred that quelled within her. \u201cThey\u2019re in our rooms. Why does it matter?\u201d \u201cBecause you could\u2019ve grabbed him and set him in either of your rooms with your books. You apparently had enough time.\u201d Then Andrew jumped in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, we didn\u2019t. We wouldn\u2019t do that. We know how much that would hurt you.\u201d Serene walked over to her bed and sat on the edge with one leg over the other and almost in tears, spoke and looked at each individual sibling. \u201cSo you wouldn\u2019t steal him because it would hurt me, but you would roast him, or shock him, or poison him with darkness, or scare the life out of him.\u201d Greg, Matt, and Andrew each looked away and showed their shame. \u201cWe\u2026 weren\u2019t going to hurt him. We were just trying to keep him in line and make sure he didn\u2019t hurt you.\u201d Matt replied, attempting to make eye contact. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t hurt me even if I told him to. We both love each other too much to harm the other. I couldn\u2019t ever hurt him.\u201d Serene looked away and you noticed little glistens rolling down her cheeks. You immediately felt the urge to run over and give her a hug, but you didn\u2019t want to get involved in this fight. Greg tried to wrap her up in a hug, but he was held off by a familiar pink emanation. \u201cThe worst thing about this is that you were so convinced I couldn\u2019t choose a good man on my own and you were so afraid of him hurting me physically that you mentally destroyed me. I trusted you to keep your word and be kind to him, but obviously that was more than too much to ask.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene sat there crying, tears pouring as strong and swift as a waterfall. You suddenly felt some rage surge, but you restrained it. Although the source of Serene\u2019s pain was right here, you knew trying to settle the score would only make it worse. So you sat and watched as she slowly calmed down and collected herself. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry, but we thought it was best.\u201d Greg said, leaving Matt and Andrew nodding in agreement. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can forgive you. You hurt me and Roy. I do want to forgive you, but if Roy doesn\u2019t feel he can forgive you, then I can\u2019t either. Roy, if you can somehow forgive them, then please show yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the decision was rested upon your shoulders. Sure, they made a mistake, but were they honest with their little tell-all or was this just a way of them trying to get closer to harm you again? You released yourself from the wall and meditated on the decision at hand. After deep contemplation and doing what was probably best for everyone, you slowly marched out of the shadows of the house and onto the desk. Just as they were all about to walk out of Serene\u2019s room, you crossed your arms and gave a sharp whistle. Everyone turned around but before they were facing you, you looked over to a stunned Serene, smiled and winked, then quickly looked back at the brothers and gave a stern scowl. They too seem surprised by your appearance. Greg quickly started walking your direction and before he got too close, you dropped one foot back. He slowly took another step forward and you stepped backward again. Then he stopped and started to back step. <br>\r\nWhen he was five steps back you stepped back to where you originally were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Serene stood up and walked over to the edge of the desk closest to you. \u201cI guess he doesn\u2019t trust you.\u201d With arms still crossed and eyes focused on the brothers, Greg in particular, you walked toward Serene. You stood there and waited for their next move. They started to walk closer and you remained where you were, feeling safe being near Serene. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely sorry. Can you forgive us?\u201d You then took this opportunity to see how honest they really were and glared at them, each dead in the eyes. You stared until one of them shook a little and moved onto the next. When you had finally come to Greg, you stared at him almost to the point where he looked paralyzed. Finally when you had gotten the desired results, you stuck your hand out. Greg, Andrew, and Matt all shook it. They then smiled and left Serene\u2019s room. She knelt over and gave you a kiss. \u201cI\u2019m glad you found it in your heart to forgive them, but what if they try to hurt you again?\u201d \u201cThen\u2026 then I guess I\u2019m the fool and you will have to get revenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s never going to come to that. I was impressed at how long you stared them down and didn\u2019t show any fear though.\u201d Serene said as she walked across the room to grab the mug of tea. \u201cWell it was quite a change from people my size, but they made you cry and if anything I had to be tough for you.\u201d She kissed you again and poured a little tea into a bottle cap. You took a hearty drink and savored its mild taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Serene sat there, enjoying the taste, when a knock resounded at her door. All eyes shifted, and Andrew was seen holding a notebook. \u201cMay I come in?\u201d Serene paused briefly before nodding. Andrew walked in and stood next to Serene\u2019s desk. \u201cI came here to ask Roy a question. While we were in math today, I noticed you had a pretty good understanding of the lesson and was wondering if you would be willing to help me.\u201d You nodded after a brief moment and after Serene moved to make room for Andrew, you began the little tutoring session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour or so, Andrew finally understood it nearly as well as you. Andrew said thanks and headed downstairs. Not too long afterwards, Serene\u2019s mom called for dinner and after mounting atop Serene\u2019s head, you went downstairs to the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After about a half hour after you had set down the stairs for dinner you were now going back to Serene\u2019s room. Serene laid down on the bed and set you in the valley between her breasts. After you had settled into a comfortable position, Serene took her index and gently ran it down your back. You let out a relaxed sigh and you started to sway. \u201cI think I ate too much.\u201d You say up to her, and in a cutesy type of voice she responds \u201cAte too much? But you barely ate anything at all!\u201d You chuckle and nod your head, once again sighing. No matter how often you looked at it, going from such a big guy to the smallest was one of the biggest kicks in the teeth imaginable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, Serene brought you back to reality with a gentle blast of air. You looked up to her wondrous pools she called eyes and found yours eyes being centered on them. Serene was absolutely beautiful and how you ever got with her is a mystery that may be unsolvable. \u201cRoy\u2026 Roy\u2026 Roy, are you all right?\u201d You shook your head violently. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Just thinking.\u201d \u201cAbout what?\u201d \u201cAbout how beautiful you really are.\u201d Through Serene\u2019s blue fur showed a hint of red. \u201cThanks, but you\u2019re pretty attractive yourself.\u201d \u201cAh but I am nowhere near as attractive as you. You have a beauty I have never seen before.\u201d Serene\u2019s face this time showed a red so deep it could make the jewel on her forehead fade and she slightly turned her face away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for embarrassing you. I just wanted to make sure you knew how I felt about you.\u201d \u201cRoy, thank you. I\u2019m glad you can be honest and tell me. But how about you tell me which sense of beauty you\u2019re talking about?\u201d \u201cI wish I could, but I\u2019d like to keep it a secret. It\u2019s not bad in any way, but I think maybe I should tell you later.\u201d Serene\u2019s ears fell a bit, showing obvious disappointment. \u201cOkay. How about you tell me what you thought of today.\u201d \u201cIf you really want to hear me blab about it, I will. But only if you tell me about yours afterward.\u201d Serene gave a nod of approval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explained to Serene about how all went relatively well, except for Mr. Necroen\u2019s issue. When you said that, Serene interrupted and both exhibited as well as explained her hatred over that situation. You then explained the situation from where she wasn\u2019t present all the way to the point of coming to an armistice with her brothers. There was a note you intentionally kept out of the conversation, the incident at the beginning of cooking. That was dirt that was best left unperturbed, as no one really was better than the other and you in reality were the cause. Serene then explained how she felt about the day and its happenings. She mentioned reading the paper, specifically the article about you and how it didn\u2019t quite sum up how great of a guy you were. You looked down and started to rub your neck. After you reformed your eye contact, Serene started talking about how much fun it was making the pizza and ended on the note of making tea. In your mind you started to cheer, seeing as she too had avoided the topic. Then almost as if feeling a premonition, or in your case an omen, something deep inside whispered in a voice you clearly recognized as your own and said: \u2018She is not done talking yet.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when you started to curse yourself silently, knowing that she was just about to start digging that forbidden turf. \u201cHey Roy?\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d You responded, now assured that the conversation was inevitable. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the beginning of cooking.\u201d \u201cSerene, if anyone should be sorry, it\u2019s me and not you. I messed up, you didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cBut I abandoned  you.\u201d \u201cYes but had I not refused your touch, this would have never occurred.\u201d \u201cBut\u2026\u201d \u201cSerene, let\u2019s put it this way. I made most of the errors today. No matter how much you argue about what you did, I won\u2019t change my view. I really don\u2019t want to discuss or debate this anymore. It makes me feel worse both about hurting you and starting a fight. So can you make me the first promise I ask of you, that being you promise not to mention this unless it is absolutely necessary.\u201d She hesitated, but nodded yes after some contemplation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d You\u2019re welcome. How about first thing tomorrow we stop by Rose and Antonio while they are in the publishing room and pick up an extra paper so you can see what they say about you yourself?\u201d  \u201cI guess but when can I read since I don\u2019t have a homeroom? I think Mrs. Blaze is going to engage in conversation rather than watch me read an oversized paper. Maybe you can \u2018assist\u2019 me with reading it, since it could take a while reading it alone.\u201d \u201cGood that way I can point out what isn\u2019t quite right.\u201d You buried your face into palm and gently shook your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you set me on the desk for a second? There\u2019s some things I need to do.\u201d  \u201cUm, okay.\u201d Serene walks you over to the desk, sets you down upon its surface and you walk in. After walking in, you sort through your duffle to find the laptop. After opening it up and turning it on, Serene looked in one of the windows. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \u201cWell as part of being sent to this world, I\u2019m supposed to kind of keep a log of today\u2019s happenings and explain them to my government.\u201d \u201cSo what are you going to tell them?\u201d \u201cJust the basics and everything overall. I doubt personal things would stir their interest.\u201d You spent a quick five minutes typing the list, sent it and within another five minutes you were answering the email they responded with, asking more in-depth questions. You answered them and after receiving a farewell response, shut the laptop down and looked to Serene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell since I\u2019m done with that and I\u2019m still in here, would it be alright if I ask you a question?\u201d \u201cWhy would you find it necessary to ask a question in your house here and not out here with me?\u201d \u201cWith the tone you had earlier, I feel a little safer asking from in here.\u201d \u201cWait, when did I\u2026 Oh are you going to ask about Jared?\u201d \u201cIndeed I am, unless you still don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d \u201cNo it\u2019s alright. I guess I got a little aggravated. Jared once went out with Alana for a little while and they seemed great, until Alana found out Jared was cheating and broke it off immediately. Alana being my best friend, I kinda came to dislike Jared as much as she had. A few months later, he played innocent and wanted to go out with me. When I flatly told him no, he kept asking, with a little bit more anger each time. A few weeks later I started talking to you. That\u2019s when I told him we were planning on going out, wether you were going to ask in time or not. He really got infuriated with that, saying how pain and suffering will only come my way by going out with you. He even started to spread rumors about you and me, which is where I think my brothers got their ideals from.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO WE DIDN\u2019T!\u201d  Shouted Greg from the other side of the door. You instantly chuckle and Serene looks at you confused. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t know what\u2019s worse about this, that Greg\u2019s lying or that he\u2019s actually eavesdropping on our conversation.\u201d Serene shook her head in shame. \u201cGreg why are you eavesdropping on us? I gave you a chance to talk with Roy and you abused it. You mad bro?\u201d You looked at her with an empty face and start climbing down her desk. She looks at you confused and when you look back, you give her a sign that something doesn\u2019t sound right. While Serene and Greg were carrying on a conversation, you crawled under the door and barely wedge yourself between the carpet and the door. That\u2019s when you noticed 3 sets of feet, one black, one yellow and the other red. You pulled back into Serene\u2019s room and dashed over to her desk and she gave you a lift up. You shook your head and she shot a look that demanded an explanation. You filled her in and she decided to let them in on their own bust. \u201cGreg, when was the last time you went to the doctor?\u201d \u201cLast month. Why?\u201d \u201cWell Roy\u2019s in here worried about you. He says growing two other pair of feet each with a different color seems unhealthy even here.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d \u201cC\u2019mon, he says he saw all of you out there. Just admit it.\u201d \u201cWe were going to say goodnight, but I heard Jared get mentioned and I got curious.\u201d Andrew confesses. \u201cSo since we\u2019re here, how about you explain what happened in Ms. Passel\u2019s class\u201d Greg says. \u201cWe\u2019re about to go to bed though. Either wait until tomorrow or have Andrew explain it.\u201d Soon enough the footsteps thundered away and Serene carried you over to the bed. \u201cGoodnight Roy.\u201d \u201cGoodnight Serene.\u201d Shortly after that you two had both drifted off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sleep was short lived, however as you woke up. You looked around and noticed the moonlight still pouring into the window. You cautiously climbed off Serene and her bed and progressed towards the desk. You slipped into your house to grab your mp3 and walked to the window sill. You put the headphones in, played some music, and sat down, gazing at the full moon. You knew you were going to wake up again tonight as you had last night. Thoughts had been in your head all of today and yesterday, you just shoved them out in hopes of a more positive attitude. Even with your best effort, they seeped into your active thoughts. That\u2019s when you finally accepted it; you missed all the great things you had back home. You knew you would miss it all before you left, but you felt this might be the better option. However, you still accepted your reasons for leaving. You left not only for opportunity, but for an escape, an escape from what you saw as terrible, an escape from your problems. You decided to call it a night, so you got showered up and climbed onto Serene. In her sleep she mentioned how much she loved you. You sighed, with a certain pain. \u201cSerene, I wish you knew how much I love you, just as I wish you knew what you do for me.\u201d Feeling your eyelids growing weary, you let them fall and with their close came the close of another day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You knew subconsciously the day was coming, but you tried to deny it. Finally you reached the point where no effort could keep you asleep. Yet your alarm was not the bright sun, nor the sweet melody of your love. You awoke to a gentle drumming melody, one you easily recognized as rain. You sat up and saw Serene\u2019s window coated with gentle streams of water. You felt something was off and when you examined your surroundings, you noticed Serene was no longer beneath you. You climb down her bed and walk over to your bathroom. You finished your business and nearly walked out when you paused at the sound of running water and a familiar voice singing. It seemed hard to accept, but you were going out with a towering beauty that was both kind and held beauties that went unseen, but certainly not unnoticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked away from your bathroom and climbed up to the desk\u2019s surface. You threw on some clothes for school and put the cloak on last. Finally you did a quick check over and walked out and scurried down the desk and over to the doorway. You walked out and almost started to walk towards the bathroom when immense tremors shook you. You looked over to the source and noticed they were moving in your direction. You plastered yourself to the wall and waited for the person to pass by. When the owner of the feet had passed by you slid back into Serene\u2019s room. \u2018Note to self, don\u2019t wander the house alone, unless you want to become part of the carpet.\u2019 You thought as you climbed onto Serene\u2019s bed to wait for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, a relaxed Serene walked in and sat on the edge of her bed. She smiled down to you, then lifted you onto her shoulder. \u201cAre you ready, Sir Roy?\u201d You shook your head in confusion. \u201cWait what? Why are you calling sir?\u201d \u201cWell knights from your world always had sir at the front of their names and since you were acting so chivalrous last night, you\u2019re my little knight.\u201d \u201cBut knights don\u2019t wear cloaks and they ride horses, not beautiful girlfriends.\u201d \u201cWell you\u2019re unique then since you do have a cloak and don\u2019t think of it as riding me, think of it more as traveling with the damsel you so valiantly helped.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d keep debating this with you, but I feel it would be a waste of time and I\u2019d end up losing.\u201d \u201cGlad you know I\u2019m right. Now let\u2019s go get something to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Serene walked down the stairs and took her place at the table amongst her parents and siblings. Ashley seemed joyous for some odd reason, but when you looked at Greg, he seemed angry. Today\u2019s breakfast: Cereal. \u201cYou know I think I\u2019ll pass on the cereal and take some toast instead.\u201d Serene thought about it for a second, then giggled a bit, then psychically grabbed a piece of toast. She broke a corner off and you nibbled away. When you finished, you sat upon Serene\u2019s shoulder. Then you felt as though you were slipping and when you adjusted, you noticed a pink aura seemed to be nudging you. You finally fell off, and was caught barely an inch from the white liquid. You were levitated back onto Mount Serene, but you gave her a dirty look. \u201cYou know, just because I\u2019m being nice doesn\u2019t mean you have to be mean.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just wanted to mess with you a bit.\u201d \u201cI know but is there some way less\u2026 uncommon. I don\u2019t think many people as a joke get a milk bath. Besides, if anything, I need to mess around some more.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone said their goodbyes, set their dishes in the sink, and went about their day. You laid down on Serene\u2019s shoulder to avoid being knocked off by the bombarding rain. The cloak splashed most of the rain off, so you kept fairly dry. Ashley now had gone from generally joyful to basking in the rain almost as if it were sunlight. Greg however kept cursing the rain, and started sprinting through it. Eventually the rain picked up and everyone starting sprinting, even Ashley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally everyone went in the school and they tried to pat out the water from their fur. You, however, decided to shake like a wet dog. Little bits splashed on Serene, but you patted them down by rubbing her soft fur. Greg stormed off presumably to his first class, and everyone else slowly went about their days. Serene, true to her word, headed for the publications office and knocked as soon as she came upon the door. Rose answered with a puzzled look, and when Serene explained the situation she grabbed an extra copy. After engaging a brief morning conversation, Serene headed off for battle strategies.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shortly after Serene took seat, the bell rang and Mr. Shartney began his lecture. \u201cAlright class. Now the last time we met, we were discussing how to effectively use attacks where you have the upper hand. But today I\u2019ll teach you about if your opponent isn\u2019t weak to your attacks or has the upper hand against you. So, for example, what am I weak against?\u201d \u201cGround!\u201d \u201cCorrect. So I\u2019m weak only to ground types. That\u2019s the obvious part, but what if I\u2019m going up against a\u2026 Whiscash, for example. I have the advantage, but I also have the disadvantage. Electric is great against water, but useless because of the ground, so what should I do?\u201d \u201cUse a TM and learn a grass type attack.\u201d \u201cThat would work in theory, but the only problem is that I may not be able to learn grass type attacks. Any other ideas other than TM use?\u201d The classroom remained silent. \u201cThat was a good idea. However the other way that may be simpler in my mind and just as efficient is to use the environment around you.\u201d Mr. Shartney paused then continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith the situation I supplied, it\u2019s difficult to see how that would work and in all honesty, even with determination and a cunning strategy, you may not stand a chance. I could win because I\u2019m that good though.\u201d The class broke into laughter, knowing he meant it as a joke. \u201cAlright, now let\u2019s say Bailey is wandering through the mountains, minding her own business, when a Camerupt decides Bailey is intruding on its space. Bailey knows no water moves, ground moves, or rock type moves. What should she do?\u201d \u201cRun away.\u201d The whole class starts laughing. \u201cWhile I appreciate the creativity, I don\u2019t want to keep adding restrictions. So if she were to fight, how would she?\u201d Nobody answered, and you were curious to see what they think. \u201cOk I\u2019ll say it one more time. Bailey, a grass type, is in the mountains fighting a fire type. Now remember what I said earlier and think.\u201d After a few minutes of silence, Mr. Shartney spoke up again. \u201cWell you know I like to give you all opportunities to answer or not to answer, but this is just getting to be a waste of the time we have. So I\u2019m going to ask one specific student. Roy, I\u2019m asking you to think like a pokemon right now and explain what you would do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly utter a few syllables. All eyes are on you and the pressure\u2019s on. You think hard, then tell Serene what to say. \u201cRoy says he would use some grass attack on the mountain until a rockslide started. The class looks stunned and Mr. Shartney looks pleased. \u201cThat is the answer I\u2019ve been waiting for. Good job. Now for those who don\u2019t understand his way of thinking or you think he\u2019s wrong, let\u2019s look at this in a more physical manner.\u201d Mr. Shartney goes over to the chalkboard and starts drawing. \u201cHere is Bailey, the Camerupt, and the mountain. Bailey attacking directly wouldn\u2019t do much good obviously, so she has to think a bit more in-depth. Bailey normally wouldn\u2019t attack a mountain because, well, it seems stupid, which is why most would overlook it as an option. But by what Roy pointed out, if she attacked enough or hit the right spot, a rockslide could potentially come and make the Camerupt faint. Either that or run away because she seems insane. That\u2019s the main idea of today\u2019s lesson. It won\u2019t work everywhere or every time. Now on the board, I\u2019m going to put a few more examples and I want you all to answer them as one big group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Shartney grabs the chalk and writes three examples: Mrs. Taoshen in a frozen land against a Pidgeot, Serene fighting Andrew, a Lanturn versus a Relicanth. Everyone discussed the answers amongst themselves and after a few moments answered. \u201cI thought Mrs. Taoshen could use an Aura Sphere and watch the Pidgeot crash into the ice.\u201d I thought she would pick up a snowball and launch it at the Pidgeot.\u201d \u201cI think Andrew would be afraid of Serene and run away. I know I would.\u201d Serene chuckled as everyone laughed. \u201cI think Serene should probably punch or kick him.\u201d \u201cI think that we should go home and see how they work it out.\u201d \u201cEveryone once again roared with laughter. \u201cFor the last one, I think it would be best to swim to the bottom and use a tail slap with mud.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood work today class. You\u2019ll be off to Mrs. Taoshen to learn how she would deal with a Pidgeot in the snow. Also, as a reminder, tomorrow we will have guests during class. Be on your best behavior, especially Roy and Serene.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang and sure enough, everyone was off to Battle Applications. \u201cWhat do you think he meant by \u2018Especially Roy and Serene\u2019 \u201d? I don\u2019t know, but I hope it\u2019s not a bad thing. I don\u2019t think we did anything wrong. Maybe it\u2019s just the guests have something to do with us. Whatever it may be, we should be fine, Mr. Genius.\u201d \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d \u201cWell you answered a question no one could think of an answer for and that shows you\u2019re smart. How I got lucky enough to be paired with you I\u2019ll never know.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got it all wrong if you think that way. I\u2019m paired with a girl who\u2019s smart, caring, beautiful, and powerful. All you got is a little man that is smart and was strong back in his own world, but now needs your help just to survive.\u201d \u201cStop making yourself sound pathetic. I\u2019d rather have you than anyone else in this world and with you being so small, we can always be together.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true. I don\u2019t want to be apart from you, but what if our love has a fallout like yesterday.\u201d \u201cWell then, like you said, this a test of true love.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got to think more before I speak. Well my lovely lady, let\u2019s go watch a few battles.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene reached over, grabbed you and planted a kiss over your cloaked torso. She set you back atop her shoulder and walked into the gym. The class flew by, having about 4 battles, and the final fight was between Serene and Alana. You sat all alone, when you were picked up by black paws. You noticed it was Mrs. Taoshen, and she set you on her shoulder. \u201cI see Serene and you make an excellent team. I think it\u2019s because of you she got so strong, feeling she was fighting to prove her love. How have things been with you personally?\u201d \u201cFine.\u201d You replied timidly. \u201cNot much of a talker. That\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll make what I need to say brief. I know there\u2019s not much you can do in class, but I need to test your strength somehow. I don\u2019t want you to get hurt, but otherwise there is not much you can do. Today I have to test you. It\u2019s going to be dangerous, but you\u2019ll overall be fine if you use your head. I was told by one of our leaders to test you in a harsh manner, but I\u2019m going to lighten up a tad for safety reasons. What\u2019s going to happen is that I will throw you in the air and you will have to land. Your strength will be determined based upon injuries. The less you have, the better you are.\u201d You freeze, and look at her with fear. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, \u2018but I might die or break my limbs\u2019. I know, I thought of this and talked it out with the leader, trying to make him see it as it really is, but I couldn\u2019t change his mind. He swore that nothing would happen and just in case something did, get a nurse on the scene immediately.\u201d \u201cBut\u2026 d-death can-can\u2019t be cured.\u201d \u201cThen Serene will have to make sure you\u2019re safe. But if she helps, you fail. I\u2019ll tell her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Taoshen went over to the tired, but victorious Serene and began describing the situation. \u201cBut Mrs. Taoshen, I won\u2019t let this happen. I will stop you from doing that.\u201d \u201cSerene please try\u2026\u201d You cut her off, knowing your words will mean the most to her. Mrs. Taoshen passes you over to Serene as you start talking, then starts to explain what\u2019s happening to everybody else. \u201cSerene, I know this is dangerous. I\u2019ve already thought of all the odds. But Serene, think of two things: everyone else and the positives.\u201d \u201cWhat could be positive about this and what does everyone else have to do with this?\u201d \u201cWell if I succeed, I pass and you\u2019re dating a guy who\u2019s smart and strong. If I fail, I tried and if the worst does happen, I\u2019ll be the strongest and will pay you back by taking care of you, even from beyond the grave.\u201d But\u2026\u201d \u201cAnd everyone else will be affected because if I don\u2019t do this or have some interference, Mrs. Taoshen and any other staff member could lose their job, plus you may lose your place as a student and your knowledge shouldn\u2019t be lost.\u201d \u201cBut I can\u2019t go on without you. You know that.\u201d \u201cYes and neither could I, but this is another one of those tests but not for love or loyalty, but belief. I need you to believe I can do this. With you believing in me, I can do anything, and I do mean anything. In my world, this would be a leap of faith for me, because I need to believe I can make it, but for you it\u2019s a belief I can fight the battle and win, as your hero. So, Serene Variform, I must ask: Will you believe in me and grant me the strength to succeed?\u201d \u201cI\u2026 I will. But what should I do if the worst does happen?\u201d \u201cDo as you have done before with troubles: Push on and be strong, live as though I were never there. You are strong and will continue.  Besides I won\u2019t fail, remember belief and trust in one another and we will be stronger.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene tries to smile through her concerned tears, and you can\u2019t help but worry yourself. Serene passes you over to Mrs. Taoshen. \u201cRoy, I will throw you in that direction. Would you prefer to be facing up or down?\u201d \u201cUp.\u201d You reply, with no fear or uncertainty in your voice, although you were afraid. She throws you slightly upward. And when you start to fall down, you roll over and use the cloak on your shoulders as a form of wings and glide closer to the dirt. But when you were about 16 feet (in your terms) away from the ground, you lose grip one of the flaps. At the last second, you shift and start running on the wall vertically. Eventually, you feel gravity start to show and you jump down to land in the dirt. Everyone gasped as the cloud of dust shielded their view of your landing. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dust swirling in the air around you grew heavy at first, and seemed to obstruct any hope of seeing your spectators. You started to cough a little as the dust got in your mouth and as the cloud dust slowly settled, the trembles of massive footsteps signaled someone\u2019s approach. Judging by the how close the vibrations were, the person was running and even before a blue paw gently wrapped around you, you could tell Serene was the individual heading your way. When Serene picked you up to her face, you turned the other way to cough up the rest of the dust left in your mouth. \u201cAre you ... alright?\u201d Serene asks, showing unmistakable fear and concern. \u201cYeah, except for a mild soreness and getting a mouth full of dirt.\u201d Serene said nothing as she tightly nestled you between her breasts. She slowly relieves the pressure she applies as Mrs. Taoshen and Mr. Kainen approached<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised you even went on with it, but you did. Nice job.\u201d Mrs. Taoshen said as Mr. Kainen nodded in agreement \u201cMrs. Taoshen, why would they make Roy to do such a crazy test even though they knew the risks?\u201d \u201cI wish I knew Serene, but they said nothing as to the logic behind it. They just assured this test was necessary.\u201d Serene once again embraced you tightly and continued to hold you tightly even after the bell had rung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw light once again as Serene released you from her fleshy mounds and set you on a desk in Ms. Passel\u2019s room. You looked up to her eyes and saw tears still remained. \u201cPlease stop crying. The more you cry, the more I feel like I might cry and I don\u2019t have anything to cry about.\u201d \u201cBut I almost lost you and why, because some idiot doesn\u2019t care what happens to you. Besides your reasons make me worried.\u201d \u201cSerene, we can\u2019t do anything about the person. What\u2019s done is done. But what do you mean my reasons worry you? Do you think I did this just as a way of getting away from you?\u201d Serene just looked the other way with no sign of denial. \u201cSerene\u2026\u201d You stood paralyzed for a few moments, unsure of how to think. You were known to be untrusting at times but her lack of trust seemed cold-hearted. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d You noticed the words seemed to just fall out of your mouth rather than being said. \u201cBecause others lie to get what they want. Even though those people aren\u2019t that close to me, their words left a sort of scar. What if I\u2019m just some trophy to you?\u201d \u201cBut I thought we already discussed this: I\u2019m not like other people. I don\u2019t act or think like most guys. My world had guys that were just after women for their bodies too. Serene, I know it\u2019s not easy, but I want you to trust me and see me as unique, because every other time things like this happen, they usually end worse, like yesterday. So how about since we have some more time, let\u2019s talk. What made you worry this time?\u201d \u201cWell it was some insane stunt where you could\u2019ve died and your reasons seemed like lies. So could you explain them once more so maybe I can see it from your point of view?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then. I took the test for a bunch of reasons. I already told you about the pride and benefits for others and to prove our relationship strength. When I agreed to take the test, I also knew that gravity would affect me less because I was so small and I would probably land softer, plus this cloak could help me glide to safety. All that is the truth, but there was one part I left out for\u2026 personal reasons. The one thought that had the greatest impact before my decision was what if I said no and what would happen to us.\u201d \u201cWhat does that mean? You would\u2019ve have been guaranteed safe and I would be happier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMaybe, but what I was thinking was completely different. What I was wondering was how would your government respond. Sure they could\u2019ve just ignored it, but what if there was some major reason for the test and by refusing to take it, I would not be allowed here. In other words, even though I have to be here, if that test had a meaning and I didn\u2019t want to take it, they could have major restrictions or send me back to my world for refusing to cooperate.\u201d \u201cStop. You\u2019re just saying stuff to try and cover yourself. Why would one test affect you so much that you would have to go back to your world?\u201d \u201cI know it seems far-fetched, but I don\u2019t know how things work here, and in my world, refusing to take a test could point to signs of committing a crime or guilt, which could get you sent away from home. So while that was a rare chance, it was one I didn\u2019t want to risk experiencing. If they did send me back, I couldn\u2019t have been with you anymore and I don\u2019t know if I could live with that. So I agreed to take the test because either way the worst option was death.\u201d \u201cHold on. What do you mean the worst option was death?\u201d \u201cWell if I had fallen and died, I would be physically dead. However if I had refused to test and they did something, like separate us for health hazards or send me back for a lack of cooperation, then I would metaphorically die. As bad as it may sound, I would rather live with you as a spirit then live without you. Besides like I said, odds were in my favor so death physically would be less likely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene laid her head on her hand and sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t what to say. I want to call you smart because you thought it all out, but I also want to call you an idiot because you would suspect something so far out there and do something so stupid just to be with me.\u201d \u201cSerene, you said yourself you don\u2019t think you could live without me. Besides if I\u2019m an idiot, I\u2019m your idiot.\u201d Serene looked stuck in emotion. She was smiling, but looked like she might start crying. She wiped away her unshed tears with her arms and smiled even bigger. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know you don\u2019t want me to cry, but I can\u2019t help it. It just feels so strange, knowing how much you would give up just to be with me. I guess that\u2019s what love is.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, but it feels right. I just hope you realize how much I really love you.\u201d \u201cI do now. I guess I assumed you might start to act like other guys once you got comfortable.\u201d \u201cWell I don\u2019t think either of us would enjoy that.\u201d \u201cExactly. I love you cutie.\u201d \u201cNot as much as I love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell finally rang after what felt like a half hour even though the clock showed only five minutes. Serene apparently felt the same way by the grin she flashed at you. \u201cDialga must be on our side. And just for the record, you\u2019re too smart to be an idiot.\u201d You chuckled as you climbed onto Serene\u2019s shoulder. Ms. Passel started the lesson and when you looked behind you, Jared\u2019s seat was empty. \u201cI think Jared got kicked out.\u201d You whispered into Serene\u2019s ear. Then like she was in your mind, she whispered \u201cMaybe but chances are he\u2019s just home reflecting on what he\u2019s done and talking with people like his parents and Lieutenant Ampren.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll ask who he is later, but for now, I\u2019m not sure whether to be amazed or scared.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just telepathy. Why? Do you think I\u2019m delving into your thoughts?\u201d \u201cI really wasn\u2019t sure, but it did feel a bit creepy.\u201d \u201cWhatever. I\u2019ve never felt what it\u2019s like. Anyways, I\u2019m going to get back to the lesson. We can talk about who is all in town during ho\u2026 I mean after school.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided not to say anything this time. She already probably had some bad thoughts brewing about the separation at homeroom. So you sat and paid attention to the whole lecture, but on occasion looked over at Andrew. He seemed to understand the concepts better. It was nice to know you didn\u2019t have to help such a massive being when you were smaller than his finger, but then again, it also was kind of cool knowing he would listen to you. Regardless, as if Dialga was indeed manipulating time in your favor, the class flew by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene walked to lunch with what felt like a slightly hurried pace. She set you down at her table and walked with all her friends up to the lunch line. Only one person sat with you and that was Mathias. A look on his face seemed to point to an internal struggle, but he was soon near where you stood. \u201cThank you\u201d he said slightly looking towards you. \u201cUh\u2026 F-for what?\u201d You replied with a hint of fear and uncertainty. \u201cFor setting me up with Alana.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all? I know it\u2019s a big deal, b-but still.\u201d \u201cWell it\u2019s just I\u2019ve been wanting to go out with her for years, but never could find the words. Then out of the blue she wants to go out with me thanks to you. I feel like I owe you.\u201d \u201cBut that was just because she was looking for someone like me and I heard you were like me. If we are alike as they think they I know what it\u2019s like to be without someone perfect like Serene or in your case, Alana. Besides, I owe you for math yesterday.\u201d \u201cWell I\u2026 I did that because you looked like you needed a hand.\u201d \u201cBut helping versus saving. I would owe you immensely and I don\u2019t know if I could do that in 2 lifetimes. So could please just call it even?\u201d \u201cDeal.\u201d The iron giant stuck out his massive finger, to which you grabbed with both hands and shook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you two doing\u201d rang in your mind as you jumped in surprise. You look around and what looks to be days away stands Serene standing in line for food, staring in your general region.  \u201cEverything alright there?\u201d Mathias asked. \u201cYeah, just something in my head.\u201d He looked the other way and shrugged. As soon as all the girls got back to the table, Cecilia looked at you with a mischievous grin. Her look stirred intimidation so you cringed as Serene took her seat. \u201cW-w-what?\u201d \u201cNothing bad, little Comran.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sat there, unsure of what she meant by calling you this \u201cComran\u201d name. All you did was look at her with uncertainty and fear lurking within you. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell him what you mean by that?\u201d Vienna asks. Cecilia shakes her head in a \u201cno\u201d type of motion. \u201cOh come on. He doesn\u2019t know who that is.\u201d Responded Rose. \u201cBut it\u2019s nothing bad.\u201d Answered Cecilia. The girls went back and forth about what to do. Meanwhile you glanced around the table and saw why Serene or Alana hadn\u2019t said anything. Alana was cuddling up with Matthias and presumably paid no attention to anything or anyone else, and Serene was gone without a trace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorried about me?\u201d Serene said as you jumped in surprise. \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d You question. \u201cTo the little girl\u2019s room.\u201d \u201cSomething about that seems a bit contradictive, if you ask me.\u201d Serene just giggled  Across the table, the girls were still debating and by the sounds of it, Cecilia was losing. \u201cC\u2019mon just tell him.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t, but if one of you guys wan to, then go ahead.\u201d \u201cAlright then. Serene, would you mind letting me see Roy?\u201d Stacey said as she flicked her tail. Serene nodded and looked at you. You quickly grabbed food from Serene\u2019s tray and then walked over to where Stacey sat. She laid her arm on the table and you climbed all the way up to her face where you sat on her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Comran was a character in a novel. It was this love story of an 18 year old Machoke named Comran that once dreamt of a Lopunny named Ajulye. When Comran explained to his family his desire to find this girl, his family did not allow him to waste him time searching for a girl that existed solely in his fantasies. Comran, although certain this girl existed, obeyed his parents and remained at home. However, every night this girl reappeared in his dreams and after a few days, talked with this girl as though she were right in front of me. After finding her name to be Ajulye and that she lived halfway across the planet, he made it his goal to meet her in person. His family, even after explaining the details, refused to allow him to search for her. After days of begging and refusal, he left in the twilight hours and searched for a way to get to where Ajulye resided. He was trapped in a predicament as he lived on water locked strip of land. He then sought Palkia, for perhaps he could guide him to his love. Finally, after much searching, Comran found Palkia and stated his request. After asking\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude, but lunch doesn\u2019t last forever, so maybe you should shorten it up.\u201d Vienna calmly explained. \u201cAh, you do bring up a good point. Okay in short, Comran met Palkia, got his wish granted, and after meeting Ajulye, moved away from her family and went somewhere away from both families, so neither saw her parents again. Cecilia called you Comran because you moved away from your family to be with Serene.\u201d \u201cSo they were a pair of star crossed lovers?\u201d You questioned as you started walking back towards Serene. \u201cI guess you can call it that, even though they aren\u2019t galaxies apart.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor. It means their love existed against all odds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Stacey seemed intrigued by your explanation and before you had gotten twenty steps away, you were soon gliding across the table, being suspended within a pink aura. You were swiftly standing before your beautiful titan. After grabbing another handful of food from Serene\u2019s plate, you were slowly lifted to her head. \u201cSo who are you going to be with for homeroom?\u201d Serene uttered with an irritated, yet calm tone. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I want to be with you, even though I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t want it to seem like favorites and besides, you know them better than I do.\u201d Serene grinned. \u201cOk then I\u2019ll solve this the best way possible.\u201d Serene grabbed the empty bottle Alana had and set it flat in the center of the table. \u201cOooh. Does the winner get to kiss your little man?\u201d Cecilia asked in a flirty tone. You felt a bit uneasy, but eliminate the paranoia from your mind. \u201cThat\u2019s funny, but no. This is to see who can bring Roy to homeroom with them since I can\u2019t. Here we go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Serene spun the bottle with what appeared to be little effort, but the bottle spun fairly quick. You looked around and even Alana and Mathias had their sights focused on the bottle. It spun and spun, and when its speed had decreased, everyone unknowingly held their breath. It eventually hit the slowest it could, then stopped with its neck pointing towards Vienna. Vienna smiled and bobbed her head. Everyone else tried to hide their disappointment, but failed. \u201cTake good care of him and don\u2019t enjoy it too much.\u201d \u201cYou know I will.\u201d Vienna replied with no specific question being answered. Serene apparently caught the joke and levitated you over to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly afterward, the bell rang and you now were in Vienna\u2019s hands. As you watched Serene vanish amongst the people. You were sitting when Serene\u2019s voice echoed in your mind. \u201cI forgot to give you a kiss. Oops. You shouldn\u2019t have to worry about Vienna; she\u2019s not going to cross any lines. I wish we could be together so we could read the paper together, but we can do that at home. But I decided that rather than talk about the town, I\u2019ll walk you around it. Remind me to get some creamed ice. Later cutie.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Serene had stopped speaking telepathically, you heard Vienna\u2019s voice getting progressively louder. \u201cRoy?!\u201d \u201cUh\u2026 y-yes?\u201d \u201cYou had me worried there. You weren\u2019t responding when I was calling you. Anyway, let\u2019s talk.\u201d You were a bit confused why she seemed so prepared, but then you realized she was already in her homeroom with you at her desk. \u201cUm\u2026 okay. What do you want to talk about?\u201d \u201cOh come now. You\u2019re the human here. Ask me a few questions, then I\u2019ll question you.\u201d You sighed. There were so many questions you could ask but what\u2019s appropriate and what\u2019s over the line. \u201cOkay, so I heard that anyone who touches a tail of a Ninetales will be cursed for one thousand years. Is that true?\u201d The vixen smiled as she flashed her tails as a peacock would it\u2019s feathers. \u201cThese tails? Yes, there is truth to that tale. However, you have not heard all there is to tell. Yes, touching one will result in being cursed, unless the tail touches you first or the touch is minimal, such as someone unintentionally brushing up against it. If a tail touches you first, then you may touch it all you want. Such as this.\u201d She moved one of her tails to you and rubbed it against you. Hesitantly, you reached out to touch it. Once your hand was completely on, you slowly stroked it. It felt soft and very fluffy. \u201cSee no harm done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then stopped petting her tail and she retracted it. \u201cSo what else would you like to know?\u201d Vienna asked. \u201cDo you have\u2026 a boyfriend?\u201d You silently cursed yourself. That question was just awkward. Who asks a friend of your love if they have a companion, especially when they are bigger than you? No matter what her status, she could get offended. \u201cMy, an odd question, but certainly not unwelcome. Yes, however he does not attend this school. There is a town a few miles away that he goes to school at. He is a Zoroark, a bit on the hard side, but really nice. Any more questions?\u201d \u201cN-no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlright then. My turn. So how are things with Serene and her family?\u201d \u201cI get along well with Serene and Ashley, as for her brothers, we\u2019re umm\u2026 working on it.\u201d \u201cGot a bit protective of Serene when they met you? How far did they go? I can\u2019t imagine their actions going farther than just yelling, what with you being so small. You don\u2019t mind me tagging you as small, do you?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care as much anymore. At first it was kind of a shock, but I\u2019m adjusting. As for your mention of their actions, then you would be surprised. But I\u2019d rather not talk about it.\u201d \u201cWhy? Do you bear scars they gave you?\u201d \u201cNot as much physically as mentally. But they certainly did have some ideas to physically harm me. You should really ask Serene. I\u2019m still traumatized by the event. Just don\u2019t bring it up to them. I think it\u2019s best if we all forget it happened.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVienna seemed to agree. \u201cWell the bell is about to ring. It was nice being with you for the time we had.\u201d \u201cAs it was with you. Perhaps we can be lucky enough to do this again.\u201d Vienna giggled. \u201cI hope Serene doesn\u2019t mind you flirting with me.\u201d Your face grew extremely red. Were you really flirting? \u201cBu-but I d-d-don\u2019t think that I w-\u2026\u201d You were cut off when Vienna put her finger close to your mouth. \u201cI\u2019m just joking with you. I don\u2019t think we would be talking if you were cheating on Serene. Though I do want you to know I think it\u2019s great Serene is with you and vice versa. You two were made for each other.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang and you climbed atop Vienna\u2019s hand. Before Vienna walked out the door, an obviously female Rhydon walked out the door and she caught your attention. But something about her just seemed wrong. She had a headstrong strut, her face seemed to exhibit anger, and she looked bigger than everyone else. However, you quickly dismissed this abnormality. The only thing that mattered right now was that you were nowhere near her and you were on your way back to Serene.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vienna casually walked back to class. Her paced seemed slow, as though she despised science. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t the class, but rather not getting to spend any more time with you. But what\u2019s bad for her is good for you. Although Vienna was good company, she couldn\u2019t compare to Serene. You started moving your arms to stretch when you realized you had the cloak on. It seemed like that cloak sometimes would just be gone in the blink of an eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVienna walked into Mr. Necroen\u2019s class, set you down at Serene\u2019s desk, and walked over to her seat. Serene snuck a quick kiss in on you before Mr. Necroen walked in. You quickly sit atop Serene\u2019s head and honestly, paid no attention. What did you have to lose? Regardless the lecture flew by, just like the rest of the day, except it seemed even faster. Then Serene darted out as quickly as she could. She made her way to cooking class and set you down on the table where she worked. Everyone walked in shortly afterward, and oddly enough, every seemed to be moving at different speeds, from slowly walking to almost sprinting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen class started, everyone was originally in the back, waiting in the cooking area. However, Mr. Cullins did not walk through the door, but in his place walked a younger looking teacher. \u201cHello class. Mr. Cullins could not come in today, so I will be subbing for you today. In case you don\u2019t know my name, I am Ms. Hydrose.\u201d Ms. Hydrose was surprisingly a Buizel and seemed a bit smaller than some of the students. \u201cSo class, Mr. Cullins informed me that in his absence, you all should make any meal of your choosing. However I need to see Serene and\u2026 Roy at the front of the class.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody got all the things they needed for whatever it is was they were making. You climbed back atop Serene\u2019s hand and she walked to the front of the room. \u201cHello Ms. Hydrose.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019re \u2026 Serene Variform? That would make you Ashley\u2019s sister then?\u201d \u201cYep. We work together back there.\u201d Serene waved to Ashley and she waved back. \u201cShe keeps me entertained in class. Great student. Anyway, where is this Roy fellow?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d Ms. Hydrose looked around, then to the ground and after looking around towards the ground notices you looking up. \u201cOh my! You mean the Roy in this class is  the human Roy?!\u201d You just bob your head in assurance. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be this Roy?\u201d \u201cWell there\u2019s so many dangerous things in here and he\u2019s so delicate. But if you\u2019re anywhere near as good as your sister, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine.  Anyway, the office asked me to send you two down. What a relief it\u2019s you two. I was afraid you were a couple caught doing inappropriate things.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face loses all emotion and Serene kind of giggled. \u201cOk. We\u2019ll see you later.\u201d You wave and Ms. Hydrose waved back. Serene walked out of the room and slowly made her way to the office. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know who I was\u2026\u201d You kind of trailed off and looked down towards the distant ground. \u201cAre you getting an ego?\u201d \u201cWell maybe, but I just figured everyone would know about me.\u201d \u201cNo you aren\u2019t. But she didn\u2019t know me either until she saw my last name, so we are in the same boat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene walked further down the hall and as she set you on her shoulder, one of those regrettable questioning thoughts popped into your head. You thought about whether to ask her or not, but in the end decided you would ask. \u201cSerene, do you mind if I ask you a serious question?\u201d \u201cI guess.\u201d \u201cDo\u2026 do you love me?\u201d Serene stopped in her tracks and the only thing that was moving was you through the air. \u201cWhat did you just ask?\u201d \u201cD-do you love me?\u201d \u201cOf course I love you.\u201d \u201cBut do you love me because I\u2019m small and easily manipulated or because of whom I am?\u201d \u201cWhy are you asking me such weird questions? Do you think I\u2019m just using you or something?\u201d \u201cNo it\u2019s not paranoia, it\u2019s\u2026 I guess it\u2019s uncertainty and confusion. I mean my world didn\u2019t seem to like me as much as people here, and people here like me mostly because of my uniqueness. But you don\u2019t like me just because of my size or species, do you?\u201d \u201cOf course not. I mean I do think it\u2019s cool that you\u2019re not my size and you\u2019re human, but there\u2019s more to you than just appearance. Physically we share almost nothing in common. But inside you\u2019re like anyone else, so why wouldn\u2019t you think I love you for you? Did you never feel affection from others in your world?\u201d \u201cI experienced it. But the dislike showed more often from others. Or maybe they showed affection in ways I could not understand.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene didn\u2019t say a word, but embraced you in a deep hug. \u201cRoy, you\u2019re the only man I want. No one else can fill you\u2019re place in my heart. If I didn\u2019t love you, I would\u2019ve never wanted to be dating you. We both love each other, because we\u2019ve each struck down the doubt. So let\u2019s stop worrying and embrace each other. Let\u2019s get the office before they start worrying.\u201d She released you from her breasts and set you back on her shoulder. You felt a joy you recognized as love and how it removed the pains you felt. Well, except for the physical pains that had started creeping over you. They felt unnatural, but they only hurt for a few seconds and were not at all often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene walked into the main office and knocked on Mrs. Blaze\u2019s door. The Typhlosion opened the door and seemed relieved. \u201cWe were worried you two weren\u2019t coming. Well let\u2019s come in and discuss what needs to be discussed.\u201d Serene took a seat, greeted Mrs. Sytes who sat next to Mrs. Blaze, and awaited some sort of opening statement. \u201cSo have the two of you been doing well?\u201d \u201cYes we have been.\u201d \u201cGood now what we need to talk about is tomorrow. I\u2019m sure you were informed this morning of guests coming tomorrow. Serene, you know what we are talking about when we say guests.\u201d \u201cA bit, but Mr. Shartney said Roy and I need to be on our best behavior. I don\u2019t know what he meant by that.\u201d \u201cWell he\u2019s a chance to get two birds with one stone. Roy, whenever we mention having guests come to visit, it means we have some of our leading officials come in and check on our teaching. However because you are not of this world and all care greatly for your safety, there will be a one extra specifically watching over you and Serene, so you both do need to be on your best behaviors.\u201d \u201cSo are we supposed to follow our regular schedule or discuss how we feel it works?\u201d Mrs. Sytes decided to answer this time. \u201cAccording to what we have been told, it will be a mixture of those two. However, they will not try to bother either of you too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the hallway the bell rang, but Serene held her spot. \u201cSerene we want you here earlier tomorrow in case they decide there are things they need to privately discuss. Other than that, the only thing I have to say although you know it anyway: Be on your best behavior. Now go home and enjoy yourselves.\u201d \u201cOk. Bye Mrs. Blaze. Bye Mrs. Sytes.\u201d Serene waves for the both of you and heads out the door. </span></div></div>",

After opening it, she grabbed the newspaper she had grabbed and headed back towards the main doors. Just before her hand pushed them open, the bell signaled freedom and the halls were now awake with the sounds of pounding feet. You both however were outside and Serene levitated you to her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where do you want to go first?\u201d She asks. \u201cHow should I know? This is your hometown, not mine. The only places I know here are your bedroom, your kitchen and parts of the school.\u201d Serene just gave a cutesy giggle. \u201cI know, but I just wanted to see if you had a place in mind. Hm, well let\u2019s go see Lieutenant Ampren. There were a few people who wanted to meet you when you got here and he was one of them.\u201d Serene started heading off in one direction and you grew curious with how things were here. \u201cSo I never asked this before, but what\u2019s crime like here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell to be honest crime almost doesn\u2019t exist here. People don\u2019t usually try to steal, murders really can\u2019t happen, and any of those other crimes never happen. The most common thing we have to deal with is fighting, but that\u2019s not really a problem.\u201d \u201cSo there\u2019s basically no crime. But how? And if there\u2019s no crime, then why have police officers?\u201d \u201cWell as kids we were told that if we were to even think evil thoughts, Arceus would come for us. As to how true that is, I don\u2019t know but it obviously works. Besides with leaders like Arceus, Rayquaza, or anyone else of that status, there\u2019s no way a crime could happen. They would know about it before it happens. As for police, the most common thing they take care of is unnecessary fights.\u201d \u201cUnnecessary?\u201d \u201cYeah. Here if you have a problem with someone you can physically fight it out, but you have to let them know first. Otherwise it\u2019s considered unnecessary.\u201d \u201cOh I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Serene was standing in front of a single story building with double barred windows. Serene pushed the door open. She carefully walked in and looked around. The building seemed to be divided into two halves: the prison cells and the officers\u2019 rooms. Serene obviously veered towards the rooms and stopped at the first room. The nameplate above the door read Nikola Ampren. Inside was a fairly empty office with very few things other than a desk and some cabinets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Serene peeked in, then moved onto the next room, which belonged to a Thomas Flame. Behind the desk sat a fairly large Arcanine who seemed focused on his work. That is however until Serene knocked on the door frame. He looked up and they talked for what seemed like ages. You quit listening and started to look around the room and noticed a picture that had Tom, whom could be assumed a s his wife, and two daughters, one an Arcanine and the other a Growlithe. The youngest Arcanine looked familiar, but you couldn\u2019t put your finger on where you had seen her before. \u201cRoy, this is Mr. Flame, second in command.\u201d You looked ahead and there he was standing in front of you. \u201cHowdy Roy. I\u2019m Tom.\u201d You reached both hands to shake his finger. \u201cI\u2019m sure you noticed that family photo. That\u2019s me, my daughters Marie and Violet, and my wife Diana.\u201d That\u2019s when you remembered the Arcanine, Violet was in your science class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell I\u2019ll see you later. Go see the chief. He\u2019s been an eager Bidoof about meeting Roy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh, okay. Bye.\u201d With that Serene left Mr. Flame\u2019s presence and walked towards Lt. Ampren\u2019s room. She stood in the doorway and knocked. \u201cEy! Who be knocking at me door?\u201d The Lieutenant looked up from the papers which he had been so focused and smiled when he saw Serene. \u201cWell if it ain\u2019t the lucky lass Serene. You bring the little lad with you?\u201d Serene, flashing a gentle smile, gently nods in approval. \u201cWell what are you doing standing there. Let me see him.\u201d Serene took a seat across from the chief and carefully picked you up with her hand. She set you on the desk and you stood there. The chief stuck his head in real close and carefully examined you. \u201cHe be a wee little lad. You got to be delicate, but I see he\u2019s in your careful hands.\u201d He then shifted his attention from Serene to you. \u201cHello there Roy. My name is Marco. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d He reached a finger out for you to shake. You shook with both hands the finger of the older Manectric. Indeed he wasn\u2019t exactly young. His yellow hair appeared faded and his voice sounded like an old Scottish man. \u201cI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re a respectable human. I would hate to try and arrest someone your size. I probably should let you two be on your way. Lots to do, the two of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell it\u2019s nice to see you again, Lt. Ampren. We\u2019ll let you get back to what you were doing.\u201d You climb on Serene\u2019s shoulder, then up to her head. \u201cPlease. I rarely get work anymore. The only case I\u2019ve had for months was with that Shiftry child and that barely had any involvement on my part. Come by again sometime. It\u2019s nice to see non-officers come here. I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene backed away and as she turned around, she collided with another Manectric. You weren\u2019t at all prepared and fell off her head. You fell for a ways before grasping onto her hair. However the silkiness of her hair made it hard to stay in one place or climb up. Eventually you came to a stop and just held on, knowing any other movements could make you fall even further. \u201cSorry about that Serene.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s alright Nikola. We\u2019ll see you later.\u201d \u201cYep. Bye.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene got moving again and she hadn\u2019t even noticed your absence from atop her head.<br>\r\nWhen she had gotten outside, you decided this was enough hanging around for a while and you started to shout to her. However she quickly turned her head and her hair flipped sending you even farther down her hair. Eventually your yelling told her you were in her hair. Her hair become surrounded in a pink and almost seemed to be combing through it and when it came to you, the aura seemed to dissipate and surround you. You were lifted to her open hands. \u201cAre you okay?!\u201d You took a second to catch your breath, then answered. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure.\u201d \u201cWell let\u2019s go grab some of that creamed ice I promised.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene started walking towards an area of the town that had what appeared to be a lot of stores. She walks into one with a hanging sign that had what appeared to be ice cream on it. She walks in and behind the counter stood a Miltank. \u201cSerene, is that you hon? Ain\u2019t it just a pleasure to see you.\u201d \u201cHi Bertha. I had some free time and decided to come see you.\u201d \u201cWell ain\u2019t that just sweet. You think you can come over here and let me see your little partner?\u201d Serene walked over to the counter and set you down on it. Bertha looked you all over and showed extreme signs of adoration and curiosity. \u201cAin\u2019t you just the cutest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Hank, get out here and see the human.\u201d \u201cNo. I am just as happy back here sticking to my work.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t mind him. He\u2019s just paranoid bout humans. I don\u2019t know why. Now let me get you something for coming round to see me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at the wall and noticed flavors marked in chalk on what appeared to be a blackboard, but they were all were based on berries. \u201cSo what can I get you two?\u201d \u201cHow about Hondew?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get that for you, free of course.\u201d \u201cThanks Bertha.\u201d Bertha went to a back room and after a few moments, came back with an orange colored drink. \u201cI\u2019d love to sit and chat, but I\u2019ve got other things to take care of. Enjoy it and maybe I\u2019ll see you both another time.\u201d Bertha handed the drink over to Serene and headed to the back room again. Serene sat down at a table and took a little sip. Serene poured a little onto the table just so you could get a taste. You put your hands together and drank it from your hands. But you quickly froze after it had hit your mouth. You recognized this pain in your head as brain freeze and the drink as a slushy. The flavor however was good, but as you looked over to Serene the glass only had a little of the pink substance left. But you weren\u2019t sure what was going on for a second. The full glass had just hit the bottom and barely any time had passed. Also something else didn\u2019t seem right, but you couldn\u2019t put your finger on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let\u2019s get going since you\u2019re not going to have any.\u201d Serene said in a disappointed tone. You weren\u2019t sure why she sounded the way she did, but you went along with it. After what felt like hours, she arrived at home and went straight to her room. She set you down on the desk and went to her bed. You went into the house and booted up the computer. After typing the report on how the day went, a response was sent with an attachment. \u201cRoy we have recently established multiple channels of acquaintances which you may be able to speak to at your leisure.\u201d You opened the list and organized the names on your desktop. A voice yelled up the stairs, \u201cSerene, it\u2019s time to eat.\u201d Serene stood outside the house, sat the school newspaper outside the house and looked in. \u201cWell come on. Let\u2019s go grab a bite to eat before it\u2019s all gone. \u201cUm Serene, is it alright if I don\u2019t eat? I just got a list of people from back home who I\u2019d like to talk to and if I talk to them now, we have more time for us to talk later.\u201d \u201cThat sounds like a great idea. I\u2019ll see if I can bring the food up here.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You watched Serene go down the stairs and returned yours eyes to the screen. But as you did, the pains you had been having shot across your body again. They seemed to be growing worse, but you couldn\u2019t be sure. Eventually they settled down and when they did, you opened a chat with your parents. \u201cHello.\u201d You called out and waited for a response. Strangely you felt a hand on your shoulder and you rolled away from it. But as you looked, you saw it was Serene, but she was your size. Your face froze up and you were left absolutely dumbfounded. \u201cWhat\u2026 Oh I didn\u2019t tell you I knew Minimize, did I?\u201d You just shook your head. \u201cWell surprise!\u201d You were somewhat surprised by Serene\u2019s voice. It sounded like it did when you were talking via the web instead of how deep it was in reality. Serene put a dish of colorful cubes on the floor and you popped one into your mouth. It had a mildly spicy flavor to it. \u201cWe call them Wonder Bites.\u201d Serene sat by your side and talked to everyone that you could talk to. Everyone back home seemed to like her, though it was hard to tell with the looks they gave her. Perhaps her nearly bare body threw them for a twist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you talked to everyone back home and it felt good to at least see their faces. Now the exhaustion was kicking in and you felt very drowsy. Serene obviously felt the same way and after she took the dish with her out the door she returned to her normal size. You shut the computer off, got into some lounging clothes, and walked out the door. Serene was already lying in her bed and she psychically lifted you over to her. However after she set you down on the pillow, she shrunk once again to your size. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d You asked. \u201cWell I wanted see how warm you are at least for tonight.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a great guardian.\u201d You whisper into her ears. She however had already fallen asleep. You laid down and tried to sleep, but the pains you had been feeling came back again, worse than before. After what felt like hours they settled down and you fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were asleep, the strangest thing happened. You felt like you woke up and it was a week after you had come to this world, then a strange sensation crossed your body and you were back to when you had first arrived. This pattern of almost time-traveling continued until you woke up for good. You tried to push yourself up and realized you were laying on Serene\u2019s breast. She had apparently returned to her normal size sometime in the night. You climbed up to her head and rubbed the gem on her head. Eventually she stirred and you whispered in her ear \u201cSo how did you sleep last night?\u201d \u201cThe same as any other night. Why would it be any different?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you remember? You made yourself my size and we slept that way.\u201d She giggled. \u201cYou sure are silly. I think you ate too many of those spicy Wonder Bites last night.\u201d She set you down on the floor next to your bathroom and she walked to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You got in and showered up, but got lost deep in thought. \u2018We did sleep at the same size, right? We had to have. I mean she did want to see what it was like and I did say she was a great guardian. I\u2019m not going crazy am I?\u2019 You finished the shower and got dressed. After Serene came to get you and brought you downstairs. She quickly ate the food her mother had made and took off towards the school without her siblings. The walk seemed much quicker than it usually did. However before she opened the doors, three Pokemon walked out, those three being  Suicune, and Entei, and Raikou.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo can we assume that you are Miss Variform and on your shoulder is Mister Roy?\u201d The Entei asked. Serene nodded her head. \u201cVery well then. Let\u2019s go inside and discuss details so we don\u2019t have issues today.\u201d The Entei led with the Suicune and Raikou following closely behind. They kept walking until they arrived at a small room labeled Teachers Lounge. Everyone took a seat, with the three legends sitting across from Serene. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Blaze walked in and sat beside Serene just as Serene set you on the table and Entei started to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that everyone we need is here, let\u2019s begin. First off, Roy, I am Entei, to my right is Suicune, and to my left is Raikou. We, as you probably already have figured out, are part of the government of this world. As such, we will be the ones who will be supervising you today and if necessary in the future, the ones who you may contact if you need assistance or to speak with someone of higher authority. I will be with Mrs. Blaze discussing policies and things enforced throughout the school. Raikou will be walking through every other room and inspecting the safety. Suicune will be following you and Ms. Variform around to survey you personally. Do you have any questions?\u201d No one spoke a word. \u201cVery well. Let\u2019s get started then, shall we?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stood up and departed for their specific locations. However, along with Suicune came Raikou who in fact passed Serene and came around to her front. \u201cMs. Variform, would you guide me to your classes so that I may inspect them first?\u201d Serene complied and showed him all the classes and afterwards returned to Mr. Shartney\u2019s classroom. She was going to take her seat, but Suicune asked her to move to the back corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit back here. That way we\u2019re out of the way of the class and we can talk if need be. So can I assume that you two are going out with each other?\u201d \u201cYes we are.\u201d \u201cWell that\u2019s a sign that you two get along well with each other. How are things at home Serene?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re good and safe, but why are you calling me Serene and not Ms. Variform?\u201d \u201cWe try to be informal whenever possible. However we have to be professional most of the time.\u201d After a few more minutes of conversing, the class started to fill with students. The class started and Mr. Shartney gave his lecture, but he was more cautioned with his words than usual. The class passed quickly and Serene stood up and left, with Suicune following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the halls was quite the spectacle because everyone watched Suicune and the students were splitting like a knife through butter. Serene arrived at Battle Applications class and sat along the wall. She set you on the ground and Suicune stood beside where she sat. Eventually Mrs. Taoshen began the class and started organizing battles. You started to get the pains again and sat down yourself, just about the same time Serene was called to have a double battle with Alana against Jake and Blake. Suicune sat down and scooped you in her hands. She was sitting with her knees up and set you on one of her knees. \u201cOkay Roy. Now we need to talk alone. Has anything bad happened to you while in Serene\u2019s protection?\u201d \u201cUh n-no\u201d \u201cRoy you have to be completely honest with me right now. We need to make sure that nothing happens with you.\u201d \u201cNo nothing has happened.\u201d \u201cOkay. Do you like being with Serene? If you don\u2019t like being with her, we can get you someone else.\u201d \u201cNo I like Serene so far. She\u2019s very protective and kind.\u201d \u201cHave you had any pains or aches that come out of the blue?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cYou have?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune\u2019s face partially lost its calm composure and she picked you off her knee, then walked out of the room after telling Mrs. Taoshen to send Serene when she finished. Suicune held you in cupped hands as she walked into Mrs. Blaze\u2019s office to which Entei swiftly turned around. \u201cWhat seems to be the problem?\u201d He questioned. \u201cRoy seems to be suffering as Palkia thought he might. I\u2019m going to take him out to see him, then go and get Ms. Variform.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d Entei answered. Suicune walked out and you started to panic a bit. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d You asked. \u201cEverything should be fine since we\u2019ve found this out now. Just be patient and let Palkia answer your questions.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went outside and there sat Palkia. \u201cAh Suicune. I see you have Roy in your hands. I assume that means\u2026\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOkay. Hand him over to me and go fetch Serene.\u201d \u201cI will.\u201d Suicune took off after a few minutes brought back Serene. Palkia handed you to Serene. \u201cIs everything alright, Mr. Palkia?\u201d \u201cPlease just call me Palkia. To answer question though, no. However right now the danger is not severe.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Palkia seemed to collect his thoughts before he answered. \u201cWell Roy right now has been suffering from what I call Transdimensionalism. Basically, his coming here has created a ripple in space and time, which has been causing him some pains. Just as well he may not truly be here.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean by that? And what\u2019s causing these ripples?\u201d \u201cRoy isn\u2019t from our planet and coming from his world has created some ripples which distort the fabrics of time and space.  Due to his small size though, while he most certainly feels them, we don\u2019t notice them at all. Back to what I said about not being here, the effects of these ripples are time not moving at the proper rate and him jumping between dimensions.\u201d \u201cWhat? Can you explain that for me please? I\u2019m not understanding it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOf course I can. It\u2019s not an easy concept to grasp. Basically a ripple in time causes time to move improperly. For example, a second for us may be a day for him or one year for us might only be seconds for him. Dimensionally, he moves between worlds exactly the same as this one but with minor changes, and he does this without even noticing he has.\u201d \u201cHow many different dimensions can he go through?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. It could be as few as two or over nine thousand. However, I can solve all these problems, but...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Both you and Serene flinched at those words. \u201cDoes he really have to return home? Can\u2019t he stay here?\u201d Serene questioned. \u201cAlthough I would like him to remain here so I know how he affects our dimension, it is too dangerous. If we manipulated the wrong region, it may do permanent harm to Roy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoy, I as well as Dialga work as quickly to fix this problem. I tell you some other things are home.\u201d You were about to question what he just said, but after realizing it probably a bit of dimensional fluctuations. \u201cAre you ready Roy?\u201d \u201cI think so. Am I ready Serene?\u201d \u201cI guess. He is coming back right?\u201d \u201cAs soon as we amend what\u2019s causing the issue, he\u2019ll be back before you know it. Once he\u2019s back though, there will be things we need to discuss.\u201d Palkia stated. \u201cOk. Well I\u2019ll see you when you get back.\u201d Serene said as she gave you a hug. \u201cYep. Don\u2019t have too much fun without me.\u201d You said coyly as you winked at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia slashed at the air and it seemed to rip with his claws. The hole had a dark blue and purple color to it and beyond that it was cylindrically rotating. Serene held her hand to the portal. You jumped into it and within a few seconds, the shifting tunnel had ended and you landed on something. You pushed yourself and saw you were back home, laying in your bed. You rolled over and tried to sit up, but it was difficult like someone was holding you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoy, I assume you have arrived safely. I will close this portal until we have everything fixed over here. When I open this portal back up, you will need to come through as soon as you are able.\u201d Palkia\u2019s voice faded out and soon you were alone. You laid there and looked at a nearby clock. 9:21. All you could imagine was what you were going to do in the time it would take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid in your bed until it was about twelve. You got up and ate a bowl of cereal. With each spoonful, you thought about all the happenings with Serene. With all the problems going, what actually happened?  Also with the time distortions, what has already happened and what was yet to come? You felt a certain hopelessness creep over you. You returned to your room and slept the day away, trying to rid yourself of the sorrowed thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoy? Roy, are you there? Roy!?\u201d You mumbled sounds as you woke up and looked around<br>\r\n and saw the familiar portal with Palkia\u2019s voice emanating from it. You got up and in a groggy state, stumbled into the portal. Upon ending up in Serene\u2019s world, you landed in her hands and fell over from a lack of balance. \u201cThere you are. Now that everyone is here, let\u2019s get things in order.\u201d Palkia stood beside Dialga along with Mrs. Blaze, Raikou, Entei, and Suicune. Palkia and Dialga went into the teacher\u2019s lounge. Serene and Mrs. Blaze sat on one side and everyone else was on the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay we\u2019ll try to make this quick. We\u2019ve all go to things to do. Let\u2019s start with the school\u2019s status, then move on from there.\u201d Dialga finished and looked down to Entei. \u201cThe school\u2019s policies are in order. They apply well to all students.\u201d Entei finished and Raikou started afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe teaching staff does seem to acknowledge Roy as a student and accept him. Despite a few accounts of prejudice towards humans, they should not endanger either Roy or his education. As for the classrooms, there were some concerns concerning the upper level science classes as well as the kitchen and battle-type classes. However as long as Mrs. Variform does as she should and cares for Roy, all will be well\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for the two personally, they most certainly work well together and show great care for each other. The participation in classes could not be completely observed, but from what I saw, he did pay attention. I will have to return at a later date.\u201d \u201cVery well Suicune. Come back the beginning of next week. Everyone dismissed.\u201d Everyone got up and as Serene stood up, Palkia made a gesture for her to sit down and she did. \u201cSorry, but you can\u2019t leave just yet.  We still must discuss a few things.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo begin with, Roy, are you feeling well?\u201d \u201cUh Yes.\u201d \u201cHow good?\u201d \u201cAbout how I felt back in my world.\u201d \u201cExcellent. Dialga and I worked to the best we could without causing damage to everyone else. However, all of us leaders decided that for the next three school days, you will have some changes just to check that all is well. For example, you won\u2019t be coming to school tomorrow, just to make sure if there are any additional problems they are just with you. The following day Serene will match her size to yours and you both will be traveling with someone else.  Suicune will be observing you both as of Monday of next week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Palkia asked questions regarding your experiences and such relating to transdimensionalism. After he was done asking about that, he started talking about the effects of it. \u201cSo, I think I need to finish my explanation. However I think you both should ask me questions rather than me ramble on.\u201d Serene immediately shot a question out. \u201cSo if he has been to multiple dimensions, why does he act normal as if he has been in one place the whole time?\u201d \u201cBecause he crosses dimensions that are almost perfectly aligned. For example, if you took a bite out of a sandwich right now and he changed dimensions, the changes wouldn\u2019t be always easily noticeable. You might have taken a smaller bite or bit in a different place or maybe even taken more than one bite. I\u2019m sure there have been more significant changes but he probably ignored them or didn\u2019t notice them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if that happens, how does it affect him?\u201d \u201cWell it really screws with his mind. He may remember things from a different dimension that did not happen here or just the opposite. He may know and experienced things that are yet to come or he may have forgotten all that happened mere seconds ago. Like with these pains he may experience them the first time but is sure he has had them before, which is why you both need to pay the most attention to the fine details from now on. Also I think it is best if you both check what has and hasn\u2019t happened so far, for the sake of Roy\u2019s sanity.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene gave a puzzled look.\u201d \u201cWhy can\u2019t you ask Mr. Dialga to send him back to when he first came here so he knows it all?\u201d \u201cBecause we don\u2019t want to mess with the fabrics of time or space too much for now. It is safer and quicker if you just fill him in. Do either of you have any other questions?\u201d Neither of you said a word. \u201cVery well then. You both may go home now.\u201d Both you and Serene said farewell and she walked home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene walked into her room and set you down outside the model house. She shrank herself to your size and walked in with you into the house. \u201cSo where do you wanna start?\u201d Serene asked as she sat on the floor beside where you had decided to sit. \u201cI don\u2019t really know. And since I don\u2019t know where to start, I guess we have to go back to the beginning.\u201d You said as you buried your face in your palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? You\u2019ve felt different since you got back.\u201d You took a gentle breath. \u201cI\u2019ve just been thinking about all that\u2019s been happening and realizing for all I know, I\u2019ve been living a lie. I guess\u2026 it\u2019s just a feeling of hopelessness.\u201d She looked you in the face. \u201cMaybe, but let\u2019s read a little further into the book before we close it and toss it away.\u201d You stood up and helped her up. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would do without you.\u201d She turned away with red cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou powered up your laptop, sent a quick summary to your government and started writing down events in the order they happened. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Serene asked as you sat down once again. \u201cWriting all the things that have happened since I\u2019ve gotten here. That way, when I have them all written, you can go through the list and say what didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Serene just wrapped her arms around you. \u201cI love you so much Roy.\u201d You stopped typing to give her a kiss. \u201cI know. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t take such good care of me. I love you too Serene.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished the list and handed the computer to Serene. She opened a side column and started writing in her own things, some of which she gasped and took a moment before she started writing again. Finally she handed the laptop back to you.  You gaze at it and that sense of hopelessness floods over you again. Over half the things you had experienced did not happen here. Mr. Necroen did not get his way and you were to stay with Serene through homeroom as well as remain in standard apparel. The throwing test never happened due to safety conditions. Many other things were different, but the one that caught your attention the most was with Serene\u2019s brothers. Rather than just threatening you, they carried out their actions and your mind went mad, because you couldn\u2019t believe how intense it must\u2019ve actually felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head fell back against the wall. You were basically dead: motionless, breathless and speechless. The hopelessness had overcome you. Serene cuddled up to you and tried to comfort you. Shortly afterwards, Matt walked in through the open door and called for Serene. She walked out and whispered to Matt outside the house. You couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying, but it what did it matter? It probably was talk about you or something the past few days. Matt set a plate of food outside the house and left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed a bite to eat and sat in the house. \u201cSerene, I\u2019m not saying this because of you or something you\u2019ve done, but I\u2019m going to sleep here tonight. I love you.\u201d She walked in and gave you a hug. \u201cLove you too. Things will get better. Just wait.\u201d She walked out and after returning to her normal size, laid in her bed. You got in some lounging clothes, put down some of your thicker clothing like a bed and tried to get comfortable. \u201cYeah maybe.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You rolled around on the floor of the model house and propped yourself up on your arms.  You got up, stretched, and looked to Serene\u2019s bed, but saw it empty. However through the door walked Ashley and she looked into the house. \u201cRoy, are you in there?\u201d She whispered, while scanning the house\u2019s interior with one eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m right here\u201d You say, walking a little closer. \u201cOkay, well get ready. Serene\u2019s not herself today, so I think I\u2019ll take you, if that\u2019s okay with you.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to school today, under Palkia and Dialga\u2019s orders. But what\u2019s wrong with Serene?\u201d \u201cWell. Um\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley gets cut off as Serene crouches to get through the door and she immediately starts yelling at Ashley, screaming for no apparent reason, like the Serene you had met faded and was replaced by this larger Espeon. You retreated back into the house and watched as Serene almost threw Ashley out of her room. You then watched as Serene smacked her brothers around and yelled at all of them, again for no reason. You waited until every member of the family, including her parents, had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You headed to the bathroom, and afterwards you scrambled back up the desk. You opened your computer and went out to the window to let it charge, since it ran on solar power and you hadn\u2019t used it too much or charged it since you arrived.  In the process of letting it charge, two separate chat rooms sessions were requested. One of them was the government demanding a better description of the past few day\u2019s events and the other was Morgan Karlyle, your eighth grade girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You went on talking between the two, but neither one was pleasant, with the government yelling \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d is not a valid answer to why can\u2019t you better explain what has happened and Morgan wanting to go back out with you, even though when you both went out, she paid you no mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour of frustration and irritation, you took the battery out of your computer, put it back in, and left the computer to charge on the windowsill.  You ran your fingers through your hair and took a deep breath. You went from the window to your house, and from there you climbed up to the roof. You laid down and calmed yourself, taking slow breaths and not thinking a thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the time came for lunch and you felt pretty calm, so you slid off the roof and landed smoothly on the desk. You then slid to the floor and that\u2019s when the scale of this operation. All the area you had to cover and those stairs, not to mention if you could get to the food. You climbed back up the desk and searched through your bags for a little tool you seriously thought about not bringing, but decided in the end it was probably better to have it: A complete multi-tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou once at the stairs. After a few minutes you stood atop the beginning step and looked down. Even with the carpet, the fall was too great and there was no form of rope in this world. You look up and see the hand rail. Seeing it as no more than a giant slide, you climb one of the vertical bars and maneuver over the rail itself. After lining up as best as you could, you slide down the railing and when the time came you needed to slow down, you forced your feet onto the railing. You ended up near the end and slid down the bar there. The bar reached the floor and you started walking towards the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter quite a few minutes, you reached the kitchen. You walk over to a counter and climb it. Once on top of the counter, you notice a shred of something blue. Upon closer examination, you realize that this thing was part of some berry, but in proportion, was probably a mere crumb. You tried to take bite, but the berry was a bit too firm to merely nibble off of. After checking around to make sure there was nothing simpler, you went back to the berry and flipped out the knife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery little bit tasted delicious despite its tough form. After climbing down, you walk back to the stairs. You took a deep breath and headed toward the steps. You grabbed the fiber of the carpet steps and slowly climbed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter quite a climb, you reached the top and walked into Serene\u2019s room. You checked the time and realized it took two and a half hours to go down and back. You tottered into the house and laid down, feeling exhausted from the adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you knew, you were awoken. You mumbled words that were impossible to comprehend, but the angry tone was easily understood. \u201cCome on. We got stuff to do.\u201d You roll over and see Matt through the window hole. \u201cWhat\u2019s this stuff that needs to be done that requires my presence?\u201d \u201cWould you quit screwing around and come on?! We can\u2019t keep Mr. Arceus waiting!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were filled with curiosity. Why would Arceus show up here? Why was Matt in such a rush? Why was he acting like you should know all of this? You climbed on his hand and waited for the answers to all this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you went downstairs and in what could be called the dining area. On one side of the table sat Arceus and Mew. On the other side sat Andrew and Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh. Mr. Roy, what a pleasure to meet you in person.\u201d Matt set you down and you walked a little closer. Giving a bow, you said \u201cAs it is a great pleasure to meet the both of you.\u201d Mew whispered to Arceus, and he shook his head. \u201cNot right now, my dear. We have business to attend to first.\u201d Mew looked a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm Arceus, if I may speak please, I have a question.\u201d  \u201cGo ahead.\u201d \u201cPardon me, but I have no idea as to why we are gathered here.\u201d \u201cHm is it that you were not informed or is it your condition?\u201d \u201cI would believe it is my condition. These three act as though I were informed.\u201d Greg lowered his head and whispered words in angry, yet silent tone. \u201cAh but Greg he\u2019s done and experienced things you haven\u2019t. I suggest you watch your tongue before I find a way to silence it.\u201d Greg recoiled and lowered his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoy, I believe Palkia advised you to take time and divide the false from the truth. Did you accept his advice?\u201d \u201cI did, and I understand the basics of the past events. However, some details have been lost.\u201d \u201cThat is understandable. I arranged to discuss tonight the severity of Andrew\u2019s, Greg\u2019s and Matt\u2019s actions, as well as a suitable punishment.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus then went over the entire event and described it in more detail than Serene had. You listened to Arceus with deep focus. Then he finished and looked at you. \u201cSo, Roy, what do you feel is a worthy punishment?\u201d You sat and thought for a few brief moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe there should be no punishment.\u201d Everyone reacted with shock. \u201cIf I may ask Roy, what would cause you to make such a statement?\u201d \u201cYou do not need my permission to ask a question. You are greater than I. My reasoning is simple, yet complex. What I suffered was not in this dimension, so to punish them for that is not just because they did not do that. To punish them for what truly happened cannot be done because I have no recollection whatsoever, as if it never happened. Thus I believe they can\u2019t be punished.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus meditated on your reasoning for a little while before responding. \u201cI accept your reasoning, even if it is odd. Roy has spoken and no punishment shall be given. I ask that you three leave this room for a moment.\u201d They all obeyed and fled upstairs. \u201cYes, that is better. Now we may speak alone. I assume your stay here has been pleasant.\u201d \u201cWhat I experienced it has, even if it my experience does not exist here.\u201d \u201cI apologize for such a predicament. Had we known, we most certainly would have stopped it early.\u201d \u201cI understand. I don\u2019t think it could have been stopped even if time were put back to that first day.\u201d \u201cPerhaps you are right. I am glad that you were chosen as the human that was to be sent over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew started nudging at Arceus and gave him longing eyes. He sighed. \u201cRoy may I introduce my wife, Mew.\u201d You gave her a bow and after smiling back, enclosed you in a bubble. She giggled and after Arceus gave her a dirty look, she lowered the bubble to the table and made it pop.  After a bit more conversation, Arceus and Mew decided they should leave. \u201cTo you three brothers, I suggest you give Roy the utmost care and respect, because next time, not even him and his mercy will be able to spare you.\u201d With that Arceus and Mew walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were sitting on the table, a little surprise coursed through you at Arceus\u2019s words. Slowly Andrew, Greg, and Matt walked up the stairs.  \u201cHey there. Nice guy Arceus is.\u201d \u201cYou mind if we have a talk with you, in the basement?\u201d You gave a face of resentment. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you said the last time, and isn\u2019t that how this whole thing started.\u201d \u201cOkay sorry. We promise not to harm you.\u201d  \u201cAnd you told Serene you weren\u2019t going to hurt me the first time around either if I am correct.\u201d All three looked away and had a defeated expression they wore. You sighed and took a minute to think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate you guys. I really don\u2019t but now that I realize you went farther than what I saw, I need to be cautious. And Arceus was right by saying to watch your actions. If anything goes wrong from now on, the sole option may be to take me away from Serene, no matter if it\u2019s aggressive or not. I would be hurt and you know she would be destroyed inside. So here\u2019s your chance to make it up. Let\u2019s go downstairs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took you downstairs and you instantly noticed the relaxing atmosphere. They set you on Andrew\u2019s desk and began questioning all about your \u201ccondition\u201d. You explained it all and made them understand it. It had grown so late that you decided to sleep on Andrew\u2019s desk rather than risking it with Serene. So on that hard wood grain, you curled up and fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

You struggled to prop yourself up, but instantly recognized you weren\u2019t on Andrew\u2019s desk anymore.  Rather you were on a bed and looked to see Serene\u2019s desk. You looked around and noticed no sign of Serene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t there, for at that moment she, at your size, cuddled up with you from behind. You tried to break loose, but she had a tight grip. \u201cWhy are you trying break free?\u201d \u201cCause I wanna know what happened yesterday before I settle in with you.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m back to normal and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d \u201cSerene, it does matter. What happened to you?\u201d \u201cNo it really was nothing.\u201d  \u201cSerene\u2026\u201d \u201cI mean it. Just forget abo-.\u201d \u201cSERENE!\u201d Her grip became weak and her arms felt limp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relaxed and let out a deep sigh. You then rolled over and looked her in the eyes. \u201cSerene, I\u2019m sorry. I really am. But I need to know what happened, and no excuse is going to make me stop asking.\u201d She turned a light red and broke eye contact. \u201cBut it\u2019s\u2026 personal.\u201d You took a moment to think of what to say. \u201cSerene, what am I?\u201d \u201cUm\u2026 My boyfriend, a student, a human?\u201d \u201cThere, the last one. A human. And what are humans known for here?\u201d She didn\u2019t answer. \u201cYou know the answer. You have embarrassment. I have shame. Could you please tell me now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and whispered in your ear. \u201cI was on my period.\u201d \u201cYou were embarrassed to tell me that?\u201d \u201cWhy do you act like that?\u201d You wrapped her in your arms. \u201cYou have no control over that, so you shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed. Besides I learned all about that this summer, just with human women.\u201d \u201cYou learned that already?!\u201d \u201cSerene let\u2019s be honest. I\u2019m about the size of one of your teeth. Don\u2019t you think it may important that I know all about the body before I deal with one as big as yours?\u201d She just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You stood up and as she was about to, you picked her up in your arms. She seemed a bit surprised, but nonetheless enjoyed it. You gave her a kiss, set her down and made your way to the bathroom while downstairs someone had just come inside the house. You were in the middle of showering when someone started talking to Serene, but you couldn\u2019t tell who because of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You finished up and after stepping out into the open, you saw it was Vienna. You waved as you started to climb up Serene\u2019s desk. Vienna set Serene down and Serene came in just as you were putting on your shirt. \u201cCome on Roy. Vienna is waiting for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Serene climbed onto Vienna\u2019s hand. \u201cSo how do I carry you both?\u201d Vienna questioned before she even moved a step. \u201cWell, I usually have Roy either on my shoulder or on the top of my head. Where do you want to be?\u201d You weren\u2019t sure where was better. \u201cI guess let\u2019s take the top of your head. We can see everything up there and we\u2019re out your way Vienna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBut aren\u2019t you afraid of falling off and \u2026 dying?\u201d \u201cVienna, we\u2019ll be fine. Serene picked you because she believes in you. I believe in her and you. Besides, Dialga would make sure that would never happen. Trust me. But before we go up top, could we go grab some food? I\u2019m really hungry and I got no food last night.\u201d \u201cOf course. But did you eat lunch yesterday?\u201d \u201cYes. After going into the kitchen, I found some remnants on the counter.\u201d \u201cHow long did it take you?\u201d Serene asks. \u201cAround two and a half hours. It was climb up that took so much time.\u201d \u201cWell, let\u2019s get going then.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVienna coupled one hand over the other, trapping you and Serene between her palms. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty nervous, isn\u2019t she?\u201d You whisper to Serene. \u201cI pulled it on her just this morning. I really wasn\u2019t in an asking mood yesterday and\u2026 it\u2019s a long story. Besides she\u2019s worried about her abilities, because you\u2019re so small and delicate.\u201d \u201cHm, she wasn\u2019t this nervous a few days ago.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a long story. Longer than yours.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVienna\u2019s hand moved away and she was now sitting at the table with the rest of Serene\u2019s table. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s alright if I eat with all of you?  I don\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay Vienna. We don\u2019t mind. Besides you\u2019re keeping a seat from being empty and you\u2019re taking care of our little girl.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to hold back the laughs. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Serene asked with a piercing eye. \u201cI thought it was kind of punny, given the circumstances.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll always be my little man.\u201d \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t want it any other way.\u201d Everyone started to grab a little bit of food. Serene slowly walked toward the food on Vienna\u2019s plate, head turning every direction possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d You asked Serene. \u201cWell it\u2019s just that, even though I\u2019ve been small before, everything just looks so different this time.\u201d \u201cWell if you think this is different, wait until we\u2019re on top of her head.\u201d She eventually grabbed some food and ate with you. After a while, both of you stopped. \u201cIt\u2019s so weird saying this,\u201d Serene uttered, \u201cbut I can\u2019t finish half a glass of juice.\u201d \u201cIt gets better, babe. You get a free ride, you can\u2019t do any work, and you spend time around someone that\u2019s pretty awesome. Usually it\u2019s you, but in this case it\u2019s Vienna.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVienna and everyone else got up and after saying some words, left to get to school. However, both you and Serene were back to being in Vienna\u2019s hands. \u201cVienna, why are you aren\u2019t letting us on top your head?\u201d No response. You grumbled a bit. \u201cVIENNA!!\u201d She slowly lifted her hands so she could hear and see you. \u201cYes?\u201d \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we on your head?\u201d \u201cWell I just felt you both were better off in my hands. I can see you that way.\u201d \u201cVienna, we\u2019ll be fine. Just put us up there and that way you have two hands free.\u201d \u201cSorry, but no.\u201d With that she lowered you once again. You turned to Serene. \u201cWhy won\u2019t she listen to me? I\u2019m being nice and she does only have two hands, unless she\u2019s somehow psychic.\u201d \u201cI think she\u2019s just too afraid of if something goes wrong.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Vienna arrived in her first class of the day.  She sat down and set you two on the desk. As you looked ahead, you recognized the teacher as Mr. Lupinel. \u201cSo, am I right in assuming this is a writing course?\u201d \u201cYes you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOkay. Well, I just want you to know that sometime during the class, I WILL end up on your head and by the end of the day we all WILL be perfectly fine.\u201d \u201cI really would rather you not. I don\u2019t want anything to happen to you.\u201d \u201cVienna, I\u2019ve not fallen off Serene\u2019s head yet, or at least I don\u2019t think I have. I promise Serene and I will be fine. Just have faith.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout that time Mr. Lupinel starting walking towards Vienna. \u201cVienna, may I ask with whom you are talking to?\u201d \u201cRoy and Serene, sir.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d He crept closer and took a close look at you and Serene. \u201cIndeed it is. Good to see you both again. Did you drop by for a little literature lesson?\u201d You chuckled and Serene shook her head. \u201cYou could say that. So what are we learning today?\u201d \u201cI never told you when you were in the class so you would not try to get too far ahead. It shall be the same now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He returned to the front and continued whatever he was doing up there. A few minutes later and after all the kids had poured into the class, the bell rang. Mr. Lupinel then began the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then analyzed Vienna\u2019s fur and amount of focus. You went over by Serene and whispered your plan of climbing Vienna. Although she didn\u2019t want to go against her friend\u2019s decision, she went with it, hoping it was for the better. You both reached the top of Vienna\u2019s head with no trouble. After reaching the top, you thanked Serene for going along with you and she met you with a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up and after moving close to one of Vienna\u2019s ears, you playfully said to Serene \u201cWell we made it to the top of Vienna. It looks I\u2019m king of the Ninetales and you\u2019re my queen.\u201d After giving a second for Vienna to react, you spoke once again. \u201cI\u2019m kidding Vienna. I never would want to rule over anyone and I think same is true for anyone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the class ended, but Vienna talked to you both a little before she got up. \u201cAre you sure you both are alright up there?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about us. We\u2019ll be fine\u201d You replied. \u201cSo if you do fall, what then?\u201d You were about to say something when Serene cut in. \u201cWe have plenty of options. I can use my powers, we can aim for the top of your mouth or one of your tails.\u201d \u201cBut what about the curse? Isn\u2019t that a concern or what if you miss your goals?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave Serene a look and you each headed over to an ear. You started scratching as hard as you could. Vienna obviously felt it based on her sudden loosening up. \u201cRelax Vienna. Relax. Don\u2019t think like that. If it comes to that we\u2019ll take care of it. Until then, relax and let things happen.\u201d Serene said with a very soothing voice. \u201cOK then. But maybe you can scratch my ears more at lunch? That feels good and I am taking really good care of you both.\u201d You and Serene chuckled. \u201cOf course Vienna. Why couldn\u2019t we?\u201d </span></div></div>",

But the day is not over yet. So you still need to be cautious.\u201d \u201cFair enough.\u201d You say as Vienna took her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlana came storming over to the table with her tray of food. \u201cWhere is Serene on a day like today?\u201d \u201cWhy\u2019s that Alana?\u201d Asked Stacey. \u201cBecause Jared\u2019s back and he just knocked me over! If she was here, we could double team him.\u201d \u201cDo you want me to go after him?\u201d Matthias asked in a chivalrous manner. \u201cNo. you\u2019ve already got one foot in the fire and I don\u2019t want you to have both in.\u201d The two of them started to cuddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene was about to walk over to Alana when you stopped her. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d You ask. \u201cI\u2019m going to see Alana. Why do you ask?\u201d You walked over to her. \u201cWell I don\u2019t think going over to see her like this would be the best idea.\u201d Serene got a panicked look on her face. \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cWell, for one, she and everyone else at this table are not used to seeing you so tiny. Besides she\u2019s cuddling with Matthias and probably can\u2019t even hear your telepathy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Serene\u2019s ears lowered slightly. You put your arm around her shoulder. \u201cI know you\u2019 re more durable than I am and more powerful. But I just care about you and you\u2019re at my size so I feel I know a few things.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019d like them to know I\u2019m here without Vienna telling them.\u201d You wandered around on Vienna\u2019s head and noticed the food on her tray. She had a sandwich and some berries. You got an idea and ran over to one of Vienna\u2019s ears. \u201cVienna do you mind if we play with your food a little bit?\u201d  \u201cNo I don\u2019t care.\u201d She blurted out as all the conversations stopped and everyone looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assumed she felt embarrassed. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d You whispered as you walked away. Serene stood amongst Vienna\u2019s hair. \u201cI never thought walking through hair could be such a challenge.\u201d Serene said. \u201cWell, if you women didn\u2019t take such good care of it, it would be a lot worse.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I have a way that you can get everyone\u2019s attention without the formal introduction.\u201d You said. \u201cAnd what does our lunch have to with it?\u201d She inquired. \u201cWell you see, since you\u2019re psychic, I thought maybe you could move one of those berries around and\u2026 you know. Um, surprise them.\u201d \u201cI guess that could work. Even though I really want to just go up to their ears and surprise them that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou can, but I just don\u2019t want you to get hurt. I guess I care too much.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I love you so much. Because you care about my wellbeing and not just my body. Although I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like when I have to fight.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know how much I want to run out there and stop the fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell as much as I love my friends, I\u2019m hungry and they need to know I\u2019m here. So let\u2019s have some fun.\u201d Serene prepared her psychic movements. \u201cYou\u2019re the one having fun. I can only watch and enjoy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe focused on one of the berries and pulled it from the bunch it was in. She adjusted her one hand and lifted the berry. You walked around and saw her actions. Her face was empty, her body had become lifeless, and she showed no signs of life except for the bold crimson of her eyes, minor fluctuations in the red gem on her forehead, and her hand movements. You wanted to look somewhere else, but your eyes were locked on hers. She\u2019s used her abilities before, but her eyes never held such a tone. From such pools of gentle purple to these bloodied lakes, it was so haunting. Then she looked directly into your eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d She asked, with her face still showing no emotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were paralyzed with fear. Fortunately at that moment, Rose\u2019s voice shattered the awkwardness. \u201cWhat\u2019s with that berry? Why is it floating?\u201d Everyone except Vienna scanned the entire lunchroom looking for the cause. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing anyone. You think Serene is here and this is her way of messing with us?\u201d Stacey questioned. \u201cNo. I think it\u2019s Vienna. She\u2019s not even moved at all.\u201d \u201cCome on Cecilia. I\u2019m not psychic. Besides whenever Serene does it, she moves her hands.\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019ve not said anything all lunch except for that blurt out earlier.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d Vienna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene moved the berry around the table and eventually brought it from under the table to behind Vienna\u2019s back and onto her head. You and Serene ate as much of the berry as you could. She eventually laid back and sighed. \u201cI never thought I would say this but, I\u2019m full off of half that berry.\u201d \u201cTragic, isn\u2019t it? Well it was good nonetheless.\u201d Serene sat there a few minutes, apparently thinking. \u201cWe still need to reveal ourselves. But how?\u201d You had an idea and whispered it into Serene\u2019s ear. She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether to like your creativity or fear it.\u201d \u201cOh come on. These are harmless pranks. If you\u2019re afraid of this, you\u2019ll have nightmares when I really cause trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe levitated you high into the air and moved you completely above Cecilia\u2019s head. Serene lowered you carefully onto her head. She didn\u2019t notice and you walked over to near where her ear was. In the deepest and strangest voice you could come up. \u201cBe cautious of those you throw in the ring of fire. You shall be next.\u201d  You mentally told Serene you were ready for the final act. She got the message and lifted you off the table. But instead of bringing you back to Vienna\u2019s head, she set you in the middle of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t look at Serene, but you weren\u2019t too happy because she decided to throw you under the bus. You froze as all eyes focused on you. \u201cROY?!\u201d \u201cYeah, it\u2019s me. What\u2019s goin on?\u201d \u201cWere you the one moving that Bluk berry?\u201d Rose inquired. \u201cOf course. I wasn\u2019t here yesterday, so I decided to come back in style.\u201d \u201cSince when are humans psychic?\u201d Cecilia asked with a glare. \u201cNobody ever has proven humans aren\u2019t psychic. But nobody can prove it either. So it\u2019s based on the individual.\u201d \u201cSure. So how about some evidence.\u201d Cecilia muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes and concentrated, trying to find something you could do. That\u2019s when you remembered the perfect line that could come in handy. \u201cWell for instance, Cecilia, the past days you\u2019ve been wanting to call me Comran due to the fact that I am from another world, searching for love.\u201d Everyone froze and stared. Cecilia by far was utterly paralyzed. \u201cS-serene told you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d \u201cNo she actually has no clue about that. And for evidence I will make her appear at my size so you can ask her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to face Vienna and raised your hand and slowly brought it down. Vienna slowly moved her head down to match your movements. Serene, unable to keep her stance, falls onto Vienna\u2019s hand. You raised your hands high and walked in a circle. Serene, realizing what just happened, ran at full force and jumped in a pounce movement. But you side stepped and caught her in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re no fun.\u201d Serene said in a playful tone. \u201cYou threw me under the bus first and I didn\u2019t want to go alone. Besides you know you wanted a good way to reveal yourself. This way was pretty good, I think.\u201d Cecilia cut in. \u201cSo Serene, did you tell Roy about Comran?\u201d Serene looked her in the eyes. \u201cNo. He knew that all on his own.\u201d Cecilia remained frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene then turned to face Alana. \u201cSo do you still want to go after Jared?\u201d Alana shook her head. \u201cI think we\u2019ll put that appointment off for another day.\u201d Serene giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell then rang for lunch to end. You carried Serene over to Vienna and after climbing atop her hand, Vienna set you on her head. \u201cThat was impressive Roy. If Serene didn\u2019t want you, I\u2019d take a swing at you.\u201d You were a bit taken back at first, but then realized what she meant. \u201cI hope you mean that in like a \u2018want to date you\u2019 way.\u201d You said into Vienna\u2019s ear. \u201cOf course. Why? Is there a different meaning?\u201d \u201cYes. In the human world, to take a swing at some usually refers to that you\u2019re going to punch them.\u201d \u201cOh my.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. Just violent ole\u2019 humans.\u201d You said as you laid back against her ear. Serene came and sat right next you. \u201cI really like you Roy. You\u2019re more fun than I thought and you\u2019re even nicer. I\u2019m glad we were paired up.\u201d You wrapped your arm around her shoulder. \u201cSerene, I\u2019m glad you like me. And I just want you to know, that you\u2019re the best woman ever. I\u2019ve dealt with a lot of females back home and not one could compare to you. I\u2019m glad you like me so much, even if I am not as attractive, nor powerful as you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both were cuddling up when Vienna said, \u201cAww.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Besides, I think saying you can sleep on someone is a sign of how soft and relaxing they are. A compliment really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you think so. Hey Serene, since we\u2019ve got Roy here, can we go say hi to my family?\u201d \u201cSure. I think we could.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m such a trophy.\u201d \u201cI would be overjoyed to be the center of attention.\u201d Vienna said. \u201cSo would I.\u201d muttered Serene \u201cHA! Okay, I\u2019ll go talk to Palkia, ask him to make you both proportional from my size to yours, and I\u2019ll carry you back to the human world with me. Then we\u2019ll see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVienna came up to presumably her house, which conveniently was next to Serene\u2019s. \u201cSo this is whose house this is. Cool.\u201d You said with a grin. Vienna pushed the door open. \u201cI\u2019m home and I brought some friends.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn walked an older female Ninetales. \u201cI don\u2019t see anyone. Are you sure they didn\u2019t leave you on the way here?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s terrible!\u201d You cried. Serene leaned over. \u201cHer mom tends to joke in ways that seem cold. But she doesn\u2019t mean it.\u201d \u201cI would hope so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery funny mom.\u201d Vienna said as she started walking towards her mom. \u201cBut honestly, where are they hun?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to get a drink, then I\u2019ll show you. Maybe by then, everyone else will be here.\u201d At just the right moment, you took a deep breath and shouted \u201cIn a matter of speaking, we\u2019re on her mind.\u201d Vienna\u2019s mom looked around in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene smacked you in the back of the head. \u201cYou sure are getting bold and harsh.\u201d \u201cIt was a joke, Serene. If I really wanted to be mean, I would\u2019ve. And you just smacked me. What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d \u201cI-I don\u2019t know. It just kind of happened.\u201d \u201cYou better hope Arceus recognizes that as playful or affectionate. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be here much longer if he doesn\u2019t, as seeing your brothers already lit that fire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVienna grabbed her drink of water and headed back into the living room where her mother was sitting. \u201cSo here they are, mom.\u201d Vienna pulled Serene from atop her head and set her on the floor. Serene resized herself and said hi to Vienna\u2019s mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their conversation, Vienna head arched back, sending you falling off the back of her head. You made quick decisions and grasped onto her hair. However her head quickly snapped forward as she let out an explosive sneeze. Her hair whipped forward and you found a way to guide yourself to her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stabilized yourself and looked around. You turned around noticed Vienna\u2019s eyes were looking up while Serene seemed to be picking through her hair. \u201cHave you found him yet?\u201d Vienna asked with a scared tone. \u201cNo, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine. He\u2019s probably fine.\u201d \u201cBut what if he fell into my tails? I don\u2019t want him to be cursed because of me sneezing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you two talking about?\u201d Vienna\u2019s mother asked, absolutely clueless. \u201cIf we can find him, we\u2019ll show you.\u201d Serene said. \u201cThanks for believing me in, gorgeous.\u201d You muttered, shaking your head. \u201cWell, let\u2019s get this show on the road. You walked on Vienna\u2019s maw until you were at the flat of her face. You started pounding as hard as you could, but to no avail. \u201cPay attention when I\u2019m pounding on your skull!\u201d She couldn\u2019t hear a word. You started making random sounds in frustration and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and you got impatient. You walked to her nose and started drumming a rhythm on it. However you felt some vibration on it and notice her head lean slightly back. \u201cOh sh...\u201d The sneeze shot from her nose with less power and more sound. Her hands captured you and all the snot that came with the sneeze. She took a look into her paws and did a double take. \u201cHey Serene. I found Roy.\u201d \u201cWher\u2026 Oh.\u201d \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Vienna asks, moving her ear close to you. \u201cCan I please go wash your snot off?\u201d \u201cThat sounds like a great idea.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVienna kept hands in one position and went back to the kitchen. She plucked you out and set you on the counter. She washed her hands off first and then set you in a part of the sink where there was a little pool of water. You scrubbed the snot off your clothes and shook the excess water. \u201cCould you please give me a little flame to dry off?\u201d She complied and put out the smallest bit of flame. You stood as close as you could stand and in seconds, not a single drip of water could be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVienna carried you back into the room with Serene and Vienna\u2019s mother. \u201cWho is this person I\u2019m wanting to see?\u201d \u201cRemember the human that was sent over here?\u201d \u201cYeah. Wait, could it be\u2026\u201d \u201cYes it is.\u201d Vienna\u2019s mother gave a squeal like a young school girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour you all talked and got to know each other. Vienna\u2019s mother took an extreme interest in you and \u2018your people\u2019. Eventually Serene and you bid farewell and returned home. She went to her room and laid down on her bed, setting you in the valley of her chest. She yawned and you did the same. \u201cSo\u201d You started, \u201cNow what?\u201d  \u201cWell. I was going to take a bath and was hoping you\u2019d come with.\u201d \u201cWell\u2026 uh\u2026 If I did would have to wear some clothes so\u2026\u201d \u201cAre you afraid to show off your body to me?\u201d \u201cWell no but, it\u2019s strange to show your body off to anyone, especially fairly new people. I mean we\u2019ve only physically known each other for about a week. I feel like that\u2019s a bit um\u2026 forward if you catch my drift.\u201d \u201cOkay. Will you join me though?\u201d \u201cYeah. Just let me get those clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene sent you over to the desk and you went in your home. You took off your jeans, socks, shoes and shirt. You grabbed a pair of shorts and went outside. Serene was standing outside, looking a bit surprised. \u201cHalf bare skin?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just my chest. Not like I\u2019m giving you the entire show.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s more than I expected.\u201d You climbed onto Serene\u2019s hand and went into the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene set you on the sink as she went over and got the water running. She slowly lowered herself into the tub and let out a deep sigh. She looked over to you. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m not used to bringing you in here with me.\u201d You were surrounded in the pink aura and brought right above the water\u2019s surface. She released you and you fell with a splash. You felt the temperature and feared how hot it would be, but the warmth was perfect. </span></div></div>",

But in a world built for those larger than life, everything should be ridiculously large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you doing, cutie?\u201d Serene asked, looking as though she had fallen asleep. \u201cI\u2019m alright. I\u2019m keeping my head above water. How are you doing, babe?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m feeling great, especially since you joined me. I was afraid you were going to say no. But now I feel like I could split a sea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started giggling and you noticed the water indeed seem to split. \u201cYou know, there was a time when this would surprise me, but no longer. So I\u2019m going to keep floating and relaxing. You enjoy being stronger than any human.\u201d \u201cYou make it sound like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d  \u201cNo it\u2019s a great thing.

I guess it\u2019s like this world just more intense.\u201d \u201cLike how?\u201d \u201cWell we all talk and interact, but in comparison, we were a bit more careless of others. The people who weren\u2019t social like my dad usually had it the worst, with the suicide, depression and lack of friends. But if you had friends, you were usually fine.\u201d \u201cSuicide and depression, what are they?\u201d Serene asked, eyes focused deeply on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Depression is some mental disease that makes you sadder than you should and suicide is the desire to want to kill oneself.\u201d Serene sat up and looked real concerned. \u201cWait people want to kill themselves in your world?!\u201d \u201cYep. My dad says he remembers when he experienced depression and both times he attempted suicide. Said those were years he never wants to relive again.\u201d \u201cYour dad did this \u2018suicide\u2019 thing?!\u201d \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know much about it. He\u2019d rather not talk about it. Guess I\u2019m lucky he didn\u2019t. Wouldn\u2019t have gotten to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAre humans really cold enough to push each other so far to death? Do they not care?\u201d \u201cWell from what I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s not a matter of not caring, but rather they just treat each other terribly until it\u2019s too late. Although dad says things have improved since he was a kid. Now can we please switch topics? This is depressing and I\u2019d really like to ask my questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. Go ahead.\u201d \u201cSo you already took the literature course Vienna was in this morning. But how can you? I mean you and Vienna are the same age, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cYes we are. But everyone has certain areas they exceed in, so they can take courses related to their skills. They say I\u2019m a good writer, so I\u2019m taking more advanced writing classes earlier. We\u2019ll have writing class the next half of the year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cReally? So what you could theoretically do is write our story and publish it for the human world. Then people could hear our tale and you\u2019d be even more famous.\u201d \u201cFirst off, what do you mean by our story? And why would I be more famous and not us both?\u201d \u201cWell the story of our love and coming together. No human really knows you like your friends know me. People would find it an interesting read. It would make some money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you, but you\u2019re sounding like one of those television agents. And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be willing to \u2018sell our love\u2019, if you understand what I\u2019m saying.\u201d \u201cYeah I do, nor do I blame you.\u201d \u201cSerene, Dinner\u2019s on the table.\u201d Called the voice of her mom. \u201cDo you want to go get some food?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all up to you. I\u2019m as hungry as you are.\u201d \u201cThen let\u2019s stay here awhile.\u201d Serene said, releasing her tensions. \u201cFine by me.\u201d You say, following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime had passed and you were relaxed, except for the numbness coursing through your limbs. You swam to Serene and climbed up on her nose. \u201cSerene.\u201d No response. \u201cSereeeene?\u201d Still nothing. \u201cSerene! Serene! Serene! Serene! Hear my voice Serene! Please! I don\u2019t want to have to hit you like Vienna.\u201d She snapped back and sent you into the water. \u201cWhat was that?!\u201d You swam quickly back and sat upon Serene\u2019s chest. \u201cY-you would start listening to me w-when I said that.\u201d \u201cYou hit Vienna?\u201d \u201cI w-was trying t-to get her attention.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why are you shivering?\u201d \u201cSerene, this water is cold.\u201d \u201cYou could\u2019ve just said you wanted to get out.\u201d \u201cI was trying, but you weren\u2019t exactly all ears.\u201d Serene patted in the water. \u201cIt\u2019s not that cold.\u201d \u201cB-babe, don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but if you weren\u2019t so big, maybe you would feel the cold!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then. Just because the water\u2019s cold doesn\u2019t mean you need to be.\u201d \u201cSorry. But I am n-not in the mood for hypo-hypothermia, so if you could, I don\u2019t know, keep me warm, that\u2019d help a lot.\u201d \u201cFine then. Let me do a quick dry off then so you\u2019re not going into cold wet fur.\u201d You climbed onto Serene\u2019s nose and she stood up and shook her body slightly. She then went over to a corner of the room with a grate on the floor and held you between her hands so very little light came in. Then an unbelievably strong rush of air pounded her hands and moved them slightly. After a few moments, her hand that was over you moved away and revealed her now dry form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay let\u2019s try this now.\u201d She set you between her breasts, but in that valley was a sensational warmth. \u201cThat is much better. Thank you.\u201d \u201cSo, what is this hypo-thing?\u201d \u201cHypothermia is a problem humans get when exposed to cold temperatures for too long.\u201d \u201cOh. And you are alright?\u201d \u201cOf course I am. I have you right here.\u201d \u201cSo in the future, would you join me or would you rather not?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll still join you. I\u2019ll just need to be more careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSo there\u2019s something I really noticed today and I want to know what you think.\u201d \u201cYeah go ahead.\u201d \u201cWell, everyone seemed to be able to hear you, but theoretically they shouldn\u2019t because of your size. Do you have any ideas?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to think about it. \u201cWell, that\u2019s something I\u2019ve never given much thought to it. I accepted it and went with it. But since you brought it up, I guess my theory would be either your hearing is much better than what is believed, I\u2019m louder than anyone believes, or possibly between Dialga and Palkia, some fibers were modified so that my voice and possibly other characteristics are enhanced for your senses. I\u2019d be more willing to think the last one, but who knows. Now if I may ask, how long were we in the bath?\u201d \u201cAround a half hour.\u201d \u201cAh, that explains why the water seemed cold.\u201d \u201cSo are you hungry now?\u201d \u201cYou would even bear to ask? I may be tiny, but food is always an option.\u201d \u201cIf that\u2019s what you wish, then we\u2019re off.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene made her way downstairs and went opened the fridge door with her free hand. The surge of air sent a chill over your body. \u201cTad bit chilly.\u201d You said. \u201cMaybe you should\u2019ve switched clothes first.\u201d \u201cNo! Food first, care later.\u201d \u201cYour recklessness concerns me. I feel like sometime you\u2019re going to get hurt because of such carelessness.\u201d \u201cSorry. I\u2019m just hungry and besides food is just as important. Gives me energy so I can keep warmer longer.\u201d \u201cOkay then, cutie. Let\u2019s eat.\u201d Serene went to the table and set whatever the food was on the table. \u201cWell here it is: A Tort salad.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d \u201cNo. I\u2019m just thinking of how I miss the taste of meat.\u201d \u201cSorry. No meat here. I wish I could help you.\u201d You both began to eat and in walked Lily. \u201cHey sis, I heard there was a dance next week at your school and\u2026\u201d \u201cAnd what?\u201d Serene asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked into Lily\u2019s eyes and knew what she was looking at. \u201cAw darnit. Should\u2019ve listened to ya, Serene.\u201d \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d She asked. \u201cJust wait,\u201d you replied and in a voice that sounded hardly feminine said \u201cHey everybody, the top piece of the human\u2019s clothes stuff is off!\u201d in a matter of moments, with no commentary from Lily, the whole family had come in. \u201cAre you kidding me!? This is freakin ridiculous! Try to be sarcastic and this happens. Serene, I give up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh so the human is what caught your tongue.\u201d Replied Mr. Variform. Everybody got closer and started to inspect your torso. \u201cSo is that what we would look like without our fur?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, son. That would be like asking with more hair, would he look like us.\u201d \u201cYou groaned. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude. I really don\u2019t. But can the specimen return to consuming food or is the examination still in session?\u201d Mrs. Variform spoke up. \u201cOh. We\u2019re sorry. We may have gotten a little carried away. Let\u2019s go everyone.\u201d Everyone left, including Lily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a bit harsh.\u201d Serene said emptily. \u201cYeah it was and I\u2019m sorry it had to be. But I\u2019m hungry, and everyone\u2019s watching me like some science experiment. I\u2019m sorry, but even for a human in a non-human world, that\u2019s a bit ridiculous.\u201d You exclaimed sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You both finished eating and Serene looked at you. \u201cSo what now?\u201d \u201cI think maybe you should float me to the top of the stairs so I can meditate and calm down. I guess you can go talk to Lily and see what she wanted.\u201d \u201cAre you sure? I can\u2026\u201d \u201cBabe, I\u2019ve been completely cold tonight. I think I need to calm down before I say some other things I regret.\u201d \u201cOkay then. Be careful though.\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d Soon you were floating and at the doorway to her room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went into your bathroom and sat on the edge of the bathtub. Serene had come back a few minutes later. \u201cAre you doing okay now?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m better, but not good by any means. I think the best cure is sleep.\u201d \u201cWith me?\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to have me. I need someone that can help thaw my cold heart.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not cold. You\u2019re just having one of those nights.\u201d \u201cYeah. Sure.\u201d You went back to your house and changed into sleep attire, then with Serene\u2019s help, slept in the crevice of her chest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You slowly started to open your eyes and rolled over. However as the bright light hit your eyes, you covered them up with your hand. \u201cBout time you woke up\u201d called a voice that reminded you slightly of Greg, however less booming and much closer. But before you looked for the source, you noticed that you were in the house, not on top of Serene. You started to get a little nervous inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey we\u2019re over here\u201d called the voice again. You looked over and noticed all of Serene\u2019s siblings, except their size was the same as yours. \u201cWhat the... What happened?\u201d \u201cOther than you waking up not much.\u201d Replied Matt \u201cThen why am I here and why are you all my size?\u201d You asked, starting to grow even more concerned. \u201cDoes it really matter?\u201d Ashley asked in a playful tone. \u201cYeah, it does. If you don\u2019t tell me, I\u2019ll call Palkia for answers. If it\u2019s a little game, you\u2019ll be answering to him. If it\u2019s something more important, I\u2019ll be answering to him. Now I may not be from this world and may not see Palkia in the same way as you all do, but I would hate to call him for any reason. Do you think he\u2019d be happy coming here just because you guys are in the mood for playing games?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all woke Serene up and asked if she could shrink us so we could be the same size as you to have some fun with you\u201d Lily said as quick as possible, turning the green of her face to a bit more blue. \u201cWell, secrets out\u201d Andrew said as he gave a classic face palm. \u201cBetter than calling for Palkia, don\u2019cha think?\u201d \u201cWould he really come if you called him?\u201d Questioned the Glaceon Sarah. \u201cNot sure to be honest. Never had to and don\u2019t think I will unless necessary. Why take the risk?.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how would he hear that voice of yours?\u201d Greg questioned with a raised eyebrow. \u201cWell\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d You were interrupted by the knocking on the nearby window. You stood up and looked out the window in your house. Everyone else stepped outside and their jaws dropped while yours locked into a grin. At the window was Palkia, showing no obvious emotion. You put a fist in an enclosed palm and bowed in a \u2018thank you\u2019 gesture. He nodded his head and disappeared immediately after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sure hope that doesn\u2019t go on record.\u201d You started. \u201cSo where is Serene?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s sleeping to make up for all the energy it took to get us like this. But she said when you got up, to wake up her up. Not sure how we should do that.\u201d Ashley said with sincerity. \u201cThere\u2019s probably a way.\u201d \u201cWithout doing any harm or getting too personal, if you know what I mean?\u201d Matt stated. \u201cYep. It\u2019s just a matter of figuring it out.\u201d \u201cEven then, you can\u2019t fly. How do you plan on getting over there?\u201d Greg commented. \u201cOh that\u2019s the easy part. You have feet and hands, do the math, so you can follow me or stay here. Regardless I\u2019m going to give her a good morning wake up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked towards the siblings and moved between them. \u201cYou know, in reality, you aren\u2019t that small.\u201d Ashley noted along with the nodding of everyone else. \u201cNot really. I\u2019m small to you no matter what. It\u2019s just that now that you\u2019re proportionally equal to me, this is what I would look if we were naturally the same size. Now do as I do or else it\u2019ll be a far fall.\u201d You started to climb down the desk and had everyone else following along. They followed your every move, until you were in line with the massive face of Serene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d say this, but she scares me. How in Arceus\u2019 name do you deal with it Roy?\u201d Greg asked. \u201cYou\u2019d get used to it after a while like I did. Besides, if you treat her and everyone or everything she loved with respect, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry. Now would you?\u201d \u201cRoy, I\u2019m sorry about last night. I didn\u2019t mean to stare and attract so much attention.\u201d Lily said, showing shame. You sighed deeply as you started climbing onto Serene\u2019s fur. \u201cI accept but I probably should be sorry as well. I acted a bit too, well, human I guess. I maybe should\u2019ve been a bit more understanding. But what\u2019s done is done. Back to the task at hand!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climbed onto Serene\u2019s gem and focused on it. You started to rub it, hoping for some effect. She moved slightly, but nothing major. You then pressed your forehead to it and tried to communicate with her through it. Eventually Serene stirred and propped herself up. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d She asked. You were still hanging onto her gem as she looked own to her family. \u201cSo either you don\u2019t want me to sleep or Roy\u2019s up. Which is it?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m up here, babe.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grasped you with the familiar aura and set you down near everyone. \u201cHiding on me, are you?\u201d \u201cWell the on you part, yes. Hiding, not so much.\u201d \u201cShame you didn\u2019t sleep a little longer.\u201d \u201cShould\u2019ve let you, but didn\u2019t want to keep you waiting either.\u201d \u201cSo if you wanted to sleep, why did you want him to wake you up?\u201d Ashley asked. \u201cI,\u201d She paused to yawn \u201cwanted to talk to him before you all played your games.\u201d \u201cSo, we all come over here just to walk all the way back?\u201d Matt asked with irritation in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I\u2019m a good sister.\u201d Serene said with a dead grin. Soon all of them had been moved over to the house. However rather than being near the entrance, they ended up on the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be tired: They\u2019re all on the roof.\u201d You said with a smile. \u201cI am unbearably tired.\u201d She said as her head fell towards you a bit. \u201cYou have to at least stay awake long enough to talk if that\u2019s what you want. I don\u2019t think you want a red stain on your forehead.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Never thought that they would\u2019ve asked for that, and out of the blue nonetheless. Otherwise I would\u2019ve done it through the night.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d be just as tired because you wouldn\u2019t have slept. So how are you doing other than being completely exhausted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a moment, apparently trying to organize her thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m okay. And how are you doing? Better than last night?\u201d \u201cYeah. A little sleep goes a long ways.\u201d \u201cLucky you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll let you sleep and we can talk later. I\u2019d rather you be happy talking than tired and confused.\u201d \u201cAs tempting as that really is, I want to talk now. Then I can sleep better.\u201d You sighed. \u201cWhatever you want. So then what do you want to talk about?\u201d You questioned as you sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, last night Lily reminded me that the high school is having a dance and the DJ is *yawn* one of my favorite music artists. So, will you go with me?\u201d \u201cOf course. I don\u2019t have a problem with that, especially if he is a favorite of yours. But I do have one question. Does this dance have a formal atmosphere or is it like, relaxed?\u201d \u201cUm. I guess relaxed. It\u2019s just a back to school dance. Why? Is it going to affect your coming with me?\u201d \u201cNo. Just for personal knowledge. You\u2019ll see why when there\u2019s a formal dance.  Now about today? What is going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnew I should\u2019ve told you last night. Every Saturday my family has a game night, where everybody gets together and plays a game or two. I guess though, all my siblings decided that they wanted to have some games or challenges with you personally. I don\u2019t know why and I\u2019m not even going to try to guess.\u201d She finishes as her head slips a tad. \u201cI\u2019ll let you get back to sleep and see you when you wake up. Oh and in case I forgot, morning beautiful.\u201d She mumbled something incomprehensible and her head fell into the pillow, sending a blast of wind your way. \u2018Like I thought.\u2019 You thought as you climbed down her bed and went over to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you reached the desk\u2019s surface, you looked up at everyone still sitting on the roof. \u201cSo what are we supposed to be doing?\u201d \u201cWhen we figure that out, we\u2019ll let you know.\u201d Andrew said. \u201cWell I was thinking we get Serene to carry us to bathroom so we can start our fun.\u201d Greg said as he jumped from the roof. \u201cGo ahead if you want, but I doubt you\u2019ll get very far. She\u2019s out cold and I don\u2019t think waking her up is a good idea, even if it does work.\u201d</span></div></div>",

But he won\u2019t do it any other way.\u201d Ashley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo theoretically, if we were to walk on our own, how long would it take?\u201d Matt asked. \u201cDepends on where we would be going. If it\u2019s down the hall, maybe twenty minutes. If it\u2019s downstairs, maybe half an hour.\u201d \u201cHow do you know?\u201d Lily asked \u201cWell you remember that day Serene didn\u2019t bring me with her to school? Trust me, you learn real quick how long it takes to get from point A to point B.\u201d \u201cYou walked around the house?\u201d Sarah asked, anxious to hear your answer. \u201cI may be a human and may not have special abilities, but I\u2019ve still got to eat. If I hadn\u2019t, I would\u2019ve hard an even harder time talking to Arceus, since I didn\u2019t have dinner either.\u201d You said as you gave a sarcastic smile towards everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone\u2019s attention reverted back to Greg. \u201cSo, do you really think he\u2019ll be able to wake her up?\u201d Ashley asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know, to be honest. If he does, she\u2019s going to be out of it and probably a bit irritated. If he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll be irritated.\u201d From the distance, as difficult as it was to see Greg, a trail of fire found its way to the back of Serene\u2019s head. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to do something about that, you know, since you do love her?\u201d Matt asked in an accusing manner. \u201cHere\u2019s the only reason why I didn\u2019t. I do love her and hate seeing that happen, but I can\u2019t shake this feeling that I wouldn\u2019t be alive if I went with him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene made a sudden movement and set her hand down to attempt to prop herself up, with her hand being right on top of Greg. Then, after mere seconds and another loss to her exhaustion, Serene moved her hand off of Greg, but then her hand swung wild as she rolled, swatting Greg in the process. Greg was sent soaring through the air and after making contact with the wall, fell and collided with the floor. \u201cOkay before we go and check on him, let me prove three ways it\u2019s better that I did not go. One, I\u2019d be a bloodstain on her mattress because of her hand. If that didn\u2019t get me, the collision with the wall would\u2019ve. And if by some strange twist of fate that didn\u2019t kill me, that fall guaranteed would\u2019ve done me in. Oh and for the record, I totally called that.\u201d \u201cYou prove some good points. Definitely will take your advice into account in the future.\u201d Andrew said emptily. \u201cThank you.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody climbed down and rushed over to check on him. He stood up and started tottering. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d He asked, grabbing his head. \u201cHow many tails do I have?\u201d You asked. \u201cWhat are you talking about? I get sent flying and you think you\u2019ve magically grown a tail?\u201d \u201cI think he\u2019s okay.\u201d You said. \u201cYeah probably.\u201d Matt added. \u201cSo we\u2019re walking then?\u201d Greg said. \u201cI think so unless we sprout wings.\u201d Ashley said. Greg just groaned. \u201cWell then, best get going.\u201d He said, as he almost fell over. You and Andrew rushed over beneath his arms. \u201cYou probably should\u2019ve listened to Roy ya know?\u201d \u201cFine. You were right Roy. Happy now?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say it. He did. I offered advice, not orders.\u201d You shot back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, everyone snuck under a door you\u2019ve never been to and behind it stood a room painted in a gentle blue hue. \u201cWelcome to my room.\u201d Ashley said with a grin. \u201cVery nice. So what are we doing here?\u201d \u201cOkay. We were thinking and we got to wondering what a human was capable of. Now we get you aren\u2019t the best, but you at least would give us a fair idea. So we figured what better way than with a set of friendly challenges.\u201d Andrew remarked. \u201cI have no problem with that, assuming these were made so that a normal-type has a fair chance.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell can you swim, run, draw, arm-wrestle, play a round of Shadowsense, take a chance, and play some board game tonight?\u201d \u201cAll but two of those. Don\u2019t have a clue what Shadowsense is and not quite sure what you mean by taking a chance.\u201d \u201cBy chance, we\u2019re just going to see how lucky you are and Shadowsense is this game where someone hides in a dark room and the other person has to guess where they\u2019ve hidden. We\u2019ll go into later.\u201d Greg said. \u201cSo without further ado, let\u2019s get started.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how about we start with the sprint?\u201d Matt said with some energy. \u201cSure. From here to the desk then?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s line you up first. Jeez.\u201d Lily said as she made a line in the carpet. You and Matt lined up and waited for the signal. Greg gave a little burst of flame and the two of you took off. But you knew before either of you had taken a first step, he had the win and the distance between you proved it. He made the finish a few seconds before you. \u201cNot the fastest thing there is, eh?\u201d \u201cNever was, and never will be? So what\u2019s next?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s wait for them to catch up. I would guess Greg though.\u201d Matt finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s one against you. Hope you aren\u2019t that bad at everything.\u201d Greg said after he made it to you and Matt. \u201cWell then, Hot stuff, let\u2019s see what you got.\u201d \u201cAt the top of here. It\u2019s hard to arm wrestle on carpet.\u201d Greg scurried up with everyone but Matt and you. \u201cYou seem confident. Why?\u201d Matt asked. \u201cBecause I have a good feeling about this. I was pretty strong back home and I think I can beat him.\u201d \u201cBest of luck. I don\u2019t mean this in a bad way, but he\u2019s not weak.\u201d \u201cTrue, and I may not be swift, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m inferior in every other way. Enough chat, let\u2019s get going.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top, Greg was lying on his chest when you got to the top. \u201cI know you\u2019re not quick, but come on.\u201d \u201cKeep talking.\u201d You lied down in a comfortable, identical position and connected hands with Greg. Your eyes connected and you felt the heat of competition, or maybe that was just his breath. When Lily gave the signal, you both struggled but something felt off. Greg felt weaker than you had imagined and although it took some effort to hold him, you could easily topple him. So you went for the win, and sure enough you had it. \u201cAlright one more time.\u201d So you two locked up again and you beat him once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlright. So I\u2019m stronger than Greg. Who\u2019s next?\u201d You said. \u201cWe\u2019re not done yet.\u201d \u201cI think you two are. I think we\u2019d all like to get a chance a proving ourselves.\u201d \u201cOh cool down. One more time isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d \u201cYou lost! Get on with it!\u201d Ashley exclaimed, startling everyone. \u201cOkay then. Who\u2019s next?\u201d Greg asked. \u201cHow about me?\u201d Sarah asked coyly. \u201cI\u2019d be fine with that. What\u2019s your challenge?\u201d \u201cWell I like to draw and I thought, you know, maybe you knew how to draw. Do you?\u201d \u201cI do actually. If you\u2019d let me, I\u2019ll run back over to Serene\u2019s room and grab my sketch pad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay! Go get it. Please!\u201d \u201cYep. Be right back.\u201d You climbed down the desk and after a few minutes, made it into Serene\u2019s room. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You mindlessly walked down the hall, as your mind was distracted by curious thoughts. There was no doubt of Sarah being the artist of the family, but was she superior to you or equal? And how would the rest of the day proceed? And was a certain someone still out like a light?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved underneath Serene\u2019s door and walked over to her desk. After climbing up, you looked at Serene while she was in her bed. She tossed and turned, and looked utterly restless. You went inside your house and switched into a pair of shorts and grabbed a towel, as you would be swimming later. After that, you searched through your things, looking for your sketchpad. You couldn\u2019t find it in the bag, but realized it was lying on the ground. You picked it up and after reaching the edge of the desk, threw your sketchpad and towel on the floor then watched as they landed far below. You climbed down and after getting back to the carpet, retrieved your things.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were walking to go back to Ashley\u2019s room, when a voice said your name and looked to the bed. Serene was now half on and half off her bed and looking in your direction. \u201cRoy, where are you going?\u201d She asked. You walked closer to her bed. \u201cI\u2019m going back to Ashley\u2019s room. I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re up.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine. Let\u2019s go\u201d she said as she got up and tottered. You gave her a concerned glare. \u201cI think you should go back to sleep.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re silly. I\u2019m perfectly rested. Now climb on.\u201d Serene lowered her hand and swayed slightly. Against your better judgment, you climbed onto her open palm and she started off towards Ashley\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene opened the door and noticed everyone on the desk. She set you down next to them and sat in Ashley\u2019s desk chair. \u201cI\u2019m here. What\u2019s the standings?\u201d \u201cRoy\u2019s slower than Matt and stronger than Greg.\u201d Lily said. \u201cNot bad. Who is next?\u201d Serene said as she yawned. \u201cThat would be Sarah. Could you get water in my sink just so it\u2019s not ice cold when we\u2019re ready to go?\u201d \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Serene got up and went to the sink. She turned on both faucets and worked to get it perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised she\u2019s awake already. She didn\u2019t mention any uh\u2026 burns, did she?\u201d Greg asked. \u201cShe\u2019s not mentioned anything other than how awake she is. But I have a feeling that won\u2019t last long.\u201d \u201cSerene not knowing about the burn?\u201d \u201cNo. I meant her being awake. You didn\u2019t see her stumbling to get out of bed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene came back over and sat back down. \u201cNot too hot and not too cold.\u201d \u201cThanks. So are you two going to draw?\u201d Ashley questioned. \u201cWell I was thinking we could just compare. I don\u2019t think there is such a thing as a better artist.\u201d \u201cSo you wanted to compare and not compete? You don\u2019t want to prove you\u2019re better?\u201d Matt asked. \u201cWell no.\u201d \u201cYou should show me your drawing, my little man.\u201d Serene said looking at you as her head rested on the desk. \u201cLet me find the page\u2026 Here.\u201d You held up the page in front of Serene\u2019s eye. She said nothing. \u201cUh Serene?\u201d \u201cYou should show it to me.\u201d She mumbled. You waved the book around, and then bopped it on her face a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you she wouldn\u2019t be awake for long.\u201d You said as you walked past Greg. \u201cSo what were you going to show her?\u201d Sarah asked as she started walking over towards the edge of the desk. You followed and noticed that her sketch pad was laid out to a painting of Serene. \u201cI feel like an idiot for not noticing that earlier. I\u2019ll show you mine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou handed the pad to Sarah. She stopped to admire it, and her eyes moved in no other direction. \u201cWhen and where did you this?\u201d \u201cBack home in my world. It was when we first sent each other pictures of ourselves. I figured whether she liked me or not, I\u2019d draw her.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, and so realistic. I\u2019ve never seen anything done like this. What did you do it with?\u201d \u201cPastel chalk.\u201d Everyone swarmed and admired it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed by and eventually everyone calmed down. \u201cSo what is this thing on your shoulder?\u201d Lily asked. \u201cIt\u2019s called a towel. It\u2019s how I dry off when I get wet. Now since she has been waiting, I think Ashley is next on the list.\u201d \u201cGlad you think so. But there is a problem. We can get over to my sink easy, but what about you?\u201d You looked at the sink and noticed it had an almost marble appearance. It was indeed going to be a challenge. \u201cWell I\u2019ll see you at the top, one way or another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set your sketchpad down on the table and watched as everyone easily jumped the large gap between the sink and the desk. It was however too much for you to jump. You climbed down and went to the base of the sink. You attempted to climb the sink, but found its texture too smooth to get a solid grip on. So you looked around and noticed the water behind the sink. The pipes also had a more textured surface, and you worked on climbing up from there. You were near the top when the part of the sink stopped you from going up. You spent a few moments contemplating where to go from there. After a few slow but solid moves, you reached the flat of the sink. Everyone turned to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe decided we\u2019d give you a minute to catch your breath or prep yourself. Whatever you want to do, really.\u201d Andrew said as he sat down. You looked at the makeshift pool that was to be the battleground. It was moderately deep, but not too bad. You leaned down and reached into the water. It wasn\u2019t hot but it certainly wasn\u2019t cold. You went to an open area of the sink and dropped your towel and removed your socks and shirt. Everyone\u2019s attention suddenly focused on your bare chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? It\u2019ll help me swim a little better and it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never seen it before.\u201d You said as you were stretching out. You then dove into the water and floated about for a few seconds. \u201cSo how is it?\u201d Ashley asked. \u201cIt ain\u2019t exactly nice, but it beats being cold. But why don\u2019t you come on in and feel it for yourself.\u201d She too took a dive, but dove to the bottom. She then shot from the bottom of the sink to the water\u2019s surface and had enough momentum to soar a bit in the air. She swam over to the edge where you were resting. \u201cShowoff\u201d you said. \u201cWell, shall we get started?\u201d \u201cFull down and back, right?\u201d \u201cSounds fine to me\u201d Ashley said as you both lined up as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026 Go!\u201d Someone shouted. You shot off the wall and made strong strokes with your arms and legs. You didn\u2019t know where Ashley was, but you really didn\u2019t care. This was going to be a long swim whether you won or lost. It just felt good to go for a swim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization that time had seized to exist came when you tapped the far wall. Ashley had apparently just tapped the wall and started her return towards the start. How you even caught up to her remained to be seen. You kept going, fighting the pain that consumed all your muscles. Eventually though you finished and floated around to catch your long-absent breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how far behind was I?\u201d You asked. \u201cYou kept fairly close \u2018til that last bit. You just lost anything you had at that point.\u201d Lily said. \u201cOh well. Better than I would have expected. Well, hate to put things off, but I am going to float around and enjoy this water while it\u2019s here.\u201d You said as you floated on your back. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go again or see how deep you can dive?\u201d Ashley asked within an obviously sarcastic tone. \u201cGet me a tail and some way to breathe underwater, then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody except Greg decided to get into the water. Ashley, not wanting to leave him out, gave him a shot of her own water, to which he did not respond well. The two started to shoot each other with whatever they had. In the process of hitting and missing, Greg\u2019s flame warmed the water up a fair amount. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a shadow soon lurked over the water. You were very relaxed and didn\u2019t even open your eyes to see who it was, because you already knew. \u201cI was beginning to think you weren\u2019t going to get up.\u201d You said. \u201cI do feel a lot better, although I\u2019m not exactly sure what happened.\u201d \u201cWell, you passed out twice. That\u2019s about all we can tell you.\u201d Matt mentioned. Everyone started to climb out of the water. You got out and dried yourself off well before putting your shirt and socks back on. \u201cSo what\u2019s next?\u201d You decide to ask.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, it\u2019s actually a little after when we normally have lunch and I\u2019m kind of hungry.\u201d \u201cWell then let\u2019s go eat. I\u2019m not lying when I say I\u2019m hungry.\u201d Andrew stated. Everyone nodded and chattered as they climbed onto Serene\u2019s palm. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you down at the bottom of the stairs. I\u2019m going to drop off my stuff back in your room.\u201d \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to walk there yourself when I can easily give you a lift?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the plan. You\u2019re already carrying all your siblings and you\u2019re going to kitchen to make us all a sandwich or something. The least I could do is walk my lazy butt down to your room.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene gave a sweet smile and blew you a kiss. You gave her a wink and watched as she walked away, tail swaying with intensity, yet in the calmest manner. You broke away from the trance of Serene\u2019s tail and started looking around. You noticed a pillow that was sitting directly under the edge of the sink. Seeing it as the quickest and simplest way down, you got prepared to take the jump. After throwing down your towel and sketchpad down, you took a deep breath and jumped. You spread your arms like they had taught you when free falling. It was a bigger rush now than in training though. The environment was much larger and the fall was much bigger, only increasing the thrill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you eventually became close to the pillow and you curled up into a ball. You hit surprisingly softly and even had a bit of bounce afterwards. You spread your limbs out and caught your balance on the immense object. You grabbed your things and walked of the pillow and landed on the ground. The trek back to Serene\u2019s room was long, but eventually you made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting your things down, you walked out of the room and climbed up the stairway railing. You slid down it and saw Serene at the bottom. She lifted you off the railing psychically and caught you in her hands. \u201cSo are you hungry?\u201d Serene asked. \u201cOf course. So what\u2019s on the menu?\u201d \u201cI did make a sandwich and everyone else has already started on it. Hopefully you\u2019ll get some.\u201d \u201cAs long as I can eat before you, I\u2019m sure I will.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene set you down on the table as she took a seat. You went to an area where nobody had started to nibble and that is where you made your start. You would nibble a bit of the bread and then move onto the components of the sandwich. After a few bites, you were satisfied and looking around you saw that everyone else was as well. Serene then took the sandwich and finished it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerene ate the last bite and gave a sigh of relief. Greg just tapped his foot and looked at her. \u201cI enjoy this different environment, but it\u2019s getting a bit difficult staying like this. How about you size all but Andrew so we can be our regular selves again?\u201d \u201cI guess I could. Are you sure though?\u201d \u201cEveryone nodded. \u201cIt was nice while it lasted, but now it\u2019s lost all glory.\u201d \u201cNot that it affects me any\u2026\u201d Andrew muttered. Serene shrunk herself to about half her size and had everyone get in the palm of her hand. She returned to her normal size and everyone else was at half their size. \u201cWe\u2019re getting there. How about the other half?\u201d Greg said impatiently. \u201cHow about you just wait. I don\u2019t have a problem with you being half height.\u201d She carried them outside, leaving you and Andrew alone on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere was she going?\u201d You ask Andrew. \u201cOutside. She can get just big enough that she can get them close enough to normal height and fine tune it from there. So, do you have a problem being this size?\u201d You thought for a moment. \u201cNot really. While I\u2019ve lost the ability to do a lot of the things I used to do, it\u2019s kind of nice just being able to take it easy. So, where are going for this luck challenge thing?\u201d \u201cThe dining room, where we talked with Arceus. Apparently Lily thinks a game of 21 is a good way to prove how lucky one is.\u201d \u201cThen let\u2019s get going. No need to wait for them to get done screwing around out there.\u201d \u201cAnd Serene\u2019s going to be fine with us just going on our own?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine with it, I\u2019m sure. If not, I\u2019m sure it can be solved.\u201d You climbed down and with Andrew following suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that wasn\u2019t as tiring as shrinking all of you\u201d Serene said as walked back in with Ashley, Lily, Matt, and Sarah following behind. Sarah was holding out her hand and set Greg on the table as everyone took their seat. \u201cHey, Roy, do you think you could convince Serene to put me back to normal?\u201d Greg whispered into your ear. \u201cWell, let me put it to you this way. I would easily help you if it were anyone else, but since it\u2019s Serene, I don\u2019t need to be on her bad side along with you. I have to sleep with her and go almost everywhere with her. It\u2019s dangerous for me.\u201d Serene just merely tapped the top of your head, as if to show approval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let\u2019s get this show on the road.\u201d Lily said as she shuffled up the cards. She began dealing out the cards. Serene stood by to help you with the cards if you so required assistance. \u201cSo I understand the game, but not the logic behind why you say this is a matter of luck. I would say this is more strategy based.\u201d Lily nodded. \u201cI would too, but I usually don\u2019t get the chance to play, so why not bend the term a bit?\u201d You had Serene lift up the cards and you take a look. \u201cHit me\u201d You say.</span></div></div>",

Hurried away, bags in tow, you took the hour long drive to the local science and space center, where some of the nation's frequent portal testing had occured years ago, before being nearly perfected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd been told that while it was still not perfect, and that a lot could still go wrong, it was highly unlikely. Many officers, goverment agents and scientists who'd been working on relations with the new alien species. Pokemon, strangely enough. While it was a huge shock, it was apparently entirely possible. As this wasnt space travel, and rather, alternate reality. Anything possible, even giant humanoid pokemon... Huh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly two hours of being breifed again, on what to do when you get there, what to take notes on as well as how to interact with them. All on top of the various saftey precautions you should be taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, at 8 in the morning, you were completely ready to go. Saying goodbye to your family, as well giving a wave to the press, you stepped though the large, white portal, ready to meet the people you'd stay with for the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes, everything was dark, and very warm. You looked around, and began to step forward a bit more, but you felt the ground under you move around a lot, and you fell over, tumbling around a large, soft room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few loud voices, and the sound of a car starting up, with a few doors shutting, you saw light flood your vision. Looking up, you finally got to your feet, although it was still a little tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you was the face of the girl you'd been talking with for almost six months now. Crystal's eyes were a deep, dark blue, in contrast to her lighter blue facial features, and the ocean blue hair falling from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned a bit nervously. and waved up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya Grey, its good to finally meet you.\" She said, a wide grin on her own face, showing off, suprisingly white, teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed you glasses up, as they had become strewn when you'd been tumbled all around in what you now realized was her hand, and called up to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too! What was with all the rush?\" You asked, now starting to take in the size difference between you. While you thought on that, she spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There were a few families there, to confuse the media. The government didn't want you to be overwhelmed when you got here, so they had us hurry, while the media was trying to figure out who actually had you.\" She said, and lifted you a bit higher, letting you speak a little lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded a bit, and held back a wince as you were brought up, wind rushing past your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it's not a long drive to our house, but I do want to tell you. I have a few siblings, you've seen my older brother already, Chilli, the Flareon, you remember him, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did remember him. He seemed nice enough, very protective of Crystal it seemed. You gave her a nod, and sat down in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I actually have about..\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course your mom argued about it, but it was only a once in a lifetime opprotunity and free school, that and you couldn't decline. The girl's name was Jenny, and she was the most beautiful gardevoir you have ever seen. She is 18 year's old, even older than you. She looked very kind, happy and a little shy, as you could remember. To mention from her breast, they were at least D-cup, but that wasn't her whole beauty. Before you go to sleep, you checked your E-net's email box. There was a message from Jenny which said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Ken.<br>\r\nI'm excited to see you in person. Maybe I forgot to tell you this, but along with my parents I also have a little sister, who's a Kirilia. Her name is Sofia, also we live near the countryside, so i could easily wake up and get to the school. But never mind that, it'll be great to finally see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. You really didn't remember those 2 things, but for you, it was a good thing to be near the countryside because you had also grown up in the countryside.,So you didn't mind it at all, you turned out the lights and started to sleep.

What pulled up was a mid-size pick up truck. \u201cYou are Mr. Roy, correct?\u201d You nodded and threw your bags in the bed. He drove off and the whole way, all you found yourself doing was thinking about jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to be huge, but how huge? And what about everyone else, were they going to be kind or just plain mean? You started to panic a bit at all the talking you would have to do, even if jenny would help you out a bit. You eventually reached the site of the dimensional gate, got out of the truck and grabbed your bags. As soon as you got out of truck, seven men in black suits stood around you and grabbed your bags. As soon as you got out of truck, seven men in black suits stood around you and escorted you in to a room with the gate. The men left and a scientist walked in. \u201cIt is good to see you, Mr. Roy. Are you ready?\u201d You nod and he fires up the portal. You took in one deep breath and ran through the gateway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around a few seconds later and see that you have made it. The grass was about to your waist, but you walked through it with ease. That\u2019s when you look ahead and see what appears to be a sort of giant white foot. you look at it curiously for a while, untill you feel something wrap around you. You look at your waist and see it's a giant green hand! your soon lifted into the air, and then, you see jenny's face. she smiled at you and said \"Hi Roy! glad to see you here!\" \"good to see you, too jenny.\" you replied back, but not really paying attention. You were too shocked at how big jenny was! if you had to estimate, you would say she was around...</span></div></div>",

You continue, \"Would you think of using that to minupulate me to your will?\" She seems shocked but gently replies, \"No, I'd never use something like that against you,\" you heave a long sigh relief.

Star gently picks you up in her palm and walks out of the biluding you were in, walkng to her house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house looked alot like yours, in fact the naborhood looked almost exactly like yours, exept that everyone was a giant anthro pokemon. Star walks into the house and it looked still exactly like yours. \"The scientests said that me and you were like the same person, but that we're diffrent in a few ways.\" Star staited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Star, is that you with the human?\" You hear who you guess is Star's mother. \"Ya this is Joe, he's the one who'll be staying with us for the year.\" Star replies. \"Ok well make sure he is alright, we want to have everything nice for him.\" Star walks to a door and opens it reviling stairs downstairs, which she walks down and into a small game room, and hallway leading to her room. She walks into her room and sets you on her dresser, were you see a small cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis cabin was about as big as the Star's room is to her, and had a shower, toliet, closet, chair, and table. But no bed. \"Hey Star, how come there's no bed?\" \"Umm, I kinda thought you could sleep with me.\" She says blushing. You blush to, having a gts and furry fetish realy didn't help so you were kinda in a dream come true. \"That sounds... fine I guess.\" \"Yay!\" Star says pickng you up and huging you into her breasts, a dream come realy true for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Star, time for you and our guest to come eat!\" Star's mom calls. \"Coming!\" Star yells back. You and her walk up the stairs (well you sat in her palm) and into the dineing room where Star's mom, dad, and a yonger brother a luxio, sat in chairs waiting for you both. Star sets you down on the table next to her plate and you all say grace to god (you all prayed to god, not arcues, weird\") and dug into the food, which was green beans, mixed with mushrooms, a pork tasting meat and rolls. Star ripped off chunks and set them to the side of her plate for you to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm star, can I please have something to drink?\" You ask. Star gets up and looks through a small box coming back with a small doll cup, which she dunked into her, what you thought to be mnt dew white out , and passed it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 7 more minutes, everyone else is done and Star's mom gets out a 10 by 10 inch sponge cake. You eat some of this and soon are full beond belife. You all go into he liveing room to watch tv and se that a ep of your mythbusters is on. You all watch untill it's 10:00 and get ready for bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, you and Star are takeing showers, and when you finsh get out to see Star in black panties and a light blue bra. \"Well, what do you think?\" She says puting a finger to the bottom of her lip sexly at you. \"Absolutly amazing.\" Your just able to say. Giggling, Star picks you up, lays on the bed and sets you in between her large round breasts and smoshes you in by tighting the strap so that it is holding you frimly in place. \"Good night Joe.\" Star says. \"You to.\" You reply falling asleep. </span></div></div>",

When you come out star is wearing a black hodie, jeans, and a baseball cap that said \"Volt= :)\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice clothes, I realy like the fadora.\" \"Thank you, star I like your hat to.\" Star picks you up and heads upstairs into the kitchen, and looks through a cabnet and pulls out a cherry poptart. \"Here Joe, I don't know if you like cherry but that's all we have for now.\" She says giving you a part of it. \"No no it's fine, I like cherry.\" Star smiles at you and you both grab your backpacks and head to school. You both talk while walking and many times she droped you into her breasts so that no one could see you, although you didn't mind. When you get to school it looked like your high school, but the name was diffrent. Yours was schs Spencer County High School. But this read Shaymin County High School.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn side it was the same, and you knew which classes were which, but a few classes were diffrent, insted of technology, you had tm/hm buliding. And insted of gym there was battle class. You had languge arts, science, algabra, reading, tm/hm building, battle class, and last social studies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar walks into the \"Gym\" and a male galalade comes up to talk with star. \"So is this our new student, alright I want you to go up to the stage and wait. \"Yes Mr.Blade.\" Star says. She walks up and goes behind the curtins to talk to you. \"You ready for this Joe?\" \"Ya I'm good, you?\" \"Im fine, I just hope no one trys to... She cuts off the last part. \"Trys to what?\" You ask counfuised. \"Trys to take you away from me,\" she says blushing. \"Dont worry, it'll be fine ok.\" \"Ok\" She replies. And now to welcome our new student for the year, Joe bradburn!\" Star walks out with you in her hand and places you infront of a mircophone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm hey everyone, great to be here.\" Over a thousand screams sound out and you cover your ears. A few pokemon raise their hands and you call on an arcanine girl. \"What is it like being so small?\" \"Uhhh hard to not die, there are alot more ways to be killed when your only 2 inches tall.\" Next you call on a charmeleon guy. \"Why shoudnt we kill all of you right now?\" You rub your temples and say. \"Because if you try I will torture you untill you can't breath fire.\" Next an areodactyl guy raises his hand and you reconize him from your dream.\" \"How would you be able to do that, your too small to hurt us.\" \"I may be small but I can do a few things and I have an item to help me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that last question you all walk to your first class and sit down for class. The same Mr.Blade teaches you, but thankfully it's only oreintaition. The next class you have Ms.Kelion, who is a keckleon. In algabra you had Mr.Buynak who was almost exactly like your teacher.

She was a Haunter anthro, her hair is a deep dark purple cut into spikes on her head the same was haunters' spikes are on their heads. She has a dark navy blue eyes that made it seem like she only had a pupil. Her body covered in purple fur from head to her floating tail/legs. You asked how it felt to just have a tail and no legs but it turns out she can turn her tail into legs if she feels like walking instead of floating.\u00a0Looking a little bit lower you can see her d-sized cups, she knows their large, she even makes jokes about your eyes drifting down once and a while. Her figure is also amazing even though she doesn't have real legs, she has hips. This gives her a very attractive hour glass figure. Though what really makes her cool is her arms. She doesn't have any. Instead she has floating hands that have some form of a forearm on them. She has complete control over them and to see her \"sit\" in front of the computer and to see one of her arms come into the room with a soda really blows your mind. First time you saw her do that the look on your face made her laugh so hard she feel out of her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait, I'm dying with anticipation.\" Jen said giggles at her own dead joke. She makes them a lot and she goes a little too far once and a while, but you understand where the jokes come from since she has a darker sense of humor, you know she would never really do any thing she jokes about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither can I. I can't wait to meet you face to face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen looks at you and giggles again, \"Actually I looked up the size difference between us, it would be more like my eye to your whole body.\" This scared you a little bit, you were hoping you would be a little bigger then that. She noticed the look on your face, \"Don't worry about it, when you come over I'll have a surprise for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big of a surprise?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen giggles, \"A big surprise for you. A \"small\" gift from me.\" You roll your eyes at her joke getting a few more giggles out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no matter what it is I can't wait to meet you.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor I you,\" Jen said though looking into her eyes she seemed to have some lounging in them. You both turn off your screens and go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Next Day--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waking up you do a double check on all your stuff. \"Nothing missing that's good.\" You walk into the living room to have your mother latch onto you like she will never see you again, crying uncontrollably saying that you might not return, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom it's okay I'll be fine, Jen will take care of me.\" You said trying to calm her down. Your parents have already met Jen and her mother. (Though you have no clue what happen to her father.) Though this didn't seem to comfort her. Your dad pulled her off of you and comfort her. Then shook your hand and wished you well. A limo was waiting outside ready to take you to the lab, where it will warp you to Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you arrive to the lab one of the scientist started to talk to you. \"Welcome Jake, I'll try and keep things simple for you alright?\" You nod your head. \"Good, now we would like you to email us about your days on this planet. We would like you to explain things as they happen. Though we don't expect there to be a lot of difference for most of your days there we would like you to tell us that, just \u00a0to be sure.\" You understand as the both of you walk and talk, towards a large white room. \"Now when you get warped there will be a whole hour before you get to the other portal. We would like it if you wrote down your experience during that hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you guys send a camera thru yet?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did but it when they played it, it only played a blank screen. We would like you to tell us if there is anything does happen during the warp.\" You nodded thou this made you feel very uncomfortable about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you step into the center of the large white room you see a glass window with the scientist on the other side typing away, they look up and give you the thumbs up. You return the thumbs up and they nod. The ceiling starts to light up and then a large boom feels your ears causing you to cover your ears. Once the sound goes away you look around to see that your floating thru... Well space, the camera was right their was nothing but pitch black darkness all around, or at least until you enter the other portal, the whole trip felt like a minute. Then you see a large room of white all around you.\u00a0Taking a few steps out of the room you see anthro, magnzones all around you. Its hard to really describe them, they have the magnzone look but they appear to be more andriod/cyborg like then human.They start to question you about your travel and you tell them about it, along with the fact that the warp didn't feel like an hour but more like a minute. They nod and inform the human scientists about that. One of them opens a door and on the other side of that door was Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen looked around a little bit and then noticed you. She had he hand float over to you and picked you up. She, and her arm with you, float out of the lab. Once out she brings you up to her face and smiles, \"I'm so happy to finally meet you!\" She Starts to nozzle you against her cheek, you just rub your arms all over the cheek while she does this. When she stops she said, \"Sorry for not talking to you in there magnzones like to study very thing they don't understand, affection is one of those things and I thought you might of had enough of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just happy to finally get to meet you,\" You said she is far more attractive in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, which surprise would you like first?\" Jen asked smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Surprise me.\" She looks at you with a 'really' look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh, fine,\" She pulls you up to her face and kisses your whole body and not just a little kiss, she held it for a good minute humming while she did it giving your body a little massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she broke it she looked at you hoping you were okay. \"What was that for?\" Is all you can say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you didn't like it?\" Jen pouted a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just want to know so I can get more of them.\" This made Jen smile as she gave you another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... We have been talking to each other for a few weeks and I was hoping...\" She was blushing and seemed too embarrass to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can put two and two together thou. \"Jen it would be an honor to be your boyfriend.\" She looks down at you and just hugs you into her cleavage, holding you there for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" is all she says as she now flies home. She keeps you in her massive cleavage letting the wind hit your face. It feels really pleasant and once she returns home, she took you out of her cleavage, \"Ready to met the rest of the family?\" You nod knowing that you would meet her mom and her little sister who is a gastly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jen opens the door thou a head comes out of the door looking you right in the eyes, \"Why hello there little one!\" It was Jen's mom who is a gengar and she almost scared the life out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!!!! I don't want him joining us in the after life yet!!\" Jen yells at her mother, thou she does smile a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I couldn't resist honey. It's nice to finally meet you Jake.\" She hold out her index finger for you to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, you really caught me off guard with that,\" You said, laughing a little out of nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright well why don't you two get comfy while I finish up diner.\" Jen's mother then returns inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Jen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, she just caught me off guard,\" You told Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good cause I don't want you to die... At least not now anyway.\" She giggles as she walked to her room. You wish she took you out of her cleavage so you could look around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen floated to her room and took you out of her cleavage. She put you down in front of a doll house. \"Just put your stuff inside. when you come out I have another surprise for you.\" Jen sang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting your stuff inside the house you turn around to see Jen...</span></div></div>",

Finally, you looked up to see the enormous figure of Sandra standing high above you. Suddenly she bent over, her face very close to your body, blocking out a lot of the light. Your vision was filled with her dark brown and cream colored face, as well as her bright red eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Logan! It is SO great to meet you!\" She said, a suprisingly large smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were astonished. Not only by the sudden realization of the size difference, but by her change in additude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were told before that the difference in height would be about 5 feet to one inch. Which made you barely over an inch in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed, and held out a hand, a stupid decision looking back on it, and replied. \"Sandra, it's very nice to meet you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she lowered her own hand, and stuck a finger out, letting you shake the large diget awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted you up with her other hand a few second later, and set you on her palm, standing up and turning to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only now that you realized that there were cameras and people talking all around. Likely the media here to see you come through. However, before anything could be taken in, a few men came up, escorting and body blocking the two of you through the hall, and outside, where you both were promptly shut into a car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing, and the car ride went by so quickly in your mind, you didn't even realize until it was over, when Sandra stepped into her house, and quickly took you away, up some stairs into her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized the place quickly, seeing the back wall that was always behind her in the video calls. Everything was either a dark shade of pink, purple or dark gray. Lots of red colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself suddenly tumble forward, falling onto a soft, rubbery surface. Picking up your glasses and looking up again, you saw Sandra's figure. Tall, slim and curved as well as very well toned. She had dark brown fur and light cream highlights. Her Platinum blonde hair was pulled back into a thick ponytail with her ears, which were also rather huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked away, and fell onto her bed with a loud groan. \"UGH! Why did it have to be me? Why not some nerd who'd actually like doing this shit.\" She grumbled, before sitting up again, looking back at you on her chair. The one you assumed she used for desk work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in a bit, dont leave or anything. I dont want to deal with losing you or something... Then again, might just be easier if you wandered off...\" She mused, before walking out of her room again, giving you another good view of her butt and small tail as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, starting to think about everything that had happened, and how she was obviously going to be treating you very differently outside of other people's view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like an hour, but shortly after she left, the door opened again.</span></div></div>",

She then says \"Are you excited about tomorrow? You get to live with me.\" She also blushed a bit. Sigma says \"Sure am, I can't wait to see you in person\". She then says \"You need to know that I am 16 years old and I live with my family, well it's just my mom, Karen and my younger sister, Sam.\" Sigma say \"Ok can't wait to meet your family too\".

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, life usually sucks. So far this week, I have had nothing but crap. Parents yelling at me, the constant bullying, the usual. For a few seconds I thought that my life was going to end. But, after school on Friday I was approached by a government official along with my school's principal. They offered me to be the first human to visit that new planet. I would have to be stupid to think no. My grades were good, so why should my parents complain. But, I think I'm getting ahead of myself. My name is Taylor Anderson. I'm an average person; short brown hair, brown eyes, somewhat of a build. Of all people to be chosen, it had to be me. This was a dream come true! The official said I would at least spend two weeks at their facility so I could keep in touch with the host family I would be staying with. I didn't mind, I didn't mind at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks really fly by fast. I spent most of my time taking to this beautiful girl. Her name is Ivy, and she's an anthro Serperior. But anthro for a snake generally means a naga-like appearance. If you don't know what a naga is, think of a human torso attached to a snake tail. Anyway, she is simply wonderful. By human standards, her body would be the envy of all guys and the jealousy of all girls. About G cup breasts, thin waist, and curved hips, she should be a model But her body is not what I find the most attracting thing about her. Well, okay I admit it, she's hot. But what gets me is her eyes. Serperiors usually have red eyes. She had unique purple irises. It looked good on her. As for wardrobe, she generally wears dressed. The last day she was wearing a nice red dress. One that was revealing her body a little too much. But I'm not complaining. She signed on and immediately said hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to see you in person Ivy\" I said. \"But, did you find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I found out\" she replied. A few days ago I asked her how tall I would be compared to her. You see, on their planet, a adult has the average height of 450ft. I know, tall right? Anyway, Ivy held up a small bead between her fingers. \"This is roughly your size to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, \"Didn't expect you to be that big. I thought I would have been at least the length of you finger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy giggled as she placed the bead back down. \"It's alright Taylor, you know I won't hurt you\" she assured me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, you...but what about everyone else?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the time and read midnight. \"Oh my gosh I need to sleep\" I shouted. \"I'll see you tomorrow Ivy. Good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night cutie\" she replied before signing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning I got up bright and early. Quick shower, quick breakfast, quick everything. I wanted to meet Ivy as quickly as possible. After I managed to pack all my stuff up, I quickly ran to the teleporter they set up. The other one was on the other planet. I ignored what most of the scientists said. Usually I always listen to what others say, but for some reason Ivy filled it. I had no idea what I was feeling or thinking. But, I did manage to catch on that I needed to write a journal blog after every day to send what I have learned. Without another hesitation, I was sent flying between planets and through space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like I was getting pushed through a water slide for some strange reason. But, I managed to stay in tact as I came through to the other side. A video chat through E-net displayed one of the head scientists. Reason being is because that the teleporter needed no humans on the other end. \"I see everything is in perfect condition\" he said. \"Alright Taylor, your escort is waiting outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last goodbye to the planet I grew up in by sixteen years, I bolted for the door. I ran through the doors but hit something hard. I looked up and gasped. Ivy was here, she was wearing a dress, and I could see up it. I snapped myself out of that daze and walked to the point where it was out of view. \"Hey Ivy!\" I shouted as loud as I could. Ivy's purple eyes landed on me and a smile stretched across her face. Her hand hit the ground and I climbed on. Without warning, I was rushed to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taylor!\" she said with enthusiasm. \"It's so good to finally meet you!\" She brought me close to her cheek and I gave my best attempt to hug her. She seemed to have felt that and she lowered her hand. With my suitcase in tact, Ivy headed for her home. It's was weird, I always told Ivy about my family but she never said anything about her's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ivy\" I asked. Her eyes landed back down on me but seemed confused. \"I hate to bother Ypu, but why haven't told you about your family?\" Ivy dished, making me feel like a jerk. But, she looked back at me. \"The reason I never told you was because I have a huge family\" she replied. \"I understand, I come a family of six.\" Ivy laughed, \"Well, I come from a family of twelve.\" I choked on whatever spit I had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwelve?!?!?! That's insane! I hope they all liked me.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We soon arrived at Ivy's home. At first glance, I must have been dreaming. Ivy never mentioned being a millionaire. The house we stopped was a mansion. And from my size it would be even bigger! Ivy slithered up to the front door then stopped. \"Now...I have to warn you about something\" Ivy told me. \"Most of my siblings are female, and they are dying to meet you. They might be a little rough when looking at you.\" I nodded so she knew that I understood. She slowly grabbed the doorknob then turned it. The grand entrance was definitely grand. It looked like something you would walk into a five-star hotel. A stairway was placed to the side that lead up to the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ivy is that you?\" asked a feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah mom\" she replied. \"I brought our guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE HUMAN IS HERE?!?!\" shouted several female voices. Without warning, seven Pokemon anthros ran through the door. They all crowded around Ivy and reached for me. I was almost taken on several occasions but Ivy's grip kept me with her. \"Sisters, please settle down\" Ivy tried to plead. But, her sisters were making too much noise. They all wanted me. This would be really good if they weren't all giants. But, a pawed hand managed to grab me out of Ivy's hand. Soon, I was now in the giant chest of one of Ivy's sisters. I'm sure this was a hug, but it just felt odd. The other thing that felt odd was that whoever I was against didn't feel like grassy scales, but fine fur. \"He's so cute!\" her voice boomed. I was grabbed again and again for about six times. I each one felt different, but another one had scales. I kept getting remarks like \"He's so tiny!\" to \"Humans are so adorable!\" and others ranging from that. Eventually a voice boomed over the rest, \"Ladies control yourselves!\" The grabbing stopped as I was returned to Ivy's hand. Now since I wasn't being passed around like a toy, I was able to see who Ivy's siblings were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recognized all of them but noticed that they didn't seem like the correct matches. I mean, I know different Pokemon can be breed together but some of these didn't seem right. Ivy's sisters were a female anthro Arbok, Ninetails, Luxray, Mawile, Buizel, Nidorina, and a Blaziken. One thing was shared between all of these odd siblings, they all had the figures of a model. Large breasts, thin waists, round hips, every single one of them. Some were taller than the others but I wasn't paying attention to that yet. The one who broke the conversation was obviously Ivy's mother. She was a anthro Serperior as well. She had a similar figure as Ivy, but had red eyed and she seemed shorter. I guess more of her tail was out. \"Ivy, please show our guest to his room\" she said. \"Everyone will have a chance to meet him later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy nodded and slithered up the stairs. She let put a sigh as she turned the corner. I understood what she was feeling, although it was more hectic for me. We entered what I guessed to be Ivy's room. It was a rather large room painted green and had an assortment of different plants. Her bed laid in the corner of the room and beside that was a desk. On her desk was a laptop and webcam, obviously what she used to chat with me. But, there was something else on her desk. It looked like a small house, practical built for my size. Ivy placed her hand on the desk and I walked off of it. \"This was built and sent to us just for your arrival\" she said. \"It's supposed to have everything a common house should.\" I opened the door but simply put my suitcase inside. Ivy was confused by this. \"Aren't you going to check inside?\" she asked. I simply looked up at her. I think my gaze was scaring her so I decided to finally speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ivy, how exactly are all those Pokemon your sisters?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy broke down in tears instantly. I knew I shouldn't have asked that. She was a sensitive being and I triggered something. Thankfully her face was close enough to the desk. I ran over and hugged whatever part I could. Her face rose, so I let go to prevent falling. She then carefully grabbed me and hugged me against her chest. I could feel her heartbeat slow down gradually. \"I'm sorry\" I said. \"I never should have asked you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Ivy replied. She dried any tears that were left and stopped the hug. Her purple irises were still glistening. \"I should have told you about my family. You see, my family is adoptive. The only three of us that were born from my mother were me, my sister Violet, and my brother Fang. The rest are adopted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, forgive me for asking, but how come they all looked like they belong in a fashion show modeling? Even you have looks some human girls would die for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy blushed at my comment, \"Well I guess the rest of us were lucky. But my mom was actually was a model.\" Honestly, I was not surprised by this. But, whatever Ivy was thinking made her happy smile turn to a frown of sadness. \"My mom met this one man that 'loved' her so much that they needed to have sex. But in the morning he left. My mother's pregnancy caused her to lose her job. I forget what he was, but I know he wasn't truly nice. Although my mother was ruined, her boss wouldn't give up on her. Instead of being a model herself, she taught others how to. After she had me, she managed to get her figure back. But, the same thing happened again and again. I didn't want to tell you this because...because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because why?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...I thought you would think of me as a slut...They always say the daughter takes after the mother so I kept my past secret, even to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hugged her cheek once more, \"Ivy, I would never call you that. I wouldn't even call your mom that. Your smart, beautiful, and very kind. On Earth that's impossible to find in a human. Your greater than anyone I have ever met in my life. Please don't cry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy pressed me against her cheek in the attempt to return the hug. Years were falling from her eyes, but these tears were of joy not sadness. We stayed in that stance for a while, but we did promise for her family to see me. Ivy did mentionshe had a father, but I just hope he wasn't one of those cruel fathers that left. But, I was going to find out.</span></div></div>",

Any viewpoint is fine 1st, 2nd, 3rd but it has to center around the main character and has to stay used so no switching from 1st to 2nd to 3rd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. All pokemon will be pokemorphs meaning they will be human but retain fur/scales/feathers and any other noticable features like differrnt ears, paws, and a tail if they have one, oh and no wing-arm things sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Sex is allowed but No: Vore, Stomping, Death, Scat, Guro, Anything else screwed up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Try to keep it consistent don't have him go from being loved to everyone trying to kill him or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. You can name the character whatever you want but once you do try to keep it constant. I will allow a change if you use a different name constantly for example (Jack to Joe)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Sorry for anyone who wants otherwise but M/F only for relationships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Any chapters breaking the first 5 rules may be removed or I will mod them until I think they fit the guidelines. If these seem restrictive well go find something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrief explanation of pokemon<br>\r\nThis has happened before so I need to clarify this now...\"ahem\" the pokemon do not wear clothes, \"but then they'lll be naked\" all the prudes will yell. No they will not be naked the pokemon will have a small cover of fur/scales/feathers over any sensitive areas such as the nipples of the breasts or the genitals. This obstruction can be moved or retracted if a pokemon enters a severe state of arousal. They can still wear clothes but that's at their own discretion, most don't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBase story<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe year is 2100, one of the countless probes that Earth sent off landed on the surface of the newly discovered planets. It transmitted an image back to Earth but no scientists could understand what it was, the image was shown worldwide and the cry was heard from the throats of anyone who still had tapes from the 2000s. It was a planet full of pokemon, and from what scientists could tell from the images these pokemon were huge, 450ft tall seemed to be the base adult height. A bunch more robots were sent through an expirimental portal technology and they created a receiver portal on the pokemon planet. It's been 10 years since connection was first established. The E-net was created as a way for Earth and what was aptly dubbed the poke-planet to communicate, Relations between the governments has been stable and a contest on Earth was started. Every high school student on the planet was given a questionarre to fill out with various questions ranging from general health to interaction questions. You were a huge pokemon buff as you're father was a fan of the series and kept tons of old games, videos, and even cards. You're father's habits which you're mother always called packratish payed off and you were selected to attend school on the new planet as an act of good will and you obviously accept since you're father made you a pokemon nut.</td>",
