You think to yourself, \"This had better Work.\" while putting the finishing touches on the machine. You had put out a flyer for a volunteer to \"help\" you test the device.

After more than twenty years you finally have the pleasure to be inside a girl's body, your body now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And everything's so smooth now,\" You say with your high pitched voice rubbing your face not having to shave every day anymore. You want to see more of your new body, but you'd rather do it somewhere else. Luckily your apartment is just situated above your laboratory. You leave your laboratory and go up the stairs. Inside you lock the door behind you letting out a relieved breath. For almost a second there you were afraid someone would see you entering your former home. Someone might get suspicious about seeing an underage girl entering the apartment of someone half her age but everything is cool now. You head straight to your bedroom, it's messy but you don't care. After all it's not yours anymore. You're more interested in the reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is me, huh?\" You ask yourself as you look at yourself. You have a pretty face, one that is simply adorable when you smile. Speaking of smiling your teeth are sparkly white too. That's a relieve since you were afraid of the dentist and haven't gone a few years now. You then look at your chest; a simple black tank top covering your chest. You pull the top over your head and down you can see your budding breasts contained in a pink bra. Looking further down you pull the skinny jeans off showing the pink panties you were wearing. Looking in the mirror you have to admit you look very hot, even though your breasts aren't as big as you would like to see them. That doesn't mean you are less interested in how they would feel. Should you continue your exploration in here or would it be better to go \"home?\"</span></div></div>",

Normally she had gotten her way at home, today is the day that changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look your body up and down and figure it was time to get back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not too much of an issue since your home was only a fifteen minute walk from your laboratory. As you are walking up to the door you, you slide your hands over her body trying to find your key. You feel a glint of pleasure shoot through you. You realize she doesn\u2019t have a key on her, so you slide your backpack off and kneel down. She was so much closer to the ground that it took no effort. Reaching into her bag you find her school books, a notebook, and pencil pouch. You open the next zipper and find headphones and her iPod. Finally, opening the last zipper you find her key and some tampons. A scary thought passes through your mind as you realize she\u2019s in the midst of puberty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand back up, key in hand, and open the door. As you walk in you feel as if you\u2019re sneaking. Realizing it\u2019s silly though, since you still live here. You straight up normally and you hear your mom call from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAllison, is that you?\u201d Your mom questioned from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost answer no, but you felt the hair on your shoulders and pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m home mom!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the kitchen and drop your bag on the floor near the table and slide into the seat just as your sister always did. However, now that it\u2019s you doing it, you feel how good it felt to slide into a seat in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was school today, cupcake.\u201d Your mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou searched her memories and felt she had a good day, but she got a C back on her math test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the same old same old. I did get a C back on my math test though,\u201d you replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, did you make sure to study.\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it just didn\u2019t feel like what we studied was actually on the test!\u201d You huffed as Allison\u2019s body fed you all of the useful information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust make sure you\u2019re careful on your school work or you won\u2019t be able to help your brother at the lab anymore. Did you help him today?\u201d You mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea he had me sort test tubes for a while, but he still has a lot of work and is staying there tonight,\u201d you lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eat an early snack before dinner and run upstairs. You almost instinctively go left into your room, but turn right into Allison\u2019s old room. The light blue of her room was distractingly apparent as you entered her room as you decided what you were going to do next. The options were endless.</span></div></div>",

Being in a much younger body now, the level of homework was a lot lower. With your college background in the body of a 12 year old, her relative IQ was raised to that of a genius to anyone who saw. Completing all of your homework in about fifteen minutes you were now free to do whatever you like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk around her room looking through your new drawers. You find things like her jewelry, socks, and panties. The sight of her panties excites you a bit and you pull them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide out of all of her clothes and stand nude before the mirror. You stare directly into your adolescent developing body.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B6Pd44OBvlT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/B6Pd44OBvlT/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are in awe of your newly developing body as you slide your hands across your body. Your hips still flat as a board. Your breasts barely budded. You reach over and hold a pair of panties in front of your sex. Admiring what it might look like on you. You slide into them and feel how they grip the void between your legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you put your hair up into two long pony tails. You think you are absolutely cute. Shuffling through your closet, you find a simple white dress that hides your now promiscuous body. You skipped the idea of a training bra as you didn\u2019t like how it felt. Finally, you put on a tan sun hat and figured you looked adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear your mom call you for dinner and run downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlli, I thought you hated that dress.\u201d Your mom says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you could say I\u2019ve had a change of heart, I decided to give it a try and i love it.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour mom smiled clearly pleased that her daughter liked the dress finally. You sit down to eat and can feel a small current going up your dress and chilling your small legs as you eat dinner. You didn\u2019t care for it much, but it was Allison\u2019s favorite so you\u2019re body enjoyed it. You slowly started to feel parts of her mind open up as you remembered more from Allison\u2019s life than just that day. You begin to recall her friends, preferences, crush, and turn ons... You didn\u2019t realize stuff got to her at such a young age. You finish dinner and return upstairs. You get on her laptop and lay on her bed. You look behind you and see up your dress in the mirror, but you didn\u2019t care too much. One of her friends had messaged her asking if you would like to hang out with her at her house for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you think?</span></div></div>",

Your parents are watching  a movie in the living room, from what you can tell they are both sitting in there and not really moving around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had back to your actual room, not Allison\u2019s this time and knock the window ajar. With Allison\u2019s much more petite form, you wiggled through the opening onto the roof. There was a storm drain that connected to the gutter of the house. In your normal body, you were not able to get down, things have changed. You grab the drain and wrap your legs around it as you slide down. You land gracefully as you hit the ground with little noise. You grab Allison\u2019s bike and you are on your way to the lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get there and swipe your keycard to get in. Thankfully you had taken it off your body before you left. You go back into the room that started all this and you see your former body laying there. You realize for the sake of science you should preserve your former body. You try the best you can and put it into a cryostasis chamber, just in case. You head to your computer and see if you can afford to make any more nanoprobes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With the design you have right now they are used up after a single use. Technically leaving you trapped in Allison for the time being. Once they had beat her immune system the basically put the original Allison to sleep and gave you control, but she was still very much alive in her own body. You strived to develop a version of the nanoprobes that would hijack and attach to the brain and could be used multiple times as well as without the use of the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put a copy of your mental processes into these new nanoprobes and wanted to see how they would work. Every diagnostic shows that they would be successful, but you were unsure of where to test them once they were complete. As you take time to think your slide your hands under your leggings and begin to rub your pussy again. You got yourself nice and distracted for a good time. As you were coming to a climax, a heavy wave of pleasure hit you and sent you over the edge. As your back arched, a few sets of images flashed through your mind. You thought of guys and what it would feel like if they were in you instead of your fingers. Weird. Were these thoughts a result of Allison\u2019s heterosexuality, you pondered. You dry your hand off and put the idea out of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to your testing, you finish the new version of the nanoprobes after 2 hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re ready to test them, but where would you want to test them?</span></div></div>",

After checking the clock that procedure took about 10 minutes to fully work. You want to see if you can speed that up. You start analyzing the data and see if an accelerant would be useful. It changed your X value by about .02. You develop a small syringe launcher and figure you should be good. About this time, you hear stirring from the other room.

You were going to take a shower, but settled on the sound of a nice bath. It sounded amazing. You put some music on and soak for what felt like forever.

You think of places like a restaurant, a movie theater, and a gym. They seemed like good ideas, until you thought about the mall about thirty minutes away.

You pull it out and quickly line up a shot with the back of her neck. You hold your breath and steady your shot. You pull the trigger and you see the syringe fly.

You brush your hair behind your ear and flash her cute smile she always gave to your parents to get her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look yourself up and down, noting your petite new figure. You grab at the waist of the sweater you were wearing now and begin to pull it over your head. Your hair again flops down onto your shoulders. You look at your form again. You were wearing a tight gray tank top and black leggings. You see the pink straps, which you can only assume was former Allison\u2019s Bra. You pull your tank top down and see two bumps through the pink fabric. In anticipation, you quickly pull the tank top over your head. You struggle to get your arms back behind and onto the clasps. Finally, after a few minutes of failed attempts you slide the shoulder straps off your arms and due to the bra being a simple training bra, you slide it off over your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately you notice how cold your lab truly was. The frigid nature of Your lab brought your perky nipples to a point. You had nothing more than mosquito bites. You bring your arms up to rub some warm into your torso and you felt a shock of pleasure resonating from your buds. The pleasure brought a load of new senses to you. You felt your legs tremble and a new warmth between your legs. That gains your attention and you shimmy out of your leggings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re left in nothing but your pink and white polka-dot panties. You threw your leggings into the pile of discarded clothes. You run your hands down your chest and to your hips. Your body has the build of a door, but you hope to fill out through your new puberty. You trace your pantie line in anticipation. Between your legs are your tight panties and you trace the lowercase w. You slide your dainty hands under the seam and just like the rest of your body. You were smooth and void of any hair. Your finger Met the slit and you slide your finger between your new sex. The entire process was foreign to you. Every inch and feeling you analyzed under your microscope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly rub a small circle around what you assume is your clitoris and a new pleasure fills your mind and body as you dampen your panties.</span></div></div>",

You had an urge to pee and suddenly your legs tensed up and your toes curled as wave over wave of pleasure broke over your small form. By the time you came to your senses your legs were drenched in your nectar of passion and your heart was beating rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide your hand out of your panties and licked them off. As you thought about dressing, you realized your panties were drenched beyond saving so you folded them and put them in Allison\u2019s backpack that she had set down when she entered the pod earlier. You dry yourself off with a rag from earlier and slide your leggings back on. They were put on with minimal effort and you noticed how smooth your legs were in her body. Next you put on the tank top, but after some discomfort with your nipples rubbing against the fabric you took it back off and attempted to put the training bra back on. You repeated your method of getting it off by just slipping it over your head and putting your arms back through the straps. With your blossoms pleased, you put the tank top back on and finally the sweater she had been wearing. You dragged your former body as best you could to a cyrostasis pod for further experiments and grabbed you backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flipped off the lights and locked the door, putting the key in your science book in the backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting home was not too much of an issue since your home was only a fifteen minute walk from your laboratory. As you are walking up to the door you, you slide your hands over her body trying to find your sister\u2019s house key. You feel a glint of pleasure shoot through you. You realize she doesn\u2019t have a key on her, so you slide your backpack off and kneel down. As you kneel, you realize the differences between your current body and your old body. You used to be 6\u20182\u201c and easily 250 pounds, but as you knelt down you remembered that she was around 4\u201911\u201d and only maybe 90 pounds. In her body, you felt tiny. Shaking that thought aside, you reach into her bag and find her school books, the science book where you hid the lab key, a notebook, and pencil pouch. You open the next zipper and find headphones and her iPod. Finally, opening the last zipper you find her key and some tampons. A scary thought passes through your mind as you realize she\u2019s in the midst of puberty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand back up, key in hand, and open the door. As you walk in you feel as if you\u2019re sneaking. Realizing it\u2019s silly though, since you still live here. You straight up normally and you hear your mom call from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAllison, is that you?\u201d Your mom questioned from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost answer no, but you felt the hair on your shoulders and pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m home mom!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the kitchen and drop your bag on the floor near the table and slide into the seat just as your sister always did. However, now that it\u2019s you doing it, you feel how good it felt to slide into a seat in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c What took you so long getting home?\u201d Your mom questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember, I was helping Jason at the lab today after school. He needed my help sorting like paperwork and stuff.\u201d You lies as you lightly rubbed your thighs under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh okay, I guess I had forgot.\u201d You mom says without looking up from the dishes she was preparing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was school today, cupcake.\u201d Your mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, it was just your average day.\u201d You shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good sweetie, dinner will be ready shortly.\u201d She rejoiced, since it was her night to cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her okay and bound up the stairs. You thought about which room to go into and finally decided you would be more comfortable in your actual room opposed to Allison\u2019s room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take off your sweater and get another look at your new form. As you are standing in front of the mirror, you preform a few small twirls and make a few faces Allison would make. After years of experimenting you had perfected the nanotechnology. You just hadn\u2019t expected that it would land you in your little sister\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to get on your bed, but it did prove more difficult since your bed was higher up. Once you got up there you pondered what your next move would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of chapter :)<br>\r\n___________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthor\u2019s note: I hope you are liking this.

Her appeal, in your slightly jaded opinion was that she was more popular for her body, than her vocal range. The way she'd loom over the microphone, and roll her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Val Deacon.\" she held her hand out for you as she entered. Oddly lifting it, as you reached out, so you had to kiss it rather than shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuiding her to the free seat on the opposite side of your desk. You describe her participation, as easily, as simply as possible, telling her that she'll just relax as if she's being hypnotised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, not wishing to sound too vague, you then tell her broadly what you intend. That your mind will take control of her body, and after an hour, your nanites will expire, and she'll recover as if from a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a hint of wrinkle at her forehead, and you reassure her that, you can hit the reset button on the computer beside you, ending the experiment safely and instantly (almost instantly).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeighing up her needs, she takes a deep breath, and agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to lift your gaze from her cleavage, as she gives a polite cough for your attention. You're not sure yourself anything will happen, if the nanites will sync, or the experiment will fail entirely. But even a failure can teach a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final confirming nod of her head, you scratch the needle across the back of her hand. A tiny bead of blood surface, and a ping, from the computer beside you shows the process has started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten seconds, 1% appears on the main screen. The screen displays an image, an outline of Val's body with a shimmering scarlet trail of nanite spreading through her body. The density is highest in her arm, leading to her brain. Though as you watch, her whole body suffuses with a soft shade of pink. Her brain darkening, as the veins are loaded with nanites, until her whole brain is a solid mass of deep red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the screen, you see the figures climb from 95 .. 97 .. 99 .. 100%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes dart wildly, as her perfect teeth pinch that plump lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like falling asleep.\" you assure her, gesturing for her to sit back in the chair and relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching for the button to initiate the change, she squeezes her eyes shut, for a moment before snapping them wide again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe button clicks, and you study her for changes. Pain spikes across your own temple, and you feel uncomfortable. Disoriented, you see yourself from Val's point of view, feel her lungs breathing, her chest... your chest heaving. The teasing tickle of your underwear. Back across the desk, you see your body slump. As it keels forward, you manage to catch your head, and softly lower your head to rest on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small details are unexpected, as you spot your spreading bald spot. The slight spread of too much sitting at a desk, and not enough time exercising... hell, not enough activity at all. Shifting in your chair, you feel how much bigger, your ass is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA niggling voice, buried deep inside echoes those same thoughts. You feel Val's insecurities as she lurks deep in the recesses of her brain. As you listen, you feel her get louder, feel her get stronger. Your finger twitches against the desk, and you realise she did that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to copy the gesture, to twitch a different finger. But she's fighting, and as you glower at your hand, it remains steady. Horror fills you, as you feel a smile spread across your face. A smile Val put there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Doctor was this what you expected?\" No words are spoken, but you can't avoid answering, inside her head, she's queen. You can't hide, you can't lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer anger builds, as she finds out how little you knew, how much you guessed, and speculated. A feminine whimper slips from your lips, as she interrogates your memories. Your judgement about her singing, her body, her intelligence (or lack), she snarls, as you try to rephrase and defend your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bimbo.\" she snarls inside her mind, \"I'll show you a bimbo. I'll <b><i>make </i></b>you a bimbo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdly she settles herself, so you can watch your pale reflection in the glass. The nanite warm your whole body, your temperature spiking, as she drives them, feeding your simple lusts, and her insecurities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make your job, easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch horrified, as her chest, as your chest expands. Each breath sinking back a little less, each inhale pushing the girls further forward. The weight growing relentlessly, as you feel your panic rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fight, and fight, desperately squirming for control, to stab the abort button to end this nightmare. But your body stubborn refused to react, just the steady rhythmic breathing, as your body conforms to even more of a bimbo shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/f01ca7836ac3c53a8a002972777cd74d/tumblr_ojydo8mnIC1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/f01ca7836ac3...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spares you a triumphant smile, as she lazily reaches for the button to end the experiment.

You thought the problem might be their reluctance, but now a host of questions race through your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to convince yourself this is the best option, you list the positives. She's human. That's better than placing your mind in an animal's body, if you hadn't found a volunteer, then you knew a large mammal was your next option. The horse, 'Firefly', was your next candidate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's a bimbo. That's good, it should make it easier for you to suppress her personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis not only provides you with a swap, but also saves the lab financially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fingers rest on the corner of the desk, as if you're holding onto a cliff edge. Letting go, the only thing stopping  you tumbling into the pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding to yourself, you are confident in your work. It is ready to be tested, and it should be you who tests it. Letting go the desk, you are only a couple of steps from the empty chamber. It feels like your breath is deafeningly loud, your nostrils flaring with each breath, as you steel your nerves for what's coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cough from behind, makes you start, and you turn to see Mr. Jensen slide a document across the table. His gaze travels to the bearer bond, \"Just a formality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fountain pen resting on the document slips from your trembling fingers. Making a fist, you squeeze away your nerves. Just one more delay, you tell yourself. Already regretting and hating the delay. You flick through the five stapled pages, reading a paragraph here and there. It's written in legalese, about parties of the third part, and their obligations, and responsibilities. Services required and consequences of non-payment etc...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretending to read it, you work towards the last page. Mr. Jensen's signature on the top line, beside the label: Main Part. On the line beneath, Mrs. Jensen's signature, Cassie, playfully the 'i' dotted with a cute heart. Is marked as Swapper 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lowest line is blank. Awaiting your signature. Labelled Swapper 2/Scientist.___________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother polite cough, and he slides the duplicate across to you. \"You'll want your own copy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... Yes, yes... of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sign the last page of the document, and enter the pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Jensen files his copy back into a briefcase, while yours lies abandoned on the desk. The systems activate automatically, as they sense your presence in the pod. You try to relax into the simple seat, as the door slides closed. The lock clicks solidly into place, and there's a brief noise, as the unit is sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA panel of lights by the hinge of the door, start lighting up, and each one turns green. You give a strained smile to Mr. Jensen through the panel, the button to initiate the change resting beneath your right hand. Beneath your left, the 'Abort' button. Your palm itches as you consider what you're about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprising yourself, you slap the button with the palm of your hand.</span></div></div>",

You fight the urge to cover your nose and mouth. The haze loses its' drifting, aimless quality, as their hive mind asserts itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a sound of thrashing from the neighbouring pod. Not the panic-stricken fever of someone fighting for escape. But the futile attempts as Mrs. Jensen swats wildly at the nanites. There are hundreds of millions of them, and any damaged and destroyed units abandoned, their tiny bodies re-used to make their own replacements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds from next door weaken, as time goes on. While you feel the effects as the nanites invade every part of your body. Your body feeling alien, and distant as you slump back. No longer quite in control of your breathing. It's your turn to feel panic, as your breathing slips from your control. Your lungs still working, a flash of vision disorients you. Momentarily you saw the lab, from her position. You felt her body breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrewing your eyes shut against the whirling vertigo of the experiment, you tell your growling stomach, this is necessary. This is what you want, what you need for your scientific reputation. You nod to yourself, but a hiccup comes with an unsettlingly large shifting on your chest. A heaviness that doesn't feel right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes snapping back open, you're treated to a view down your own canyon of cleavage. Looking away in disbelieving horror, you shake your head in denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, from the opposite side of the pod door, Mr. Jensen reads your face entirely differently. A broad grin, widening revealing more teeth than you like. His gaze dropping from your terror widened eyes, and panting breath, to your vast rolling chest, as it pitches with each breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the cycle complete, the pods swing open simultaneously. Your own body... your old body, resting quiet, and calm... empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning your attention inwards, you sense the suppressed personality of Cassandra Jensen. A sense of dreamlike unreality should keep her calm, allowing you to maintain control of her body. A cough clears some last nanites from your throat. It's higher pitched, somehow feminine without even speaking a word, you know your voice lacks that gravelly authority, that low growl that you liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a half-swallowed gasp, you find sudden importance in your preferences. The body is yours to control, the autonomic responses left as they were. However, you hadn't considered too deeply, the effects of hormones and upbringing. Your thoughts are scattered as Mr. Jensen rises from his seat. Now a much more imposing figure, he towers over you by twelve inches or more. His body though old, is more used to exerting power and authority than yours. His bodyguard an added incentive to obedience.</span></div></div>",

You ease yourself up, with a hip wiggle to avoid the pod door. The natural grace of your movement, a little odd. Your new instincts allowing you to keep your feet in her heels, and still move with fluid smoothness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we can see the technology works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slip your hand from his, and do a slow pirouette, allowing him to admire your body from every angle. Again your intuition guiding your action. Though, you do feel incredibly aware of how your bust bounces with your tiny steps, and the answering ripple from your rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good start.\" he assures you with calm confidence. His gaze floating up lazily from your jiggling arse. His admiration of your body, shameless and open. It's oddly empowering being admired for your body. At the same time, he's dismissing your intellect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>G.</i>. Good start?\" you ask. His answer surprising you, eager to get to the next stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing to onerous.\" he tells you. \"I just need to ensure the body will stay swapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes dart back to your body. It looks like it's sleeping like some Disney princess waiting for a kiss. The pod still sealed protecting your body from harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust a meal, isn't too great a burden.\" he interrupts your distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..sorry, yes... I mean, no.. No, it's not a burden.\" you feel flustered and distracted, \"Yes, you want to check the range, and ... see I don't snap back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs, \"Oh, and it's a nice meal with some interesting conversation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suspect that whatever Cassie's appeal are to her husband, she's not a great conversationalist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've booked us a table, at \"L'Auberge Jardin\". He offers you the crook of his elbow to lead you from the lab. A casual glance at timer on the pod tells you there's enough time to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hips feel like they're moving far more than necessary, as you hang on his arm. The bodyguard leading the way. Heading down the stairs, you are intensely aware of how much more your body moves, and keeps moving after you stop. Your instincts compensate, keeping you upright. But it is hard to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the car door is held open for you, the body guard keeps an alert eye scanning the vicinity. Sliding in bum first, you smooth the skirt from beneath you, as you get in. Cassie providing all the feminine gestures and mannerisms to ease your passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Jensen slips in the other door himself, as the body guard doubles in the role of chauffeur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf expecting to snap back to the pod, you almost wish it would, and you could examine your results. However, you jump as Mr. Jensen's hand rests on your thigh. A soft snort bursting from your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, just a natural reaction to your presence.\" he offers as an apology. Although he only removes his hand after an appreciative pat of your smooth firm thigh.</span></div></div>",

She went with her emotions and indulged her sensual nature. She left the thinking for others. This approach had always served her well given her looks. She was never prudish. In fact she enjoyed sex. Enjoyed the attentions of her husband. Enjoyed his games of dominance. Loved them. These were the traits her husband had sought. Her sensual nature allowed her a life of affluence and she embraced them. This was her way to power and prestige. She was beautiful and rich and envied.

The proud erect nipples displaying for both of you, precisely how your body is feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a final insult, his hands slide firmly up from your belly button, through your cleavage. A deliberate insult that he ignores your needy nips. Coming to rest on your shoulders, he pins you to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last giggles, and gasps leave your body, as you regain control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you imagine that?\" he asks. This time allowing the question to sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you imagine being a broodmare, can you imagine carrying your foal for a year?\" His voice dripping with malice. \"Is your current body so bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can answer, he shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But those aren't your choices. It's simpler than that. Broodmare, or siring Stud. Can you picture it. Satisfying filly after filly, your days passing in a daze of endorphin pleasure. Your body .... Hell, with an horse's brain, you'll be able to keep your consciousness, even in animal form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow in horror, mutely shaking your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think, that lavish body is so terrible. Can you imagine surrendering to your animal needs... in an animal body...\" he practically hisses the words with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think of it, being a horny filly, knowing why the stallion is in with you, knowing what is coming, unable to protest, as your body, as your instincts have you present your rear for his approval. Consider your hungry pussy twitching with need, as he sinks inside you. As you milk his cock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stops for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you could be the stallion. Your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes flash, \"Now, choose!\" he demands forcefully, confidently.</span></div></div>",

You thought you\u2019d never see anyone from your life again after what you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, seriously what are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sounds mocking. It\u2019s not very kind of him not to at least say hello. Even after what you did, after leaving everyone behind and work here in this dump for your last resort, your maybe chance to do things over or different, to flee from your rotten life which you so hate you think if someone decides to find you and visit, saying hello is the least they could do. Pete doesn\u2019t seem interested in your glare though. He just walks in and throws the morning paper on top of your desk, with an article towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>One volunteer requested for testing a experimental project. A budget of $1000 is rewarded to the volunteer, no matter the outcome. If you\u2019re interested, find the abandoned hangar at \u2026 </i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s the article you placed in the news paper to lure a test subject, a ticket out of your life. You wonder what the deal is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you here to volunteer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, idiot. I know you, you don\u2019t have any money what so ever. I told you, you should pay people back. Then I find this, looking like you\u2019re about to give money to a stranger. Money you need to pay your debts\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is right about the debts, not about paying back. You worked out everything. It took you a few banks and loans, but you needed every penny to design the probes. Of course it would count as stealing, but your body is about to leave you anyway. You don\u2019t care, and no one is going to take those debts over so there is no problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, leave me alone. If you\u2019re here to wipe in my mistakes, then do that somewhere else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue make your final adjustments for the programming on your computer. Pete angrily checks out what you did to this big room in silence. Even though it was a hangar, it\u2019s a working lab right now. It has its own generator, electronic locks, nice lightning, camera security, computers, several chemicals, a fume a nice desk and of course your projects, including the failed ones. A set of leftover pods attached to a machine clearly stands out most. Pete is looking at it for a while. Meanwhile you stare up closely to a small vile filled with a transparent liquid, almost like water, but you know they contain your utmost priority and secret project, your Nanoprobes. There are over a million in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attach it to a needle and inject it on your blood stream. A computer is clearly showing the actions the probes take in your body with red dots. The program isn\u2019t active yet though. It should speed up the process if they are already at your brain fully prepared for download, which is why you did that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, what the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize Pete saw that and startle a little. If he finds out what you\u2019re up to it could ruin everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrugs.\u201d, you quickly reply. It\u2019s a little suspicious lie, but you didn\u2019t have  a better idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re on drugs, great. So great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised that he accepts that answer you return your eye focus to the monitor and see them as red dots traveling through vanes of your bloodstream.  You take another check at the transmitters and the receivers as well as any backup protocol you made.  (This has to work), you think. (I tested everything, calculated every possibility. There\u2019s no way it can fail.) You happily look at the monitor, then back at Pete. Should you really test it on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with a startle, the door slams open. An older woman,  Asian looking and about in her fourties drops in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this the place where something is tested?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has an Asian accent. You\u2019re not too happy about what came in, but at least there is a volunteer. Finally an escape of life. When you were about to answer her, a man walks in, also Asian looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! You will not be the volunteer. I will take your place.\u201d, he says to the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they start arguing in Japanese. Then two kids walk in. A moment later a western looking modern business woman with shades walks in as well. Followed by a tinned guy, who looks like a skateboarder. Several other people come in as well, most of them speaking languages you don\u2019t understand at all. Worried you quickly switch the screen to cam view outside. A tourist bus is parked in front of the building and there are several cars. There\u2019s a whole crowd coming this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap.\u201d, you say accidentally out loud. You know why they are here. You were so busy with it and afraid no one would come you added a little message to your advertisement. You can tell they all hold the newspaper. They\u2019re here, not for you but for the reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly everything becomes really noisy and crowded. People asks all sorts of things to you about what is going on, what the plan is and who you\u2019d pick. A translator does most of the word. Eventually you told everyone you\u2019d only going to pick one, and then some Japanese guys figured out a way for you to decide it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, your white board is borrowed. All your calculations are erased, well not that you mind, you have the in the computer anyway and somewhere in your journal, instead they made this sort of tournament board with people their names on it. Everyone is taking even more space now, as they are all competing with each other, all sorts of one on one games, such as card games and chess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(How the heck did this happen?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around. Even outside of the room there are people. All sorts of people, playing games. You wonder if they are going to camp here next or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do several calculations on your computer. Probes are the only thing that count in your mind right now after all. They don\u2019t need a medium. You made them so they can literally fly towards the target. Although that takes a while due to them being so small, it is also the reason. They shouldn\u2019t even be able to notice them if they are out in the air. The only problem is wind. First you planned to let the computer shut down the air filtration system, so the room becomes air silent, and lock the doors. That way the probes can freely go towards the target without interruption on the fastest possible way. The problem is, if you now close the door people will start wonder why and who knows, maybe your one target is actually outside. You\u2019re glad there isn\u2019t too much wind today as it is almost standing still outside, but still it might take long for the probes to reach the target. Long enough for them to move. Though as long as they are within two mile radius, the probes receive their programmed command from your station here. You guess they can\u2019t go far on foot to avoid it, unless they take the bus or cars. It\u2019s getting tricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think of what to do and decide it may be best to choose one target now anyway since they are all so busy with this tournament, and probably argue after wards. (Stupid money wolves), you think. Good thing they are money wolves. At least you have a wide variety of selection right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice even Pete is playing, but since he is an idiot and closely similar to your old life, you think you skip him out of the selection. You also don\u2019t really want to be too old. You\u2019re already thirty-six. Twenty years of work goes to these probes. You still can\u2019t believe you started it on your sixteenth, your run from life and deepening into science. You really hate it, your life, even though it was completely successful, till you were fired on age of twenty-seven due to lack in socialization. Being a scientist was boring, well\u2026 you mainly did it all to find a way to escape the life you were in. You left everything behind, your family first, later your friends and even your girl friend. You kindly regret that a little since you did have a good relationship with them. Still, you don\u2019t like your life so much it was well worth it. This project became your life or way to life instead. It better work, it should work. You trust it works and it will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to have a fair life, a different life instead. You have so many people to be jealous on. Even these tourists and money wolves seem to have a better life. You quickly make a nice walk through the selection and made a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I\u2019ll become you.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your final changes and set the targeting system to the programming. You hide yourself behind one of your failed projects, since it will probably cause you to faint and you don\u2019t want to make a panic mess. You press the button and initiate the machines. Almost immediately you can feel something move in your head. The download must have started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guess it\u2019s going to hurt a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Who did you pick, what preference did you have?-</span></div></div>",

Of course, you did not want to continue living your life; that was clearly confirmed in your 20 years of research for these probes. But when you really sat down to think about it, you realized that not all aspects of your life were bad. You were a big fan of baseball ever since you were introduced to it as a child by your grandfather, and while it has been sad watching it alone after your grandfather has passed away, you enjoyed watching the games, especially the euphoria from seeing your team winning. You want to continue enjoying meatloaf, your favorite dish that your grandmother used to make, and it served as your everyday lunch for the past 20 years. Despite all the bad memories you have suffered your whole life, there are some good ones hidden in between, such as the times with your late grandparents. Safe to say, you felt closest to them, as they were caring, attentive, and optimistic: qualities not present with your current friends and family. In a way, watching baseball games and eating meatloaf help you remember those times as you endure the years of hardships. You thought, \"Perhaps it will be easiest to keep those traditions as an American. Sure, I can adapt to the new body's circumstances with the power of these nanoprobes, but it would be easier to keep <i>some</i> aspects as an American regardless. Plus, I could always switch hosts later, so I could try others as long as I can access the machine again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the download continued, you felt yourself losing your senses. Over time, everything went numb and pitch-black, as your consciousness became its own separate entity. You knew that based on your calculations, it might take a few minutes to reach your target body and control it from inside. Soon, a screen popped up in your \"virtual\" world, a space programmed in your probe. It showed the current scene in the lab, where every volunteer has gathered for their \"tournament\". As you wait patiently, you could only hope that the probes stay true to their course, and there are no outside interference in your path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was your target?</span></div></div>",

While the skater teen seemed like the best choice for that nostalgia trip you wanted, you thought that you would want to experience something new. After all, you invented these probes to have a refresh on your life, and being an American teenage boy again doesn't quite fit under that definition. There was also the fact that you broke up with your girlfriend several years ago due to her complaint of the lack of time you spent with her, even though she was a biological researcher herself. It has puzzled you to this day why she would be so upset about the lack of time, even though research is an integral part of her career. Perhaps having a woman's perspective could help with that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou observed the business woman as your probes slowly inch their way towards her. She was a young looking woman, probably in her mid-20s, with curly brown hair flowing down a couple inches past her shoulder. She had light make up on, and combined with her shades that are now hanging on her forehead, it gives her a svelte professional air to her appearance. The rest of her attire consisted of a black unbuttoned blazer, a spring green silk blouse, a tight black pencil skirt that currently covers half of her thighs, and black stiletto shoes. She was playing a card game with an Asian man, and judging from her fidgeting and constant foot tapping, things might not be going her way. You were still perplexed by the unfolding of this situation, how a simple ad would blow up to a series of games in your lab. It made you wonder how to resolve this mess when you obtain your new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, you saw on the monitor that your probes have entered the woman's mouth. Fortunately, your probes were too small to see to the naked eye, so you highly doubt she noticed. Now, it should be within several seconds when the probes begin uploading your consciousness to her brain. You were filled with both excitement and apprehension at what would happen next.</span></div></div>",

The backup system, constantly uploads the path and makes sure it\u2019s the same as in their memory banks. Even if it would be disabled, the probes cannot be stopped from their programming now. But just in case, you locked every panel on every machine with a secure password during the program\u2019s execution. Only after you have your new body, they would unlock. You placed fake plugs in the wall, in case children rip them out, the real power cable goes straight in the ground below the equipment. Everything in there is made sturdy, so breaking stuff will take a long while. Though, you guess if someone shoots a gun in here things can go wrong, but that still wouldn\u2019t stop you from becoming someone else. Even if someone would shoot you in the head now, the probes can still extract the data and save you. The probes have their own method of gaining power, they basically convert kinetic energy to power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh a little evil in your head. You think maybe you\u2019re a little over reacting with the measures you took, but it is necessary. The only way you could be stopped, is when someone comes with a bomb and kills everyone or when someone creates a massive EMP, destroying the Nanoprobes. The chances are so low, it\u2019s unlikely to happen. Especially with all these people around. You laugh a little evil again, convincing yourself you have nothing to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were calm for a few seconds you think and then fall asleep. Everything darkens, then suddenly at some point, the nanite eyes of your probes convert an image to your mind, creating a virtual image of what is really happening in the lab. Basically you can see everything that is happening now, with maybe a millisecond delay. You can also see the position of the probes, by red dots within this 3D map. It looks like a large red mist that comes out of your body\u2019s mouth and flies toward the target. You always thought it went a lot slower, but your Nanoprobes are quite fast actually. It takes maybe two minutes to reach the target and probably some more for them to enter the body. You feel relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a close look at your target body and notice a small bar, like a health bar in a game displayed.. You immediately understand that is the meter indicating how long it takes before you lose sight of this virtual image, like you programmed. After wards the upload will start and that body will most likely faint for a moment. You can\u2019t wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Soon you'll be... too-</span></div></div>",

Both of them are French. When you think of France and what you want to do in your new life you think you clearly hit a jackpot and have no regrets selecting this target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are playing a game of crackers. Apparently your target body isn\u2019t in a winning position. The opposing one already has three doubles and won one game. Then you realize there is one thing you forgot. If someone loses, wouldn\u2019t he or she immediately go away since there is nothing left to win? With that in mind, you resolve is about to be scattered. You just hope everyone stays where they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check the bar and the red mist. As the mist is shrinking in size and entering the body the bar fills. It\u2019s already over half way. You take an imaginary swallow and pray everything goes well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Please make it happen. Do not fail. Please.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a few minutes later you see the world, the virtual image collapse. Everything darkens again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(It\u2019s time.), you think. One moment ago you saw your target body in virtual image form, now you\u2019ll become one with it. You\u2019re clearly impatient. You really wonder what your life is going to look like now. This is one heck of a drastic change for you. You want to know and to be. You wish yourself high luck with your new body and somewhere in your mind you think pretty evilly the words: (I won). You successfully defeated the impossible and obtained a new life. You already know it. The upload will succeed. You know it. You feel as if you\u2019re about to have an orgasm, but in a different way. Unimaginable excitement and happiness. Highly curious of your new life, you guess you don\u2019t really know what to think, but you\u2019re sure it will be awesome. Finally you\u2019re saved from your prison-like hellish life, your broke scientist life and those connections. Everything will be cut officially. The shape of a clear figure that you have in your mind gets stronger and stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can fully imagine the shape it has, what it is. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It\u2019s a little drastic, you know. You disliked your life so much that you rather not be reminded of things you\u2019d constantly had to do over and over. The ritual gain of a daily man\u2019s life is a reminder of the endless seeming loop and connects those things to memories and your past. You realize the only way to break free was with a choice like this, one choice that made sure you won\u2019t have to do with that life anymore or it being similar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to be far away from everything. Your home wasn\u2019t the best place. You didn\u2019t like your town either, nor your contacts. It\u2019s only obvious you\u2019d choose something like this. You\u2019re certain of it and yet, somehow it feels a bit strange too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your past life you had only two friends at high school, but you never spoke with any of them after graduating. Of course you also had your crush, but you only started seeing her after graduating which is ironic. You didn\u2019t like home. Your mother who now is fifty-two was a weird one. Most of the time she was a bitch blaming you for everything, but sometimes she pretends nothing happened. Your father was very kind, but never home. You barely know him, you guess. Of course there was also your siblings, but the only one bothered to even speak with you was your youngest sister who is currently twelve years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had to guess, you whole birth was a mistake. Your mother shouldn\u2019t have a child at that age she got you, let alone you became nothing but a reminder of everything that went wrong to her after wards, including her depression periods. So she complains to you even for no reason. You guess that\u2019s why you were always distant from people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool didn\u2019t help you either. Because of your weird behavior probably caused by your mom forcefully make you do things all the time which you couldn\u2019t refuse, because if you did she\u2019d make you so sad and abuse your feelings and the situation and if you say no she made you heavily sad, that you\u2019d regret saying no even if you only did it once. Of course you realized this all was just her way of being in control when you went into puberty. You still can\u2019t believe she was just blackmailing you all the time and driving your kindness and feelings in the floor for her own pleasure. Of course she was nice and hiding her true self all the time towards others, but anyway, it caused you to mistrust a lot of people. Especially since your mom remained nice and when you told someone what she did to you, because of her behavior they\u2019d always think you were lying. No one believed you. So you can guess how school went after wards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got teased a lot, never really socialized. You never really lied in your old days, but people just called you a liar all the time anyway. You learned you had to lie in order to avoid a lot of pain from teasing, as long as it was believable. But during your middle school period, you realized you were all wrong. It\u2019s just an unfair life. People only accept what they want to hear and want to see, but that doesn\u2019t make it right. As the same thing goes for your being. Your mom tried to force you into a direction and all you can do is pretend to be closely to it, but it doesn\u2019t really fit with the puzzle. So you also strongly feel like you haven\u2019t been yourself at all, that you weren\u2019t really alive and you couldn\u2019t develop your you. You even started regret distancing from people, not listening to them, but no one wanted to be in your neighborhood. So you decided to change a little and become more honest and social.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem is what happened to you traumatized you. You had developed this sort of fear, causing you to keep distancing yourself from people anyway. You could never find the right words when you spoke with someone random for something random or you\u2019d just feel you couldn\u2019t trust the person in front of you, because who knows what he might do or tell your mom and then the whole loop would start over. You hated to be teased too, but that didn\u2019t really happen on middle school either. People just kept distance. Of course your words sounded a bit harsh too. Your life was mainly trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill two people decided to be with you through the years. You\u2019re glad that happened. You liked them, but in the last year on high school they seemly distance themselves from you as well. You felt betrayed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was this one girl you had a crush on, but never dared to go to or speak to or even look at. The problem was she was a lot of people\u2019s crush, a beauty and a cheerleader. Even though you guessed she wasn\u2019t your type, she started seeing you after graduation and thanked you for giving her space. Apparently she liked you too. Too bad she betrayed you on your twentieth, just when you had bought a ring for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t really mind those betrayals, they are just add-ons, more reasons for you to continue the project you started working on during your second year high school. You needed a way out of your life, things are just a constant pain. You were glad you could live on yourself when you got eighteen, but you felt it wasn\u2019t enough. You were right\u2026 A lot more things happened which you regret. For years you have wondered, you can\u2019t even recall for how long, why you were born. Why like this and why in this life in this form with this face? You were never sure, but you felt like something was wrong. You felt like if your life was okay, if your mother was normal and if you had a social well status you\u2019d probably be happy with your life, but as time passed you were doubting that was possible. You shouldn\u2019t have been born with them at all, was your conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter high school, you went to college and after wards got a job. Your only friend was science and logic and of course the project. You forced yourself to become smart, to study science and become a nerd, all for the sole purpose of finding a way to escape life and develop the Nanoprobes. As you did all that and time passed, your social problems faded. What was left was a deep scar, that makes you a bit harsh to others even if you don\u2019t want to. Still, now that you have a working project, now that the project is active and your plans seem to take full effect, now that you are finally able to escape your life, you feel like you can forget everything completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo you don\u2019t doubt the choice. Your country, your neighbors, your contacts, everyone you knew they all abandoned you. If not worse, they just rubbed it all in. You strongly feel that way. Getting out of this town is something you have been wanting to do. Getting out of the states is even better. Getting out of your life, awesome. Getting out of your body and obtaining a different one, excellent. Becoming something entirely different with a different past and yet still being able to life, perfect! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would probably be weird for a while, knowing there are differences between male and female humans, but you think it\u2019s something you can get used to. You\u2019d probably enjoy it even, mainly because it\u2019s not the old you and who knows, maybe there are lots of more things you\u2019d like. Becoming a woman who is French speaking, that idea makes you dream. You think you\u2019ll enjoy it on many levels and you haven\u2019t even thought of the sexual parts. Strangely you prioritize a lot of other things, but now that you start thinking about it slightly, you can\u2019t help but to start to feel a little bit exited on that level as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou honestly don\u2019t know what to do at the moment, there are so many things you want to try. One thing you do know for certain is that you can\u2019t wait to open your eyes and try out your new body, your new voice, your new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-An \u2026 life-</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s the type that gives a lot of hugs and cookies to her dog, her little baby. You had thought about it for a while, but decided not to include it in your selection list, because you\u2019d have lack of freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother one brought a retriever, a typical dog. It belonged to a guy who looks like one that been through a lot and lived in the country for decades, also the type that likes to fish and dresses a little in that old country fisherman style.

It could take a long while to arrive after all, the distance is much bigger than just in this room and if a small breeze blows your airborne nanoprobes will spread out and it will take a while for them to recollect together and even enter the bird\u2019s body. This is a real test and a huge gamble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the bird gets too far away, you\u2019d be screwed. The spread nanoprobes are programmed to take the target in range and within a certain time. If it gets out of range and the time is has passed, then they would simply collect together somewhere where most of them went to, to communicate allowing you to select a new target for them in live mode. But you\u2019ll only be able to do that if they are collected together, meaning within a certain range of each other. If that range is too big, it\u2019s feel like a second when it is an hour or something. Time skips and you wouldn\u2019t be able to notice it. Also, they need to be close to each other to send reliable digital imaging to your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knows where the probes might end up to. Something could have breathed most of them in. In that case they\u2019d most likely pick that person or animal as target and start uploading you into something you have no idea of what it is. Well, you guess you had your fun. You already started the process after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA headache followed by loss in feeling, movement, hearing, sight and taste, followed by the loss of your consciousness take place in a very quick rate. You\u2019re not sure how much time passes. As you could think, you know something went wrong. The visual imaging doesn\u2019t take place, so you have no idea what is happening. The sensors on the probes should have send you some info of what is going on in the world, but you guess something is disrupting the signal. Maybe a phone or something. Oddly enough you can still think in the darkness. If it was strong enough to disrupt, the pieces of data spread over the extremely small probes floating in the sky shouldn\u2019t be able to communicate like a brain if that was the case and purely rely on the backup system in your lab, meaning the signal transmitter and your computer. You know there isn\u2019t much air flow in the lab, still it is possible that something or someone is causing your probes to separate even further, something you didn\u2019t count in on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice a sort of loss conscious flash. You realize something is happening and think you skipped time just now. You wonder what happened and thinking about a lot of possibilities, you realize you just have a scientist mind even though you wanted to lose it, your whole life. Is that also the reason why you picked a pet at the moment of truth, you wonder. You think something cursed you. Then suddenly you feel very weak again and fall sort of asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to wake up slowly. You hear something softly rumbling. Something is moving your feet and you have trouble maintaining balance, you could tell, but something did gave you balance. There\u2019s something strange about your feet too, you feel as if you\u2019re grabbing something with your toes and stand strange. There is also a soft breeze you feel sliding over your arms. You think your body hair is making weird motions because of that too. The noise gets louder. You yawn and open your eyes. In front of you, you see a window and below it road moving towards you. Somehow the platform you\u2019re standing on is a bit instable. It shakes like a swing with every bump motion the place makes. You think you\u2019re in a car or a bus, but somehow everything looks extremely big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice a huge nose between your eyes and colors around them. You stretch and notice your arms and hand are placed strangely against the side of your body and your feet feel weird and yet they feel as if they are relaxed in their original state just like you\u2019d normally have when you let your arms hang loosely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilt your neck and startle. You saw all kinds of red colored feathers, you whole arm was covered in it. Your chest had white feathers. You move your arms and open your hands wide and notice white feathers on the bottom side there. Then you realize they were wings. The tips of the wings had green feathers. You could feel a tail too, which had a similar wing pattern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered if you were dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sight focus loosened. Behind you were lots of human heads sticking above each other. Several rows of chairs filled with lots and lots of people in each column. You hear a lot of them speak right through each other, it\u2019s not really understandable. You tilt your head back forward and stand normally, well you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s normal, it feels so restful, it\u2019s almost sitting and you know you\u2019re slightly tilted forward instead of sitting straight, due to your size and weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized what happened and what you now were, you just couldn\u2019t believe it. Yet somehow it all feels weirder even if you think about it. Your breathing is accelerated in comparison with your previous body, you don\u2019t however feel faster thinking, but you can diffidently move and see faster. You stare at the road and notice several signs and trees. It doesn\u2019t look familiar to you. Suddenly a man next to you stands up, making you startle. You keep him in your sight for a while. The man speaks in five different languages, saying you\u2019re going to some Hotel for the night soon, but first stop at the next town for some sightseeing. You realize you were dragged along the touring bus. That can\u2019t be a good thing. You just wanted to be a bird for a moment, not forever you suddenly feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey.\u201d, you say. Your voice sounds weird. Your first try on the word hey sounded like a wraaye. You try again. \u201cHey\u201d. Now it sounded like a hrey. Better but not good enough. You guess if you lengthen it it sounds like a typical parrot squeak. Your voice doesn\u2019t make it any better either. It\u2019s hard controlling what words come out with beak and these vocal cords. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes my friend Perry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man that was just telling about the plans suddenly turns his smile towards you. You can\u2019t believe he called you Perry. You start to regret your choice already. If only you could get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I get out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHo ho ho, of course. Everyone gets out at the next town, including you my friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though your words are sounding better, this isn\u2019t good. You\u2019re not sure what to do now. Maybe you should jump out of a window. You\u2019re a bird after all, you should be able to fly somewhere. The man looks at you concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs everything alright Perry? Normally you say things short and twice, followed by some whistling. Are you feeling okay my friend.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA passenger behind him immediate drags his attention with a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, birds can\u2019t talk. Well, he can, but he doesn\u2019t us. Leave him alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerry is smarter than you think young mister. He is a genius.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah I know. He can always find it\u2019s home even if you\u2019d throw him out of the window right now, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, basically yes, but you should not be so mean to Perry. Perry is a beautiful bird and a friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is right, you\u2019re not really acting like a real parrot yet. Maybe it gets you into trouble if you keep this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine.\u201d, you say followed by some weird squeaks and whistle sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere there is my Perry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and try to act as bird as possible. You feel like a living camera. The bird has some sharp eyes and a nice tunnel vision focus. Very detailed. You side step and turn your face towards the back and see if there is any open window, while tilting your head sideways from time to time. No luck. Suddenly the car needs to break, lifting the swing on which you stand up almost hitting the ceiling. Without thinking in a startle you grab the wood with your feet and flap your arms and hands a few times to rebalance and turn face forwards. While the swing is swinging back and forth and you are trying to maintain balance you look outside. There is car parked outside in front of the window on a very sharp turn with little view on the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIdiot\u201d, you say and let out a little rage roar, followed by a laugh in your head. It felt a little itchy when your tail got hit by the ceiling, but your reaction time was amazing. You don\u2019t understand exactly why you did what you did, but you think you\u2019re starting to get the hang of controlling your current form. This body feels in very good condition and you\u2019re glad. You can\u2019t wait to try out flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry Perry, my friend. Here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man hands you a nut or something. You grab it with your beak and somehow it smells eatable, or maybe it\u2019s your imagination. You use one foot to hold it a little and move your beak yaws in a rapid motion to quickly twist and peel of the cover. You break the nut into pieces. Then with a few bends up and down you can swallow the nut. Yummy. You blink a few times and startle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow the heck did you know what to do. It seemed so logical, yet you\u2019re surprised to find that you can move your foot up that high. It must be you, you guess\u2026 or you\u2019re starting to connect with the birds mind a little. You just hope you stay yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passes, you\u2019re not sure how much. You were filling time playing with your beak in your wings a little. It was itching at some spots. Suddenly the bus stops and lets everyone out. You realize you can grab this moment to fly off to somewhere, or you could stay sand see what happens.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course you\u2019d run away. That guy who probably is your \u201cowner\u201d is freaking you out a little with his \u201cmy friend\u201d quotes and those tourists made a whole mess around your plans before. You think you have seen enough of them for one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for the last guy to leave, then jump of the swing using your arms, your wings, as a chute to land. You hop to the edge of the stair case and exit the bus with a nice jump and some flaps, landing in a grass field. That translator guy notices what you and offers his hand. You jump and grab his finger with your feet and try to maintain balance while he carries you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is weird, you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a nice breeze and decide to look around. There is a monument in front of you. You see a couple of roads and buildings, but only one tree. You guess there really isn\u2019t much to do here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man holding you replies with a  weird stare to your question.  You realize from this distance, you are slightly taller than his whole face which looks weird, so you give him the weird stare back. You wonder what the problem is, but then it hits you. It\u2019s pretty weird for an animal to ask something, let alone permission to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my young Perry. You are getting smarter by the minute aren\u2019t you? Where would you go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a small pause now. You wonder if you did something wrong again. Then it hits you and you correct yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHome. Home. I\u2019m going home.\u201d *whistle* *whistle* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 ho ho ho ho ho.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man pets your head softly and gives you a nut. You eat it in a record speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, I know you can find your way. Just be careful my friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump of his finger and take the skies, leaving with a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye, I\u2019ll fly.\u201d *whistle*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery flap makes your breathe rate accelerate. Your heartbeat increases. You flap your arms and hands and notice every push pushes you up and every lift balances you. You subconsciously move your hands in a weird pattern you feel, but don\u2019t mind since it is working in your favor. You lift your feet up and stretch your tail, noticing that where it to points you go. After taking several meters in the air you start to feel very warm and aerodynamic somehow. At some point you notice the winds get very strong allowing you to hover and take things slower, as well as getting to breathe at a little more accepting rate. You fly up slightly even higher. And then just let it float. You look down. it\u2019s amazing what this body can do. It feels really strong. You think you can fly for a while. The view is amazing. You let out a shout of happiness, but your bird voice made it sound really weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around for a little while and start to recognize where you are. It looks like the outskirts of a town you once saw on online mapping pictures. It\u2019s a few miles away from the hangar where your lab is. You think with a bus it takes about 20 minutes. It probably did so last time, you realize. You know the road the bus came from. It runs through a forest as well as some fields, but it\u2019s basically and mostly a straight line. You know your lab, the hangar, it was in is somewhere in the outskirts of town. This town is it\u2019s neighbor. It shouldn\u2019t be that far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you feel like you need a reason and direction to fly, you decide to go there. You\u2019re not sure where else to go. You find the right height so that the wind is in your favor and mainly glide your way back. While you\u2019re on your way, you enjoy the excitement of flying and view on the world. You feel like a  ruler of the skies. You feel free and be able to do anything, even though it is eating your stamina, especially when you\u2019re not looking forward. Several times you need to readjust your height to get the wind in your favor again and luckily you can feel whether you need to go up or down due to the wind blowing along your body, but still... you can tell you can\u2019t maintain this forever. Especially the take off was difficult and tiring, but anyway you aren\u2019t worrying too much about it. You\u2019re not planning on leaving south for the winter yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point flying alone becomes rather boring. Maybe because it\u2019s tiring. You seek distraction and so you came up with the idea of thinking weird stuff about every house you see. You also comment on cars and people. Eventually you get the idea of taking a dump on a car. You feel like something is building in your belly somewhere anyway.  You take a few careful calculations, not adjusting your speed and height you take careful look at how long a car takes to pass you along with taking in account the wind and gravity for how you must aim. Then with the next upcoming car, you give a sudden hard push. Some white warm shit is falling from your behind and you feel a little bit emptier. You closely look how it falls down, how it almost hits the front of a blue car and then, splash! It was a success. Part of the window on the driver\u2019s seat got covered in your shit. Very entertaining, though the winds make your butt feel a little bit wet and cold now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get near the town of your destination now. The hangar should be around here somewhere. You feel your tummy rumble. Sigh, you just had a nut already, but you guess you need to eat more. You think you left a bag of chips in your lab somewhere. If you could just find it. Ah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully circle down a little and try to maintain position in height as you look for a nice place to land. Oddly the door of your lab is open. Right, you left it open. Then you notice a black car. A guy in a business suit exits your lab and goes to the car, only to drive away after wards. You land on your lab\u2019s rooftop, the roof of a hangar and stare at the car as it is driving away. You could easily see the license plate and the man\u2019s face, but you have no idea who it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump of the building and head into the open doorway, into your lab. Everything is as you left it, only a lot quieter. All the people are gone, your body is gone. The rest is all still there. You jump and fly towards your desk and step towards the computer. Entering a code turns the screen on, which you do with your feet and beak.  The first thing you see is the log screen of your probe transfer. It was a complete success. You tick a few keys and ready for the next program, with is the original version. You don\u2019t think you want to stay a bird forever, but at the moment you have no problem with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump around one eighty degrees and jump again to fly towards a closet. You pull it open with your feet by flying and grab the bag of chips with your beak. At the same time a lot of paperwork flies around the room. You\u2019re making a lot of wind you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tear the bag open with your beak and grab a chip with your foot claw. You start eating some chips on the usual bird way, digging of not drilling chips down by pecking. After you ate three outside the bag, you decide it\u2019s easier to stick your whole hear inside the bag and eat like a monster. All the rumbling sound of the bad and your insane eating made you so busy, you didn\u2019t notice anything else anymore. It\u2019s just too loud and active, but you like it. Till the moment you startle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?! Rick Carter FBI. Is someone there? Uh.. what the?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly turn your body around. A face was sticking inside your lab from the doorway. (Shit), you think. You realize you have to hurry. Luckily this body is fast. You jump up and fly only to quickly land on your keyboard key to disable the monitor. Immediately after you jump and make a few flaps to land on top of the monitor, which you grab and hold sturdy with your feet. You give the guy a deadly bird stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, what\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother guy appeared. This one is probably his partner. A black guy with deep brown eyes and a nice old fashioned short haircut. He is pretty huge too. You wonder what his name is, so you know who to avoid. That Rick guy is white, has outstandingly huge eyebrows. Brown eyes and an average posture. He doesn\u2019t really look like a serious and kind guy. He looks more like the type that  teases people, but you can\u2019t judge on appearances you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 it was eating chips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s probably his pet or something. Man, I just can\u2019t believe he leaves it alone like this. Where\u2019s it\u2019s food and water?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here to judge people on their way of treating pets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the heck do they want? Just as you ask that, you hear a third male voice. A familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh excuse me. What are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRick Carter FBI. Mind If I ask you some questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear he startled. You know who it is, you just forgot his name. Maybe you should have paid more attention to people, not that it matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, what are you three doing here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman now joined the party. Who are they? Why the heck do the talk in the door path. Two outside, two inside. Sigh.<br>\r\n\u201cI could ask you the same question. Rick Carter FBI. This is my partner Kane Pennington. We\u2019d like to ask you a few questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few questions, well I have a few questions myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind showing us some ID?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSigh, it\u2019s always the same with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too fellow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guy doesn\u2019t sound like he is very confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do know one thing. You can\u2019t really let them snoop around without your permission, but at the moment you can\u2019t really identify yourself. You probably won\u2019t be taken very seriously if you\u2019d talk to them since you\u2019re basically a pet. Maybe you need a human body after all. In that case they need to go inside, which you rather have not. What should you do?</span></div></div>",

You notice the two FBI agents are looking at each other for a second and then back outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm look, he needs to talk to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe needs to talk with me first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, we\u2019re the FBI.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust because you need to talk to him doesn\u2019t make it so that he needs to talk to you. He always has the right to refuse and besides, I am sure he\u2019ll talk to you after we have had a little private conversation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight and again, who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSigh\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence enters, but then suddenly all hell breaks loose again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIMF? What the hell is the IMF doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell excuse me. I\u2019m just here for personal reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. Well, you\u2019re interrupting an official federal investigation. Please go do your business elsewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman walks inside, making you able to see her clearly and as if a coin fell, you almost immediately fell in love. She looks young, about aged in the twenties. She has blue eyes and this cattish seductive look in her eyes. Blond long hair wrapped up in a long pony tail which has a few decorations and leans on her shoulder so that most of her hair is in front of her. She wears a black opened blazer with a white blouse underneath of which both the sleeves are wrapped up a little just below the elbow. The top buttons of the blouse are opened showing her beautiful skin and her chest decoration which is a golden necklace and partly a nice looking bra and a pair of breasts. She also wears black trousers matching her blazer and a pair of black heels which also reveal skin. You could tell from the cloths she isn\u2019t poor. Probably a capable of a lot too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou startle when she suddenly looks at you and approaches. Those eyes are demonic, they completely freeze you and make you feel as if you\u2019re being blessed by heaven. Someone in your head you want to shout for help, but everything else just triggers weird fantasies. You cannot hear what they say and what she says as she approaches you, all because of your manly hormones and perverted fantasies. Suddenly she touches you in your neck. You could see white wings behind her, wrapping around you. She is trying to tell you she loves you. Are you in heaven, you wonder. Of course that is all in your mind. What really happened was the following. She saw you, took interests immediately and starts petting you below your neck, because you\u2019re a parrot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy aren\u2019t you a cute little parrot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you can\u2019t come in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou told me to go elsewhere, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head around and stopped touching you. You could not get your eyes of her. Her skin was beautiful and as she turns her face back towards you, you could see the darkness in the split between her two breasts. It turned you on so hard, you got frightened. You want to avoid losing yourself in your fantasy again so you look elsewhere but her lips suddenly turn into a smile, making you look at her again. It was too late. Her face is too much and that body. You sink away into your inner perverted world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHooot\u2026 hot babe. Tell me your name. Marry me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuch, that came out wrong. Heck you did not even want to say anything. You feel completely embarrassed, but she just smiled and laughed a little, causing you to loop back into her charm and your fantasy mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you could talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the FBI agents do not really know what to do anymore. They just talk to each other a little till the third guy walks in. Obviously you heard that on the background, but you were too focused on the girl that was treating your feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh you know, you all can\u2019t come in here. It\u2019s not your place, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great, now you too start fighting our protocols.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys\u201d, the girl suddenly interferes. \u201cWhat do you think of this parrot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not important right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl points her finger in her jaw and looks up. She looks so cute. She turns her face towards the FBI agents and suggests something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it is because someone is going to need to take care of him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the FBI is busy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns her face towards you again and starts petting you with a smile. You think you can\u2019t handle it much longer. Meanwhile the other FBI agent, Kane was staring silently at a machine in your lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRick, what do you think this is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have honestly no idea, but it\u2019s clearly made for humans to use.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the girl stops petting you and walks towards it. You were nearly coming too, you think. Disappointed you look in their direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were staring at your original nanoprobe machine. It uses a different set of nanoprobes and smaller vials. It injects nanoprobes into the invader, which then download the whole consciousness and then they return to the machine, which then sends the nanoprobes into the host, where the consciousness is being uploaded. It works excellently. The problem is the nanoprobes left in the host are basically scrap metal after wards. So you need another vial if you want to transfer again. Eventually this causes metal poisoning to the body if you do it too soon so there should be a long delay between uses. It is also less portable. With your new nanoprobes, which are airborne, you basically only need a computer and some software. If the target body is in range you could reuse the nanoprobes in your current body, by uploading a new command set using the right software and they would start downloading your brain and leave your body, traveling through air to the target. So you think it failed a little with the giant heavy machine. As these were much safer for health too. However it is completely operational if turned on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman turns it on. A display shows some images.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, didn\u2019t you ask what it was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not me. It was my partner, but anyway, don\u2019t you know what happened here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agent who calls himself Rick all the time places his hand palm in his face and continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick walks around nervously. Meanwhile his partner is taking a look at some of your barrels and closets, opening them and peeking inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude whoever lived here has some strange intentions. What do you think this is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is holding a vial, a piece of glass filled with a little bit of mercury looking liquid, which he took from one of the barrels. Those are the nanoprobes for the machine that was just turned on. This looks bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl steals it and places it in the machine slot. Everyone looks weird at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? It was in the instruction here\u2026 They are for this machine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the two pods their internal lightning activates. Kane draw out a different vial from another barrel. One with what seems like water. It is actually the new type airborne nanoprobes, solved in hydrogen with salt, made ready for programming and injection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis one has a number on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick looks at Kane and starts thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is a lab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think is going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess he was trying to make a mercury bomb. The transparent liquid is obviously nitroglycerin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe places the vial back quickly. They aren\u2019t very bright. The numbers you put on the transparent vials are for group indication, which you need for their programming. Sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he was making bombs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl suddenly makes a suggestion. It sounds like she has more brains then these two. The two man walk towards her and stare at the screen. The woman walks into a pod and starts taking a closer look at the sensors and lights inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe screen clearly displace this has something to do with humans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah, this machine was also limited to human only. The injector needs to be at the right height after all. The girl continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought it was supposed to be a scanner of some kind, but it looks more like it creates some sort of link between two people. I\u2019m not sure why it would need mercury to operate though. It cannot be good for your health.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think he was experimenting on humans?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this suggests it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, I\u2019m calling the federal computer analysts and forensics. Kane!? Call the analysts and forensics.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, as for you. I still am going need to ask you a few questions, so stop what you are doing before you get involved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInvolved in what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm.\u201d Sudden words come from a dark corner in the lab. Everyone startles. The woman hits her head against the pod. A loud <i>BEEP</i> immediately echoes through the room, the entry door closes and locks electronically. At the same time the pod lid closes and locks, waiting for the other one to be filled to begin transfer. Rick freaks out. Kane dropped his phone. You nearly jump of the monitor. Everyone suddenly looks in the same direction. The third guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings are about to go wrong, will you act?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cUh, help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear soft bangs hitting thick glass. The woman is struggling inside the pod and cannot seem to get out. Of course you know the reason why. It\u2019s part of the programming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan someone get this pod open?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about the door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent Rick notices the front door got locked as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere seems to be some interference. I can\u2019t make a call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent Kane attempts many times to call someone without luck. Everyone sighs and turn their faces towards the third guy. The silent one who suddenly spoke and started this chain reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. You were here too. Well, it\u2019s all your fault. We got locked inside this lab, without food, without water, without phone signal, we\u2019re screwed. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh Rick, we have phone signal, but something is just jamming it. We also have water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKane points to the water tab on a lab table. That was pretty mean of Rick to blame everything on the third guy. You know him, it\u2019s always been like this. He just has a bit of a low presence issue. No one notices him and when they do he either gets teased or causes bad luck for others. Well, it\u2019s not his fault. People just don\u2019t take the time to notice him around. Now he looks sad to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for correcting me Kane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick is pissed. He kicks the wall, which you had enforced with metal plating, causing a loud sound to echo. Then he starts pointing fingers towards the closed pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s all because of you. If you would have just listened to us, if we could just have a bit of a word, we wouldn\u2019t even have been in here, let alone in this situation. We have a protocol. We have an investigation to handle and you, you\u2019re just being in our way, obstructing our investigation. When you get out of there, I\u2019m going to have you get arrested for this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell excuse me then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third guy stares at the machine, more precisely at the closed pod with the woman inside. He places his hand softly against the glass and she does the same at the same spot. They\u2019re staring each other in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Rick retains focus and checks the console on the machine. He presses all sorts of buttons, but nothing much happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKane, you try it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKane now checks the same console while Rick is watching. The third guy is distracting you strangely as he is playing with your feelings right now, feelings for her. You\u2019re still on top of the monitor on your desk, which operates most of the system remotely. Everything in your lab is connected, so you know the machine\u2019s protocol closed the front door. Normally your electronic card comes in handy, but since your body was taken somewhere by someone the woman is in some bad luck. The only way to save her now is with the abort command which has to be inputted on the device directly. You could activate your airborne nanoprobes thought and take possession of a new body. That would overwrite the current program, because it is in waiting phase, waiting for someone to enter which pod holds the invader and which the new host as well as for the other pod to be filled. No actual transfer has started yet, so when you start a transfer with your own probes it should end with resetting all programs, unlocking the door and pod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem is, you\u2019re a big bird currently. You need to jump down and if you enter a code they can easily take over your console unless you quickly activate the program, so you have no time to type all sorts of things to find a way to open the pod from here. You could fly over to the console on the machine and enter the abort code there, but you\u2019d probably be chased away since they are foolish. Maybe they\u2019ll even tie you up for not listening. You can\u2019t risk that. You feel so useless at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is someone who can save her though, the silent guy. You still can\u2019t remember his name, but you remember he came here a lot, which is awkward. For some reason people easily forget about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe first came to your lab while he was wondering off far away from home, so it was pretty random. Since you didn\u2019t expect any visitors and the lab was a sauna due to summer time, you had the door open. You startled so badly that day. It turned out he was extremely smart, like you. Too bad he has some communication issues. He is the most introverted person you have ever met, well you guess you can\u2019t blame him. What\u2019s weird though is that he is extremely kind and compassionate, even though he basically went through the same thing as you, if not worse. His life is a hell, it\u2019s making him crazy, yet he always says \u201cbetter me then someone else\u201d. What the heck. You\u2019d go rage against god and make sure you\u2019d be able to escape your life, by building this thing. He could do the same, but he is just too busy being depressed, caring, inconfident and self hating. You don\u2019t get it, but that\u2019s because you\u2019re different even though there are so many similarities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to him, you altered your plan. He even helped you develop the airborne types and with the programming. Of course you mainly did all the work, but still he was able to draw it out with so much details. You just can\u2019t believe he never went to high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently he got teased badly and forcefully quit school early. With his past and that personality you can\u2019t blame him. He\u2019s incredibly weak footed, doesn\u2019t want to fight back because he doesn\u2019t want to hurt others. He got teased by his parents, by his neighborhood. Everyone called him a liar, which started because of his siblings who usually did something bad and abused his low presence by pointing fingers and working together. Since he didn\u2019t have a big mouth and couldn\u2019t prove the opposite, he was just being called liar all the time. No one believed him and took him serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he didn\u2019t get to have any friends, even though he is the type that would be appreciated by everyone, just because of people teasing him and his own misfortune. He is bad in communication skills because of a fear he developed. He never knows how to say what he wants. He looks normal, well quiet. Guess what the reason is. When he talks, something goes wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn about his twentieth age he got diagnosed with some sort of small form of autism, a so called developmental disorder. No one ever noticed, but ever since they take all his behavior for something autistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that, together with the fact that he was struggling all his life with gender identity issues he didn\u2019t understand till he was in puberty made things very unreal for him. He realized his mom was just using him, blackmailing him and his feelings into doing stuff. He got used by almost everyone. He never had a chance to say his own things and if he did he got punished, because it was wrong and against protocol. His family is pretending to be poor and he was supposed to be the savior or the person his parents could leech money from. He was forced to grow up as a perfect and normal guy, which is completely against his own true self and got punished for not being able to do that. His life must feel like a lie. He was most diffidently born in the wrong body and the wrong life, but with everything that has happened he isn\u00b4t being taken seriously since people don\u00b4t separate things once they are grouped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of that he can\u2019t get treatment for anything. Also because he has such low self confidence and persistence in himself and his opinions, he doubts everything due to his fear. The doctors he has just tell him everything he has is caused by autism, so he can\u2019t go anywhere. It doesn\u2019t matter he suffers. No one has money for him anyway, so a surgery would be too expensive. They always had some excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know all this because he told you, which made you hate society a little and since his relation with his family was so similar to yours you couldn\u00b4t help but to get a bit hating towards him too for reminding you of yourself, which you regret. You remember what he told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u00b4t matter. I don\u2019t feel like I am existing you see. They aren\u2019t actually teasing me. I\u2019m nothing more but a lie. They just tease what they see, which hurts but it\u2019s not me so, I\u2019m okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tells himself stuff like that every time something bad happens since he gets reminded of everything every time just to keep sanity. If he gets fired, no problems. If he gets hit, no problems. If he gets nearly killed, it\u2019s okay. It pisses you off a little how he cares about himself. He is depressed. He wants to kill himself, but he decides not to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you met him, you thought you\u2019d offer him a chance to run from his hell when you offered him a nanoprobe treatment. He could be anyone he wanted. He looked at you with those sparkling eyes of hope and turned to tears, yet he said no because he didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone else. He didn\u2019t want them to feel like he did, even though it\u2019s probably the only way. He also said he\u2019d be forced to serve you for the rest of his life is he did that, due to his honor. You couldn\u2019t believe it. Of course that was some time ago and your offer still stands. After all, when you get a new life you don\u2019t want to have anything to do with this anymore, you probably couldn\u2019t anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that time passed and your nanoprobes are completed and working, his suffering must have only increased. He is getting nearly crazy for certain and yet he is still quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is staring so hard at the machine and the girl inside. To him this must be like a sign from god. You realize he is considering to use it. If you were him you would. This is too much of a chance, it will only happen once in a life time. But you\u2019re not him. Heck you\u2019re not sure you\u2019d want that.</span></div></div>",

The FBI agents mumble something to each other for a while. In the mean time the woman locked up in her pod is still making close eye contact with the third guy as if they are lovers. You can see her mouth move, but you can\u2019t hear what she says. Maybe they are communicating or something. Suddenly the FBI agents turn their faces towards the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey kid, stop staring at her boobs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that comment, Rick immediately made the third\u2019s face turn towards him giving him the look as if he said something strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a fine plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can get me out of here?\u201d, the woman suddenly quotes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but the device doesn\u2019t seem to be doing anything, so we\u2019re going to leave it that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! But it\u2019s cramped in here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, your noisiness has reduced since you were in it. We\u2019d guess it\u2019s a bit sound isolated. While you\u2019re in there, you have no way of getting in the way when we talk to this guy here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?! That\u2019s not a\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so that brings us back to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turn their faces towards the third guy. He is a bit nervous all of the sudden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t leave me in here. Hey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman is completely ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Rick Carter FBI. Nice to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRick, we already did introductions with this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? Did we see his ID yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but for some reason I can\u2019t remember what it says though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm strange.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Hello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman is still ignored. She bangs and bangs on the glass then gives a sad hopeful look towards the third guy, who suddenly looks at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would help me wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to her. Hey look girl, he\u2019s busy with us at the moment alright?! Now then. What will you.. uh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick\u2019s comments didn\u2019t work. The third is distracted by the woman who looks helpless and seductive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you trying to pull?\u201d, he says to the woman immediately followed by \u201cWhat are you. What are going to do?\u201d which he says to the guy. It\u2019s silent for a few seconds, but then Rick starts commenting to the guy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, don\u2019t listen to her okay. We deal with situations like this before, we deal with it a lot. We\u2019re the FBI after all. She\u2019s darn beautiful, I have to admit. That standard seductive glance in her eyes and her current puppy glare should be ignored. I know it\u2019s difficult, especially with that way she dresses and her features, but keep it under control okay. Don\u2019t listen to her, just talk to us. You can listen to her all the time when we\u2019re finished, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime the woman comments on almost everything he just said, but is completely ignored till he was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey. I\u2019m not a\u2026 Well thanks but\u2026 say what? Excuse me? Ugh. What?! What kind of a reason is that?! Hey!! Morons!! Sigh\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey voice raised volume exceedingly the moment he started talking about her features and she hides them with her hands. Rick continues to talk to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, woman. I know you were trying to seduce the kid with your charms so he\u2019d be more interested into listening to you, then to any of us here. You know that would alter his opinion on how he thinks. We\u2019re trying to have a serious and free conversation here, so stop abusing your looks and keep those Cs or Ds, whatever they are out of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick turns his face towards the third guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where were you earlier today, at about 9 AM?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third guy looks at the closed pod. The woman inside is pissed off. Rick kindly pissed you off as well for treating her that way. Maybe you should start speaking. Then again, you\u2019re not really in the right bone to give an opinion at the moment. Maybe you should peck him instead. You try to keep your rage under control and watch what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did I tell you, keep your focus on me. Now go on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKane suddenly interferes. \u201cHey Rick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Rick angrily turns his head around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat bird is glaring. It\u2019s creepy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a parrot, it\u2019s supposed to be creepy. Don\u2019t be distracted by it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly everyone turns their heads to the silent kid. He startles and freezes up. Then suddenly the woman speaks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course he wouldn\u2019t say anything. You guys are scaring the crap out of him with your idiotic behavior.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, no one asked for your opinion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passes. The third guy walks towards the console on the machine and takes a look at the woman from that angle then at the monitor. He closes his eyes, but as suddenly Rick placed his hand on his shoulder, he startles and glares scared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, relax okay. Sorry for our rude behavior, but you need to understand. Anyway. You know how this thing works?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third guy looks down and back at the console, then at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you looking away like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe probably doesn\u2019t want to tell you.\u201d, the woman interferes. Rick doesn\u2019t pay attention to it though she is probably right. If he tells what he knows about it, his chance is immediately screwed. He wants to decide, you guess. You\u2019ll let him, but somewhere deep in your soul you hope he won\u2019t do it. You want her to be your girlfriend or something as she is. You\u2019re afraid somewhere of what might happen. What if you can never touch her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously sidestep on the monitor. The stress is getting a bit high. You feel like you need to peck something or flap your wings. It\u2019s really not good. You look around for any alternative options. All that is left otherwise will involve losing your bird body. Well, you could do that, but then\u2026 you think it\u2019s too short. You want to fly around some more. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have gone back here after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that bird doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou startle as Kane notices your noisy claw-like feet ticking the monitor edges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea.\u201d, rick says. He stares back at the kid, who touches a single button. A bleep sound draws everyone\u2019s attention back to it. Staring at the monitor, rick suddenly quotes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you changed the arrow between the two screens. It\u2019s on empty to filled now huh. What does that mean? Do you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third looks at the empty pod for a while. Then back at the woman, who stares strangely through the glass and back at the empty pod. He really is considering it. You notice his hands are shaking. It must be a really difficult decision for him, which you don\u2019t get. You would have claimed her an hour ago. She\u2019s an amazing woman. What\u2019s the point on waiting. Still and again he isn\u2019t you. In fact, that makes it a little troubling for you. Somewhere in your head you want to give it a go too, but problematically she is stuck in the pod. You\u2019re not sure if your probes can get in and if the machine activates while your nanoprobe process is still underway, she\u2019d have two sets of nanoprobes. You wonder what will happen. Who would be in control? You never tested simulations like that. All you know is too much metal in one system isn\u2019t good. Of course if your probes are faster and complete the process before the machine starts you can exit the pod before anything happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Darn risk, why did he have to set the direction now? If only) you stop thinking. You just have a dreadful feeling of hate now, which isn\u2019t placed right. It\u2019s not fair, yet it is fair and at the same time it is not. You should have been there, not him, but then again he probably deserves it better. Even so he\u2019d do anything for you, especially when this happens for him. You think of all sorts of bad things that could happen not in your favor and good things you could do if you were to become her, but then you feel bad. Besides, having her as girl friend seems much more appealing for you, but still not having unlimited access to that body, having to share it with a guy. A guy. Wait, he never felt like a guy. He hated being a guy. He\u2019s autistic. Is he a guy? Of course he is a guy, no he isn\u2019t. Technically he is, but wait..  Damn, you can\u2019t decide. Still, besides that matter there is a chance she\u2019d turn autistic, although he explained to you that it\u2019s a development disorder and thus if he\u2019d suddenly have a developed brain it should be theoretically cured, but still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole silence part makes you nervous. Not just you, you notice the FBI guys get impatient too as well as the trapped beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to save her, then do it already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third guy is silent. He shakes more and more though and puts his hands against his head. He is struggling whither to do it or not. Kane suddenly comments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you do know what it does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick suddenly interferes a bit dissatisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019ll make the right decision.\u201d, the woman quotes. Suddenly the two stare at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third guy\u2019s pressure is rising. Tsk, you think. He should just pull the switch and become her. You wouldn\u2019t have minded then, but all this silence made you doubt that decision. Jeez. Suddenly several tears drop from his eyes and his face turns red. Then he looks up to the ceiling, closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. His color returns to normal, and he is calming down. Well, his arms and legs are clearly still shaking. He looks at the agents and the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll save you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2026 he spoke. That has been a while. But what does he mean by that? He is still staring at the machine. Tears drop from his eyes. His lips move, but there aren\u2019t any words. What will he do? </span></div></div>",

It startled them. He then walks slowly into the empty pod, but as they realize he was about to enter it, Rick grabs his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the h-hell are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason he sounds nervous. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was because he spoke, you don\u2019t really know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words the third tries to shake his arm loose, but he doesn\u2019t let go that easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what you are up to, but this thing is dangerous. You should get out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust let me go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear drops from his eye, which startled him. He lets go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-this is the only way. The only way to safe us. I think that\u2019s why this happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gift of fate. I-I shouldn\u2019t decline it. It\u2019s rude! And yet\u2026 I am also afraid. Please\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 okay. Whatever. Just don\u2019t do anything crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Rick, don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a bad idea?\u201d, Kane intervenes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not even sure what he is trying to do, but all those weird emotions, I don\u2019t get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI trust him.\u201d, the woman suddenly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, whatever.\u201d, rick continues. \u201cOkay kid, go ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKane immediate grabs Rick\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBut sir!\u201d, he shouts. Rick looks at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201che probably knows how to save her and I don\u2019t think he would endanger himself in anyway and he seems to be knowing what is going to happen, even though he sounds ridiculous so let\u2019s let him be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third makes another bow and smiles. A tear still drops from his eye. He presses a switch inside the pod, causing it to close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u201d, he says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the trouble I\u2019ll cause.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to thank me hehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Rick, didn\u2019t he say trouble I\u2019ll cause?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe probably means I\u2019ve caused. He\u2019s a bit weird, just let him fix the problem. We can have a conversation after wards, right lad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third nods and then startles. The agents startle too. A thick wiring with needles is suddenly injected into his tummy. Some blood splashes on the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake cover.\u201d, rick says as he pulls a gun out of his pocket and starts loading it, taking quick aim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! You idiot. This thing is round and metallic. You\u2019d be killing him if you shoot right or one of us if you miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on shooting the pod, moron. I need to save them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman suddenly startles from the reaction the two make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust hold on tight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bang! Bang!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick shoots the machine connecting the two pods. The bullets however bounce off everywhere eventually hitting and staying in the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you! These things are refrained. Whoever made this must have thought of everything not to be disturbed. Seriously mad if you ask me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bang!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next bullet remains to hang within the machine\u2019s cover, completely flattened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it. Any other ideas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick starts aiming at the monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are raged. You fly off towards them and pick them on their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet your hands of my life\u2019s work you faggots.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is with the bird all of the sudden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe shots much have angered him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re damn right I am angry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to stop them from destroying your monitor. You land on a table near them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow listen you two, stop shooting stuff or I\u2019ll rip those noses of your foreheads.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the FBI is scared. They can\u2019t believe what they are seeing, you a bird talking to them and threatening them. You don\u2019t care anymore, how your voice sounds and what you look like. You just don\u2019t want every part of your life\u2019s work to go into vane. It took you a freaking twenty years to build after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKane\u2026 what the hell happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got nearly killed by a bird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKane\u2026 I\u2019m scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo am I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know how to deal with people, but animals. No way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew this would happen. Animals just pretended to be dumb, till one they they\u2019d conquer us all. You know, like alien invaders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you\u2019re over reacting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilence!\u201d, you shout. You can\u2019t believe them and wonder how the hell they get into the FBI in the first place. They\u2019re shaking a little so you guess they aren\u2019t joking, which is good. You walk to the edge of the table and stare at them thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow listen. I shall summarize your actions. First, you invade someone\u2019s house without his permission. Secondly you didn\u2019t have official permission to be here, which makes me wonder why you even went inside. Thirdly, you not only invade a house, you\u2019re destroying it now. What kind of a behavior is that? You call yourself civilized young man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilence!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back and forth sideways while still watching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume you\u2019re here to find out what happened, but I don\u2019t think you know anything. That\u2019s probably why you want to ask questions to everyone and yet you didn\u2019t even think of asking the one who lives here. Me. So then now tell me, what does that make you? Fools? Idiots? You\u2019re probably something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, that bird is scary. He\u2019s swearing at us and we\u2019re the FBI.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilence. It was a rhetorical question, like before. Again I am surprised what live brings me, but I was never expecting such rudeness from the government. You do not only treat me rude, you treat my home and my guests rude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop walking back and forth and approach them, with a sharp stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch rudeness is unforgivable, unless you happen to\u2026 apologize.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe FBI agents don\u2019t know what to do, they just stare at each other for a moment and then Rick starts talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry sir bird, but you must understand. We have our protocols. One of them literally suggests not to talk with animals to avoid health problems. We take things serious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain your destructive behavior.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry, we were just trying to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they realize they forgot something. Something important. They stare at the machine that suddenly makes a bleep sound. The pod hatches open up. The vent system is reactivated and the front door unlocked. Smoke exits the pods which is drained away through ventilation, revealing the two that used them. Both however appear to be unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKane checks the girl and Rick the guy. They conclude they both seem to have been injected with something in different places, but there is something off about the guy. He seems less stable then the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet an ambulance here. Now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the forensics and\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKane starts calling people. Rick looks at you. You\u2019re relieved and pretend to be a normal bird for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cidiot. Idiot.\u201d <i>*Squeak* Whistle~</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump fly to the top of the machine. Hop somewhat. Make some random sounds bird usually do. Quickly move through the room then stand somewhere they can\u2019t reach to keep an eye on them. You hop left and right there and be a bit more bird like. It is important to retain your cover. Rick finds you however so you tilt your head a few times and he points at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t fool me bird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know he can\u2019t prove anything and what is there to prove, that you\u2019re smarter than someone expects. Whatever. You jump and take flight to go outside, but while heading there, you land a little bit of shit on his face. You laugh as you do that and land on the hangar roof, thinking that\u2019s what you get for what you did to me, my lab and that hot girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about the girl and aren\u2019t sure what you should do now. You just wait and relax in the sun. There\u2019s no way you want to be one of those two idiots and fix things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gets dark. The two FBI nerds waited and looked outside probably for you. Suddenly an ambulance arrives. You quickly take that distraction moment to fly back inside your lab and land on the table. The two are still unconscious. That\u2019s odd.  At least one of them was supposed to stand up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of guys walk in with a cart. They noticed you, but didn\u2019t bother. They drag away the two injured.  The police arrives together with forensic investigators. The FBI talks with the police.  Some police agents walk inside to do some investigating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the second time today something really weird happened here. This place must be blessed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard that from outside, an old guy\u2019s voice. You wonder what he talks about till you heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 and there is no sign from the cause?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re investigating it right now, but have yet to estimate the cause of death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCause of death, you thought. Then a moment later you realize they were talking about you, or your real body. It died? You\u2019re startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear some talk about the article too as well as the bird, the threats and all sorts of problems you made for the government, which are especially on financial level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear some talk about where they are taking the two injured and learn the location. All they wonder now is who is going to take care of the bird.</span></div></div>",

Too bad her hero can never kiss her, since he wears a beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think strange thoughts as you realize in your heart what you should do, but at the same time you think why. Why do you feel bad. Parts of your old live shouldn\u2019t be important. Then again you have nothing else to do. You\u2019re not sure where else you could go to where you wouldn\u2019t feel annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigh, the world is cruel. You didn\u2019t expect this much drama to appear. Why is everything you do a problem? You make a device for yourself and others get involved, which cause them to get into trouble and then. Oh yes, eventually you get pointed at, since you were the designer. Sigh. Stupid life, you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou complain for a while and end up checking your arms, or should you say wings. You guess it\u2019s a positive point your device worked. You think you should have picked a different body from the start though. Flying is great and all, but this body is so limited in the social world. If only, if only there was some place you could release all your stress and turn it into power and excitement. Some place full of ero or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then realize what you should have used the device for. Your erotic desires. Damn, that would have been awesome, playing with boobies and\u2026 owh. You imagine a picture of normally filtered 18+ content of several beauties you know. (oh yeah..)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou startle. Why do you feel so exited? Something is strange. You can feel something harden somewhere but you have no idea where. You feel a little active too. You realize your thoughts are going in that direction too. What the heck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel that girl\u2019s finger still touching you, petting you at places very pleasuring. You jump startle, because there is nothing there. It\u2019s a memory, a strong one. Jeez, did she really made you that exited? You run a circle on the table and look through the doorway to outside. (God.) You realize you can\u2019t help yourself either. You think you need help, before it gets out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess it\u2019s the hospital then, for both reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a bunch of police men wearing big green gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, birdie birdie birdie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a parrot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere parrot parrot parrot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019re going to try to grab you. You didn\u2019t see this coming, but now that you do. You take distance. Once there is a clear path, you jump and start to fly, past them and outside. There some more obstacles form. Several agents set up traps, including nets, which you could see as you fly nearly in them. You manage to quickly turn and fly through the traps and past nets though, off to the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuckers, try better next time!\u201d you shout with your bird voice. You laugh a little which that sounds creepy. Again you elevate high into the air. You could see the sun setting down slowly. Again at the right height you calm down from all the strength you just used and with the winds help you glide towards town or more precisely the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city looks amazing from above. You pass several birds too, but they didn\u2019t really pay much attention to their surroundings. You know where it is luckily. It\u2019s the nearest hospital. Too bad it\u2019s near the center where it\u2019s usually very crowded especially at this hour. You decent slowly by circling and land on a nearby street light, facing your next problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(How do I get inside?) Why do you find yourself asking that a weird question now? You look around and notice a lot of people take a moment to look at you even while walking. Probably because of your outstanding colors, you guess. It didn\u2019t matter. What did was that you only notice the woman. It\u2019s as if your brain is filtering out all the men, you can\u2019t find any even though you know they are walking around and driving cars or bikes. You only see the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Crap, my ero level hasn\u2019t lowered.) You realize you\u2019re still exited. It\u2019s itching on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fly a little around the building and notice a few open windows. The problem was, they weren\u2019t open enough. Eventually you end up back at the entrance on the same street light. All the stamina you wasted for this. You take a deep breath, or at least let it feel that way. You\u2019re not going to give up though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice a few people entering and exiting the building. You decide to make your way in the moment someone opens the door flying. That way, you wouldn\u2019t be  noticed that fast, or maybe you would but they won\u2019t be able to catch you. You take the skies and when you see someone facing the door, you suddenly act like a dropping missile you spear your way past the head of that person and the doors into the hallway. You take a few turns and fly upwards at the stair case. A lot of people you come across either startle or scream. In both cases they make annoying sounds. Once is funny, all the time no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just followed the signs you saw for the most likely place they went to, but still you are doubting you should be here and guess you don\u2019t have much time till someone finds you. You land on the ground since flapping makes too much sound and hop your way further in. You hide in several places such as under tables and in rooms and closets. Of course you look around everywhere if you can find your contact. Since you can\u2019t you stop at the floor reception. You can\u2019t really see over the high desk though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a soft \u201chuh\u201d as reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what, who is there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman\u2019s voice with sounds like a rolling chair and some footsteps are your reply this time. You fly up towards the reception bar and stare her in the face. A girl dressed like a nurse with a stethoscope and ID card. She immediately startles upon seeing you and falls into her rolling chair, which hits the wall behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Holy crap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Lupine? I\u2019m looking for the man and the woman that were brought here by ambulance not to long ago. Can you help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s startled and silent for a long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit. Oh hehehe. I get it. It\u2019s a prank. Well done. God, you gave me a heart attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan this bird looks so real.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am real.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a few movements. Suddenly she faints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump behind the bar and stare at her body. It\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s hard to resist your inner feelings and desires at this point, but you have to for now. You\u2019re not getting a chance like this again. No one is around right now, you can access her computer, which you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peck a few keys and mouse some. It\u2019s difficult, but doable. Since you don\u2019t know the names, you search for the time of arrival. You get some hits and manage to narrow the possibilities down to 6 different rooms. Two of them are on this floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKu\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and stare at the girl that dropped. She\u2019s about 30 you think. Nice body. Half long curling brown hair. What interests you most are the covered by showing two hills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKu ku. Doctor, I have a patient for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fantasy starts making you say weird things as you plan something very evil and execute it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKu ku kuuuu\u201d, you say as you jump down with your claw feel spread, grabbing her uniform. You grab her top with your beak too and start ripping it open. Using your wings you rip it even further open, noticing you took some of the clothing underneath, revealing a white bra covering her hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScientific analysis indicates the hills were actually hot body decorations. Noted.\u201d You land on her and rip her bra lose with your beak. You lay down and start robbing your back against the flesh. You feel completely excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start licking it, which is only then you realize your tongue was pretty long. Long enough to leave the beak. Your excitement level raises a little. You make the dominate motion, which dogs normally use a lot and rub her body with your feathery belly. It feels good, but only in your mind. Somehow, it doesn\u2019t satisfy you at all. Maybe she isn\u2019t pretty enough. Oh well. You calmed down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerverseness works well after drama.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl wakes up and starts screaming when she sees you. You bite and lick her nipple once and fly off. You notice she is full of scratches and wounds now. Your claw feet aren\u2019t good for their health, neither is your beak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fly towards the rooms, apparently neither of the people were on this floor. Off to the next one. You go back into stealth mode, carefully exploring the fifth floor. You check the rooms you read and eventually you find one answer. You cannot however find the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you found was the room where the woman was supposed to sleep. You only know it\u2019s the right room, because of the basket with clothes left there. She herself isn\u2019t there. There is a small tree. You decide to stand on it and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nurse pets you and takes the basket away. Later a different nurse gives you some food. You hear conversations about you, or more or less the bird. They don\u2019t know if you endanger the patients health or not. They also wonder who your owner is and how you got there. No one remembers taking you in. Apparently dogs are allowed. Sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA doctor gets in too and checks your feathers then takes a sample. They conclude you\u2019re tamed well, since you behave and accept what they do and let you stay. Of course they must not yet have heard what you did downstairs, if that\u2019s their conclusion. You hear some strange conversations, but eventually you conclude they are still working on a treatment for her. They don\u2019t mention stuff about the guy yet though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Oh wow, it can talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Why is everyone so surprised you can talk? Seriously?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, the patient. The woman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you mean Miss Satin. She\u2019s getting treatment for the elevated metal levels in her bloodstream. Why am I even saying this to a bird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t scan her. The MRI can cause serious damage to her body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, smart bird. Sounds almost like he knows what he\u2019s talking about. Heeheehee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo is she ill?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer body isn\u2019t taking it very well. Heh. This is nuts. Oh.. It\u2019s almost like this bird can understand me. I am leaving. It must have been a long day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she leaves another nurse comes in with some stuff. She approaches you and starts taking samples of below your feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I need to test you, just hold still.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Wow, you can understand me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaah that explains why \u2026 oh god I am going nuts. Say, We\u2019ll be needing to wash you, do you mind if we take you to bath?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is standing so close to you that you could easily see her pair. She is pretty. The moment she mentioned bath it started working on your erotic levels of excitement again. You imagine a girl splashing water all over you while being naked with her in a bathtub full of pink soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you can take him. It\u2019s safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says towards the door opening. Suddenly a guy walks in with gloves and a suit as if he was about to commit surgery or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fantasy started changing. The girl replaced with a guy. Meanwhile the man picks you up and restrains your wings with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Aaaaaah!) You scream in your head. Then suddenly you wake up and stare at the man. You can move your neck a little to view his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re not giving me much freedom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you planning to do with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClean you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might have something the patients don\u2019t like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m good with animals. I have cleaned several dogs and read how to do birds too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, if you give me food after wards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty smart, for a parrot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely he accepts easily you can talk back to him. About ten minutes later he brings you back. You smell a little of the sprays he used. Apparently you\u2019re now bacteria free. He puts you on a stand they placed in the room. It\u2019s probably normally used for coats and jackets. He places a little box with bird food on the floor. You can\u2019t believe you have to eat that. Of course you asked him for info, but he didn\u2019t know anything. You were his only job for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump to the ground and start eating the weird food. It looks dirty but since you feel your tummy you eat it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later a doctor with a bunch of nurses come in, along with a bed. You fly jump towards the stand and took a closer look. It was the woman from your lab a while ago indeed. Miss Satin huh? She\u2019s sleeping and has an infuse in her arm. The nurses leave almost immediately, while the doctor checks the card and notices you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re the bird I heard about. You caused quite a ruckus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour boss is gonna be fine. She had some seizures, we realized she had an elevated metal level which caused a allergic reaction. Her body is filtering it out now just fine. She only needs some rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor tabs your head with his fingers and heads for the door, but you stop him with a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the guy that was with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor thinks for a moment and walks away. He ignored you. You feel a little prejudged. Just because of your animal appearance, he probably thinks you\u2019re dumb or something. You\u2019re not satisfied with that answer at least. You jump of the stand and follow him with hops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease answer my question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks faster. At some point he asks the nurses to stop you, but you evade them. Eventually the doctor heads in an elevator which closes before you could get near him. Suddenly you\u2019re surrounded by two men and six girls. They slowly approach you. You panic a little and distract yourself from it by looking at the chests. Eventually you jump up and fly right into one, landing softly with your face in her boobs. You grab her clothes with your beak and feet and tear it, flying off to your next target while evading another attack which came from a guy who now accidentally grabs her bra. Although it was accidental this time, you land in another set of boobs and follow the same procedure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear the girls start to scream and feel awkward. You stun by what you found just now though. They\u2019re pretty big. A guy tries to catch you from behind and you barely evade it. Accidentally you land your wings in someone\u2019s face and rip the sleeve open by tripping with your feet and trying to fly backwards. It was another girl. Now three of them are trying to hide their chest even though they are not completely naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, it is turning you on like nuts. You feel like you\u2019ve obtained a new title just now. Ero-bird, master of the sky. Suddenly you hear someone shout behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou.. monstrous\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nurse is pretty angry at you. She swings a coat stand like an axe at your direction. You barely manage to evade most damage. She hit the tip of your wing. You land on the ground and try to hop away, but then another swing comes forth. You had to jump and fly off again. Suddenly there was a guy in front of you, so you turn and try to evade them grabbing. Then you land in the neck of the evil nurse, who startles and drops her weapon. You slide down, but the sharp nail feet make you slide down slowly as they rip open her clothes and scratch her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYaaaa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour girls shout now a tremendous high pinched screech. Since you didn\u2019t want to fall, you instinctively grabbed something with your beak, which happened to be her bra and you accidentally cut it too. She startles and you fall on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-damn you perverted beast!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour red faces. One with breasts showing. It\u2019s getting too much. You enter ero mode and fly towards the remaining two targets, on purposely setting them bare. The guys don\u2019t know what to do as they are stunned. Every time they look, they get hit in the faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, like a missile, you fly towards the bras and cut them loose with your beak as you hit your target\u2019s chest. The girls get so weirded out they start to run while screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no you don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take flight once more and follow them. Imaginary you see before you a targeting system like that of a military jet. They all flee everywhere, Eventually you manage to lure them together causing them to hide in one certain room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKu\u201d. They can\u2019t hide from you. Your ero levels increase as you approach that room. You can hear them complain about you, but they eventually don\u2019t stand much chance. You slowly approach the door silently. Suddenly the door opens and you were about to hop in, but then startle. All of them had refreshed their cloths and carried weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly fly off away in a random direction avoiding personnel underway. You get chased by some hot angry nurses, but since this is not s dream it can\u2019t be good. You quickly hide in a room to shake them off and land of a railing. You saw the nurses run past the room and phew in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you turn around you startle badly. A striking beauty is smiling at you from her sick bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall of the railing on the floor. She was so pretty you felt your heart beat louder than you ever felt and immediately fell into a day dream. Landing on the floor didn\u2019t even hurt because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly wake up upon hearing a cute voice. You are on her bed. She is standing next to it. You stand up and look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer striking eyes form a gentle look. With that smile her kindness represents the sea of happiness. Signed by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you shouldn\u2019t think poetic right now. But seriously she is hot. A goddess maybe. She should do something more about her appearance for that though. Her hair is shoulder length, dark blond and a little messy. Her skin is pretty and western. Her eyes are blue, like a spring sky. Her smile, girly. Her face, extremely well looking and cute. She can easily go for model or movie star. You don\u2019t understand it yourself completely, but your thoughts say \u201cJack\u201d and \u201cpot\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am better than I ever was. Please be my girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god, you ero mode is still up and running. That was embarrassing, but she just smiled and laughed about it. She lifts herself back in her bed. It makes you wonder something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, why is a beauty\u2026 I mean why are you in a hospital?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI made a mistake I guess. Teehee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, glad you\u2019re okay then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not supposed to be okay. It\u2019s wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks sad. You feel drama coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(N-no, no no no no no. No drama. Ero. Why did I ask that? Give me ero, no drama.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh.. hm..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to stop yourself from asking what is bothering her. Something just tells you it will involve some drama, which will make you feel bad. You don\u2019t want that, really. But if you look at her you just can\u2019t help but to reconsider\u2026 maybe. </span></div></div>",

What were you exactly doing to get in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looks sad for a moment as she stares down, but when she looks back at you, you could see a smile. Her eyes are shaking a little. She hold her hand near her heart, looks to the room entrance once and back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops after saying one word and moves her other hand to her chest too. They  move a little in each other\u2019s palms. Her face turns a little red and she suddenly looks down again. She sways her hips a little. You hear small steps too. Suddenly she distracts you with her piercing vibrating eyes staring directly at you. Both her hands suddenly move towards the bed, slamming the blankets softly. Her right leg moves backwards and you think it\u2019s resting on her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it sounded serious, she couldn\u2019t finish it without her face becoming more red. She steps back to her normal pose and hold her hands near her chest. She looks at you with the same glimmer. Her mouth though shows silence. At least for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you get ridiculously exited, but different than before. She\u2019s beautiful. The way she acts is diffidently cute. You\u2019ve seen it in a romance movie once. Could this be, a love confession? You\u2019r e not sure how to handle it. It\u2019s putting a lot of stress on your mind. Everything combined makes it all nearly too much for you to stay awake. It\u2019s almost like a daydream, a fantasy. The problem is this is real. You\u2019re too stunned by it too. You can\u2019t move or speak. You can only see her and she slowly starts turning into an angel. Her wings are showing incredibly white. At the same time she gets surrounded by this pink aura with flower petals. Of course that is all part of your fantasy and you know it, but somehow she just makes the room bright and you only notice the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad\u2026 someone finally visited me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your fantasy broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t get many visitors.\u201d, she says when suddenly looking upwards and to the right. A few seconds pass. She looks back at you and bends through her knees to look at you straight in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pets you with her finger with a happy face. You\u2019re not sure if this is awkward, but at the moment you could easily see into her gown. Of course it\u2019s hospital standard, it didn\u2019t really matter, but what you saw underneath it. Two beauties, bouncing a little. Of course you noticed them before, but not this bare. You start to think she\u2019s perfect. Everything you wanted in a girl. (God, help me.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re still way to exited though. You can\u2019t control your thoughts and fantasy very well. All the erotic appearances, your perverted inner man, you\u2019re still in ero mode. You want to approach them, approach her, but she is just too clean. You don\u2019t want to dirty her with you, scratch her with your sharp foot, flap on her with your feather bed wings. Of course you want to do it so badly too, touch her everywhere you can and hopefully turn into a parasite that suddenly gets attached to her body and cannot be removed so you can keep touching her everywhere at  any time you like, but that\u2019s just from your weird perverted thoughts. Straight, on which you have nearly lost control over you want to be her boyfriend and marry her, protect her from people like yourself, have a life. You think she is the one. Love on first sight. You\u2019re not sure what to do now though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumps into her sick bed and looks at you. She taps the blanket near her, suggesting to come near. Nervously you walk there tightly grabbing the blanket with your claw feet. You look around nervously as well, but mainly at her. She smiles when you made it and starts touching you wings. Suddenly you feel like you have to say something and force yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 I- I- I- uh\u2026 Oh right. Heheheh\u2026 Yeah I kinda, I mean I did say something like uh\u2026 I mean uh, ehehehe\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, want to have a cookie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t parrots eat cookies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYikes.\u201d You completely forgot you were a parrot for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like cookies?\u201d, she quickly replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no no, cookies are fine. I mean good. I mean delicious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarn, even though your nervous current mind stops you from saying stuff you absolutely don\u2019t want, you\u2019re talking random words now. You\u2019re not sure what to say to her. Her face somehow charmed you more then you have ever felt. You try to distract yourself by looking at her chest. It\u2019s beautiful and it works a little. Your nervousness goes away, but your excitement levels are still fluctuating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you are beautiful. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you didn\u2019t want to say that, she seems to like the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just can\u2019t understand why someone would harm someone like you. You\u2019re kind, smiling, hopeful. You have an awesome bo- ,I mean uh shape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarn! You\u2019ve said it. The worst thing a man could say while a trying to hit a little on a girl he likes. You feel like you can\u2019t stay friends with her if this keeps up. You have to fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean uh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boobs however are distracting you a lot, as well as her hourglass shape, her roundness. Your words were true. She is nicely shaped. She could easily go for model or maybe actress. You realize your hormone mind is playing with you. You think about all sorts of stuff that make her beautiful, and then it hits you. Something a lot of people to prefer about themselves. A weird smile turns up in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean you\u2019re well in shape. You must take really good care of yourself and I think it\u2019s highly appreciated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBingo, the one words in your mind that is currently displayed. It even sounds a little evil. The reaction however isn\u2019t what you expected. The girl looks down a little. That\u2019s odd. You could even see a small tear starting to form, but she is still smiling. What is this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, but you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m actually not really taking very good care of myself. I uhm\u2026 I\u2019m not sure how to say it, but actually\u2026 heeh, saying it to a parrot is a bit weird, I think. Though I haven\u2019t been able to say it to anyone yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles as she says that. She even laughs softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I am a parrot. I am also very good at keeping secrets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause appears. She looks at you deeply. You somewhere wish she\u2019d stop that, it\u2019s too much. She\u2019s too pretty, and then suddenly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! \u2026 I mean uh, thank you for trusting me. I mean this bird body, I mean me. Yes. I was right the first time. Oh, I didn\u2019t mean to say that out loud. Anyway, please tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no real reason to exist. My life isn\u2019t very great, but not bad either. Everyone is nice to me and of course I like that, but actually. I\u2019m not good at anything and I\u2019m nothing more than a bother. I\u2019m in the way for everyone. I mean my parents pay for me, I take in space in their house, my friend always bothers to wake me up every day, my other friends always meet up with me. They are all taking time for me while they have so many other things they want to do. I\u2019m in the way, like a block on a path. Because of me no one can achieve their dreams. I\u2019m nothing more than a problem causer. I realized they think of me the same way. Every day my presence in my life dropped. My feelings stopped counting and I faded. I realized no one would miss me. There\u2019s no place for me in this world, no need. It\u2019s pretty lonely, but as long others were happy I know I could be too. I\u2019m glad I met them, all of them. Unfortunately one day I was more in the way of anyone then I thought I would ever be. It didn\u2019t just stop on that day. It kept getting worse. They started calling me names and I, I didn\u2019t know what to do. They didn\u2019t very well understand me either, since\u2026 I always kept being nice and polite. For some reason I caused them a lot of sadness. I knew\u2026 I knew then the world was done with me. I have seen enough. So one day, I went to the kitchen and locked every door. I sealed off every window and turned on the gas. I thanked the world for the time it gave me and the people I met, for my memories and life and hoped I could die in peace. I fell asleep after a lot of pain and gasping, but then\u2026 I suddenly woke up here. I wonder what it means.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely silent. She tried to kill herself. Is she joking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe\u2026 of course. yeah well, people safe people. It\u2019s what they do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201coh\u2026 I see. I guess I\u2019ll have to try better next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned. Next time. She still plans on getting herself killed. What the heck? The reason sounds weak. She must be hiding a truth, a whole truth. This can\u2019t be her story. It\u2019s something she lied to herself to make her feel better. Why else would she even try to kill herself. Let alone suggest to do it a second time. What\u2019s worse is that she\u2019s smiling now. She told the story a bit sad, but now she is even giggling a little. What the heck?! What did they do to that girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I am still not liked to be around people. There\u2019s no need for me to be alive. I\u2019m sure the hospital too can make a mistake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 They saved you. Is this, is this for real?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t give my life to someone who needs it more than I do and I don\u2019t need it. I\u2019m glad I met you though. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t believe she is about to throw her life away. You want to help her, help her find will to live on. You just don\u2019t want her to get hurt. You\u2019re not sure what to do, but maybe you can borrow some time at least. That last thing she said gave you an idea.</span></div></div>",

You need to give her a reason to live or she\u2019d be going downhill again even though her reason sounds ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one moment. I don\u2019t get something. Why throw your life away? I mean, shouldn\u2019t you fight it? Shouldn\u2019t you hate them for hurting you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just realized her story disabled your ero mind from functioning properly. Even though you still have the feelings, the suddenly swapped place to the background. All you saw now in her face was her pain. A pain you have a hard time to understand. You just knew she isn\u2019t telling you exactly what happened. She\u2019s defying her own logic just to post a  fake smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeehee.. I know right? It sounds ridiculous, but it\u2019s for the best. All I can do is hurt people. The world is better off without me. You should understand right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI.. N-no. I mean I uh.. No, absolutely not. I don\u2019t get why someone like you could be hurt at all. I mean you\u2019re kind and pretty. Nearly perfect. Why would anyone want to destroy that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeeheehee, thanks but. Have you ever wondered what happened if someone would stand out in some way? Like someone got selected to be more than just ordinary?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean like, Jesus and god or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little I guess. The bible is a nice story, but that\u2019s just where it stays. The truth is much harder to take. I am sure you know what I mean. It happens in bird families more public then in humans, let alone most humans don\u2019t even do it to their own kind and family, but it still happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, what are you talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen a young family of birds is born and the caretaker gets one out and tames it to be familiar with humans, to be able to be touched without flying away. Even though this treatment takes a minute a day. The care taker gets the bird out of the cage and places it back in, to live with the family, do you know what happens?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 the scent changes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes but it doesn\u2019t end there. First the other bird teases this one. Eventually they hurt the bird. Peck it every day, till its bones break and one day it dies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven when humans do not interfere at all, if the children stay with their parents all the time eventually they\u2019ll kill them. Just because they are a little different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s cruel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes and this didn\u2019t leave humans either. Some humans stand out and because of that they\u2019ll be teased, hurt, tortured. If god did select Jesus, he would have followed a similar fate. There\u2019s no way for someone who stands out to survive. Sometimes natural beauty hurts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t really believe what she tells, but somehow there is a truth. You know some kids don\u2019t know when to stop when it is already far over the line. Why is she mentioning this? Then you realize it. It must have something to do with what happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you got teased?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, heehee. Silly. In humans case it works differently. It\u2019s more like a pile. Things that happen to you will count, everyone knows that and yet they all decide to hurt you and sometime later again. It\u2019s basically the same, but long term. I don\u2019t get teased every day in a cruel way, but I guess in total it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if they did. I think if they\u2019d physically hurt me every day, I wouldn\u2019t be hurt this much. It\u2019s a different route, I guess. More effective on humans. Anyway don\u2019t worry. I just know my life takes too long. I can only be hurt now. Life has nothing left for me. So that\u2019s why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s still smiling as she says that. You start to realize how wrong this is. Something messed up her mind. Someone did hurt her terribly. You want to take revenge for her, but still. The problem is you can\u2019t. Your arms are wings. You knew it was a bad choice. Stupid head of yours. If you had your human body, you\u2019d rush to whatever place did this to her and punch everyone. You feel like you want a regular body again. That would mean finding a new host, but where. Sigh, all on short term too. Maybe you should at least tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, if I still had my hands I would have kicked them for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s rather softly said. You\u2019d rip their spine out of their ass and twisted it around their head. Then you\u2019d steal a road roller and drive twenty times over their body and then spread the blood. She seems to look worried though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not get anyone hurt, so please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least allow me to share a little secret then. I hope you can keep secrets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can, I think. No one ever told me a secret before, so I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m not going to be around very long so it won\u2019t be much of a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she smiles. It\u2019s getting too much. That\u2019s not right for a joke. Talking about killing yourself is just wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. But promise me you stop trying to kill yourself or talk about it, or even think about it if you know this, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d, she says doubting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat gives?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry, I have to die. I\u2019m just in the way. You don\u2019t understand, I get it. It\u2019s not like I can be useful, it\u2019s not like I can give my body to someone else either. I mean I have a friend who is desperately trying to become a boy. She\u2019s in trial for gender reassignment and all, I know there are a lot of unhappy boys out there who\u2019d like to become a girl too. I know how hard it is for her, I wish I could help, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m completely useless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe startles. She\u2019s silent and stares at you deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a genius you see. I invented a way for a human to take another body, another life for themselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe the starts laughing. \u201cWhat you?\u201d, she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm yeah. I mean, I\u2019m the first test subject. I became what you see before you right now. I used to be a human and actually I\u2019d like to become one again, but that aside. So you see, you have a reason to live.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s quiet for a moment. But then\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re serious aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing. Amazing! Absolutely amazing. It must have been difficult. It sounds very complicated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you believe me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then you have a reason to live now, don\u2019t you? So stop throwing your life away and maybe I\u2019ll even let you in my lab to show it to you. How about it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her boobs as she was about to answer. Darn, they are hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay. I promise then. Heehee, this explains a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBirds reply sometimes, but they still don\u2019t understand humans as much as you do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 oh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you see the reason why everyone was reacting so idiotic. Sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell the location of your lab, and if she\u2019s up for it she can come by anytime starting tomorrow. You also inform her of your little contact, who was the second to test it (well first in the prototype) but had a unfortunate accidental miscalculated seizure, but still should be okay in the other room, you think. You just hope it\u2019s one of them at least, and not a consciousless brain. She should be able to help. Her car is near your lab anyway, so she had to go there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like you made a new friend, a girl friend. Perhaps soon to be for real. You were just about to leave the room and let her rest when you suddenly heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere it is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman, a nurse, it sounded familiar and is. There\u2019s this nurse with a soup spoon in her hand near the door. There are a bunch of nurses behind her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl behind you speaks once more. You explain her that you had a seizure yourself, an erotic-style uncontrollable pervert one. You harassed them a little. The nurses approach slowly towards you, filling this small room. Then the girl begins to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s probably because you\u2019re still a young strong parrot. You\u2019re probably suffering puberty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain a smile, but this time you don\u2019t mind. The thing was, you hoped she said something different, something to distract them, but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 perverted bird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly one nurse tries to grab you and another one swings with her spoon like a sword, only to hit the nurse instead of you when you attempt to evade it. You realize you can\u2019t get passed them. But then something amazing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls, leave the bird alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head nurse walks in. She sends the nurses away. You don\u2019t understand what is happening, but eventually she takes you to Ms. Satin\u2019s room. She asked you softly while petting if they all scared you. You didn\u2019t answer. You just felt a little bit tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere there. I\u2019m gonna have a word with those girls. You stay here and be a good parrot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaves you behind in the room, which was empty. Ms. Satin wasn\u2019t in her room, nor was her bed. You wonder what is up now. More testing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt tired, but you\u2019re not sure what to do now. It is dark outside, you feel like sleeping. But where?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You\u2019re tired. You don\u2019t want to travel very far so you think you\u2019ll stay here. You think about things, things that happened. A lot has happened today after all, most of which was not in your schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawn and think to yourself, how should you sleep? Where should you sleep? You don\u2019t feel like going very far. You stare at the food left on the floor. Right, and you have to eat bird food. Yuk. The more you think about a birds life, the more you\u2019re starting to dislike it. It\u2019s great that you can fly and do whatever you want without getting in trouble with the law and all, but it sucks on so many aspects. You can\u2019t fiddle with breasts, you can\u2019t hold something well, you have sharp feet and you\u2019re annoyed by your own erotic excitement, because you can\u2019t jack yourself off either. So things start to play with you on strange levels, like fantasy. You feel active, annoyed and easily distracted by your own fetish thoughts. You feel so limited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to become a human again, but it\u2019s going to be tricky. Finding a body is difficult, getting it to the lab is worse. You need help and you think you can get it. The problem is, she\u2019ll probably have to do everything for you. It\u2019s not like you can ask someone to die for you so you can become him or her. Seriously it would be a laugh if you could. You are probably going to have to lie and make some sort of strategy. Especially if you want to do it while all those government goons are lurking out there. You know your lab is being watched, especially now that the FBI saw someone faint in there. You just hope it doesn\u2019t get any worse than that or you\u2019re going to be stuck like this. You can\u2019t let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s almost like starting over from chapter one. Finding a new body and a new life for you. You\u2019re disliking your current live. Sigh, what a waste. At least you learned your lesson. No scientific research. Sigh, you were planning on quitting that with your new life, why the heck did you have to become a bird for the experience? You don\u2019t even get yourself anymore. You want to hit your own head, but that would feel soft. Damn it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go through your memories of today and hindsight yourself. Since that lowered your excitement a little, you could fall asleep and you did almost instantly, posing like a dead bird on the floor. Oddly though, what you dream about is weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dream about your life in high school. You\u2019re still seventeen. You completed your probes. You were about to test it on this girl and after wards have sexual intercourse with your crush in the girl\u2019s locker room. During that time you got surrounded by a lot of other girls, who felt sexually excited by the scene and start to masturbate themselves or use each other. It\u2019s almost like a manly erotic heaven. Then suddenly you start to feel lifted up and rise towards the heavens. It\u2019s like being carried on clouds. All the girls gain wings and follow you, but at the end of the light you saw the ultimate playground, guarded by bunny suit uniform wearing woman. Just before you could reach it, the dream ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you startled awake knowing what you dreamed, you thought you\u2019d wet your pants, only to find out that didn\u2019t happen. Somehow, you\u2019re in a different room. You woke up on a table in this small room, with nothing else besides a chair inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and shocked, realizing yesterday wasn\u2019t a dream. You\u2019re still feathered. Damn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opens. What comes inside the room is more the a surprise. A guy dressed in black with a tie and suitcase. His big eye brows seemed familiar. He takes a seat in the chair and stares at you. Then you realize, you know who he is. He starts to speak before you could say anything though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe meet again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re being silent for now and look at him in a little bird method. You\u2019re not even doing that on purposely now. It feels like that\u2019s normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot answering hm? Well, maybe you forgot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grabs an ID badge and shows it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRick Carter FBI. I\u2019m here to interrogate you. I\u2019m gonna ask you a few questions and all you have to do is answer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like he is serious. You bet he is still angry because you let your shit drop on his face. He grabs a few files and places them on the table, including some photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I know you\u2019re intelligent and I am going to forgive you for your actions. I\u2019m not here to insult you or for revenge. I\u2019m here because of a case I am working on. You understand, right? Now I want you to look at some pictures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shows you a photo of your body, your lab, a strange man that appeared near your lab during the commotion (he somehow seems familiar) and several others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, what I know is you\u2019re not the parrot of this scientist. You rather belong to this man, Fernando Gomez. A Turk who moved to the states 4 years ago. Works as a translator for tourists. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so interested in this scientist or his lab here, but the thing is he died. I\u2019m trying to find out how and why. The reason is simple. We know he had a huge debt. Several parties are interested into making his live worse than hell, because they were promised profit. So we have a few suspects. Now what I want to know is what you saw at that time. The time of the commotion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is he saying? Doesn\u2019t he know your body most likely passed away because of the download? This shouldn\u2019t be a murder case or something. Then he continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know that\u2019s when he died. It was even recorded and live broadcasted on the TV. The man got slammed outside of his lab and was beaten to death by several masked people. We know who the act did, but there seem to be a bigger fish behind the whole scene. You were outside, it was recorded. You had a better view at their looks than anyone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heck? You didn\u2019t die because of the download? Some people rather drag an injured, ill looking man from behind a device, right through the crowd and beat him to death outside? Who would do that? Who would do that to you? Sigh, you have the bird\u2019s mind, but as far you haven\u2019t been able to suddenly remember something on will, even though it should be possible. This is a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try hard to remember. You imagine yourself outside on a stick. It\u2019s sunny, there\u2019s a man calling you friend all the time next to you. Suddenly you trigger something. A memory appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(\u201cMy Perry is amazing. He can fly from anywhere, he still finds way home.\u201d )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo that\u2019s not it. You look further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n( \u201cWa- What\u2019s happening?\u201d \u2026 \u201cOh no, quick Perry. We need to leave.\u201d \u2026 \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d \u2013who\u2019s voice is that? \u2013 \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, you are all gonna watch. Be quiet or we\u2019ll take you down as well.\u201d \u2013the guy is threatening the tourists. They\u2019re getting dragged back inside the bus- \u201cShut up or we\u2019ll blow the parrot.\u201d \u2013They take you outside- \u201cM-my Perry.\u201d \u2026) then it happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, that was weird. It\u2019s there indeed, in your head. It\u2019s like a weird conflicting memory and it\u2019s pretty faint, but you can tell what happened. You can\u2019t believe it. You saw yourself getting beaten up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain what happened and had to think hard of the details. You recognized a set of tattoos eventually. He thanks you and lets you go. He was planning on taking you to the animal caretaker or back to your real owner, but since you told him so much without resisting he changed his mind. Still he wonders why you are so smart, what the scientist (you) was doing in that lab, what the machines are for and why people ended up in the hospital. But his protocol states he can\u2019t investigate those. The police can, but he can\u2019t, since there is no case involving them. You\u2019re not answering those questions though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the door opens, you realize you\u2019re in the hospital, a different floor and room, but still there. Rick wanted to talk with someone who he refers to as \u201cthat IMF witch\u201d, but protocol states he must wait till visitor hour. So he exits the building instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a bit strange. It\u2019s like after looking inside your memory, you feel more proud about yourself and more compatible. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve become more bird in your head. It freaks you out a little. You don\u2019t want to be a bird. You need to get rid of your bird body. First things first. You need a replacement body, but to get one might be difficult. You guess you can go meet up with someone and ask for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will you go?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Zoo is a bit far away and you have no way of getting there with all those tourists around, nor can you take the machine there. You need to lure an animal here somehow if you really want to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case this option is as of yet a no go, but it doesn\u2019t matter you guess. You can always try it later, though it would probably be permanent if you do so.  If they catch an animal, they put them in special places you can\u2019t get out and that means you won\u2019t be able to operate the consoles in this lab anymore, nor would you be in range of them so even if you let someone do it remotely you\u2019d still be stuck in that animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, you need a different life. You want to be someone else. Right now it didn\u2019t matter who, so you picked someone from the crowd and made sure you\u2019d become that person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re glad the probes are airborne. It saves a lot of trouble. Still though, due to all your doubting and introvert behavior lately you spend a lot of time thinking and not acting. A lot of people left the door already and your choices get limited. The tournament still goes and people are probably going to get angry if they notice you\u2019d still not pick one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you looked around you noticed a lot of the woman lost. Most of the people left fighting are men. Several people are waiting in the touring bus, but it\u2019s a giant risk to get your probes outside while your mind is inside them due to a sudden wind blows and who knows when it\u2019s going to drive away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you doubt much longer they are going to get away. You better choose before it gets a one sided choice.</span></div></div>",
