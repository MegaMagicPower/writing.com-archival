He made that weird Vacuum Mushroom, and those ones that caused the Blorbs, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic turtle leaped off his throne and scrambled to storage, tossing aside henchmen in his haste to locate Fawful's locked-up stash. He hadn't really wanted to mess with the stuff too much before; it was all so hi-tech and weird, he was afraid it'd end up blowing up in his face. But Bowser's enthusiasm overrode his caution, and he approached the iron door in the bowels of his castle, ripped the chains and lock right off of it, and perused the contents of the forbidden storeroom, tossing aside junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wind-up Fawful chattering teeth... X-ray Glasses permanently stuck at maximum strength so you can't really see anything... Ray guns... Earl guns... Duke guns... Worthless! What a bunch of bunk! ARGH!\" Bowser slammed his fist into a stack of crates in front of him, and was rewarded with a crate to the head. After regaining his bearings, he looked to the label of the crate, and grinned a toothy, evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slob Shrooms, huh...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe halls of Peach's palace bustled with activity and joviality. The reigning monarch of the Mushroom Kingdom had thrown another party, inviting her closest friends, along with a number of ambassadors and diplomats from neighboring kingdoms. Mario and Luigi hadn't shown up yet, held up by an infestation of boos in their house (engineered by Bowser, unbeknown to anyone). Princess Peach herself was speaking with Daisy and a delegation from Sarasaland, when a Toad came up to her, bearing a gift package wrapped in green and red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon my interruption, your Highness! This package just arrived with your name on it! I'm not sure, but I THINK it's from Mario and Luigi! See, cause of the colors.\" The retainer handed off the gift to Peach, and she delicately opened it. \"A present from Mario and Luigi? I wonder what it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she lifted the cover off of the box, her nostrils were assailed by a pungent, yet strangely alluring odor. Inside the box was a large, somewhat blobby, wobbly dark green mushroom with brown spots, seeping with a slick and oily substance. She picked up the card inside, trying to avoid getting the secretion on her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'This is a Genuine Lucky Mushroom, from a far-off kingdom. Consider it as a repayment for all of the delicious cakes you've baked us. Sincerely, the Mario Bros.' Oh! How... Um. Nice?\" The princess looked warily at the reeking fungus. It looked, quite frankly, disgusting... But something about it made her want to indulge. And it was a gift from the heroes of the Mushroom Kingdom, after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy looked at the gift her friend had received, half-jealous and half-relieved. \"Uh... Wow. Go on, take a bite Peach! I'm sure it... Well, I hope it tastes better than it looks. It can't be hard, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach stared daggers into Daisy, and reluctantly took the jiggling mushroom into her hands. The greasy coating was already staining her gloved fingers. She put her lips to the unctuous shroom and bit off a chunk. The mushroom left her mouth feeling like it was coated in grease, but she also found it extremely, incredibly delicious. Abandoning all pretense of etiquette for the moment, Peach started scarfing it down, smearing musky juices all over her face and lips. The mushroom was gone in the space of ten seconds, Daisy and her delegation the stunned witnesses to the subtle beginning of Peach's transformation. The princess of the Mushroom Kingdom licked her fingers of any remaining juice, loosing a smelly belch that sprayed crumbs of fungus over her guests before regaining her senses, blushing hotly and putting her hands to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Oh my. I'm sorry... I'm not quite sure what came over me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy wiped the crumbs off of her face, and grinned. \"It's fine, Peach. I mean, I know I've always been telling you to loosen up some, after all... But maybe scale it back, some.\" She put an arm around her usually elegant playmate. \"This party is kind of dead anyway, without Mario and Luigi. Want to skip out for a bit? Although, if you want to go powder your nose for a bit, that's fine. You've sort of got... A little something there... Yeah, there.\" Daisy took a kerchief and wiped Peach's face. \"Got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach thought about it. Her head was feeling a little muzzy...</span></div></div>",

You want to lead the way?\u201d Daisy motioned toward the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two princesses walked out of the palace. Surprisingly, no one took notice to this as they were too busy engaging in drawn-out conversations and small yet delectable hors d'oeuvres. When Peach and Daisy were outside, the blonde was asked a question regarding her gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Peach, do you really think that Luigi and Mario sent you that mushroom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes. Who else would send me a present in a box with those colors?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe someone who wanted to prank you by making you think that our boyfriends gave you a bad gift.\u201d Daisy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the mushroom was bad.\u201d Peach said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally. After what that thing made you do when you basically stuffed it down your throat.\u201d Daisy said with folded arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit that it was odd that I just lost control of myself after eating the Genuine Lucky Mushroom, but at least it was nothing too embarrassing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, burping loudly in front of people isn\u2019t embarrassing at all.\u201d Daisy replied in playful sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you\u2019re one to talk, Miss \u20185 time Top Belcher in Sarasaland\u2019.\u201d Peach shot back with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the brunette\u2019s face lit up with a red hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give you that. But a kingdom-sponsored public burping contest isn\u2019t the same as an upper-class party.\u201d Daisy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. So, what do you want to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPersonally, I want to find out where that mushroom came from, because I doubt our resident heroes would give you something like that.\u201d Daisy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen who do you think would?\u201d Peach asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who would. Wario, Waluigi, Bowser\u2026\u201d Daisy listed off some possible gift-givers on her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust to be sure, we should go find Mario and Luigi and see if they did give it to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Daisy agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Daisy and Peach arrived at the house of the Mario Bros. However, when they got there, they saw that the red and green clad heroes were fighting off a boo infestation. After they stopped it, they noticed their girlfriends at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Peach and Daisy.\u201d Mario greeted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Mario and Luigi.\u201d Peach greeted in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat brings you here? Aren\u2019t you two supposed to be at a big party?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I decided to bring Peach here because of a gift that she thinks you gave her.\u201d Daisy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat gift?\u201d Luigi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Peach pulled out the red and green box that was filled with grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis had a special mushroom inside called the Genuine Lucky Mushroom. There\u2019s a note in here that says that you gave it to me.\u201d Peach said as she handed Mario the note and he examined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m-a sorry, Princess, but we couldn\u2019t have sent you the mushroom. As you\u2019ve most likely noticed, we\u2019ve been preoccupied with an assault from several boos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy and Peach entered the house and saw that it was thoroughly trashed. Furniture was on its side, and appliances were smashed. The two royal figures were shocked by the interior, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my. I\u2019m sorry that this happened to you two.\u201d Peach apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. What did the mushroom look like?\u2019 Mario asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was blobby looking, it smelled badly, and it was green and brown.\u201d Daisy described.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, that\u2019s the description of a Slob Shroom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a \u2018Slob Shroom\u2019?\u201d Peach asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disgusting kind of mushroom that alters the personality of anyone who eats it. Did either of you eat it?\u201d Mario asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy and Peach gave each other a scared look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 I did. <u><i><b>~*BBBBUUUUUURRRRPPPPPPP!*~</b></i></u>\u201d Peach answered sheepishly before emitting a repugnant belch that lasted four seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do we stop it from changing me?\u201d Peach asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only cure is the Clean Shroom. It can make anyone who eats it act well-mannered and active. It is located in Bowser\u2019s Castle.\u201d Luigi explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, we have to deal with him, then?\u201d Daisy stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, we\u2019ll find him and get that Clean Shroom.\u201d Peach declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we join you?\u201d Mario asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Daisy assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the two princesses set off to find the Koopa King and get Peach back to normal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll just go to my room for a bit...\" stuttered Peach as she slowly through hall, exited through a door that leads to a staircase where her room was up top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the top, Peach opened the door and closed it behind her. Walking slowly towards her bed, the worn-out princess immediately collapsed on to it with exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she tried to rest, her stomach was suddenly making all sorts of gurgling sounds. And worst of all, she couldn't think clearly as her mind was a bit cloudy. \"Uuhhh...\" Peach groaned while rubbing her throbbing head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling herself back up where she laid, the blonde sat herself up and slowly began to take her shoes off; then suddenly something unexpected happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPPFFFFFFFFFHHHHHHHHTTTTTT!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach let out a huge fart from her ass; making her jump with fright. Quickly hopping off her bed with panic, she suddenly began to circle around the room to find out where did that sound come from? Believing it was another surprise attack from Bowser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was soon interrupted by another unexpected sound...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPP!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only did Peach let out a surprisingly huge fart, but now she just unleashed a mighty burp that could probably put Yoshi's to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore alarmed than before, Peach covered her mouth, the princess' cheeks completely red as she couldn't help but blush at her gassy situation. \"Oh my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, oddly enough, she didn't feel embarrassed by the fact that she just farted and burped like that. Elegant princesses shouldn't pass gas like that! But things became even more complicated for her; as she didn't seem to care about her sudden change of manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Peach's stomach roared loudly, demanding to fed after letting loose, wanting and demanding to fill up the empty void. Luckily her bedroom chambers were filled with all kinds of desserts received as gifts from many of her friends and guests. Without even thinking, Peach walked towards them with a drooling face and started to dig into her sweet meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating away as fast as she could, crumbs, frosting and jam smeared all over her royal dress not caring one bit about her appearance. As her dress was starting to rip and give way to the fat that was forming on her expanding body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer flat stomach started to spread out, poking through her dress and then eventually hanging over as it matched the size of an over-inflated basketball. Her breasts were struggling to break free from her bra as they getting bigger from each Cup size, her arms and legs started to get thicker and more sluggish making the size of tree trunks. Her face started to form an extra chin but still keeping her cute appearance on her face. And finally, her ass had expanded to the size that matched the size of footballs leaving her panties wedged in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished eating the last slice of the cake, Peach was surrounded by the mess of the food she had just consumed and the remains of her ripped dress as she has revealed more of her flabby body as her gloves could no longer fit in her fat pudgy fats and how her belly had ripped through her ruined dress and her bra had finally giving up and leaving her huge breasts resting on top of her belly but still covered by the remains of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world could now see her royal panties as how they wedge in her ass; as Peach would try to straighten them. After eating her gifts, Peach who once weighed 116 pounds was now weighing 350 pounds and she didn't seem to be shocked by her sudden growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh... that was -HIC- delicious...\" Peach beamed, scratching her ass and belly. Letting out another faint fart, the now sloven princess waddled to the door to rejoin the party.</span></div></div>",

The worried looks on their faces lifted for a moment as the door opened, but came back with a vengeance as they saw what the monarch bloated, half-naked, and smeared with food. Peach, for her part, was oblivious as she smiled and toddled down the stairs, a journey that seemed to get her newly altered sweat glands acting overtime. When she reached the bottom, she broke the stunned silence of the crowd with a loud, raunchy fart that sent crumbs and sweat droplets flying from her quivering flesh, knocking Daisy and Toadsworth over and causing the rest of the crowd to gag uncontrollably on her rancid fumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh... All that moving makes me hungry all over again, for some reason.\" The princess, thinking nothing of her explosive outburst, maneuvered her grotesque bulk over to the refreshment table, taking a bowl of punch in both hands and drinking it messily, most of the sugar-loaded liquid making its way down her greedy gullet, some of it dripping down her double chin and between her flabby cleavage. Toadsworth, recovering from a head-on encounter with Peach's methane maelstrom, quickly hurried the guests out of the room while Daisy tried to restrain her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peach! PEACH! What's gotten into you?\" Daisy attempted to get her arms around the mountainous monarch and wrestle her away from the snacks, but to no avail. \"You're... You're... I don't even know! It's like you've lost control of all your inhibitions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach slowly turned around, flesh swaying with the motion, tendrils of slobber mixing with the fruit punch that reddened her face. \"It's great, isn't it! You should try it, Daisy! Here... I don't know how I know this... But I might know how I can get you started!\" With one deceptively swift motion, Peach locked her lips to the protesting Daisy, almost flooding her mouth with soupy drool and half-chewed food.

This time, Daisy didn't put any resistance; In fact, she was longing for more of that delicious stuff that was making her tingle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss lasted some minutes. In which Toadsworth  left the room out of sheer panic. Once it was done Daisy fell to the floor. Unable to move due to the sheer pleasure she was feeling.

And her manners weren't far behind, as she cut a noxious fart right next to Peach, biting her lip from the sheer pleasure of the sensation. Peach took a deep whiff of Daisy's gaseous leavings and moaned, taking her back into her sweaty embrace for another slobbery kiss. As they groped each other's massive, flabby bodies, a shy guy wearing a gas mask peeked in on the scene. Distracted for a moment, he went to work, laying down a trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph... Nhhaa~! Peach, I've never felt this way before! *BRRARRRRRPH* It's wonderful! Oh! And look!\" Daisy pointed to the trail of pasties leading out of the palace. \"More food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two piggy princesses ate their way along the path, up a gangplank, and onto a waiting airship that took off as soon as they were aboard. Dully, Peach and Daisy looked around, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... We seem to be flying, Daisy. *PHWARRRRRRK*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's weird... Oh hey! *PLRRRRPH* Donuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was, indeed, a new trail of warm, gooey donuts, leading down into the brig... And ultimately to an enormous pile of the things, along with a chest of sex toys. Normally these would hardly be fitting accommodations for a princess, but Peach was strangely alright with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This is the best kidnapping I've had yet! *BLRRRUP* Maybe I've got Bowser all wrong...\"</span></div></div>",

Now that I think about it, Wendy stopped chasing us awhile ago Iggy; I thought it was getting strangely quiet without her screeching from behind us!\" \"I find it stranger considering she'll almost <i>never</i> let anything go if she can help it!\" Shrugging to each other, the two tip-toed off to the relative safety of their bedroom chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Wendy had found herself one moment chasing her brothers out of bloodthirsty-revenge, to being completely and utterly lost. \"Well this bites! First time I get lost in this place and it's when I've got a pair of losers I need to pummel!\" Wendy moaned to herself, walking around the dusty old hallway she'd wound up in. Before long, she heard her stomach start to audibly growl. \"Darn it, and now I'm hungry! Princesses shouldn't have to put up with this treatment from their underling brothers!\" Yet before she could start complaining to herself some more, she started to smell the faint scent of food. As she started to instinctively follow the scent using her nose, Wendy hadn't noticed an ever-so-slight amount of drool had started to leak out of her large lips, nor that the closer she got to the source, the more her mind was clouded with thoughts of stuffing her face and little else.

Replacing the codices was cake. And where there should have been folios, there were french fries. The shelves of the cavernous chamber seemed to be stocked with heaping amounts of every stripe and color of greasy, sugary, and unhealthy foodstuff known to Koopakind. There were some comfortable looking chairs and tables too, but being inedible these did not draw nearly as much attention. The sheer spectacle of it was heart-stopping in the figurative sense, and would probably prove to be heart-stopping in the literal sense.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In her island fortress of Syrup Castle, the leader of the Black Sugar Pirates sat upon her throne of pilfered gold, looking like the cat that ate the canary. Life had been good for her, especially since she'd conned the Bottomless Coin Sack from Wario. The pirate queen lived the high life from that point on, rebuilding her old digs three times as large and a million times as luxurious. One could say that she never wanted for anything, but the problem with Captain Syrup was that she always wanted more, and in that respect she was much like Wario. The similarity stopped there, however. Syrup was a cunning foe, as beautiful as she was devious. Wario was... Wario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned as she thought of Wario. She liked the crude, greedy man, but she liked his treasure more. Still, she hoped he wasn't TOO sore about her swiping the Bottomless Coin Sack. He'd proven to give as good as he'd got in the past, and the last thing Syrup wanted was him thrashing through Kitchen Island hellbent on taking his treasure back with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, one of her Goom henchmen came waddling in, bearing a huge wrapped gift. The red-haired rogue perked up immediately. \"What's this, henchman? Something from an admirer?\" she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goom set down the box in front of her. \"Appears to be from that purple-pants guy you're always messing with, Captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA present? From Wario? So soon after she'd made a fool of him and stolen his treasure? Best to let the expendable henchman open it, just in case it proved to be a bomb or some other nasty surprise. \"Open it, henchman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goom did as he was bidden. The inside of the box was a mess of dunnage, wads of paper overflowing onto the floor. The hapless swabbie dove in, rustling around for a few minutes before extricating himself with a tiny box and a letter. \"Found it, Captain! Apologies for the delay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just stand there, bring it here!\" Wario's lamentable lack of eco-friendly packaging technique was the last thing on Syrup's mind as the Goom trundled over, handing the contents of the giftbox over. Her eyes scanned over the paper as she read aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Syrup; I'm really sick of you stealing my stuff all the time! Don't get too comfortable just laying around while others do the work, or you'll really regret it! But to show that I'm not TOO angry with you, here's a present. I think it'll really bring us closer together. Have a rotten day, Wario.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...Interesting. I wonder what it is.\" The nautical nymph opened the small box, revealing a golden band studded with precious stones. The ring was on her finger five seconds after she opened the box. \"How wonderful! I'll have to steal from him more often!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Syrup...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A great grumbling erupted from Captain Syrup's stomach, echoing around the great hall. The pirate queen blushed as the noise subsided, brought to a low gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henchman!\", the plunderer in purple barked, \"Henchman! I'm hungry! Tell the cooks to prepare dinner. Or, no, a feast! But just a light one, I've got to keep my girlish figure. No, wait, I work hard, I need to eat to keep up my strength! Make it a big one, the biggest! Just tell the cooks to keep doing their thing until I tell them to stop. What are you waiting for, henchman?! Get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feisty freebooter crumpled up Wario's letter and chucked it at the fleeing Goom, off to relay his mistress's orders and to belay her wrath. Syrup leaned back in her throne, grinning as she admired her new ring. It was a little gaudy, but it was a pirate's right to be as gaudy as possible. Something about it unnerved her, though, a feature that she'd overlooked in her rush to put on the gift. There appeared to be the head of a pig adorning the band, a ruby stuffed in its mouth, emulating an apple. Somewhat tasteless, but still, treasure was treasure. And what more could she expect from Wario? The captain waited impatiently for her meal. She didn't know why she was so hungry all of a sudden, but the cause of her hunger wasn't as important to her as the satiation of it. After what seemed like an eternity to her, the tiny pink mole creatures that served as the cooks of the Black Sugar Pirates began to wheel out her ordered meal. Syrup grabbed a platter at random, and was rewarded with a heaping pile of spaghetti and meatballs, dripping with sauce. The greedy pirate grabbed a fork and twirled a huge wad of it up, jamming it into her mouth and smearing sauce all over her face in the process. She took another fork and ate hand-over-fist, until the contents of her plate were either staining her face and clothing or digesting in her distended gut. The pirate queen shifted in her throne, rubbing her stomach and loosing a smelly belch that made her eariler gastrointestinal grumblings sound like a dropping pin in comparison. She closed her eyes and licked the sauce sloppily off of her lips, leaving them wet with her saliva as she considered her next course of action.</span></div></div>",

Lately she had been getting so board with her life that she even stopped practicing magic. Of course, there wasn't much for her to do around her house other than practice magic, so she decided to look through a book of spells and found something that interested her, a spell that let her switch lives with other people. At first, she didn't really care, but then she remembered her old magic school rival, Princess Wendy O. Koopa. \"hmm... Princess don't have to do much.\" thought the 15 year old witch, she then got a sly smile on her face \"all they have to do is sit around on their throne and tell others to do stuff for them. Plus Wendy can use magic too, so if I don't like her life, I can always switch back. It's perfect!\" Ashley grabbed a phone book and called Wendy over for a visit. She then immediately began preparing her master plan. Soon Wendy arrived, she was a slightly pudgy girl, but all koopas are pudgy, so it didn't bother her. Wendy looked at Ashley who waved to her happily. \"Oh hey Ashley. That you? wow, you actually grew\" Said the smug Koopa princess, Ashley had always had a growth problem, which was the reason she began practicing her magic. \"Oh.... Wendy.... you.... look... great.\" Lied the young witch, forcing herself to smile. Truthfully, she couldnt stand to even look at Wendy, but Ashley was determined to get the easy life of a Koopa Princess. \"Say Wendy\" said the young witch \"want to see a new spell I learned?\" Wendy just scoffed and looked at Ashley \"sure, its not like I got anything better to do.\" Wendy couldn't figure out why Ashley was being so nice, but she never got the chance to realize what had happened, Ashley casted the spell and both girls were blinded in a white light. When Ashley woke up, she saw she was in a very royal princess like room, except the colors were black instead of Pink. Ashley's spell worked. Ashley looked in the mirror and saw....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Patting her stuffed belly after she'd just wolfed down her fourth greasy burger, Ashley was starting to get used to her new slothful lifestyle. Wiggling her butt further into the enormous throne she'd been binging away in for the past few hours, the slothful witch girl started to contemplate her situation while she wolfed down some sugary donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So being a royal *GULP!* koopa princess and all, I have- *Urrrrrrrrp!* ('scuse me!) an entire castle to myself? And all you- *Frrrrpppptttttt~* (Man that was a big one~) slaves to boss around? I should've swapped places with that Wendy brat ages ago!\" Slowly pulling herself off her grand chair and watching her developing potbelly jiggle a bit, Ashley took a few sniffs. \"Hmmm, I'm certainly stinking the place out a bit... So princesses have something like a jacuzzi, or an enormous swimming-pool bath, right?\" She asked the nearest koopa guard, taking some cruel satisfaction at her stench causing him to gag. \"Yes, y-y-y-your m-mmajesty! *Cough* There's a queen-sized h-h-hhot-tub on the t-t-t-ttop floorrrrruugh-\" As he fell unconscious from the witch girl's rank BO, Ashely merely shrugged and while scratching her sweaty rear-end with one hand, pulled a waitress goomba cleaning up her previous binge in front of her. \"Hey, small-fry~\" Ashley cooed, again grinning as see saw beads of sweat starting to form on the teenage girl's forehead as she farted away in the background. \"Better not slack off like this last guy while I'm saying this! Now, I want my <i>royal</i> hot tub to get filled up with nothing but rich, melted chocolate! Heck, I want it to be topped off with a ton of whipped cream and candy for me to snack on, and I want it done in the next ten minutes orrrrrr-\" Slowly lifting her leg, Ashley gave a wink to the now terrified girl \"*PrrrrffffffftttttttttttSPLAT!* I'll make <i>sure</i> you'll be the girl washing the tights I've just spent keeping nice and pungent! Off you go sweetie, your royal princess of whatever-land commands you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a few more donuts and scarfing them down, Ashley started to waddle out the kitchen and back to her bedroom. \"Oh man, being a princess <i>rocks{/i)! Though I might want to start enforcing a strict girls-only policy for my staff, heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Wendy was finding life living in Ashley's huge, mostly decrepit mansion decidedly less fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, this BITES! I should've put a hit on that witch dweeb years ago to stop her pulling THIS kind of stunt on me!\" Wendy snarled as she rummaged through what was once Ashley's bedroom, finding little else besides obscure potion ingredients, torn clothes and the occasional half-eaten sandwich. \"Doesn't help that I had to trade my hundreds of servants for whatever sort of thing YOU'RE meant to be! Ooooooh, when I get myself out of this...\" the pudgy koopa girl pouted as she pointed at Red, who was quite confused as to why his master was suddenly much more... <i>Reptilian</i> in appearance. He couldn't tell much of a difference from Ashley's personality to this new character's however. \"Eh, master? Why are you ransacking your own bedrooooom-*ACK!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing him by his small neck, Wendy started to unload her frustration on the red demon-creature. \"Look, pipsqueak! I know that nerdy girl of yours like all creepy witches probably has some sort of 'aaaalll-powerful' spellbook she uses every time she wants to terrorize the neighbourhood or move over on someone else's turf, and I bet she's too thick to realize it's still lying around here! Once I find that book, I just read out the counter spell and everything's back to normal... Aaaand then I capture her, publicly humiliate her and keep her as some sort of adorable, geeky human pet. Any questions, or are you going to help!?\" Barely able to breath, Red slowly responded. \"I know... Where.... *gasp* where this 'book' is... Just... Put me down... Pleeeeease...\" Placing him down and tapping her foot from a lack of patience, Red quickly scuttled underneath Ashley's bed and produced a large book. \"Bingo! At least you're smarter than my servants are-Hang on you moron, this isn't a spell book...\" As she sat up on the bed started to flick through the pages, Wendy's eyes lit up and a cruel smile grew on her face. \"It's her DIARY! Oooooh, the humiliating secrets a socially-awkward dork like her must've confided into this book... Boy, I am going to unleash a world of <i>hurt</i> on this girl by the time I'm done reading this thing~.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CANNONBAAAAALL~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing only a tight-fitting bikini, Ashley jumped into the towering chocolate monstrosity that was supposed to be her bath with a large splash, slurping up the confectionary goodness she was submerged in as she swam around. Swallowing mouthful of the thick, sticky fluid, Ashley let out a few small farts just to watch the yellow balls of gas float to the top of her chocolate pool with mild amusement. When she'd eaten enough to put even Wendy to shame, she lout out a personal-best of a burp, echoing all throughout the room. \"*BRRRUUUUAAAAAP!\"Ashely stood up and waddled over to the side of the large tub and started to lick over her slowly growing arms, looking around just to see the room mostly abandoned (likely due to her horrible scent), besides the still anxious looking goomba girl from earlier. Turning around and facing the teenager, who despite being obligated to watch over Ashley during her bath was keeping her distance from the human fart-machine, the witch princess leered over the edge and flashed her a large, food-covered grin. \"Hey small-stuff, you did a pretty good job with this big bath sundae of mine! Maybe I oughta make you some sort've advisor or something, I can see us getting together reeeeally well~\" \"Eh, thanks, your royal-ness! But I think there's like, a high-ranking magikoopa who's meant to have that role-\" \"Pfffft, I don't want some old guy telling me what to do! I want people my age! Heck, why are there mostly <i>guy</i>... Eh, turtle and mushroom people here? I'd be having A LOT more fun with girls like yourself looking after me! That's an idea....\" Ashley started to muse to herself as she sucked on a chocolate-covered finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, goomba-chick! Tell everybody who isn't a chick that works here that I'm firing them! Then start hiring for girls only, preferably my age... Hell, just go to a high school and kidnap a whole bunch of teenagers I can oogle! Oooooo, it feels <i>nice</i> not having to hold back now!\" Ashley cried out as she let out enough farts to turn her chocolate hot tub into a bubble-bath.</i></span></div></div>",

Laharl had not seen the need to leave his castle in over a month, and that meant he was constantly haranguing anyone within earshot, if not to get some mundane task, then to just have an outlet for his extremely pushy and obnoxious temper. On top of that, his perpetual presence in the castle made it particularly hard for Etna to shirk her duties or plot for a way to gather a little power herself; becoming a tyrannical dictator was an absolute treat of a thought for her.  Hardly in a place to make a power-grab, Etna had ridden out the past few weeks dictating most of her work to her Prinny soldiers and giving Laharl as hard a time as she could without directly disobeying him to encourage his attention to move elsewhere.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning as Etna trudged down the hallway towards Laharl's throne room, she heard a bit more commotion than usual outside the castle. She took a peek outside through one of the large, gothic windows in the hallway, observed the commotion,  and remarked to no one in particular in her bossy tone:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Etna's eyes grew as wide as saucers. A redheaded, youngish looking girl with red eyes and a flowing white robe was being attacked by some of Laharl's castle guards. The girl reminded her of Flonne, and seemed to be dressed similarly. However, one difference between the two was immediately clear: she weighed nearly a ton! It was amazing that her colossal legs even carried her weight, yet she moved as if she didn't have the slightest trouble. The guards were attempting to drive her back with spears and swords, but it looked like every time the soldiers landed a blow, a brief, greenish haze would materialize between the weapon and the angel-looking girl, rendering the blow apparently ineffective.  The girl herself seemed rather panicked, and seemed to be trying to apologize to the guards. Eventually she turned and began walking away from the castle.  The guards seemed visibly relieved; if she had wanted to move forward, they probably wouldn't have stopped her. Etna was ready to write the encounter off as one of the many strange events that occurred in the netherworld on a daily basis, when she saw the girl produce a small staff from her robe as she walked away and pointed it at a nearby hill. The affected ground seemed to shake, then violently crack and collapse into flat land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna wanted that wand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you! Fatso!\"  Etna growled, a little out of breath from her run down from the castle. <br>\r\nThe redheaded angel turned with a worried expression. <br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your deal? And where did you get that wand?\"  Etna crossed her arms and waited for a response.<br>\r\n\"My name is Sellipheluma...you can call me Selly if you wish....is this the netherworld?\" <br>\r\nEtna snorted. Where did she think she was, Hawaii?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this is the Netherworld, has fat begun to leak into your skull? How could you not know that?\"  Etna questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear...Its official....I'm a fallen angel!\"  Selly seemed on the verge of tears. <br>\r\nEtna raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I didn't used to look like this, I was an angel in charge of celestial information gathering; I was always trying to be the fastest to get our leaders information, and I guess I got a little too competitive....I so loved the praise I received for my good work, that I may have sabatoged one or two of my peers to keep my high standing....I didn't think it was a big deal! I could do their work and my own and still be faster than they were, but the higher Seraphim just wouldn't listen! I just wanted a chance to show them how hard I was working....I woke up here today...my punishment must be time in the netherworld and becoming the opposite of what I was trying to obtain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna laughed. \"What'd you do, tape a dumbbell to another angel's wings or something? Anyway, I don't really care, just fork over that wand that can blow up mountains!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelly gave a sad smile. \"Oh no, that's just a hunk of wood. All of my angelic powers have been taken away, now all I've got is the demonic power of sloth...I need a wand to properly focus it.\"  She sighed sadly, then scoffed sarcastically,  \"Or maybe someone will want to take my burden off my hands...tch....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna shook her head to make sure she heard correctly.  \"You can GIVE that power away?!\"     <br>\r\nSelly nodded, her chins shaking.  \"Of course. There's nothing more deplorable than power, especially one so closely linked to sloth. If I wasn't angelic, I don't know what kind of tyrant I would become, or how easily this energy could warp my body and mind....\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, if I can blow up a mountain like that, I'll take it! Now!\"  Etna was already having sweet dreams off making Laharl's throne launch like a rocket out the top of the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You WANT it?!  This is my punishment!....but....maybe I could fly again if I lost some of this slothful energy........Look, I can't give it all to you at once, you'd explode, most likely. This is going to change you, and I want to make sure you are not going to regret this. So here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed a hand on Etna's head, and a brief green spark appeared at the site of contact. Etna could have swore Selly's generous belly receded ever so slightly when it happened.  Etna  felt as if she received an electric shock, and even after the dizziness passed she felt kind of tired and rather hungry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back in a day's time if you really want more....though I doubt it.\" Selly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I feel stronger?\"  Etna demanded. \"I just feel sleepy!\"  <br>\r\n\"It takes time to work through your system...you'll feel it soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a potion, huh?\"   Etna grinned.<br>\r\n\"Like poison.\" Selly sighed. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she tried to account for her abnormal tiredness, she realized she hadn't felt this refreshed in ages. She almost felt intoxicated with good vibes. She pointed at a decorative urn in her room and watched with amazement as the ice spell she tried to cast materialized with almost no concentration or mental exhaustion, obliterating the vase with diamond-sharp ice. Etna felt like she could take on the world!....until she got to her feet. She suddenly felt a little nauseous, and her shoulders got the slightest bit achy. She plopped back down into her bed and the good vibes immediately returned.  She slept another hour, and would have gone for longer, but her growling stomach rudely awakened her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch...guess a trip to the kitchen is worth the headache.\" She got to her feet, this time ready for the mild feeling of discomfort. She glanced at herself in the mirror, and her eyes widened.  She was kind of chunky!  Her belly was now a soft little dome that squished into the waistband of her shirt. She realized she had less mobility in her skirt; her thighs had softened, and Etna was worried that if she had gained just a few more pounds, her butt would be too big to cover with her skirt. Her face was rounder, and her breasts seemed ever so slightly bigger; only someone with treated them with as much scrutiny as Etna would notice, however. She seemed less concerned about her weight gain and more than more didn't go to her chest.  \"I would have hoped the whole lardo effect was only for that angel girl, but If this process is going to make me a fatass, it better not take the phrase literally and shove a little blubber into my chest!\" Etna scowled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More, more, MORE!\" Do you not understand the word? M-O-R-E!\"  Etna had discarded her fork for her third plate of pancakes and tore into them with her hands, letting butter and syrup cascade over them. Her prinny chefs were desperately trying to keep up with her appetite.Bite after bite sent a sticky river dripping down her chin and onto her skirt. She felt her skirt digging deeper into her waist as her gut became packed with food even as it growled in want of more sustenance. She killed another two plates, wiped her hands on her skirt, and threatened to use her new-found magical aptitude to have prinny for lunch if she wasn't brought chocolate to round out the meal as soon as possible. Ever since she sat down to eat, her discomfort had vanished, and the second food touched her lips she realized how hungry she was. Her weight gain was in the back of her mind as she demanded more food, but her desire to eat was overwhelming. </span></div></div>",

Her jog made the strange feeling of discomfort that hung over her intensify, but she didn't care; she needed to find her and get more power! Etna hated exertion, however, and her rear end was kind of chafing in her leather skirt now that it was pressing so tightly against it. She could feel the extra flesh jiggling from her momentum.   Strangely enough, Selly was right where Etna had left her! She seemed to have either obtained or conjured a pile of pillows, and was lounging on them lazily.  Her eyes lit up when she saw Etna.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't back for more, are you?\"  She asked hopefully. <br>\r\n\"Of course I am! I barely need to focus to cast spells I know now! Gimme all of it this time!\"  Etna grinned and rubbed her hands together. <br>\r\n\"I still don't see how you could possibly enjoy lazing around all day while using magic and coercion to cheat your way to everything you need! Look at me, I haven't done any work in a day now, I truly am in hell!\"   Selly sighed and lifted a titanic breast a little with both hands, as if it's weight demonstrated the severity of her inertia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna, restraining the urge to assault the flabby angel for her stupidity, realized she could only benefit from keeping her cool.  \"Yeah yeah, so terrible. Gimme another dose!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nEtna returned to the castle a few hours later with blueberry sauce smeared around her mouth. She leisurely strolled in towards her room, licking her fingers, when she was stopped by a fuming Laharl.  \"Where the heck have you been?! I should have you executed for this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna yawned. \"I would have been back earlier, but I saw this goblin selling pies, and next thing I knew I had killed a few hours! Sue me! I'm gonna go take a nap.\" <br>\r\nLaharl's jaw clenched before he began his next torrent of threats.    \"If you set foot into your room before giving me a full report I'll watch as y.....your ass is getting HUGE! What are you doing, eating members of my court?! Quickly, have everyone report in for attendance!\"  Laharl shouted after the placidly advancing Etna. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I still can't believe you chose to vacation here, Mika-san! I've been improving my culinary skill by leaps and bounds, so if there's anything you need, I'm your man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Mika smiled. \"Just keep the food coming, El Fuerte! This is good stuff!\" The famed wrestler was on sabbatical after suffering an injury while training a few months back. Her trainer, Yoko Harmageddon, was typically a strict and unrelenting overseer, but she had forced herself to go on what she described as a 'soul-searching journey' after aiding her pupil in recovery. When she left, she'd given Mika a generous sum to spend as she saw fit as reparations. Mika thought the reaction was a bit extreme, and she knew it wasn't really Yoko's fault, but the downtime was nice. She'd chosen to visit Mexico, partly to vacation, and partly to learn a bit of lucha libre technique to round out her repertoire. However, her chosen trainer appeared to be concentrating more on his culinary skills than his wrestling ones at the time, though he still retained his chiseled physique and furious strength. El Fuerte, for his part, was certain that he was close to perfecting the \"food of champions\" that was his Holy Grail, and was quite eager to have his idol sample his creations. Mika, for her part, didn't exactly complain about the free food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was her second day with the masked chef, and she was currently sitting at the counter of his new restaurant, devouring a large bowl of chili con carne. The spicy, saucy dish stained her lips and face as she lost herself in the meal. Whatever the feisty luchadore had learned about his other craft was nothing less than a miracle. Something about El Fuerte's new style of cooking was simply too divine to resist, despite some of the horror stories she'd heard about it. One bowl turned to two, then three before the voluptuous street fighter decided she'd had enough. Rubbing her distended belly, she turned her stool around and leaned against the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was really... Just, really good! I've never had such good food! But... Ugh... I think I overdid it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEl Fuerte peeked out from the kitchen...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tFelicia mewled, sighing as she looked at the latest reviews of her CDs.  She had enjoyed a few years of popularity, some of her records reaching platinum status, but even the novelty of having a catwoman as a pop singer wore off after a time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe sighed again, running a white furred paw through her huge mane of blue hair.  Her ears twitched slightly, and she shook her head, smiling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh well\u2026 At least I got enough money in to live comfortably\u2026\u201d she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhich was true.  Her records, her concerts, her merchandise, all of it had given her so much money that she didn\u2019t have to work a day in her life ever again.  She had a modest mansion on the outskirts of the city and some loyal employees (she didn\u2019t like the word \u2018servants\u2019) that didn\u2019t mind the fact that she wasn\u2019t human.  The orphanages and animal shelters she had started were thriving, making sure that abandoned youngsters and pets of all ages found good, loving homes.  She still had many fans, but most of her target audience, young girls, had moved on to the next big artist, each more superficial than the last.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFelicia sighed.  She didn\u2019t have to work, but she wanted to.  It helped get over the depression she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer first orphanage, Felicity House, had been run by Felicia herself.  She had taken all the vows of a nun, but because she wasn\u2019t human, the pope had disavowed her, refusing to acknowledge her as a nun and excommunicating her.  It had been loudly contested by the church that raised her, as well as her lawyers, but the papacy wasn\u2019t hearing of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFelicia mewled softly, idly fiddling with her tail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe did have another option, but she wasn\u2019t very happy with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJedah was still around.  Jon Talbain, her sometimes lover, had vowed to fight the so-called Dark Messiah.  She could go find him\u2026 but she found fighting abhorrent, save for just friendly exercise or fighting to save someone she cared about.  And Majigen, Jedah\u2019s realm, was nearly constant fighting.   To say nothing of the Dark Hunters that stalked that place.  Donovan respected that she wasn\u2019t a threat to humanity and left her alone, and Hsien-Ko and her sister were Felicia\u2019s friends, but Baby Bonnie Hood was a fucking psycho who had vowed to have Felicia\u2019s pelt as a jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFelicia shivered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was BOOOORRREED\u2026 She had already checked up on her various businesses, her agent still didn\u2019t have anything for her, she had already checked her stocks and sold the ones that were in danger of falling, and she really didn\u2019t want to risk meeting up with B.B. Hood or even worse, Lord Raptor.  Hsien-Ko had warned her that the zombie was a ravening bloodthirsty lunatic who went hump-crazy whenever he saw some female he liked.  It was only by rampant mauling of the zombie\u2019s genitals that she was able to escape being raped the first time.  (He behaved himself and just flirted with her since then, his testicles regenerating.)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFelicia yawned, and stretched.  It was getting late.  Maybe she should get something to eat?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe picked up the phone and called her kitchen.  The chef there, Alphonse, picked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes, Miss Felicia?\u201d Alphonse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, Al.  I\u2019m thinking a little dinner would be nice.  You got time or are you and the others going out to eat?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlphonse grinned.  \u201cWell, Miss Felicia, I\u2019ve actually already eaten.  I\u2019ve got this amazing recipe I found that I\u2019ve been wanting to try out, and I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d be willing to try it.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFelicia mewled.  \u201cSounds good,\u201d she said, \u201cHow long will it take?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot long, Miss Felicia, I was actually in the process of making it when you called and was planning to offer it to you once I was done.  Fifteen minutes, tops.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFelicia nodded.  \u201cThank you, Alphonse.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFelicia hung up the phone and sighed, laying down on the couch in her room.  She looked around at the lush surroundings, and contemplated just staying in here forever.  Everything was so plush, so comfy\u2026 The couch she was sitting on was so comfortable, she felt she was sinking into it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter fifteen minutes, Alphonse came in with the meal, which turned out to be a huge pan of lasagna, big enough to serve ten people.  Felicia smelled it before it got there, the scent so delicious that she was salivating heavily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh my,\u201d she said, looking it over and grinning.  \u201cIt\u2026 It both looks and smells wonderful!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlphonse grinned, setting the pan down on the table.  \u201cYou like?  Lemme set it down here and get some plates\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore he could leave, however, Felicia began to tear into the lasagna, the smell overcoming any sense of reason, inflaming her hunger to sudden intensity.  She used the serving spatula as a kind of spoon to shovel the tremendous amounts of lasagna into her mouth.  Cheese and sauce smeared around her face as she stuffed herself, her belly visibly swelling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlphonse, for his part, could only watch as Felicia stuffed herself.  He secretly took this job because he had a fetish for seeing women eat.  To see a woman as beautiful as Felicia stuffing herself\u2026 on HIS cooking no less\u2026 It was a dream come true.  He had to keep still, he didn\u2019t trust himself not to do something inappropriate otherwise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMmmm, delicious!\u201d Felicia moaned, licking her lips and continuing to hungrily stuff herself.  Bite after bite, huge scoopfull after huge scoopfull vanished into the catwoman\u2019s ravenous maw, her belly bulging out with each swallow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinally, after consuming more than half the pan of lasagna, Felicia stopped.  Her belly had bulged out to the size of a basketball, her jaws covered in sauce and gooey cheese.  She licked her lips, laying back on the couch and groaning, clutching her heavy belly, which Alphonse could almost hear gurgling as it struggled to digest the load the greedy catwoman had just forced into it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFelicia groaned, and let out a juicy belch, blushing.  \u201c\u2019Scuse me\u2026 Sorry, but that lasagna was just so GOOD\u2026 I couldn\u2019t help myself, it made me so hungry\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo not complaining,\u201d Alphonse heard himself say.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each time I take a meal you made, I always thought *<b>URP</b>* you're very skilled despite being young. But this lasagna is exceptional!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks Miss Felicia.\" Alphonse smiled shyly, trying not to be noticed that he couldn't take his eyes off from Felicia's sauce-covered bulging belly. \"Only a few days ago, I laid in a large stock of some special spice. I heard this product was developed to target the Catwomen and it contains the catnip, the root of kiwifruit and other herbs. All the matters relating to cooking was entrusted to me, so I apologize for not getting your previous permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't mind it, not at all. No wonder I was engrossed in that. Well, then\u2026\u201d Felicia leaned forward slowly and stared the pan of lasagna ravenously, a wet belch escaping her lips. \u201cResume the dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphonse was taken aback. That spice's effect seems to be a little more powerful than he had expected. His shoulder angel insisted he should stop Felicia and it's for her health. However, the temptation of a celebrity catwoman stuffed herself with his self-confident dish was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Miss, are you going to be OK...ea-eating so much? I think you should to keep your image as a singer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of *munch* course!\" Felicia answered and took a big bite into lasagna, without looking at Alphonse. All that she saw was the rest of the lasagna, for four persons at the lowest estimate. \"But such a small amount won't affect my figure. Probably.\" She added without thinking deeply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, she was feeling quite full, her belly having a hard fight against very heavy load. However, rather than her stomach's limit, she was more afraid of the possibility that the chef would confiscate this pan if she tells the truth. It\u2019s too delicious to waste!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing beside herself with joy, Felicia let go of the serving spatula, and plunged her head into the pan\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, the pan was empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Uuuggghhh\u2026*<b>BUURRP</b>* Excu*<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>BBUUUURRRPP!!</b></font>* Excuse me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia, being smeared all over with greasy sauce and sticky cheese, groaned with stomachache and burped intermittently. Now her belly was swollen to fitness-ball size, slightly flushed pink, and audibly gurgling and sloshing without a pause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphonse remained an awkward silence, his eyes wandering from place to place and regularly being glued to Felicia's overloaded belly in awe. He could not decide whether to continue to use the spice in question or not. It was clear that this is not healthy for Felicia, but he didn't want to miss a chance to have a fetish dream-like time under the pretense that he should serve good meal for his employer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al*<b>BURP</b>*phonse...\" Felicia gasped as she tried to allow Alphonse to leave. She was holding her intestinal gas that had been generating rapidly in, but she knew she must let it out (unless she wants to explode). She really didn't want to feel ashamed of herself in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, however, Felicia couldn't get that lasagna's scent and flavor out of her head...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Changing from her pajamas to her a usually red skirt and red boots. As she walked out her bedroom and entered the main room of her apartment; she heard her door bell ringing noisily. She walked towards the door with a cheerful smile and opened it, there was nobody there. She looked from both directions in the hallway to see if the person who was ringing her door bell has quickly ran off or was hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww... I was hoping it was Sonic...\" said Amy sadly, but before she was going to close the door she noticed that there was a bottle of perfume on the doormat; it even had a piece of paper attached to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! A gift for me? It has to be from Sonic!\" thought Amy as she picked up the perfume and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy quickly walked back into the bedroom and sat down on her bed to read the note from the perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Lovely Rose,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time I see you,<br>\r\nYou resemble the beauty of a Diamond,<br>\r\nEvery time I hear you,<br>\r\nYou always put a smile on my face,<br>\r\nWhen I smelt this lovely scent,<br>\r\nIt reminded me... of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom, Sonic<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy let out a long sigh of pleasure that her crush had finally realised how Sonic secretly loved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My darling Sonic...\" said Amy while blushing madly. Amy picked up the perfume and read the label. 'Sloberry La Pe'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she started to spray herself with the perfume to enjoy the smell, oddly it was something unexpected. The scent smelt of disgusting things, unclean socks, rotten food and the smell of a thousand farts. However seeing that this gift came from 'Sonic', Amy was blinded by love to seem to notice the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic...

For some reason, she craved it the second she saw it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly grabbing her phone, she ordered an astonishing of food, ranging from tacos, burritos, nachos, fried chicken, fatty steak, burgers with an absurd amount of fries and toppings, and the restaurant dubs the onion blossom, which was a fried onion.

This made her nervous, as she had a theory what it was; gas. And from she was taught, girls with gas are not sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought placed firmly in her mind, she tried to hold it in. But that did not last, for a blast erupted from her rear end. The fart came and... it felt good. All of a sudden, Amy felt relaxed, less full. Why would anyone say this was so bad? A little more bloat came back and she happily let out another toot, shifting her caboose to the right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome gas came back yet again, only this time, it was heading upward. Here came another taboo; burping. But when she released the belch, she enjoyed that too. She became a one-woman sound machine, with an \"URP\" here and a \"FFRRRT\" there.

She felt herself become instantly hungry and it got worse lower she went. When she got to the bottom she saw a huge pile of freshly preserved meats, fruits, and even sweets. She tried to run for it but she had gotten as far as the rope would allow. \"Gonzo, let go!\" Tetra demanded. \"But Miss Tetra, if I do that, you'll be stuck down there!\" \"I don't care. There's... uh... some really great loot down here. I'm sure there's another way out. These caves seem to go out in different directions. One of them has to be a second exit. Now just let go!\" Gonzo followed his orders and let go. As soon as Tetra no longer felt the pull against her she darted straight for the food. \"Miss Tetra should we try and meet up with you by finding the other cave?\" Gonzo said, still feeling unsure about this. \"NO!!! Um I mean, no. I'll be fine. Just continue searching the rest of the island then wait for me on the ship.\" Again, Gonzo did as he was told. He and the rest of the crew continued to search the island while Tetra had her feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetra ate just about anything and everything she could reach.

She soon realized this wasn't working that well. \"Man, I really don't feel like moving but I'm still really hungry. I wish someone was here to feed me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she heard a voice echo through the caves. \"Allow me to help you.\" it said and a Great Fairy appeared in front of her. \"Wow a Great Fairy, but what are you ding here? This doesn't look like a Great Fairy island.\" Tetra questioned. \"I'm a secret Great Fairy who appears only to the most diligent adventures. You must have done much exploring to find me.

Maybe I should leave but I don't really want to. Great Fairy, what do you think?\" This was an odd question for the fairy to answer because she never really concerned herself with physical appearances though she was getting a strange feeling from this young girl. She had a feeling of wanting to see what happened if she ate more. She wanted to feed her and watch her eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well young one, I could feed you for now and if you don't like what happens, I can always change you back with my magic.\" the Great Fairy said, hiding her true intentions.

After a rather rough start with her newly obtained Pok\u00e9mon, Kris was ready to take charge and truly begin her journey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she wasn\u2019t mumbling in her sleep still\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 go get them Cyndaquil,\u201d she spoke in between snores. Meanwhile her Cyndaquil remained on her lap throughout the night; still fast asleep too. Eventually Kris was woken up Nurse Joy of the center; who couldn\u2019t stand the combined snoring from the two. As the nurse nudged them, Kris\u2019 and her Cyndaquil\u2019s bubbles popped from shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 OH! Sorry Nurse Joy,\u201d rubbing with her back with a nervous chuckle. \u201cWell this is rather embarrassing,\u201d she thought to herself. Collecting her things and still carrying her Pok\u00e9mon, Kris left the center and began her way to the next route; every second letting out a loud long yawn from her mouth. Unfortunately there was another bump on the road for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a couple of steps out from the Pok\u00e9mon Center and Kris\u2019 stomach was letting out constant growls, wanting to be fed and fast. Rubbing her flat stomach, she also noticed Cyndaquil was growling for food too. \u201cI guess we\u2019re both hungry huh?\u201d she giggled. \u201cMaybe this can help us bond,\u201d she thought. Luckily the Poke-Mart was just next door to the Pok\u00e9mon Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside Kris purchased all sorts of food and snacks for her adventure, from sandwiches, chocolate bars, and fizzy drinks and so on; until she kindly paid the person at the counter. Taking a seat near the entrance of route 30, she gently placed Cyndaquil on the floor and gave it it\u2019s share. Patting it on the head, Kris smiled and said, <b>\u201cLet\u2019s dig in!\u201d</b></div></span></div></div>",

Things like mayonnaise, and bits of mushed chocolate, soon covered it's mouth, chin, and lower neck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris herself wasn't acting any better, as her attempts to shove as much of each sandwich into her mouth as possible. Crumbs and condiments surrounded her mouth, covering her cheeks and chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing each of her sandwiches, she looked to her candy and chocolate. \"I guess dessert wouldn't hurt... I do love sweets after all.\" taking a bite of some chocolate, she was reminded how good such treats tasted. Looking left and right to see if anyone was watching, and started cramming more candy into her mouth than it could actually hold, causing bits of wet, sticky crumbs, and melted chocolate drops fell onto her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRefusing to be beaten by such a simple human limitation, she held it all in with her hands, and forced her mouth to chew until she could swallow bits of the massive clump of sugar down her throath. upon one last swallow, she let out a victorious sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally full, she rubbed her messy hand over her now slightly bulged stomach, leaving behind a messy hand print on her shirt. \"That hit the spot... how are you doing Cyndaquil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tiny partner had eaten all it could handle, and laid on it's side on top of it's own mess as ot yawned. \"Wow, you're pretty messy after all of that, huh?\" Cyndaquil let out a small sound of bliss as it started to doze off. \"Tired already? But it's still so early...\" Kris' train of thought was interupted by the sound of snoring. \"... Why does something so lazy have to be so cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the young trainer picked up the mouse like pokemon, she only now noticed she herself was coverd in food. \"Oh, wow, what happened to me? I've never gotten this carried away before!\" as she cradled the young pokemon, she remembered her mother had made her pack a spare set of clothes. She'd have to waste time heading back to the center to change though, and already she had wasted quite a bit of time, and she was still supposed to retrieve Professor Elm's present from Mr. Pokemon, It wasn't like she was expecting to make a good first impression for anyone important, right?</span></div></div>",

Kris wasn\u2019t attending some sort of fancy party, she\u2019s a Pok\u00e9mon trainer and getting messy was part of the experience\u2026! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she thought. \u201cI\u2019ll clean all of this later, Professor Elm is relying on me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving a trail of crumbs and rubbish from the spot they were, Kris and her equally messy companion Cyndaquil headed off towards Mr. Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s home in route 30. Compared to yesterday, Kris was full of energy and ready to take on any challenge that awaited her, today? Not so much. Slightly winded and puffing for air, Kris stumbled along route 30 towards Mr. Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u2026 <b>*Huff*</b> I shouldn\u2019t have\u2026 <b>*Huff*</b> eating that much,\u201d panting with each step she took. Cyndaquil slept peacefully in Kris\u2019 arms as she proceeded through the harsh grass fields. While Cyndaquil was snoring and letting it\u2019s bubble expand and deflate, it soon brought up a new pattern in it\u2019s lazy behaviour. \u201cWhy is my arm suddenly damp?\u201d wondered Kris. Stopping to investigate, she soon found out where the source of dampness was coming from, Cyndaquil was drooling all over her arms; making her sleeves wet from it\u2019s salvia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAHH! Oh come on Cyndaquil!\u201d But before she could lecture her Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s indecent actions, Kris saw a wild Caterpie that had appeared in-front of them. \u201cAlright Cyndaquil, its show time!\u201d Gently putting Cyndaquil down to face this bug Pok\u00e9mon, Kris pointed and shouted, \u201cCyndaquil use Tackle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cyndaquil just remained still and snored. \u201cNot again\u2026\u201d Kris whined. As the Caterpie slowly approached Cyndaquil ready to attack, it was suddenly engulfed by flames. \u201cWhat the-?!\u201d While Cyndaquil didn\u2019t move or follow her trainer\u2019s command, instead Cyndaquil let out a sneeze which let out a tiny fireball. Surprised to see this one hit the foe, Kris quickly pulled out a Poke ball.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoke ball go!\u201d Kris chucked the sphere at the fallen bug and within seconds she had obtained her second Pok\u00e9mon. Well it wasn\u2019t what she was expecting, but it was certainly a step up from yesterday\u2019s battle. \u201cGood job Cyndaquil,\u201d complimenting her partner. \u201cQuil\u2026?\u201d mumbled Cyndaquil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRe-energised from the battle Kris and Cyndaquil headed up to a little house halfway up of the route. There she received an apricot basket and even more snacks to carry in her backpack, as she made her way to Mr. Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s house.

Mr. Pokemon I presume?\" she closed the gap between the two of them as the man turned around, only to meet with a sudden revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-professer Oak!?\" Kris took a few steps back as she held up her equally messy Cyndaquil in front of her face as she turned red with embarrassment, it yawned, just now waking up from another sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was possibly the most embarrasing thing to ever happen to her in her life. Here was the leading authority on all things Pokemon to see her looking like a complete SLOB as their first impression. It's only beena day and a half, and yet this adventure just kept getting worse and worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Professor placed a hand on Kris' shoulder \"Ah, you're fine. You're only young once, so it's okay to occasionally get carried away when trying to bond wih your Pokemon.\" He lifted his hand, and Kris lowered her Cyndaquil, revealing her still red face. \"Although... you both should probably go easy on the sweets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly now did Kris notice another man in the room. Turning to see the old, mustachio'd man in a brown suit, with a matching hat, she feelt he looked like he was dressed to go to a fancy restaurant in the cold seasons. He was checking the computer moniter, when he noticed the visitors. \"Ah, you must be here for the package. Hang on while I get it for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA momentary silence passed, before Oak quickly turned his attention to Kris and offered a pokedex. Kris nodded, quickly realizing how great an honor such an offer was. \"If you find the time, try and fill it out as much as you can. I can use all the help I can get\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Professer Oak left, Mr. Pokemon came back with the package. \"Be very careful with this, it's quite fragile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris had and easier time getting back to Cherrygrove now that she had a CaterpIe, this gave her time to think as she walked. Specifically about the package \"I wonder what it is?\" Her thoughts were cut short ae her pokegear rang, and incoming call came from Professor Elm. She quickly answered \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello? Kris? It's a disaster! Uh, um, it's just terrible! What should I do? It... Oh, no... Please get back here now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on my way Professer! I should be there by morning!\" Kris was actually closer than she let on, she very well could of gotten there before midnight, but something in her just couldn't find the energy to walk much longer. She'd have to stop by the center in Cherrygrove again and rest before she could make it to the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the courner of the Pokemon center, Kris and Cyndaquil were once again sleeping, complete with matching bubbles as they snored.

Suddenly out of nowhere, some girl appeared in Kris\u2019 line of sight and approached them. Wearing a white rounded hat with a red ribbon on it that was followed by her blue overalls and yellow handbag, Kris could only assume she too was a Pok\u00e9mon trainer heading out to start her journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAahh, so you\u2019re the one who took the other Pok\u00e9mon at the lab?\u201d she said. Kris remained silent at this stranger, wondering what her ploy was. Leaning in closer to have a better glance at Kris and her sleeping Cyndaquil, the girl\u2019s face quickly changed to a wicked grin. \u201cWhat a waste, oh well, at-least you and your Pok\u00e9mon have one thing in common,\u201d she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re both pigs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngered by her statement, Kris immediately put Cyndaquil down and instantly glared back at this stranger. \u201cOH REALLY?! Well then, show me what you got \u2018Miss Perfectionist\u2019\u201d! Barking back with rage, her words shooting some spit out and landing on the girl\u2019s clothes. Wiping it away with disgust, Lyra continued to snicker. \u201cI\u2019ll show you what I mean!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there a battle commenced between the two girls, Kris calling her Cyndaquil ready to fight, while their mysterious friend threw out a Poke-Ball; which came with a surprise. Out came a\u2026 Totodile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d she muttered. But there was something rather different about this particular Totodile, it was rather plump and was constantly salivating. Not wanting to back down, Kris cleared her throat and said, \u201cCyndaquil use tackle!\u201d Expecting her Pok\u00e9mon to do nothing again, this time however it managed to stand up and lazily bump into Totodile. \u201cGood work!\u201d cheering it. Irritated by that first shot, the stranger commanded Totodile to use bite, but instead of chomping on Cyndaquil instead it started wolfing down some random berries. \u201cYou idiot!\u201d Kris and Cyndaquil laughed at this remarkable display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight was long and tedious but in the end, Kris won from the combined efforts Cyndaquil and Caterpie, while her opponent\u2019s Totodile was more interesting chowing down on food it somehow acquired. On the verge of tears, the stranger quickly grabbed her defeated Pok\u00e9mon and sprinted off before shouting out, \u201cThe name\u2019s Lyra! And next time we meet, I\u2019m gonna be a Pok\u00e9mon Master!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah, yeah righ-<b>*URP*</b>!\u201d Kris snapped back before interrupted by a sudden belch. \u201cThat came out of nowhere,\u201d she thought. Patting her Pok\u00e9mons\u2019 heads for their hard work, they continued on their way back to Elm\u2019s lab. </div></span></div></div>",

Some rude girl with a Totodile got in the way... amung other issues\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElm's assistant nodded, looking towards a now sleeping Cyndaquil. \"I can tell you were in quite a rush... You know, I never would of belived that Cyndaquil would ever move on it's own had I not seen it for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man in blue walked up to her, and kneeled down, holding up a notepad. \"You mentioned battling a girl with a Totodile?

So Kris handed the package to the assistant. \"I'll stop by later to talk to the Professor, but for now I think I'll spend a little time at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably for the better (for both of you, you need a bath...), I'll make sure he gets this...\"</span></div></div>",

She placed a hand on her slightly bulged gut, and thought about putting down her fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again...\" Kris' mind told her it was a good idea to stop, and not to overdo it. but a growling in her stomach knew it could be a very long time before she'd have a chance to taste her mother's wonderful cooking. \"I guess I can overeat just this once...\" and so she resumed eating, taking care not to drop even the smallest crumb. A meal like this was too good to waste, and she hadn't eaten all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Caterpie was already full, having fallen asleep, Kris' Cyndaquil had wanted one last go. Unfortunately, the rest of the food had already vanished, leaving a bloated gut large enough to show just a crack of Kris' belly. \"S-sorry Cyndaquil... I guess I over did it, huh... *urp*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris' Mother giggled, covering her mouth to hide a smile. \"You really were hungry, huh?\" she then placed a freshly baked pie on the table \"I guess you don't have room for dessert, huh?\" her smile grew bigger as she asked the rhetorical question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I alwa*urp*... always have room for your apple pie, mom! (exscuse me) One for Cyndaquil too, please!\" Her partner took great pleasure in seeing a slice placed in front of it, wasting no time chowing down as the young trainer did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh... I can't *urp* believe we ate it *uuurrrp* all... *BUUURP*\" Kris gave up on excusing herself for each belch as she placed her two sleeping pokemon on the foot of her bed. \"*urp*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her swollen stomach, she could see quite a bit of skin showing between her pajamas. It hurt a little, but it felt a bit better as she tstarted to rub it. \"But... it was just so good. It was totally worth-*FRRRT*...\" Kris' face turned a heavy shade of red as she realized she was just cut off by a rather loud fart she had made herself. \"I really hope Mom didn't hear that.\"</span></div></div>",

Quil...\" As usual Kris was struggling to get her companion awake and alert. \"Come on Cyndaquil.\" Before letting out a long yawn herself. \"Geez, watching you sleep is also making me\u2026 tried as well, you know?\" Scratching her rump without a single thought. Eventually Cyndaquil managed to wake up when it's nose picked up a nice sweet scent from downstairs; even Kris could smell it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... Pancakes,\" licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a nice breakfast and another goodbye to her mother, Kris and Cyndaquil went to Professor Elm's lab to continue what was left off from yesterday\u2019s conversation. Entering the lab while still licking her sticky hands from the amount of maple syrup she poured onto her pancakes, she saw the professor by his desk before he noticed her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah there you are Kris,\" he beamed before noticing the sticky stains on Kris' clothes and her Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s face. \"I see you had one heck of a breakfast.\" Blushing at what he meant, Kris tried to clean herself up by wiping her hands on her clothes. \"So Professor, what's in *Urp* the package?\" Quickly changing the subject and blushing redder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, the package,\" Turning around and pulling the package up onto the desk, there he revealed what was inside. \"Behold Kris.\" Opening the top of the box, there inside was an oddly coloured egg. \"An egg...?\" she asked in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just any kind of egg my dear, a Pok\u00e9mon Egg to be more precise,\" He boasted while re-adjusting his glasses. \"This is one of Mr. Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s biggest discoveries and this can certainly help with my continued research about Pok\u00e9mon Evolution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on Kris also told the Professor she happened to meet Professor Oak there at Mr. Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s residence and she was given a Poke-Dex. Showing him the device made Elm jump back from his desk in surprise before smiling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-That's incredible! He must have seen some sort of potential in you Kris,\" he stammered. \"I think you might have what it takes to be even the Champion, you should head to Violet City and challenge the Gym there!\" Stroking Cyndaquil\u2019s head, Kris smiled how much they had achieved in a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there Kris made her way to Violet City.</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Save for a couple wold pokemon battles, route 29 was rather uneventful this time around, Thankfully, this meant she was making good time, so Kris decided to pick a few things up at the pokemart in Cherrygrove before heading to route 30. Halfway through though, she had her second ever trainer battle against a youngster named Joey...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... that was *burp* actually kinda sad...\" Kris murmured under her breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after his defeat, Joey asked for Kris' number. \"I'll ring you for some battles. I'm a rookie too, so I think it'd be a good motivator.\" As Kris was about to reject his offer, she noticed a flash of light. Turning her head to the source, she found that her Caterpie was now a Metapod. Easy money and fighting experience now seemed a bit hard to pass up. \"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris had gotten so carried away battling other trainers that she had lost track of time, and now it was pretty dark. For the firat time, she finally decided to feel her now somewhat squishy stomach. \"Hmm...\" she wasn't really too hungry, but she was felt too tired to move on, so Kris decided to rest near the start of Route 31 until she caught her breath. And what better excuse to eat something good than resting by a warm fire...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat she had to start herself, as her Cyndaquil decided to sleep. Apparently, Kris could only motivate it during battle, as it was rarely in motion at any other time, unless food was involved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess that means more for me!\" She teased. Kris knew Cyndaquil would be awoken by the scent of something edible. Kris pulled a can of beans from her bag, bought at the Cherrygrove Pokemart. \"I knew this would come in handy!\" Peeling the lid off of the easy open can, she licked her lips, ready to dig in once she pulled out a spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking out a big scoop, Kris shoved the spoon into her mouth, dropping quite a bit onto her lap. she then proceeded to talk with her mouth full. \"Mmm, Shoooo goood... Here you gho SHinduhquil!\" As even more fell out of her mouth, she gave a few scoops to Cyndaquil, spoonfeeding it as if it was a child, then wiped the spoon on her shirt to clean it before eating some more herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, so glad I bought that *URRRP* second can!\" Kris said before getting on her knees and leaning over to search her bag. \"Now to *buuurp* wash it down with some soda!\" As the messy trainer looked through her stuff to find something to drink, the moon had fully peaked over the horizon, signifying that night had arrived, and some wild pokemon went to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while her attention was elsewhere, she failed to notice one rare pokemon that roamed the night, a ghostly creature made of toxic gasses, difficult to see in the darkness. Unoticed by either of her pokemon, the creature was about to engulf it's prey and suffocate her with it's poisonous body when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! here they a- *phrt*\" as Kris sat up with a bottle of soda in each hand, the dim light of the campfire showed her face as it turned red. Despite the fact no one was around to hear it, Kris couldn't help but feel deeply embarrassed by the sound of gas escaping from her backside. Her face faded back to it's normal color though as she heard the sound of something coughing. Turning to see the source of the sound, she let out a scream, waking up Cyndaquil and Metapod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about ready to run, when she noticed it was keeping a distance. The distance only grew upon the sound of another fart escaping from Kris' rear. \"... Heh... heheh...\" A smile could be found sneaking on Kris' face, the Irony of the situation was not lost on her. Burst out in laughter, her gas flatulence going crazy, being unable to control herself as the wild Ghastly was ready to flee, turning around. But it's escape was cut short by a sticky string covering it's face. As it struggled to get it off, it soon met up with a small shot of fire, burning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee! Good job guys! Now leave the rest to me!\" Kris managed to suppress her Laughter as she pulled out a pokeball. \"You're mine Ghastly!\" The ball collided with the partially solid gas cloud, engulfing it in a flash of light as it was sucked in. The struggle was short lived before the ball clicked shut, sealing the ghost inside. \"Alright! We *urp* did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris headed toward Violet City, off to win her first badge once she got some rest at the nearest pokemon center. She didn't feel so embarrassed of her gas problem anymore, in fact she was actually kind of proud of it. But not as proud as she was of her two pokemon. She was ready to be a master, and tomorrow was the day she'd take her first real step towards that goal.</span></div></div>",

After her and Pok\u00e9mon had eating an enormous breakfast at the Pok\u00e9mon Center, Kris marched out and was set to find the gym in the city and earn her first gym badge. Not bothering to change her dirty and slightly tight clothes once more, she stumbled her way through the city, constantly letting out little belches out now and again; until she noticed something that caught her interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching what she saw, there she discovered a huge three-tiered tower made entirely out of wood with multiple eaves. \u201cHmm\u2026 Maybe some sightseeing couldn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Pondering at the idea while her hand scratched her slightly exposed belly poking out underneath her top. \u201cWhat do you think Cyndaquil?\u201d Lifting her companion to face her directly, the little Pok\u00e9mon merely sneezed and resumed sleeping; leaving quite a mess on Kris\u2019 pudgy face. \u201c\u2026I\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside Kris was astonished by what she had discovered\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing <b>*HUFF*</b> here *PANT* was a <b>*HUFF*</b> mistake\u2026\u201d Puffing and mumbling with regret, Kris found herself climbing a series of stairs to get to each floor of the tower, to her surprise and common knowledge of everyone else; there wasn\u2019t any elevators to use; just a huge amount of stairs to climb. Not wanted to really strain herself, she put Cyndaquil back in it\u2019s Poke-ball unless there\u2019s a battle about to commence in the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, it wasn\u2019t just stairs she had to endure, when she had reached the second floor she had battled a couple of the sages that resided there, each with a Bellsprout under their care and very thing that tower\u2019s theme is based upon. The battles didn\u2019t last very long as Metapod and her newly obtained Ghastly made short work of them; meanwhile Cyndaquil slept through the whole thing. Eventually she had reached the third and final floor of the building, her whole body was sweating not-stop from the \u2018little\u2019 exercise she went through to get here. Sweat had completely soaked her clothes, as she raised her chubby arms slightly to let the cool air flow under her armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally\u2026\u201d Still gasping for air before letting out air of her own from her sweaty arse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPPPPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTT!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning with a tiny hint of pleasure, Kris dumbly smiled at the relief she had let out into the room before noticing who she saw in front of her. There up ahead was that girl she had encountered a few days ago, Lyra!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs promised here\u2019s your HM,\u201d said the sage. \u201cBut let me say this, you should look after yourself and your Pok\u00e9mon with your\u2026 well\u2026\u201d Before he could finish, Lyra quickly turned around to leave but saw Kris standing in her way; she looked rather\u2026 different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kris met Lyra, she had a skinny frame of a body; but now? She almost matches the same amount of meat found on Kris, with the exception of the massive potbelly that was being well held within her overalls; along with her chubby thighs and plump hips. Sucking on what seemed to be a lollipop, Lyra glared at Kris and said, \u201cHmmph, you again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re here to try your luck with the Elder, spoiler alert, he\u2019s weak and doesn\u2019t offer much a challenge.\u201d Before getting any chance the question her, Lyra bumped Kris aside with her belly and left the floor in a hurry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the building, Kris received a HM with a moved called Flash after defeating the Elder and hearing his words of wisdom. Unfortunately he wasn\u2019t the gym leader and the gym was actually on the far left side near the tower. Feeling she made some progress anyway and got some extra hours of prep time before the eventful match with the gym leader, she decided to\u2026</div></span></div></div>",

Although the two trainers who had impeded her Progress were not much of a challenge, all the hype building up was really wearing her down.

I need to lay down...\" A puddle of sweat started to form as she stood there, finally taking a moment to breath properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to make one last stop today, and that was to the pokemon center.

While Kris was going full on gluttony this morning, Cyndaquil chomped loudly on it\u2019s share of food, getting equally messier as it\u2019s owner; shoving some Onion Rings down it\u2019s stuffed mouth.  Even Metapod and Ghastly were mimicking the two, as they too were also lost on the delicious tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUUURRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPP! Letting out a thunderous burp out in the building for everyone to hear. \u201cMmm\u2026 delicious\u2026\u201d Kris beamed lipping her fingers with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaying Nurse Joy for the big breakfast and collecting her things, Kris waddled her way out and proceeded her journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris waddled her way down the streets of the town, still oblivious to the massive amount of weight she\u2019d gained from the past few days or, for that matter, the fact that her clothes have not been washed or changed from the amount of filth and stains that have been gathering. Her once trim and fit body had fattened up considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was expanding at a rapid pace as it was filled with all sorts of fatty foods. Her top underneath her jacket had now ridden up past her belly button, as her stomach was growing bigger, rounder, softer and flabbier by the second. On top of that, her once small breasts have now swollen and beginning to overflow her tight top. And then down to the lower half of her body her ass, hips, and thighs have also gotten considerably chunkier as well; hugging her shorts tightly too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Cyndaquil was packing quite a belly on it\u2019s small body. But that didn\u2019t bother Kris at all, or even question why she was very sluggish today, as she slowly waddled her way for route 32 where she learned this the route she needed to take; to get to Azalea Town and get her second badge. \u201cI\u2019ll visit Goldenrod City another time,\u201d she thought strolling along through the woods, leaving a trail of sweat from her flabby body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, Kris and her remarkable team faced many wild Pok\u00e9mon and Trainers, not many gave Kris much trouble, as each win made her belch and fart from the victorious results. Later on, she came across a pier and tried her best not be imitated by the fishermen who had casted their lures there; some of which that were trainers too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need *HUFF* a drink,\u201d she panted rubbing her flabby elbow on her sweaty forehead. She pulled out a fizzy soda can from her bag and drank it down in one go, some spilling from the sides of her mouth, as the liquid ran down her neck and down towards her top\u2019s turtleneck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Kris arrived at another Pok\u00e9mon Center, it was already night and thought it would be a better idea to rest and continue onwards tomorrow and of course have another big meal.

I couldn't even BEGIN to afford that! I don't think It's even physically possible to hold that much money!\" her face turned red with rage, the young trainer stormed into the center, grumbling angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I thought kids these days were loaded...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the doors closed behind her however, her stomach gave an angry grumble of it's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh... this talk of edible things made me even hungrier...\" as she gave her pokemon to Nurse Joy, she ordered more food than usual. dozens of burgers, fries, sweets, plus extra for her pokemon, as well as lots to drink. As her pokemon were returned, Nurse Joy bowed her head politely, though the fact that she wore a clothespin on her nose as her eyes watered due to the terrible B.O. was lost on the messy girl, who was still fumming in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We hope to see you again soon... hopefully after you've bathed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to eat with her companions instead of sitting at a table, Kris layed all the greasy food across the floor, and started to dig in, beginning with a large burger packed with various layers of food and condiments. Taking a large bite, some ketchup was squeezed out of the other end, and into her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thish ish *burp* sho gud.\" As she spoke with her mouth full, dropping partially chewed food into her now ketchup stained lap, she was already starting to forget why she was mad. She just knew that there was a pile of food in front of her, and she and her pokemon were going to eat every last bit of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris and her three partners layed on a pile of chewed up food and greasy wrappers, all of them stuffed to their limit with junk tood and soda. Kris moaned in a mix of pleasure and pain as she eased the pressure in her bloated gut with loud belches, with and occasional fart roaring out from behind.

All while Kris continued to expel gas from both ends of her body. As she started to dream, her belly started to churn loudly as it started to digest all of the food contained within. At the moment it was causing her shirt to ride up, now almost completely exposed, but it soon started to slowly spread some of it's newly found fat all across the blue haired trainer's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zzz...

The Nurse Joy of the facility was disgusted to find the mess Kris and her team had managed to make during their short stay, with so much filth, crumbs and stains left around the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND DON'T COME BACK WHEN YOU LEARN SOME MANNERS YOUNG LADY!\" shouted Nurse Joy, pushing the obese girl straight out of the building and closing the door behind her quickly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbfounded by all of this, Kris scratched her sweaty armpit with utter confusion at what she just witnessed. \"What's her problem?\" Shrugging at the overdramatic nonsense that just occurred, Kris waddled down the lane towards her next destination; the Union Cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Union Cave may have been a very simple cave for everyone else who have travelled through it, however Kris wasn\u2019t simply \u2018everyone else\u2019. She had a hard time walking through the rocky terrain and finding different paths to cross the many pools of water she encountered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris was hoping to use Cyndaquil to help her see in the dark, but she knew it rather lay down and sleep peacefully in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting the wild Pok\u00e9mon and Pok\u00e9mon trainers that inhabited the place was no easy task as well, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that Kris was reeking of a very foul stench that surrounded her flabby sweaty body. Any Pok\u00e9mon or Trainer that tried to challenge her would soon meet a dreadful smell that went straight up their nostrils, immediately avoiding and evading any further contact with the stinky blue hair heroine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may have taken all day, but finally Kris made it through the cave as it was already dark once more, taking another drink to quench her thirst and spilling it all over herself. She waddled her away straight to Azalea Town hoping to find the nearest Pok\u00e9mon Center; however she was met with something else instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed a strange black dressed person standing in-front of what seems to be a well, being curious she approached the man to find out why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello *URRP* there, what\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked back at Kris and was about to answer, but the horrid stench that had been following her immediately made contact with his nose and made his eyes tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-J-Just standing guard\u2026 the well\u2026 the well is unsafe so I\u2019m stand-standing guard,\u201d he responded, trying to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to continue bothering this man\u2019s task, Kris wandered her way into town, just before letting out a long fart that made the man faint from the lack of fresh air to breath. \u201cWhat a nice guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she staggered through town looking for the Pok\u00e9mon Center, Kris\u2019 eyes jumped at the mere sight of the Pok\u00e9mon Gym as it was on the opposite side of the Center, \u201cHow convenient,\u201d she thought. Wanting to check out the competition unlike before, Kris headed towards the Gym\u2019s main entrance but she was stopped by\u2026 another man wearing black?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry kid, the gym\u2019s under\u2026 maintenance, yeah,\u201d the man stated with a sly grin on his face. Kris wasn\u2019t very happy to find out about this, as she was hoping to get her badge as soon as possible. Just before she left the man\u2019s sight, \u201cHey, have you heard about the Slowpoke Tail? I heard it\u2019s rather tasty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>SLAP!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I help you\u2026 miss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her throbbing hand, Kris looked at Nurse Joy and said, \u201cThere\u2019s some sickos out there.\u201d<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

Her frustration didn't completely subside this time around though, as she barely even bothered tasting her meal before swallowing. Her pokemon companions could barely keep up as they devored their share as fast as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Joy had only just noticed the mess left behind by the time Kris had stormed out of the center, hearing the words \"What in the world!?\" before the door shut behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a loud fart as she looked around, Kris couldn't help but notice something about the town seemed a bit... off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps talking to everyone she could find and asking questions would shed a little light on the situation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the slowpoke have disappeared from the town.

She wanted to check one last place to the north of the town before jumping to conclusions. It was a house built somewhat differently then the rest, as it appeared more old fashioned...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old man named Kurt and his grandchild were the only two living there, and apparently they made special pokeballs out of fruit. She could overhear the young girl's concern for the missing pokemon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The slowpoke are gone... Were they taken away by bad people?\" it was shortly after the young child noticed an odd scent. \"Oh wow, grandpa, what is that awful smell!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking to the old man, he mentioned teaching a group named Team Rocket a lesson in pain before rushing off to the well. It took a while, being so out of shape and bloated from her earlier meal, but she managed to make it to the well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He *pant* must be crazy *pant* going in all *BURRRRP* alone... phew\" Taking a moment to catch her breath, a puddle of sweat was quickly forming beneath her drenched body. \"If it really is Team Rocket, there's no way he should go alone... *PHRRRRRRRT* That's better!\" with the man guarding the entrance to the well gone, she headed in, hoping nothing had already gone wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurt! Are you okay!?\" Kris got on her knees as she tried to help a fallen Kurt up onto his feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took a tumble down the WELL. I slammed down hard on my<br>\r\nback, so I can't move. I guess it can't be helped. Young lady, if you could, show them how gutsy you are in my place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick nod, the blue haired trainer went deeper into the well, wich seemed to be more of a cave from the inside. It didn't take long before she saw a few people dressed in black, seemingly acting as guards, when two of them covered their noses. \"Wh-what is that smell! It smells like a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a loud BUUUUURP cut the grunt's words short, while another one with a familiar face noticed the source, recognizing Kris \"Ack! I-it's that girl! I'm out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two ran off, the third grunt, a female, stayed behind and yelled at them. \"Oh come on you two cowards! It's not like the smell is any worse than Proton's Koffing!\" turning towards Kris, her face looked determined and ready for battle. \"Well I'm not about to risk disobeying an order from him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the fight could start however, Kris' stomach could be heard begging for food, much to the grunt's amusment. \"Hah, tell you what, I'll give you a few free slowpoke tails, you leave, and we'll pretend none of this ever happened...\"</span></div></div>",

But a good tackle was all that was needed to finish the snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't believe I lost to some stupid pig of a trainer!\" A bit surprised, the grunt took a few steps back nervously, but wore a fake grin on her face to hide any fear as she lifted a large sack full of what was presumably the tails of the poor slowpoke. \"Wh-whatever, I got more than enough tails for a good profit, I'm out... of...\" she slowly turned around as she felt an ominous presence hovering behind her, \"here...?\" her eyes met with that of a sentient, toxic cloud. \"... crap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris started to walk up to the the woman in a Team Rocket<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris dropped the now empty sack as she walked deeper into the well, leaving behind a stomach bloated, crying female member of Team Rocket laying on the ground, whimpering \"So delicious... yet so *urp* gross...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined to put a stop to the whole scheme, the young blue haired trainer continued down the path withing the cave-like well, hoping to find the person in charge. Not much further however, she could once again feel her stomach cry out for something to fill it, causing her to grab her stomach in pain as she fell to her knees. her body was heavily sweating, moreso than usual, slowly causing a puddle to form under her, growing wider the longer she stayed on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so hungry... So hot... need food...\" If she didn't eat food quick, she may start eating some tails out of desperation. She quickly placed her bag on the ground and opened it, she was glad she remembered to fill it with food. Sandwiches, chocolates, sodas, chips, and even a few pieces of pie wrapped in foil, all of which made her mouth poor drool down her chin in anticipation, dripping onto the bag. The bag was so full that a lot of the food was squished and crushed, and some of the chocolate had started to melt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a few portions of it all out for her three pokemon, she now sat on her rear, soaking it in the still growing puddle beneath her on the dirty rocky surface of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't stand the hunger anymore, she needed food now, thus the Team Rocket \"Executive\" would have to wait just a little bit longer.</span></div></div>",

Apparently, the Pokemon Professor Elm sent his assistant to give it to her, in hopes that she would hatch it during her journey, and had caught up to her before any food arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith such faith in her from Elm, the young trainer was ready to make massive amounts of progress by next morning, and was certain to reach her next destination as soon as possible once she beat the Azalea Town Gym.</span></div></div>",

None of them seemed much of a challange though, especially with her newly evolved Quilava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBugsy, a young boy who was apparently an expert in the field of bug type pokemon, took one look at the Blue haired mess of a trainer, and noticed her odd appearance. amoung all the stickly food stains and drool, Kris was drenched in sweat from her journy to reach Bugsy, yet with a look of determination, clearly refused to be short on breath. The only thing that seemed to rival Kris' recently obtained slobbish behavior was her desire to win, something that seemed to rub off on her pokemon the same way their lack of manners rubbed off onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis actually made Bugsy a lttle nervous, but he said what he always told all trainers before he'd fight them, and a battle soon followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out into the sun, Kris held up her newest badge infront of her face. It was almost disappointing how easy it was, but that just made progressing to the next destination easier. As an added bonus Mettapod evolved into Butterfry after it took out Bugsy's Kakuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a mighty fart, her head finally realized just how much she was sweating, and she dropped onto her rear. \"Whew, time to cool down...\" opening her bag, she realized she was on her last soda, and the only thing accompanying it was the egg entrusted to her by Elm. \"Guess we're stopping at the Pokemart before we *BURRRP* continue.\" And with that, she drank her last beverage in one go, spilling some of it down her chin as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving to carry the egg in her arms now with how much she stuffed into her bag, Kris made took a deep breath, before farting again, then made her way into Ilex Forest. \"Here I go. I'm not coming out unless it's on the *BURP* other side!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris' mouth began to drool as she fantasized about all the various foods she'd get to eat once she finally made it to Goldenrod City. she knew the journey there would probably be a long one, but she felt it wou'd be worth it in the end.</span></div></div>",

Lifting herself up and wiping the dirt on her already messy clothes, Kris noticed the egg was missing and started to panic. \u201cOH NO! Where is it? Where is it?!\u201d Sweating nervously at what she had done. Luckily there was no trainers or wild Pok\u00e9mon nearby so Kris wouldn\u2019t be interrupted, she hastily checked everywhere in her area to find the egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil finally she found it well hidden in some bushes. \u201cThere you are,\u201d she beamed. Bending down to collect the egg; until another unexpected thing occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPP! </b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreezing in place, Kris\u2019 face instantly flared up with red and slowly moved her flabby arms and hands to her backside to confirm what she heard was true. \u201cPlease please please please\u2026\u201d she muttered to herself, hoping it was something else but unfortunately she was correct at what she felt. There on her shorts revealed a big massive ripped hole, with her sweaty chunky ass free for all to see; while still being held with her wedged panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly picking up the egg, Kris sprinted her way through the forest as fast as she could; before anyone or Pok\u00e9mon sees her like this. She waddled as fast as she could but, that didn\u2019t last very long as she only made it barely at the forest\u2019s lake, huffing and panting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying down in exhaustion, Kris admitted her defeat and rested for a while before thinking what to do next.</div></span></div></div>",

Kris couldn't believe it! Had she really earned it, just like that?  She accepted it nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here, you've also earned this.\" Whitney gave Kris a sheet of paper. Inside was her...phone number! \"now you can call me! ...Any time you like! Really, I'm available -all- the time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, erm...thanks. I'll do that!\" Despite her recently gained \"charms\", Kris seemed oblivious as to what was going on. She thanked Whitney for the badge, and walked out, hips swaying as usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney watched her go....every second of it. Her attention squarely on Kris' bare spot on her rear. She just couldn't take her eyes away. It was so big, and luscious, and shapely...and mmmm, those dimples...all she could do was stand and stare, a dumb smile on her face, drooling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her mouth filled with huge, wicked fangs, and her fingers fused into three sharp-clawed digits on each hand, and her legs expanded hugely, particularly her thighs which grew thick with flab and muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did th-they do to me?!\" Samus stuttered in shock, her hands groping and pinching her belly rolls. \"I look almost like Kraid!\" Her eyes still staring at her newly grown organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly all of her eyes became deeply coloured red instead of clear white. Three spikes grew out from her enormous belly, making the transformed bounty hunter howl from the sudden pain, but couldn't help but moan from the strange pleasure. And lastly, a giant reptilian tail grew out from above her colossal ass, that slithered out to stretch and flick about freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better find those blasted pirates and find out why they even did this to me!\" Samus snarled while her new nose flared puffed angrily, as she stormed off with heavy loud thuds on the ground.</div></span></div></div>",
