I don't know if I could take any more surprise visitors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise visitors?\" the boy asked, holding his friend's rather heavy, fully wrapped birthday gift in both hands. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ugh my aunt--\" Johnny was cut off by a feminine voice yelling from another room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JOHNNY WHO IS IT AT THE DOOR?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny sighed and pitched his voice as high as hers. \"JUST MY FRIEND RICKY, AUNT LESLEY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK! Well let him in! You guys are letting a draft in the house by keeping that door open!\" She yelled from the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny rolled his eyes. 'It's summer for gods sake. A little breeze of fresh air never hurt anyone...'<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRicky stepped into the house and Johnny closed the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your aunt, huh?\" Ricky asked, kind of bummed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. My mom asked her to come over while she and my dad went and got my birthday gift...to 'watch' me. I'm old enough, I mean my god. I don't know why they needed her here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they just wanted more family over for your birthday, and I mean, it's also the end of the school year tomorrow too so it's kind of like a double celebration. We\u2019re gonna be SENIORS bro aren\u2019t you stoked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you\u2019re right.\" Johnny sighed out, defeated. Maybe his friend was right. \u201cSeniors.\u201d Johnny replied giving his best friend a fist bump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my annoying younger cousins are also here....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if on cue, Ricky and Johnny heard two really loud thunderous footsteps running down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom!\" they spoke, running by Aunt Lesley in the other room. \"JOHN! JOHN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky glanced over and saw two young boys darting towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" the blonde one shouted as he stopped and stared at Johnny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wesley....You know I hate it when you call me John, it's Johnny.\" Johnny almost rolled his eyes to the two boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, whatever.\" The dismissive boy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky already hated these two boys. He could tell that when Johnny said they were annoying, that was an understatement. Both were dressed in designer clothes that neither Ricky nor Johnny's parents could afford. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" The darker haired one asked Ricky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a gi---\" Ricky started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh. I know it's a birthday gift. It's all wrapped up.\" the dark haired one replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin don't be rude to my friend, what do you two want?\" Johnny replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not being rude. And I TOLD you not to call me Justin.\" The dark haired boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny sighed. \"Ok. Fine. Juice.\" Johnny paused, feeling silly for calling another person after a drink. \"Don't be rude to my friend, and what do you two want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welllll, JOHN.\" Wesley said with a smile; showing off his bracer clad yellow teeth and completely ignoring Johnny's preference of name. <br>\r\n\"We WERE coming down here to get your laptop password, but now we kinda want to know what that gift is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky winced at the sight of Wesley's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what is it already?\" Juice repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky ignored both of the boys and what they were saying, already annoyed with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what a toothbrush is?\" Ricky asked Wesley. \"Maybe I should've brought one so you could at least see what it looks like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember talking to YOU, shithead.\" Wesley said. \"I just want to know what your worthless gift is so I can get on with my life.\" He finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worthless gift? I'm sorry you think it's so worthless before seeing it. Give me your address and I'll mail you some toothbrushes. Trust me it would be the most useful gift you've ever gotten. I can smell your breath from here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny sighed out loud. He really wished his cousins weren't here right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you think you are?\" Juice asked Ricky as if sizing him up and getting ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky looked over at the younger boy kind of cockeyed. 'Are these two even serious?' He wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look all I'm saying is maybe I should've brought some sun screen because your brother's teeth are as yellow as the sun.\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not about to have any teeth in a second, dickhead.\u201d Juice said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe ONLY person who\u2019s gonna lose any teeth here is brace face when he goes to the dentist hahahahaha!\u201d Ricky laughed not taking Justin seriously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD WILL YOU GUYS PLEASE STOP IT!\" Johnny yelled as Justin got closer to beat his friend Ricky\u2019s ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny wasn\u2019t one for confrontations like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything ok in there?\" Aunt Lesley called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, everything fine.\" Johnny replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mom.\" The boys said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your mom weren't here...\" Ricky started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh I'm shaking.\" Juice said sarcastically, fake trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck sakes. Look, it's none of your guy's business what the gift is and---\" Johnny began, trying to deflate an escalating situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... can you take it off my hands right now? It's really heavy.\" Ricky asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Johnny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because it's heavy doesn't mean it's any good.\" Wesley said in a snobbish tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky wanted to punch the kid. 'Who WEARS a shirt that says 'supreme' anyway?' He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Also might prevent me from smacking some brats with it...\" Ricky muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of the gift fell into Johnny's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?\" Johnny replied, getting a grip on the gift and taking it out of his friend's hands. \"this thing is INSANELY heavy.\" Johnny said, having to use both hands to scoop it up onto the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made a rather loud noise as he sat it down on the counter-top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.\" Wesley said, enthralled by the gift now and ignoring Ricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude unwrap it!\" Juice added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't have to unwrap it now.\" Ricky said in annoyance. \"Can't these kids go DO something.\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Juice and Wesley glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's ok. I would like to.\" Johnny said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny started with the bow and pulled it off. Then he pinched his fingers around the red patterned wrapping paper that read 'Happy Birthday!\" with balloons everywhere all over. Johnny tore the paper down and to the right, diagonally, and as all three boys looked at the small opening in awe Ricky started to smile. <br>\r\nJohnny quickly tore the rest of the wrapping off and the gift lay naked before everyone to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Juice said with disappointment in his voice. \"It's just a rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..\" Wesley basically laughed \"a poor persons gift. Kinda stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky felt personally attacked. The boys' words stung him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! It's really cool.\" Johnny said, defending his friend's gift. \"What are these markings!?\" Johnny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my parents went on one of those archaeological digs, you know? Where you can find cool fossils and stuff? It was like the first vacation they've taken in years. They found it there while they were digging.\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.\" Johnny said, amazed. \"Shouldn't this belong in a museum or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a nerd.\" Wesley said, belittling Johnny. \"And so are your rents.\" He continued, referring to Ricky's parents. <br>\r\n\"It's a ROCK. It belongs outSIDE??..... you know, in the grass?...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you shut up already?\" Ricky asked. He was at his wits end with these two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah can you go find something to do?\" Johnny repeated.</span></div></div>",

Helllllllooooooooo.\" He added snapping his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Spiderman465 for fuck sakes, Justin.\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moooooooooooooooooooom!!!\" Wesley called out. \"John cursed at us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BE nice to my boys!!!!!!\" She hollered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny just rolled his eyes as Wesley stuck his tongue out with a \"nehhhhhhhh.\" causing Ricky to gag once more at the sight of his filthy mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two GAYYS have fun down here with the dirt rock.\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not gay!\" Johnny shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever!\" the two boys said in unison, as they started to run off with Juice in the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny and Ricky watched Wesley flip the two boys the bird. Johnny replied by flipping him off as well, and that's when Wesley stopped moving mid run, to look back at the two boys. Wesley saw Johnny's finger, and so he took his own middle finger which was still flipping them off, and stuck his tongue out, patting his ass with the extended finger over and over in a mocking gay gesture while laughing. It was like he was fingering his ass with his middle finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile his brother Juice, completely oblivious to all this, stopped his running streak by jumping up and hitting the patch of wall above the doorway. Wesley turned back to face forward and ran quickly to catch up with his brother. The two took off, and the boys could hear them get halfway up the stairs when Johnny and Ricky heard Aunt Lesley yell out to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT are you boys doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna play minecraft on John's laptop!\" Wesley replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T BREAK ANYTHING!\" His aunt reminded them. \"He doesn't have as much as you boys do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah OK.\" One of them yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" was all Ricky could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. She doesn't help anything....I'm sorry about that.\" Johnny muttered, while touching the rock. <br>\r\n\"She just sits there and watches desperate house wives while those two destroy my room. I wish she would go to the store or something. Then I'd be in charge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I understand...\" Ricky said. \"They're brats. Oh, and annoying doesn't even begin to describe them or the throbbing headache I have right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny laughed. He was so happy his friend understood exactly what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was up with that...umm...gesture, though?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...you remember in middle school when the asshole kids discovered the word gay?....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more.\" Ricky replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they've been calling me gay for years. It's like their joke or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean they can't prove it!?\" Ricky said, laughing at his own sarcasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They WISH.\" Johnny replied as he was lifting up the stone to carry it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight tinkle glinted the rock on the stone as he spoke, but the gleam went unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, kids!\" All the boys in the house randomly heard Lesley call out. \"I have to go back to the house for a second. I forgot something REALLY important!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, mom!\" The brats upstairs replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLesley walked out into the kitchen where Ricky and Johnny were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot your birthday gift, Johnny I am SO soo sorry. I told the boys to remind me before we left, but they never did. You know how hard it is for Wesley and his ADHD.....and Justin with his...well, you know their conditions. I'm just going to go back to the house real quick, ok? You'll be fine by yourself. Honestly, you turn 17 today. I trust you.\" She said. \"I'll be RIGHT back and you know I'm just a phone call away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Thanks, Auntie.\" Johnny said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLesley walked out of the front door and not soon after the boys all heard a car start and pull out of the gravel driveway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Johnny said, grunting. \"I'm going to carry this upstairs, can you go ahead and tell the brats to leave my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly!\" Ricky said, jogging over the stairway and going up the stairs hastily with a smile on his face while Johnny inched his way toward the staircase, weighed down by the stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore walking in to his friends room, Ricky heard a muttering about something gay. 'Lame middle schoolers.' he thought to himself. He couldn't wait to tell the two brats to get out of the room, so he grabbed the knob and opened the door quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.\" He heard Juice say while Wesley laughed. <br>\r\n\"WE WERE RIGHT!\" Juice said. The two boys were staring at the computer screen and didn't even turn their heads to acknowledge Ricky in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two have to leave.\" Ricky said with authority. \"Get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Wesley said, with a huge smile on his face. \"Are you two butt buddies coming up to have sex or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude we're not gay, will you shut the fuck up already?\" Ricky said, his eye twitching in frustration as he listened to Wesley sip loudly on his energy drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\u201d Juice asked, turning the computer screen that was sitting in his lap toward Ricky. \u201cThen how do you explain these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky squinted at the computer screen and what he saw left him in complete shock. His mouth opened up a little, and couldn't describe how he felt in that moment, as a wide range of emotions flooded through him. He was leaning in closer and closer to look at the images on the screen, completely unable to process the information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, it's ok that you're a fag or whatever but don't like open your mouth, and come closer to my dick like that. It's creepy.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley started laughing. \"Oh my god he totally wants to suck your dick, Juice.\" The laughter from Wesley increased when he heard how much funnier it sounded at the end when he said 'dick Juice'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT FUCKING GAY!\" Ricky shouted defensively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why did you let your boyfriend take all these pictures of you!?\" Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look.\" Juice said, \"Here's one of someone\u2019s penis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" Ricky said, looking at the photo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like Johnny opened up Ricky's pants and took a snapshot of his package.  But he had no memory of that happening. Was his friend taking pictures of his privates while he was sleeping!?<br>\r\nRicky glanced at some of the other photos on the screen, too, completely in shock.<br>\r\nIn a lot of them Ricky looked like he was asleep. In some of them Ricky was in the gym shower.....naked and wet. In others someone that looked like Ricky was just bending over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude look at this one!\" Wesley said with tears in his eyes from laughter. \"It looks like!! --HHhaha It looks....\" Wesley lost his breath and couldn't breathe enough to finish his thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energy drink in his hand spilled out onto the floor as his body reacted to what he was seeing. Juice was also laughing uncontrollably at this point. <br>\r\nRicky looked and he saw it. It was a picture of him, passed out. He remembered the day exactly. He was sleeping over at his friends house a year or so ago...It was a picture of Ricky, laying in the bed, and he looked like he was asleep, and someone's dick was on his face. <br>\r\nHe immediately wanted to throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys could hear footsteps approaching and the door opened. <br>\r\nJohnny stepped in and tried to quickly drop the slab of rock on top of his desk nearby, completely unaware of the atmosphere in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ.\" He said, stepping in a puddle of energy drink on the floor near the bed as he walked in the room. \u201cDid you spill that energy drink Wesley?!\u201d<br>\r\nHe asked a little pissed, feeling his socks soaked in some foreign liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped toward his desk and dropped the stone on it. It made a loud slamming noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuuuck.\u201d He said. \u201cThat thing is way too heavy. Next time you get me a gift make it a little easier to carry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up your butt?\" Wesley asked, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny turned around and....</span></div></div>",

Soon all 4 of the boys were listening in on the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL BE RIGHT THERE! JUST DON'T TURN ON THE NEWS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny immediately grabbed the tv remote from his desk and turned the news on, and turned the volume up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOD DAMN IT JOHNNY I YOU NOT TO TURN THE NEWS ON!\" His Aunt Leslie screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped his phone in total shock of what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his parents car....completely destroyed and rolled over at the end of a giant hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tragedy struck today when a semi-driver fell asleep behind the wheel and collided head first into a white 1990's Honda Accord, knocking the car through the railing and down into a ditch below Crestfall Hill. The semi driver came out of the accident unharmed, but the driver and passenger of the Honda died shortly after impact. The bodies have been identified as Mr. And Ms. Charlie Dewitt who were returning home with their teenage sons' birthday gift. The city is mourning their loss of life and the Mayor is currently taking up donations for the family's loss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen cut over to the Mayor \"This is a tragedy....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears swollen out of Johnny's eyes and fell down his face. He couldn't stop crying and in doing so forgot about his wet socks, and the mess Wesley made. He even forgot about his friend in the room. His voice was quaking and snot was slowly working its way out of his nose while his body quivered in loss. He turned back around to face everyone in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...my parents are dead.\" he was able to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude that's like, the least of your problems.\" Wesley said. \"Like...we know you're gay, now.

MY PARENT'S JUST DIED SHOW SOME FUCKING RESPECT YOU PIECE OF SHIT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny pushed Wesley, who just fell back onto the bed he was sitting on. He immediately got back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you take those pictures of me, Johnny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you wanted him to?\" Juice laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What pictures? My parents are dead....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took naked pictures of me....\" Ricky said, far more concerned with this issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Johnny replied, his voice weak but alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky pointed at the laptop, and Johnny's tear stained eyes looked at the content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-? I don't know how...\" Johnny said. \"Oh my God! I DON'T KNOW how those got in there! I WOULD NEVER! RICKY I WOULD NEVER!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ricky I would neverrrrr!\" Wesley replied in a gay voice. \"I promissssssssssssss I love you. You're my butt buuuuddyyy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut. Up.\" Ricky replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Hey we want you two to know that we're supportive of you, just not of the butt sex you guys have.\" Wesley said, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These pictures are...these need to be deleted! I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY GOT HERE!\" Johnny repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deleted? No way. We saved them, actually.\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saved them?\" Ricky repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...we're not like bigots or whatever... but we thought it would be helpful if we sent them out to the school and outed you guys.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Ricky replied. \"I'M NOT GAY!

I have no family left....and you're blackmailing me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are your family.\" Wesley replied. \"And don't take it so seriously. We just want some things...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you two talking about?\" Ricky asked. \"Delete the photos!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached over, grabbed the laptop and thew it at the wall. The laptop screen broke but it didn't cause any real permanent damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and destroy the laptop...we saved the pictures to iCloud. I can even access them in my phone.\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW THE FUCK DID YOU GET THOSE PHOTOS IN ICLOUD!?\" Ricky replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was like the first thing we did, duh.\" Wesley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were you two I'd be more worried about what we want...\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you fucking want!?\" Ricky asked, freaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that stone for starters.\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking take the stone! YOU CAN HAVE THE STONE!\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just take the stone.\" Johnny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not all we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What more can you fucking want?!\" Johnny screamed. \"I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT!\" tears started streaming down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit being such a queen.\" Juice replied. \"It's not a big deal..and you still have us, even if you are a queer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT FUCKING QUEER!\" Johnny shouted. \"YOU CAN'T SEND THOSE PHOTOS OUT! THEY'RE A LIE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...if you really don't want us to send them out... I'm sure we can come to some kind of arrangement...\" Juice said, looking at his brother Wesley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of arrangement!?\" Ricky asked.</span></div></div>",

He dropped his phone in total shock of what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his parents car....completely destroyed and rolled over at the end of a giant hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tragedy struck today when a semi-driver fell asleep behind the wheel and collided head first into a white 1990's Honda Accord, knocking the car through the railing and down into a ditch below Crestfall Hill. The semi driver came out of the accident unharmed, but the driver and passenger of the Honda died shortly after impact. The bodies have been identified as Mr. And Ms. Charlie Dewitt who were returning home with their teenage son's birthday gift. The city is mourning their loss of life and the Mayor is currently taking up donations for the family's loss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen cut over to the Mayor \"This is a tragedy....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears swollen out of Johnny's eyes and fell down his face. He couldn't stop crying and forgot about his friend in the room. His voice was quaking and snot was slowly working its way out of his nose while his body quivered in loss. He turned around to face his best friend to seek some comfort from him.. but his eyes found a face he wasn't used to seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA face of betrayal and disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a fucking freak!\" Ricky shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? My parents are dead Ricky what the FUCK are you talking about?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky pointed at the laptop the two brats left laying on the bed.<br>\r\nJohnny glanced at the content and his breathing stopped as his lungs clutched in his rib cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those?!\" Johnny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell ME.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly Johnny's head felt like it was splitting open. The whole room was spinning and he had to grab hold of the desk, until his grip was lost and he fell down to the floor. He could feel the wood of his desk against the back of his neck. He heard a loud thumping noise near off, but before he could look over he lost his vision and his hearing. He knew he lost his hearing because he was yelling for help, but couldn't hear it. He could only feel the hardwood floor beneath him, so he kept shouting. He kept shouting and shouting, even as the feel of the desk pressed against his neck also faded away, and he was left with nothing but the floor beneath him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered if this is what death felt like. Would the floor disappear from his senses soon too, and he be left with nothing? He was hoping his friend would call an ambulance and after shouting a few times but being unable to hear his own voice he gave up. He was feeling sharp, unbelievable pain coursing throughout his body to the point where his body was having a spasm fit beyond his control...but yet he was cognizant enough to understand he was probably having a seizure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his vision returned his ears rang for a few seconds and he was staring up at what looked like his dresser. The size of it was really distorted though, or so Johnny thought. When he pulled himself to set up, he thought his eyes were fooling him. Underneath his bed, he could see an old discarded shoe of his from a few years back, laying there scuffed up and forgotten. He was only HALF of the shoes HEIGHT sitting up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't have been more than 4 inches tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. the. fuck?\" He heard a familiar voice shout from near the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE FUCK!?!\" He heard again, this time more intense. Johnny turned his head toward where the noise was coming from and found himself looking at his best friend Ricky, who was the same size as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happ--\" Johnny's concern was interrupted by a loud noise downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys suddenly heard loud-thunder booming just outside the half-open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnnnyy?\" A young, masculine voice called from the hallway leading to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT!\" Johnny shouted. \"HIDE!\" both Johnny and Ricky made a dash for underneath the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd dipshit Dewitt go?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, probably ran off with his boyfriend after hearing the news.\" Juice replied, kicking Johnny's laptop across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's so stupid we have to be here. Can't we just call mom and tell her he's not here?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I think we have to help him or whatever.\" Juice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait....does this mean he's coming to live with us?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck.\" Juice said, flopping his ass on the bed and making it quake above the two tiny grown men, cowering underneath it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stretched his body out on the bed and in doing so, his feet were dangling off the edge just enough so Johnny and Ricky could see the dirt in the treads of his shoe as he rocked his feet back and forth, playfully pounding them against the bed itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want that faggot living with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ME EITHER!!!!\" Wesley shouted, slamming his foot down hard on Johnny's laptop, which made a snapping sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those bastards!\" Johnny whispered out-loud, praying he was quiet enough that they didn't hear him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt Ricky grab his shoulder from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to us.\" He whispered to Johnny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Johnny replied as the two giants above them continued to have a conversation amongst themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to put a lock on my underwear drawer.\" Wesley said, talking to Juice above them. \"I don't want to walk in one day and see my fag cousin sniffing them or some weird shit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he'll probably be taking pictures of us in the shower or something like he did to Ricky.\" Juice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't actually believe that Ricky isn't a faggot too, do you?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnseen by the two boys below the bed, Juice shrugged. <br>\r\nJohnny and Ricky tried to keep having a conversation, but the two boy's high-pitched and extremely loud voices always interrupted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It had to be that stone, Johnny!\" Ricky whispered in an intense voice. \"That's the only thing that makes any sense!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny thought about it for a second. \"You're right.\" He realized. \"I was touching it when we shrank....so that means all we have to do is wait for them to leave, and try to get up to the stone.\"</span></div></div>",

They saw the mattress conform with the majority of the weight in one area, where Juice's ass was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaahahah!\" Wesley's high pitched laugh was so annoying and loud the two boys had to cover their ears. \"You're still sitting in their cum you know?\" He asked Juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude I don't care, I'm wearing pants. It's better than it being in my hair or something. At least mom will wash these for me later. Actually, I'll just burn them later and tell her to get me a new pair instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley kept laughing. \"Are you gonna cut all your hair off too?\" He asked his brother. \"AIDS HAIR, AIDS HAIR!\" Wesley chanted, cracking up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice looked at him deadpan and the laughing stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok geez, I'm sorry alright? You're still my bro, aids hair or not.\" Wesley said, smirking again. \"OOOOOOOOOK FIIINE. Don't LOOK at me like that, Juice, please. PLEASE don't kill me, alright? Damn, man.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley turned around and sat on the bed next to his brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now we can both throw our pants away later. Mine are like a few months old anyway. It's about time mom replaced them.\" Wesley said. \"but....we guuci, right?\" Wesley asked his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we guuci.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You CANNOT tell them!\" Johnny whispered with a loud sounding authoritative voice. \"THEY'RE EVIL!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU TOOK PICTURES OF ME NAKED AGAINST MY WILL AND THEY'RE EVIL!?\" Ricky whispered back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU ALMOST GOT INTO A FIST FIGHT WITH THEM, RICKY!

YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

He ran for his life toward the 4 dirty, but giant sets of shoes in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally got out into the open and waved, screaming \"Help me!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was already in a lot of pain, and hitting the ground didn't help. He lifted his neck up, rubbing the back of it when he heard a thunderous surprised voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Wesley said, looking down at a miniature Ricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of intrigue was visible on the young boy's features. Then a quick smirk flickered across Wesley's face exposing his braces briefly before they disappeared behind his closed lips. Ricky didn't seem to notice that Wesley was holding back a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ricky?\" Juice's voice asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny watched in horror as a giant hand reached down and snatched his friend up, lifting him beyond view. \"Duuuuude, is this even real?\" He heard Wesley's voice say, as the boy began poking Ricky all over. <br>\r\nJohnny was unable to hear his friend from this distance, but the booming voice of his two cousins were more than audible. \"You have to help me!\" Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help you?\" Johnny heard Juice ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Wesley followed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT WAS THE STONE! Johnny was touching the stone!! AND IT CHANGED US SOMEHOW! YOU HAVE TO HELP US!\" Ricky cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John was touching the stone?\" Wesley asked, and John felt the blood drain out of his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'WHY WOULD YOU TELL THEM THAT!?!' His physique screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm..\" with the tiny in one hand, Wesley pulled out his cellphone in the other, wondering if google could help him figure all this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe completely ignored the screams of the annoying man in his right hand as he googled the phrase \"magical stones\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU HAVE TO HELP ME!?

Help me!\" Ricky said, frantic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't tell him, don't tell him!' Johnny thought to himself. 'Please don't tell him!' Johnny began biting his nails, unaware that his best friend had already sold him out; his voice too small to hear from this distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny watched Juice get up, and his shoes were facing to the left of Johnny's vision. He saw the giant blue sneakers creak the floorboards beneath them with every step. Johnny, a grown young man, trembled as Justin's sneakers leaned onto their toes, causing them to crinkle, and the colossal boy's butt lowered closer to the ground..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh Joohhhhnnnnn?\" Juice called out, bending down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching that way, Justin's huge face would be next to make an appearance before Johnny. His breath caught in his throat as the giant's big, boyish, mischievous face loomed over him. His eyes locked onto Johnny for a few seconds before his lips curled in a devious grin that gave Johnny the chills. (1)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny laid there, frozen in absolute terror as the giant boy reached out, extending his arm toward him. Justin's giant hand overshadowed Johnny's whole body, and came crashing down, coiling itself around his legs. Justin pulled Johnny out from under the bed, with only a light grip on Johnny's legs. The poor young man's head rubbed harshly against the hardwood floor underneath, even thudding against it with every crack that he was pulled over. Within an instant he was looking straight up at the God-Like form of his bratty younger cousin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter John?\" Juice asked with that same villainous grin, as he tilted his head to the left. \"Didn't you want to come out and play?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a name=\"freturn1\"></a><a href=\"#footnote1\" class=\"footnote\" title='Footnote 1: Original writing credit goes to puppet_master  in chapter 11 of \"  Big Men On Campus  \" - Exposed to the Terrible Teens.

Juice also used his thumb and third finger and put them under Johnny's arms, trapping them and making him unable to move, not like he was anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice lifted up his annoying older cousin like that, slamming his body onto the soft mattress in a display of superiority. \"Why were you hiding from us John?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're your family, and we're here for you.\" Justin said in a menacing, cold voice that faked concern. \"You know that, right?\" He asked again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny just stare up at his youthful, but frightening face as it came closer and closer to him. Johnny couldn't do anything but stare in complete awe of the size of his cousin, and old memories came to the forefront as he looked up at Justin who was still wearing that same menacing grin overhead. Memories of Juice and Wesley breaking his things, treating him like shit...even memories of Justin abusing animals. And here Johnny was, staring up at his younger cousin who was fond of torturing things, completely helpless and literally in the palm of his hand like a small action figure. Justin took his other hand, and placed it standing up but flush against the bed right above Johnny's head and Justin's lips; like how a young child would whisper into a friend's ear. His bad breath wafted down to Johnny as his lips opened up in another chilling smile. They pursed outwards JUST above Johnny's face and Juice whispered ever so softly so only Johnny could hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you're fucked, right?\" Juice asked. \"You're mine now.\" He said, coldly. His hot, gross breath and his next words caused Johnny to start sweating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your boyfriend and you? You belong to us. You're our property. Don't even think of trying to escape.\" He advised, leaning back so he was standing straight up again, his disgusting breath now far away from Johnny's nose but his words still echoing in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU GOING TO HELP ME?!\" Ricky shouted for the billionth time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Wesley said, looking at his phone, and completely ignoring Ricky. \"It's the Philosopher's stone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what now?\" Juice asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Philosopher's stone. It has to be! There's no pictures of it, but throughout history there have been civilizations who described a magical stone that would grant them their wishes, whatever they wanted! Looks like most people wanted it to turn things into gold, or whatever. That's what it is!\" His overpowering young voice screeched as it cracked in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley's voice was like nails on a chalkboard to the two shrunken men, but the message he stated was loud and clear. The whole room was stunned. Johnny especially knew it was true, because he was the only one so far who actually made a wish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WISH I WAS BIG AGAIN!\" He screamed with all his might. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice looked down at him with a death glare. If looks could kill, Johnny would be dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says here you have to be touching the stone in order for the wish to be granted. But nice try.\" Wesley said, snorting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...it's a magical stone...\" Juice said, sounding interested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's cool but you're helping us, right?\" Ricky asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do?\" Wesley asked his brother, ignoring Ricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..\" Juice pondered.</span></div></div>",

It was epic! Taz ripped Mr. Squeakie in half.\" He said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny stare up at the boy who was fondly reminiscing about killing his favorite pet mouse by feeding it to his dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft yeah.\" Wesley said, snorting loudly again. \"He turned him into a squeakie toy hahahah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's limbs felt cold. He started thinking back to when Mr. Squeakie disappeared, right after his cousins visit. He never even put two and two together but now that they said it, it all made sense. After his cousins left the house, Mr. Squeakie wasn't found again, but Johnny didn't notice he was gone until hours after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky gulped. \"A-are you going to save us?\" He asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley ignored him again. \"Ohhh do you remember dipshit Dewitts birthday last year when we fed him that cake?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHA Oh my god how could I forget!? The look on his face was priceless!\" Juice said, actual excitement entering his voice now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you guys talking about?\" Ricky asked, becoming really afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the only time so far Wesley acknowledged his existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" He said, looking down at Ricky. \"We put one of my turds in a blender, and made Johnny a cake with my poop and frosting mixed together hahahaha!\" Wesley laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny felt a sharp pain shoot through his head and through the nerves in his eyes. He could still remember the taste of that cake from last year. His head was splitting open at the realization that he ate his younger cousin's poop, and that explained the foul taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He ATE the WHOLE thing!\" Juice added with a huge grin on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW!! It even LOOKED like shit! THAT'S THE MOST FUCKED UP PART!!!!!! HIS FACE THOUGH!! OH MY GOD!\" Wesley said, almost unable to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used his free hand to wipe away a tear from laughing so hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why we call him John..\" Wesley explained to Ricky, looking down at him with a smile. \"Because he eats shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHA You're right Wes we didn't even try to disguise it or anything. It was a cake in the shape a giant turd that read 'shit you're old'. Your idea to add the little pieces of corn was my FAVORITE part!\" Juice told him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck no, YOU had the best idea to add my shit!\" Wesley laughed. \"Or wait...was that Tyler's idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, Wes...\" Justin said, a realization striking him causing him to ignore his brothers question. \"I just thought....What if your poop made him gay or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley's laughter stopped and he became real serious all a sudden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait-what? You mean like...he ate my shit and then started sucking cock or something?\" Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude gay guys love eating ass. What if your poop turned him?\" Juice continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...it all makes sense now......\" Wesley said, sounding like he just learned everything about the entire universe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT GAY!\" Johnny shouted, almost crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just found out his parents died and he was a shrunken toy practically in the palm of his cousins hands, both of whom were menaces to him his entire life. He felt like he was on trial for something with no one hearing his side of the story, only people accusing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, bug.\" Juice said nonchalantly, brushing off the emotion in Johnny's voice while at the same time bringing the tip of his index finger against Johnny's face, and cramming a large portion of it in his mouth to silence him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did poop turn you gay, Rick?\" Wesley asked, looking down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gay! He took those pictures without me knowing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm..... I don't know if I believe you....\" Wesley said. \"You can't BOTH be 'not gay', I mean look at those pictures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU HAVE TO!!!!! PLEASE I'M NOT GAY!! PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!!!! I WANT TO BE NORMAL AGAIN!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, man. I feel kinda bad that you're not gay and all....I mean, I'd hate for my cousin to be lonely...\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should turn him, too.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as though the whole world stopped for Ricky when he heard that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-ww-what?\" Rick asked. </span></div></div>",

NO!!!!! I'M GAY I'M SO GAY!!!!!

He watched as Wesley reached to the back of his low-cut designer skinny jeans and wiggled a finger between his ass and the waistband of his boxer shorts which was just barely poking out of his tight jeans enough to show off the designer label on them. He pulled back opening a small space and revealing part of his ass crack to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\" Ricky screamed bloody murder, over and over, thrashing against Wesley's hand as it brought him to the back toward the opening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesssss.\" Wesley replied with a voice of a rapist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE!!!!!!!! DON'T DO THIS!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley stopped moving, as though thinking about it for a second, as he dangled Ricky upside down toward the opening by only his foot. Ricky was staring at, and smelling, Wesley's gigantic asscrack and dirty underwear, the air around him all sultry and earthen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm....\" Wesley pondered out-loud. \"I'm just trying to make sure my cousin has a boyfriend, that's all..\" Wesley said. \"Pluuusss........\" Wesley's voice started drawing out the word \"if I do this...then YOUR teeth will be yellower than mine, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice snickered. \"Brown, even.\" He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOK I'M SORRY ABOUT THE TEETH COMMENTS, I'M GAAAYY! I'M TOTALLY GAY, OK!?!!!!!! WE TOOK THE PICTURES TOGETHER PLEASE!!! YOU DON'T NEED TO TURN ME!!\" Ricky plead for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNEW IT!\" Wesley and Justin said in unison, Justin with a less excited voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're gay then you won't mind licking my ass, right?\" Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE DON'T!!!!\" Ricky shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kinda itchy back there and all... I could use a nice massage. You could scratch it for me.\" Wesley said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\" Ricky shouted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude you won't scratch his ass?\" Juice asked. \"You scratch his ass and he scratches yours..err? Umm.. Well maybe not.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on Ricky you're gay. Gays love men's asses. You won't scratch my ass for me?\" Wesley asked, in a saddened voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOO GOD PLEASE NO!!!!\" Ricky shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha did he just call you God?\" Justin pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley started laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well duh, of course I'm his God. Look at me.\" Wesley said, snorting again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm like 800 times his size. Hey, Ricky... God wants you to lick and scratch his ass, got it?\" Wesley said, letting go of Ricky who plummeted into the small opening of Wesley's tight blue boxer brief's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I won't scratch yours though.\" Wesley laughed and snapped the waistband shut, turning his head and looking back at his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\" Wesley shouted to everyone, pulling his pants down just low enough to show off the shape of a trapped and squirming Ricky who was pressed up against his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's buttlick Rick!\" Wesley said, laughing and shaking his ass back and forth. <br>\r\n\"You're not coming out until all your teeth are brown hahahah!\" Wesley laughed like all of this was some big joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny watched as the shape of his best friend kicking and squirming inched its way down further and further into the pit of Wesley's tight underwear with every shake of his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin leaned back down toward him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey...\" Juice said, getting Johnny's attention. \"You're gonna call me God, too, got it?\" He said in an authoritative voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny felt his consciousness failing him...and he passed out from shock and horror.</span></div></div>",

Everything around him was dark and he felt a cloth around him. He started fumbling around and felt several lint balls scattered all over the place. Alarmed, he clawed and clawed his way, trying to climb up to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE STOP!!!!!!!!!!!\" He recognized his friend Ricky's voice begging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, you bit my bro's ass. This is payback.\" Justin said in a cynical voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE I DIDN'T MEAN IT PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!! STOP!!!!!!\" Ricky cried out, completely at Justin's mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I'm not convinced you mean it...Ohhh, look who's awake.\" Johnny heard his younger cousin say out-loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a glimpse of light enter his prison then a giant hand wrap around his body. He was inside of a pocket! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to watch this bug. This is what happens when you defy your Gods.\" Justin said, pulling Johnny out into the light and tossing him on a bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny looked up in horror to see Ricky's leg being pinched between two of Justin's fingers. Justin's hand reached down toward Johnny, and it fumbled around, finding a lighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO PLEASE DON'T!!!\" Ricky begged through tears of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT WAS A MISTAKE I SWEAR!!!!! I THOUGHT YOU FORGOT I WAS BACK THERE I COULDN'T BREATHE!!!!\" Ricky yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're right about one thing, it was a mistake. You won't make it again.\" Justin said coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burn him, Juice! BURN HIM!\" Wesley shouted almost gleefully. While Justin was calm and calculating, Wesley was loud and hyper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET HIM GO!!!!\" Johnny screamed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWesley looked down at Johnny and grabbed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet.\" Wesley ordered with a squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make him watch.\" Johnny heard Justin's voice command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, bug. Look.\" Wesley ordered, looking down at Johnny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU GUYS HAVE TO LET HIM GO!!!\" Johnny screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky looked at his best friend with tears in his eyes. His clothes had been burned off already, and it looked like he was suffering from at least 2nd degree burns all over his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't HAVE to do anything.\" Justin reminded Johnny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This INSECT bit my brother. It needs to remember its place.\" Justin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I REMEMBER, I REMEMBER!! I PROMISE!!!\" Ricky started sobbing as the lighter was brought right below his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say you're our property.\" Justin ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds went by, and Justin brought the lighter closer to Rick's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it.\" He repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M YOUR PROPERTY, OK!!!!!\" Ricky shouted. \"Please don't hurt me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And does property hurt its owners?\" Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!!!!!! I WON'T EVER AGAIN!!! I SWEAR!!!!!!!!!\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's lying Juice!\" Wesley chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOO!\" Ricky's voice cracked. \"I'm not!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU NEED TO KILL HIM, JUICE!\" Wesley yelled. \"KILL HIM!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No please don't!\" Ricky cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T KILL HIM!\" Johnny yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to save your butt buddy, faggot?

I DID!!\" Ricky said as Juice inched the lighter even closer to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley snorted loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if we let you go you'll lick each one clean?\" Wesley asked.</span></div></div>",

Ricky immediately started rolling around on the bed, trying to remove the burning sensation. All he could think about was stop drop and roll. His eyes were closed shut and he moved like a man would when his very life depended on it. Justin and Wesley didn't care as they looked down at him from up above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time you'll kiss my ass instead of bite it.....\" He got closer while Ricky continued to roll. \"...Understand?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even a second passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Durrrrrrrrr. Earth to faggot?\" Wesley said, tapping part of the mattress near Ricky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used his free hand that wasn't holding Johnny and stopped Ricky from rolling, holding him in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky was shaking his head back and forth, his eyes still closed. He was in so much pain he simply COULDN'T stop moving. That's when he heard a monstrous noise from above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAHEMMMMM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWKKKKKKKKK <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky heard what was coming for him as he was shaking violently and by some form of miracle he managed to open his eyes. He looked up in abject horror, seeing that mouth that he hated so much and the yellow teeth forming a grin; aware of his gaze upon them. Wesley's giant glistening eyes looked down at him and the teen couldn't help but smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018This can\u2019t be happening this simply can\u2019t be happening!\u2019 Ricky thought, knowing what was coming and hearing Wesley clearing his throat even more with worse and worse sounding noises, like he was reaching for every bit of scum in him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAAAAACCCCKKKKKKKKKK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAHHHHHEMMMMMMMMMMM <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAAAHH HHHEMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHACCCCCCKCKKKKKKKK <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019m dreaming I have to be!\u2019 Ricky screamed in his mind. 'Wake up, wake up wake up!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky watched helplessly as the noises came to a stop. He saw Wesley swirl something thick around in his mouth and cringed at the thought of some liquid soaking up the very essence of his filthy mouth. He stare up horrified and watched the teens lips pucker together forming an O shape; preparing to launch a bullet of bacteria straight from the depths of hell. Ricky continued to shake violently, feeling as though he were still on fire but also wanting to escape more than anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018No, no no no. This isn\u2019t real.\u2019  Ricky thought to himself, watching as a viscous ball of yellow slowly pushed its way out, pressed against Wesley\u2019s lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake it stop I just want to go home!!!\u201d Ricky screamed, thinking out loud and closing his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky heard Juice laugh from above. Causing him to look up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe just wants to go home to mommy.\u201d Juice mocked. \u201cNot so cocky now are you, bug?\u201d He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018This is a nightmare I HAVE TO BE SLEEPING!!!!\u2019 Ricky thought, hearing a loud noise above him and watching what was happening to him almost from a 3rd persons perspective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPTTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley spat out. Ricky watched as a giant and abnormally thick yellow loogie fell down from Wesley\u2019s mouth, passed the safety of his lips in almost slow motion. Johnny watched and gagged at just the sight of the loogie while Ricky almost threw up from seeing it looming above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!!!\u201d Ricky cried out. \u201cYour mouth is so disgusting! This can\u2019t be happening to me!!! Make it stop!!!\u201d He yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loogie inched it\u2019s way closer to Ricky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO PLEASE NO!!! DON\u2019T DO THIS!!! PLEASE MAKE IT STOP WESLEY!!!!\u201d Ricky screamed between tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky watched Wesley flash that same boyish and toothy grin from before, brought on by Ricky\u2019s disgust. Because of Wesley\u2019s smile the loogie suddenly drooped down hard and smacked into Ricky's face like a water balloon that was the size of his head. He tried to scream but had to stop because upon impact the spit-wad began to run down, coating over him like his very own mucus skullcap. If he thought he could smell Wesley's breath before, he certainly could smell that and more now as the bile worked its way over him. It started to naturally ooze, taking the shape of Ricky's face; flowing down his cheeks and everywhere else until the loogie was now finally gunking up all his facial features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the mucus fell onto the bed, but most stayed on top of Ricky's ugly mug that instinctively crinkled itself in absolute horror and disgust. The mucus clogged every pore and orifice; including his nose. Ricky was now suffocating and drenched in nothing but pure scum and bacteria from the same mouth he had the audacity to mock earlier. Even though Ricky was blinded by mucus and thrashing for his life and air itself, he could still see it; that vile smirk Wesley wore just before he lost sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe loathed it so much; the sneer the brat had watching his snot ball cascade itself downward from Ricky's forehead. It was etched into Ricky's mind becoming his sole and only vision as he fought for his life. Matters only became worse when he started to hear some laughter from above him booming down triumphantly like a victory song mocking him; the loser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

After several seconds of struggling and no progress, Ricky's brain started losing oxygen and all his organs, heart especially, felt like it was going to beat out of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for fucks sake, man.\" Justin said. \"You're so worthless.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed part of the bed sheet and wiped the snot off of Ricky's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, my loogie almost killed him.\" Wesley said in a tone of voice that resounded with amazement rather than concern. <br>\r\n\"SOOOO. Cool!\" He hollered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could've killed him...\" Johnny muttered, completely at shock. \"YOU COULD'VE KILLED HIM!!!!\" He repeated in a higher pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....so?\" Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what's the big deal, dude?\" Wesley repeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He should be thanking me, really. My snot stopped him from burning up. Right buttlick Rick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky was silent, he almost seemed like he lost consciousness because his eyes were still closed and he wasn't moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RIGHT, ASS FACE!?\" Wesley repeated, jabbing him in the stomach with his finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky turned over and coughed up a lung-full of Wesley's liquid snot, and vomited. </span></div></div>",

You're gonna what? Tell?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley tossed Johnny down on the bed like a pair of dice, causing him to roll. He just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can't tell...\" Justin said \"There's no one TO tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley's high-pitched voice was next to chime in. \"Everyone thinks you're missing, dumbass. Think they're gonna look here, huh?\" He asked. <br>\r\n\"Think they're gonna look up my butt to find your little friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PPFT!\" Justin half-laughed. \"Actually, that would make sense.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley started cracking up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Where else would a faggot like him WANT to be, right?\" Wesley agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin got off of the bed and grabbed something. Johnny noticed it was small mirror, and the brat brought it closer to Ricky's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, bug. Look at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asswipe.\" Wesley said. \"He's talking to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky opened his eyes, but his vision wasn't perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PFFFFT OH MY GOD!\" Wesley cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE YOUR EYES ARE LIKE RED AS FUCK!\" both Johnny and Ricky wanted to cover their ears from his explosive voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU HIGH OR SOMETHING!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, obviously that's pink eye from the car ride here...\" Juice said with a half smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'..or the smoke from his burnt hair and flesh that went into his eyes...' Johnny thought. 'Wait...car ride here?...\" Johnny asked himself in silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so caught up in Ricky's torture he didn't even look at his surroundings. When he turned his head to look around he felt hope die in his very soul. He and Ricky were at his cousins house. That meant no one would come looking for them, and no one knows they're here. He couldn't remember the trip, he must've been in Justin's pocket the whole time, completely knocked out...while Ricky was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you mean when he was up my ass?\" Wesley laughed. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, probably. He was wiggling a lot back there.. you really enjoyed it, didn't you?\" Wesley asked, looking back down at Ricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's gaze turned to him, and immediately everyone noticed he had dropped down to his knees, looking into the hand held mirror in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my face...\" Ricky couldn't find the words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was permanent damage to his entire forehead, most of both of his ears, and his entire scalp which was now bald. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hair...\" he said, touching his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his hand back and winced in pain from the burns. Johnny ran over to him, grabbing his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that bad, Ricky.\" He tried to console him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S NOT THAAAAT BAAD.\" Wesley mocked with his high-pitched snobby voice. \"Gaaaaaaaaaay.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two can't treat him like this! He's a PERSON!\" Johnny yelled at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin just snorted a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Justin said with a fake voice, \"the toilet is going to call the better business bureau and report us for mistreating him and his friend, the toilet paper.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky started crying and Justin dropped the mirror on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My whole body is deformed.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude that's a good thing. I like my toilet paper with ruffles in it.\" Wesley said, laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice and him exchanged a high-five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

That was a bit mean of me to say. You know, my brother and I were thinking, and we felt bad about burning your hair off.\" Wesley started saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I almost wept looking at your ugly faggot face, especially when you started crying.\" He admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my bro here,\" Justin waved. \"Had this great idea. Make him a wig, he said.\" Wesley informed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a great idea, right?\" Wesley asked, and Juice revealed the item behind his back to be super glue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what did we make the wig out of you might ask...\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\" he brought his hand from behind his back, and revealed a jar full of hair. \"What better than my ass hairs, and some of our ball pubes!?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still going to be ugly.\" Justin said. \"But you were before anyway, so....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ttttts, yeah.\" Wesley half-laughed. \"But now you can WEAR my ass wherever you go. Cool, right?! Now hold still.\" Wesley ordered, sitting the clear jar down beside Ricky who looked inside to see the contents in total disgust and shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Ricky said faintly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to run but before he could even attempt it, Wesley's free hand coiled around him like snake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you learn your lesson?\" Justin asked. \"Or do I need to get the lighter out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I-I mean, Please no. I-I'll be fine.\" Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think anyone with ass pubes for hair can be called 'fine'.\" Wesley mocked, laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, your boyfriend there might like it. He used to stare at my ass all the time.\" Wesley commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I didn't!\" Johnny shouted up at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet.\" Justin said, bringing a hand out and flicking Johnny, who fell down from the tremendous force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the bruising on his body already. All from a minor flick that wasn't even intended to do any real damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin pulled out a doctor's glove from his pocket and put it on his right hand. Then he pulled out a Q-tip from the same pocket, placing it on the bed. He then picked up the glue, unscrewed the lid and tossed it on the bed. Meanwhile, Wesley bent over and picked up the jar full of pubic hair, while still holding Ricky in his right hand. Wesley smiled down at Ricky as he moved the jar in his left hand over toward his brother and held it in place, waiting. Ricky got another look at the hairs in the jar and saw Justin pull out a Q-tip covered in glue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't do this.\" Ricky asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry what was that?\" Wesley asked. \"It's hard to hear you from all the way up here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak up.\" Justin repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE! Don't do this.\" Ricky repeated in a louder voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny watched from below while a grin crossed both of his cousins faces and shivered with rage. He knew his friend Ricky was keen on his appearance and made a huge effort to work-out just enough so he looked good. His bratty cousins already deformed his face, and made him bald. Now they were going to glue their ass and ball hairs onto his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. We don't HAVE to...\" Justin said. \"But when we're done you're going to look in the mirror, and then you're going to thank us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Wesley's condescending voice pipped up. \"This is like charity-work for us. You're right, we didn't have to do it. But we're generous, so we're just trying to help you out with what we have. Plus you have such great looking teeth, right? So even a head full of my ass hair and some of our ball pubes shouldn't be too big of a deal...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I am so sorry about your teeth!\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky saw the grin fade off of Wesley's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you're sorry about my teeth?\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT!\" Ricky cried out. \"I MEANT I'M SORRY I MADE FUN OF THEM!!\" He corrected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, PLEASE can I stay bald, Wesley?\" Ricky asked them in the kindest voice he could muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only had so much patience and it was wearing thin. Only Johnny could hear it. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well, since you asked nicely............ no.\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin took the glue-covered Q-tip and quickly rolled it around Ricky's head, who started squirming in Wesley's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still, butt boy.\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, or don't I don't care. Hey, Juice. See those strands of hair right there?\" Wesley said, using his head and eyes to help his brother locate the ones he meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put those on first. I think I see a few of my dingleberries on them hahahaha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh good call...\" Justin said, grabbing those hairs out with his gloved hand and pushing them on top of Ricky, who had to close his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe already stopped trying to fight. It was futile. He couldn't escape Wesley's grip. He just felt Justin's fingers pressing harshly against the top of his head over and over and over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PERFECT. Now my shit will be the first thing he sees in his hair.\" Wesley commented, overwhelmed with joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral seconds went by of a finger pressing into Ricky's scalp. When he finally opened his eyes he saw that the jar was empty, and he could see strands of pubic hair in his vision. They had so much it cascaded around his head.<br>\r\nWesley sat him down on the bed and Justin grabbed the mirror again. He lifted it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL?\" Wesley asked with impatience. \"What do you think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky pushed some of the hair out of his vision and stared at the mirror. Tears started streaming from his eyes and Johnny walked over to console him. But once Johnny walked over, he immediately stepped back. Ricky reeked of shit and piss, and Johnny could SEE the dingleberries littered everywhere on Ricky's hair, just like Wesley said. He hoped his friend didn't see him back away, but the two brats definitely did. He knew by the wide smiles they were giving him. It was like they were looking at two little dolls they could with whatever they wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to thank us?\" Justin reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you.\" Ricky said through the tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For?\" Wesley inquired, making it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For giving me h-hair again...\" Ricky finished, mortified.</span></div></div>",

PLEASE NO!!!!!!\" Ricky shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're his property.\" Justin reminded. \"You don't get to decide.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right, you know.\" Wesley said, unbuttoning his pants. \"Besides I don't have a WHOLE lot left, most of them are on your head hahah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky started running but Justin reached out and grabbed both him and Johnny, one in each of his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, remember how I said I like my toilet paper to have ruffles? Well I just took a MONSTER dump, and didn't bother wiping. That's why your new hair smells so ripe.\" Wesley continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky started breathing heavily and his heart was racing a mile a second. He started thrashing against Justin's grip. In this moment, even falling to his death would've been better than what he was hearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you learned your lesson from before, right? Ass face?\" Justin asked him, looking down at the tiny young man in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're gonna treat my butt with respect, right fag?\" Wesley asked, dropping his pants to the floor and kicking them across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds went by of silence and Justin started violently shaking Ricky while Johnny just watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-YES!!! I'LL TREAT YOUR...BUTT WITH RESPECT!\" He forced himself to let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. I want you to pretend its a scratch and sniff sticker, get it?\" Wesley asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get it!?\" Juice repeated with a harsher tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky just nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy.\" Juice said, patting the top of his head harshly with one of his free fingers. \"Here you go bro toys all yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Toy...' Johnny repeated in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley snatched Ricky out of his brother's palm and coiled his digits around him possessively. He brought the hopeless young man around to his ass and Ricky stare at the boxer-clad tight skinny ass as Wesley open it up with his free hand. Justin came around to stand by his brothers side so he could get a better view.<br>\r\nDangling him by one foot over the opening, just like before, the familiar sight of Wesley's fuzzy youthful yet muscular cheeks made Ricky gag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" Wesley said, sounding like he had second thoughts. \"Does dropping him in my pants make me gay?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky's ears perked up and he believed he was on his way toward freedom now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, not at all.\" Juice said. \"He's just toilet paper remember? So HE might be gay but you still have to wipe your ass right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh I guess you're right... it can't be avoided.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice leaned in to get a closer look, but only so far because it would be disgusting to be that close up to his brother's butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh-bye.\" Juice said with a million dollar smile, and perfect, sparkling teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes closed just for a second as he waved to Ricky as if granting him a safe journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez bro, did you want to kiss it too since you're back there?\" Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice pushed Wesley with his free hand who started laughing as he bumped into a wall and dropped Ricky in his underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to see it happen.\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just wanted to see it?\" Wesley asked, turning his ass toward his brother and putting one finger on it while looking back at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" He faked a southern country girl accent. \"Why didn't y'all tell me that earlier?!\" Wesley snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" Juice spat out in defense, as Johnny watched in horror seeing the shape of his best friend once again squirming...back there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's so riled up back there. Scratch and sniff, remember?\" Wesley asked, bringing a finger back toward his ass and pushing Ricky's figure further into his asscrack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you have trouble breathing back there you can always just tap Wesley's ass like 3 times or something.\" Juice said. \"I'm sure he'll be happy to fart for you hahaha. His gas is so fucking overpowering, I'm sure it's enough to breathe in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah trust him, he knows from experience.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you.\" Juice replied, pushing Wesley playfully again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He already knows, he was in the car too, remember?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's right, I actually forgot.\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had a front row seat.\" Wesley said with a snicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He WAS the front row seat.\" Juice corrected with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah...\" Wesley said, walking over toward the bed. <br>\r\n\"If you need air the three tap system should work. Just pound your face into my ass or something three times and I'll help you. I can almost fart on command.\" He said proudly, bringing his thumbs down to the rim of his waistband braggingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inserted his two thumbs and traced his boxer's waistband all the way around to the back side, pulling it out just a tad and letting it go to make a snapping noise as he turned around to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley flopped his ass down on the mattress with no regard toward Ricky who was trapped under his young buns of steel and most all the weight above it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But to be honest,\" he said, leaning back some casually \"I'm probably going to be farting anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he has nothing to worry about!\" Juice said. \"This one, though...\" He mentioned, bringing the focus back toward Johnny who was beginning to sweat from literal fear and the warmth of Justin's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do with him?\" Wesley asked.</span></div></div>",

Both John and Ricky lay on the bed looking up at their two tormentors like Gods before them, completely unwilling to move from where they lay because they knew the consequences of that action would be dire. Neither Ricky or Johnny had any intentions of getting their balls burned off. The two watched as Justin sat the mirror down, and picked up a little box in his hands. He pulled an enormous string out from it and sat the box back down. He wrapped two ends on the index fingers of both of his hands and started flossing his teeth, glancing over at Rick and John with a menacing look in his eyes. John's gaze switched to Wesley's face to get an idea of just how fucked they were. That's when he noticed Wesley wasn't looking at him, nor Ricky...not even his brother. His eyes were fixed on something behind his two action figure sized prisoners. Justin noticed John's gaze, and looked over at his brother with confusion while continuing to floss his teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth he and John matched Wesley's gaze and realized what his eyes were locked onto: the stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..I..have an idea.\" Wesley said in a tone that sent shivers down John's back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky was too busy crying and trying to brush his new hair out of his eyes to notice any of this going on, but John watched as Wesley walked over to the stone and put his hand on it. Wesley whispered something to it, and walked out of the room, not even saying anything to Justin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro?\" Juice asked, wondering what the hell was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than 30 seconds what appeared to be Wesley came back wearing a onesie that made John's jaw drop. It wasn't just any regular old onesie....it was a spider-man costume. John gulped as he realized the answer to his earlier question about just how fucked he was. Everyone was staring at Wesley who was more than thrilled to get all the attention in the room. He had the entire outfit on, mask and all, and it looked as though it were tailored specifically to his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit.\" Justin said, completely in awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley stepped over towards the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is everyone so amazed? Just your friendly neighborhood Spider-moon!\" He said in a completely different tone of voice as he bent over in front of the two boys on the bed and shook his ass in what had to be the tightest spandex imaginable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suit was so tight, not only could Ricky and John see the entire shape of Wesley's ass including his crack, but they saw his balls dangling from below, taunting them with their enormous size and threatening presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn gagged at the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johhnnnny I'm sure you're really turned on, huh?!\" Wesley asked, rubbing a red gloved hand up and down his ass cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing is soooo tight.\" Wesley said, bending his ass closer toward both John and Ricky who were laying close to each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pinched his right ass cheek and pulled the spandex as far as he could, which wasn't VERY far at all. He let go and it snapped against his ass. John watched as his cheeks jiggled a bit from impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a wonder I can fight crime in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice, seeing all this just started laughing immediately. His laughter filling the room was another big shock to John because it's not something he's heard a whole lot. Typically Justin was always annoyed and grumpy. John used to mutter sourpuss under his breath every time he would bump into Justin when the cousins came over to visit. Justin pulled the floss out of his mouth and he looked down at it with a smile. He snatched John up in his hand and tied the wet floss around his body while John struggled for freedom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey spider-man? Wanna use the John!?\" Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind if I do, citizen! Thank you for the offer!\" He replied in his spider-man voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody gets one, Spider-man.\" Juice said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley pinched the floss between his two fingers and dangled poor John down toward his crotch, bouncing him against his dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well. Looks like I caught a bad guy on my web.\" Wesley said holding the floss still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn stare up at two giant white eye sockets of the suit, which were completely void of emotion. John could HEAR Wesley's smile behind that mask, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know that spider-webs shoot out of spider-butts?\" Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crouched over, put the longest portion of the floss between his legs, which he then closed and began pulling a dangling John up slowly, closer and closer to his gigantic spandex ass. Justin started laughing and Ricky looked onward mortified. It looked as though Spider-Man Wesley had a spider-web shooting out of his ass and reeling his friend in closer and closer to it...a destination no man would want to reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley just laughed at John's struggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spider-butt. Spider-butt. John's gonna kiss my spider-butt. Can't escape...not at all. Spider-butt...spider-butt.\" Wesley's two giant globes got larger than life until Johnny's whole body was pressed up against the red tight forming spandex in horror. </span></div></div>",

He didn't even know that Justin had just now walked over to the stone, placed his hand on it and began whispering something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be right back.\" Was all he heard Justin say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Juice, I'll be having all the fun without you.\" Wesley promised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood back up straight, releasing poor Johnny from the confines of his ass and dangling him carelessly, and almost dangerously close to the floor.<br>\r\nWesley tossed Johnny back on the bed next to Ricky and in almost an instant was bending over in front of the two boys again, his ass hovering just above. This time, however, his ass came down on both them, trapping each one of them under one of his giant ass cheeks. Wesley giggled and began bouncing his ass up and down onto the two boys repeatedly, clearly enjoying his power against the two helpless toys below him who were fighting to run away or defend themselves from his onslaught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncing continued until Wesley stood up higher than ever and came down on both of them painfully. Quicker than ever before he rose, and Johnny tried to crawl-run over toward his friend and grab his hand so they could run off together. Unfortunately, he was too late and the gigantic ass slammed back down on both of them; trapping the boys under Wesley's right ass cheek. Only Johnny's head was poking out, the rest of his body was completely trapped under the heat of Wesley's ass in spandex. But next to him his friend Ricky had worked his torso out and only his pelvis and legs were trapped under the weight of the bratty teenager above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley was about to get up again to slam his ass down once more when he heard some loud music being played from outside the hallway. <br>\r\nWhat sounded like rave music picked up and echoed even in the room it was playing so loud, and John wished he was able to put hands over his ears and cover them like Ricky was. <br>\r\nEveryone was completely stunned when Justin came into the room, the music blaring and echoing louder than ever from the phone in his hand while he danced and twerked his way into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey call me Deadpool, I'm hella fast<br>\r\nCame to merc the bad guys, and get some ass<br>\r\nGot blades for days, got guns galore<br>\r\nGot combo moves, evades and more<br>\r\nWith bear traps and hand grenades<br>\r\nPull the pistol like a maniac right in your face<br>\r\nPoppin off caps, leave a trail of guts<br>\r\nSittin' on my chair, scratchin' my nuts<br>\r\nDon't stop when I shoot, full-auto is on<br>\r\nYour ass is grass, and I'm mowin' the lawn<br>\r\nHot lead to the head, and I won't stop<br>\r\nWhatcha crew gunna do when I hack and chop?<br>\r\nBut all these bitches are prima donnas<br>\r\nI stuff my face with chimichangas<br>\r\nTacos and beers, always keepin' it loose<br>\r\nHang on for a minute while I'm droppin' a deuce<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley laughed from above through the whole routine while his brother Juice showed off his moves. Wesley's ass muscles clenched and moved a little with every laugh, threatening to swallow up John's whole head as it rocked back and forth with glee. Meanwhile, even with the threat of suffocating to death under a giant red ass John watched as Justin moved with the lyrics and even scratched his nuts on cue with the song. John saw Ricky's head turn toward him, the shitcoated asshair frizzled from the spandex moving was the only way he noticed his friend had turned to look at him, he was so stunned by Justin's entrance and dance. John looked at his friends face which was easily read. Ricky was looking at him a stunned, fearful and disgusted look. His face literally said \"what the fuck!?\" and \"What are we going to do!?\" with his eyebrows arched the way they were and his mouth open.<br>\r\nThe song went into the second phase and Justin shut it off after a voice called out \"Sexxxxxy mother fuckaaaaaaaa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deadpool!\" Wesley-man shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup babe, thought I'd drop by.\" Juice said, using a deeper voice.</span></div></div>",

Soon Justin sat himself in Wesley's lap and had his crotch pressed up against Wesley's stomach. Justin's legs were lifted up and were overhead the two boys under Wesley's right butt cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh, honey.\" Wesley said, grabbing Deadpool's ass and bringing him closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want some fuck?\" Justin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would but my ass is....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Occupado?\" Deadpool asked. \"Whaddya say you ditch the two bad guys back there and we get some action going huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley reached out and slapped Justin's spandex ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh baby.\" Justin cooed, still maintaining his deep voice. \"You're so sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Tom Holland sexy? Or Toby Maguire?\" Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breaking the fourth wall already? That really makes me horny...\" Justin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head went up and down like he was checking spider-man out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say better than both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really know what to say to get me going, don't you?\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn wanted to fucking run! It was HORRIBLE to watch his younger cousins role-play like this....in THIS way. It was horrible enough he was trapped under his cousin's tight ass, let alone watching him slap his own brother's ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'FUCKING SAVE ME!' John screamed in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe imagined running away, but it began to look like he was going to live vicariously through his friend Ricky, who had just slipped his legs out from under Wesley's ass cheek and started to try to silently get away. Johnny looked up and noticed Justin-pool staring at Ricky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'SHIT!' John thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RUN!\" he yelled out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky started to run but he had no way of escaping. He reached over and grabbed Ricky effortlessly. John looked up at his scared friends face as he was pulled away by the giant closed fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta keep better track of the bad-guys there, spider-buns.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! I have one trapped in a web.\" Spider-man hollered out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And one running around freely? Maybe I should cut off his legs with my katanas...or BURN his dick off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO PLEASE!!!\" Ricky cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm....\" Justin said in his Deadpool impersonation. \"Speaking of those buns, I'd like to punish him but I can't take my eyes off those things. Do all spiders have such a fine ass?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, just this Spider...\" Wesley replied. \"Want it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yeah!\" Justin replied all excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached over on the desk and tore off some tape. He pulled Ricky down toward his crotch and taped his head right where Justin's dick was. John KNEW he was taped right where Justin's dick was, because it was impossible to NOT see Justin's dick in the tight Deadpool suit. He had the back of Ricky's head pressed up against his cockhead, when Suddenly Wesley got up, freeing John from his smelly prison. <br>\r\nWesley-man stood in front of Justin and bent over in front of him. <br>\r\nJustin-pool grabbed both of his hips from the side and began to move into position, Ricky screaming as he came closer and closer to Wesley's ass head on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful, if your dick goes in there it might get caught in my web...\" Wesley warned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, challenge accepted.\" Justin replied as he started humping his own brother's ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn watched in absolute terror, completely frozen and unable to move just like before when Wesley first discovered him under the bed. He was watching helplessly as his best friend's disgusted, burned face was violently slammed into Wesley's spandex ass repeatedly with the thrusting of Deadpool...Justin's, cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaaah!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!\" Wesley cried out in a fake orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeadpool thrust into Wesley's ass harder than ever, and started working his cock up and down, smearing Ricky's face into Wesley's ass. Wesley picked up on it, and started grinding his crack against his brother's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that's done...\" Deadpool said. \"Wanna go for round two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of want to play with the little one, now.\" Wesley replied in his normal voice instead of his fake spider-man one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, I thought you were ALREADY playing with a little one.\" Justin replied, not breaking character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dick?\" Wesley asked, laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, my dick is WELL PROPORTIONED!!\" Justin cried out in a fake voice as his brother walked away and grabbed John, who was still completely frozen, looking up at him in absolute horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeadpool started to shake his hips to where his dick was doing the helicopter and poor Ricky was along for the ride. His body suspended and flapping around everywhere as Justin finally broke character, laughing and swinging his hips faster and faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, mr. bank robber...\" Wesley said, speaking to John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're poor and pathetic but that gives you no right to run around stealing from the more fortunate, does it?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we teach you a lesson and you lick Deadpool's cum off my ass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just stare up at the expressionless mask as it leaned in and he heard Wesley's voice whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you always wanted to lick Spiderman's ass?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was so fed up about all the gay jokes and he was sickened to death about even the thought of licking Wesley's ass, clothed or otherwise. NO WAY would this happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley sat John down on the edge of the bed standing up and bend over in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, lick my ass. Circular motion, right on the crack.\" Wesley pointed to his protruding ass-crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm not wearing underwear.\" He announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeadpool worked his way toward these two with Ricky still attached to his now erect penis so he could get an up-close look at this next level of humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK YOU!\" John yelled up at Wesley, who couldn't even hear him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh geez, I think he's refusing, Spider-cans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeadpool's voice went back to the typical Justin voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we show him what happens to people who refuse to listen to us.\"</span></div></div>",

It was so tantalizing to Ricky, who watched him grab the same device that already ate away most of his flesh and left him a broken, sobbing mess only a little while ago. <br>\r\nWesley grabbed John in one hand, bouncing himself onto the bed and spreading his legs wide open, and Justin approached with the lighter, leaning down toward Wesley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a sudden move by the two boys, who seemingly had a plan already, Wesley stuffed John under his spandex ballsack and trapped him there, while Juice ripped Ricky off the front of his pants, tearing the tape and causing him to scream bloody murder as the bottom portion of his face went red from the adhesive quickly peeling off of him.

DON'T HURT RICKY!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ARE going to hurt him.\" Justin said in a cold voice, looking down at John in his Deadpool costume. \"And it's all YOUR fault.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah I knew what you were planning. Figured he'd care more for his gay boyfriend than for himself. Good idea, bro.\" Wesley chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!! PLEASE DON'T BURN ME AGAIN!!!!!\" Ricky cried out, completely helpless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Ricky.\" Justin said, his voice not getting any warmer. \"You BOTH need to remember that THIS is what happens to those who don't listen to us. Get it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! IT WASN'T ME!!!!!! IT WAS HIM!!! HE DIDN'T LISTEN!!!!!! I'LL LICK YOUR ASS WESLEY I PROMISE!!!!!!\" Ricky cried out. \"I'LL LICK YOUR ASS FOR HIM JUST LIKE YOU WANTED IN A CIRCULAR MOTION, PLEASE NOT THE LIGHTER!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two cruel teenage boys ignored his pleas and Justin handed him over to Wesley who used both hands to hold his body flat in the air, exposing everything but the sides of his face and his feet which were both being pinched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna burn your balls off.\" Justin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley just snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Ricky cried. Justin brought the lighter up toward Ricky's exposed crotch, just low enough so that the flame would touch his pubic hair but not high enough so that it would touch anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even flinching, Justin turned the flame on with a flick of his finger and John looked up in horror as Ricky's pubic hair caught on fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEE NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!\" Ricky screamed. He wasn't in any real danger yet, it looked like the flame was juuuuuuuust low enough to start a small splintered fire fragments in his hair, some of which extinguished themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU TWO BOTH GOING TO LISTEN TO US FROM NOW ON!?\" Wesley asked, in a demanding voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!!!!!\" Ricky shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! PLEASE LET HIM GO!!!!!!!\" John begged, feeling ridiculous for pleading to a teenager he always viewed as a brat since he was young, from underneath his ballsack, wrapped up tight in a spider-man costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*DDDDDDDDDIIIIIINNNNNNNNNG*<br>\r\nJuice's phone started going off.</span></div></div>",

With only a grip pinched on Ricky's head, the rest of Ricky's body began free-falling into the fire. Ricky screamed bloody murder and was somehow miraculously able to extend his legs in such a way that he was pushing them against the lighter itself, causing the flame to only connect to part of his body, rather than all of it... The part of his body the flame was connected to, though, was Ricky's crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Ricky screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was unimaginable as his balls and dick were being burned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't DONE anything to you yet, can you stop being over-dramatic.\" Wesley said, not even looking but instead looking at the picture message on his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see her tits?\" Justin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I'm looking at them now...\" Wesley replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they're real? They\u2019re FIRE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares. Thirsty ass bitch. Texting BOTH of us? The fuck? Probably has some kind of venereal disease. Whatever.\" Juice said, shrugging it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two discussed some girls boobs John and Ricky were screaming. John cried out for their attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOK! YOU'RE KILLING HIM!!!!!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Ricky was just screaming in complete agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long after that everyone heard a faint popping sound and John watched, powerless as his best friend lost consciousness. The popping pulled both of the boys attentions up and Wesley freaked out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT!\" he said, dropping Ricky onto the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think his balls burst and I have some of his liquids on me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice flicked the lighter off and looked over at his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude...as gross as that sounds, it's so fucking cool that we popped his balls!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn listened to their reactions completely taken-aback. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU FUCKING MOTHER FUCKERS!!!! MOTHER FUCKING MONSTERS!!!!!\" was all he could come up with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh calm down there, dodgeball.\" 'Deadpool' Juice said, looking down at John underneath his brother's balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was just a prank. It wasn't even on purpose.\" Wesley replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at Ricky's body which lay completely limp on the bed right where he dropped it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PFFFFFFFFFT HAHAHAHAH!! It's actually REALLY funny if you THINK about it!\" Wesley with his newfound perspective. \"We threatened to burn his dick off and I think we did it on accident. Hey, Juice, did we burn his dick off?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck sakes, Wes, I don't want to look, you look.\" Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, YOU look!\" Wesley replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dropped him dumbass, you get to look.\" Justin answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, FINE.\" Wesley gave in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned Ricky's body over and immediately put a hand to his face covering his mouth with what at first, seemed to be an expression of shock. John realized after hearing a snort that it was to hold back laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His entire...package is gone..\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" John cried out in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...wait, is there like a hole there or....?\" Justin asked out of curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really not sure, everything is charred black.... I can't tell.....\" Wesley replied with honesty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU GUYS HAVE TO FUCKING FIX THIS! GET THE FUCKING STONE! FUCK HOLY SHIT FIX IT!!!!!!! IS HE DEAD?! WHAT'S HAPPENING!?\" John cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm the FUCK down.\" Justin said. \"This is the LAST time I warn you. I've got experience in burning shit, now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice caused Johnny to gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he's right.\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'FINALLY!' John thought. 'Someone with some fucking sense.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should fix this with the stone, Juice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Justin asked. </span></div></div>",

Johnny shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, give him a vagina. That would be AWESOME!!! And why are you complaining down there?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably because he doesn't want his boyfriend to be a girl.\" Juice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't have cooooties you know that, right?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm....\" Justin said, considering all their options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ricky finally came to, a few hours had passed. He slowly lifted his head, scratching the back of it while moaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh.\u201d He let out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision started to return soon blurred shapes transformed into images with color and significance. <br>\r\nHe saw two very young giants looming over him. One with a smile and the other a frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what happened?\u201d He asked the two boys while looking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was on a bed he didn\u2019t recognize in a room that appeared unfamiliar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re finally waking up, you should be more careful next time.\u201d The giant with a frown said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you got too close to the flame, we saved you though.\u201d The giant with a smile added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe flame?\u201d Ricky asked, rubbing his head as some memories came flooding back to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands started shivering and he became confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll that was a dream, right? This is a dream too... I remember... Juice and Wesley and....\u201d Ricky\u2019s hands traveled to his pelvis and he started shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a huge gash between his legs that resembled a hairy axe wound..when he looked down he started to cry. He saw that he had a pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, retard.\u201d Wesley chirped up. \u201cWe\u2019re not a dream. This is real life. Duhhhh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you burned your dick off we thought we\u2019d give you the next best thing.\u201d Juice added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough tears Ricky could see Wesley elbow his brother in his ribs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEerrr well it wasn\u2019t really OUR idea. But we went with it.\u201d Juice added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN?! You two MASSACURED ME! NOW YOU TOOK AWAY MY DICK!!!\u201d Ricky yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude don\u2019t you remember shit?\u201d Justin asked. \u201cJohn didn\u2019t lick Wesley\u2019s ass so we decided to teach him a lesson. We thought if we came close to burning his boyfriend he\u2019d fucking do what we wanted. I guess he doesn\u2019t love you much, after all. And licking ass should be like in his nature anyway.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI REMEMBER YOU TWO BURNED ME BECAUSE OF HIM!!! FUCK YOU!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa quit PMSing, madame.\u201d Wesley said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t ACTUALLY going to burn you. Weren\u2019t you listening? We were PRETENDING. Then we got a text and accidentally burned you. My bro SAVED YOU. Giving you the vag was all John\u2019s idea.\u201d He fibbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about he would never..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? We recorded the whole thing.\u201d Juice said, pulling out his phone and pressing play on a video the boys had fabricated using the powers of the stone earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky stared, watching closely as memories flooded back to him with being trapped under Wesley\u2019s Spider-Man ass and Juice\u2019s entrance as Deadpool. He looked at the video, the phone standing up in a corner of the room recording Wesley holding him in the air, Juice having a lighter just under him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was all just a prank. Spider-Man loves to prank people.\u201d Wesley said as the lighter poppped on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we got a text and I dropped you, See like i said. Juice saved you. He shut the lighter off. I freaked out and threw you on the bed....\u201d Wesley explained as the video rolled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice voice was the next to talk \u201cWe have to save him!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky was so enthralled watching the video he missed Wesley giving his brother a cheesy smile above the device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can wish his dick back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Don\u2019t.\u201d John\u2019s voice countered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Why do you get a say, ball scratcher?\u201d Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s MY boyfriend eerrr... he will be anyway. He just doesn\u2019t know it yet. You already burned his junk off. Give him the next best thing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe next best thing?\u201d Justin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, give him a pussy. I\u2019ve always wanted him to have one.\u201d Johnny admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky\u2019s hands come up to his face and covered his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley just laughed. \u201cA pussy? Why would we help you and give HIM a pussy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPLEASE just do it! Give him a pussy! It can be my birthday gift.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t my brother\u2019s balls in your face gift enough you queer?\u201d Justin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou HAVE to give him a pussy! Come on, don\u2019t you guys think it would be funny?\u201d John asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that he mentions it, it would kinda be funny....\u201d Wesley said. \u201cAnd didn\u2019t you promise you\u2019d turn him into the girl he\u2019d always want to be Juice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYessss! Yes! Do it! Give him a pussy! I love him. I know he\u2019s always wanted one.\u201d John pleaded. \u201cYou should fix his burns too.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm....\u201d Justin said. \u201cI\u2019ll give him a pussy but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to fix his burns. I don\u2019t need you two fucking. That\u2019s disgusting. I\u2019ll have to make sure we keep you two separate as well... you\u2019re really sure he always wanted a pussy?\u201d Justin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Yes he did!\u201d John relied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I guess.. you asked for it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky watched as the video showed Justin wishing on the stone, and then it cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky started tearing up some more and slamming his fists down on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019LL KILL HIM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you didn\u2019t want a pussy after all?\u201d Wesley asked. \u201cIt kinda made sense to me because you\u2019re a faggot.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck no! Of course not! IMA A FUCKING MAN AND IM NOT A FAGGOT HE IS AND HE\u2019S OBSESSED WITH ME!!!\u201d John yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well... you believe us now, right?\u201d Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! It was all fucking him! The pictures, the pussy EVERYTHING. WHERE IS HE ILL STRANGLE HIM!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe separated you two like we said we would. Don\u2019t want him to fuck you.\u201d Justin replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck me? I\u2019m going to fuck him up!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, see?\u201d Wesley asked snorting. \u201cThat\u2019s just gross.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot like that! You guys have to help me! Let me kill him please! Don\u2019t you believe me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah.\u201d Justin replied. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. Those pictures looked like you were willing. You\u2019re a fag.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not!!!\u201d Ricky screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm.. if he did something like that to me, and I weren\u2019t a faggot... I think killing him would be too easy.\u201d Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ricky asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah almost like a mercy killing.\u201d Justin added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would you do?\u201d Ricky asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d make him eat shit.\u201d Justin replied in a cold voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat shit??\u201d Ricky asked totally confused. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... it\u2019s the perfect revenge. We made him eat my shit before in a cake for always being such a buzz kill and a fucking loser. The look on his face was priceless.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha you remember how he ate it all?\u201d Justin laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to forget it. That was our birthdays gift to him. To be honest we\u2019ve never really given him anything for his birthday except your pussy.\u201d Justin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky looked like he was thinking. \u201cSo you saved my life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d Justin replied. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me, but you should.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-thank you dude.\u201d Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah. I wanted something more than that...\u201d Justin said, putting a finger into his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d kiss my dick.\u201d Justin replied, unbuttoning his tight black pants and pulling everything down to expose himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not gay! Please you have to believe me!!\u201d Ricky yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gay!?\" Wesley asked, laughing. \"Dude, you're a GIRL. Kissing dick is normal for girls, dumbass.\" Wesley was cracking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to earn my trust.\u201d Justin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-how can I do that?\u201d Ricky asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can start by getting over here and kissing my fat cock.\u201d Justin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley started laughing.</span></div></div>",

If you want your dick back you have to kiss mine.\u201d Justin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKiss it like you mean it queerboy!\u201d Wesley added. \u201cYou want your burned face fixed right?\u201d He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky wrapped his hands around the cockhead and French kissed the pissslit as precum flooded into his mouth causing him to gag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it... a real faggot's thank you.\u201d Justin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not gay?\u201d Wesley asked, laughing and making a gagging noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky pulled his mouth off the piss slit and a smiley trial of cum attached to his lips and Juice\u2019s cock grew larger with distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not gay!!\u201d Ricky screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look real gay right now, cum lips.\u201d Wesley added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice!!!\u201d Ricky yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ALWAYS have a choice.\u201d Justin replied. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t kiss another man\u2019s cock. Not ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE AND MAKE JOHNNY PAY! This is ALL HIS fault!!\u201d Ricky yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI admire your passion.\u201d Justin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn his kiss or his voice?\u201d Wesley asked cracking a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth, bro. Both.\" Juice admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought so.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Deal.\u201d Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice pulled his fat cock back behind the cover of his boxer shorts, and with a smile he pulled his pants back up and buttoned them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d Justin said with his usual cold voice. \"Stay here.\" Justin ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin walked out of the room, leaving just Wesley and Ricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where am I?\" Ricky asked, trying to strike up a conversation with the giant brat. \"This room is pretty cool..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Juice's room.\" Wesley said, pulling out his cell phone and sending a text message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...Juice has great taste.\" Ricky replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you, his stalker or something?\" Wesley asked, putting his phone away and giving Ricky a weird look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! I just meant that this room is really cool! He has a lot of neat posters of rock bands in here.\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Wesley said with a specific tone of voice that made it clear he found it weird to be discussing his brother's taste in music with a toy. <br>\r\n\"He listens to metal and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky caught the tone of voice and decided to stop bothering Wesley out of courtesy. He was still shifty of the two cousins and didn't trust them 100%, but in the back of his mind he was beginning to wonder if they were really all 'that' bad or if they were just regular teenagers. <br>\r\nLooking around the room Ricky saw posters for bands that were just rock, but some that were really heavy metal. He also noticed a few pairs of socks scattered around the floor. He saw a pair of dirty underwear hanging off of Justin's dresser. It was hard to see a great distance in the room because the lighting was off, the windows were closed, and the curtains shut. There was also a distinctive smell in the room, that wasn't exactly a 'friendly' or 'welcoming' presence. It was like a mix between teenager...dirty clothes...something from outside, and...weed? Ricky looked over on the other side of the room and saw a bookshelf, and where books would be Ricky saw a fleshlight hanging out in the open. Looking at the bookshelf closely, Ricky thought his gaze would catch some books, but it didn't. Instead he saw action figures sitting there. Several of them with missing limbs.. he gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's normal' Ricky told himself in his mind. 'For a boy to play with his action figures. Sometimes it gets rough.' He smiled faintly to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I kind of remember that. Only my mom would've killed me if I broke my toys.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few books Ricky did see on the shelf were all biology related. \"How to properly dissect a mouse\" one of the many titles he saw. Ricky continued to scour the massive room. Not massive only because of his size, but massive in general. The room was many times bigger than his own parent's master bedroom. Ricky saw a walk-in closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why would he have a dresser AND a walk-in closet? How many clothes does this kid have?' he asked himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over and saw a computer desk which looked like it was crafted out of what had to be 100% real mahogany. On the desk were 2 huge dual monitors. Below it was a massive computer tower that looked like one of those fancy gaming towers that lit up different colors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from him Ricky, behind Wesley who was again looking at messages on his phone, was a massive TV mounted on the wall. Flat-screen. Ricky guessed it must've been one of those new 4k TVs. Searching further he found a trash can, near where the computer desk was, packed to the brim with trash. He saw a few wadded up tissues on the floor next to the full trash can. The last thing Ricky noticed was a huge table next to the headboard end of the bed, and it had a giant glass aquarium with only a little water. Ricky couldn't see what was inside of it, but next to it were a few jars labeled \"bugs\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he looked upon this table, and the computer desk and even the dresser Ricky saw a lot of dirty dishes. Plates, and glasses. All fogged up. One of the plates was red with what had to be ketchup. The other was smeared with some kind of sauce. A1 maybe? Juice had eaten a steak recently. On the floor directly below was a pair of skinny jeans, partly hidden under the bed itself. Something big was underneath those jeans...and Ricky gazed upon what looked like a bong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky heard something coming from the hallway, and Justin popped in through the door with 2 pairs of shoes in hand and a few rolls of paper towels hanging on his arm. he dropped all of it to the floor immediately, the shoes flying every which direction. Ricky got a good look at the soles of the shoes and gagged. He saw the shoes littered with bug corpses and grass. One pair even had a giant wad of gum under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa. Where have you guys been walking recently?\" Ricky asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff. Right?\" was all Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky, who was curious and wanted a bit more information, asked a follow-up question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, like...how can you keep wearing shoes if they have all that in them?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley's smart ass mouth replied back. \"That's why we're having you clean them, dumb ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're careless, really.\" Justin replied with a honest tone. \"Especially Wes. He's always stepping in his own gum somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AM NOT!\" Wesley replied angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARRREEE TOOOOO.\" Justin made a childish voice at a similar pitch to Wesley, mocking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley just flipped his brother off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...anyway...\" Justin began, walking over to Ricky and picking him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped over to the middle of the room where the paper towels and shoes were and sat him on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what your job is.\" Justin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.... I'll clean your guys shoes and you grow me back.\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. For revenge.\" Justin added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what?\" Wesley asked. \"Are you gonna kill John when you see him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still thinking about it.\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha.\" Wesley laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got on his knees, bent over and then went on all fours so he could get in Ricky's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well with how dirty our shoes are, you're gonna have A LONG time to think about it.\" He said with a smile, flashing his yellow teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky tried not to gag as Wesley's foul breath permeated the air. He didn't want to seem rude to the person who was going to help grow him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha.\" Ricky faked a laugh. \"You're right.\" Ricky replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley's smile grew wider and the glint from the light in the room reflected off of his metal braces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know.\" He mocked, taking delight out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna leave you to it.\" Justin said.</span></div></div>",

Whatever.\" Wesley replied, looking at his phone as he exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Justin left, Ricky saw a huge grin on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember Ricky...\" Justin said. \"They have to be SPOTLESS for our graduation party. Friday.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Juice I'll make su----\" before Ricky could finish his sentence Justin slammed the door shut behind him and walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have 2 days to make these 4 shoes spotless... I may as well get started.\" Ricky said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to the paper towels and tried to move them toward the shoe but even lifting up the full roll of paper towels was difficult at his height of only about 6 inches. He drug it slowly across the carpet to the first shoe he wanted to start with, placing the paper towels next to the shoe so he wouldn't have to walk as much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't look TOO bad.\" Ricky said to himself, getting used to the peace and quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled the paper towels out and ripped off 2 veryyyy tiny square sections or about 1/19th of a full sheet, maybe less. With both of those in each hand, Ricky walked up to the trim of each shoe and began peeling the grass clippings off of the giant converse sneakers. He saw a few rips on the shoes fabric, but nothing that had a hole in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they want to wear these shoes to graduation?\" He asked out-loud. \"They're kinda scuffed up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky just shrugged, pulling the grass clippings off and throwing them onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume they want me to just...leave a pile of paper towel's here. They didn't give me a trash bag... I guess they can just vacuum it later right?\" He continued to pull off the grass clippings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The important thing is that their shoes are CLEAN!\" he continued, grabbing more grass clippings. <br>\r\n\"And that I get to shit in John's mouth for what he did to me.\" Ricky said, shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 30 minutes of cleaning grass clippings off of the one shoe because he had to climb on top of it to get clear the trim, Ricky hopped down and began looking over the sole of the first shoe. He walked around it taking it all in, and a disgusting smell sickened him to nearly puking. He looked at the sole of the shoe and underneath a huge dead insect with wings was a bunch of dog shit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God.\" Ricky said, trying to stop himself from hurling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can't expect me to CLEAN that!\" He said, his eyes starting to water from the intense smell. \"Is that on ALL THE SHOES!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran over to the other one. Check. He ran over to the completely separate pair and they, too, somehow had dog shit on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do TWO different PEOPLE step in dog shit!?\" Ricky asked himself. \"It's all dried up..\" he said out-loud shivering with disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know how I would get that off! I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE. FUCK THIS!\" Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO FUCKING WAY!\" He looked over toward the door and thought about it for 5 minutes, having an internal argument with himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't just RUN away! What if they catch me!\" Ricky told himself. \"But at the same time, there's NO WAY I can clean up dog shit off their shoes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did they do this on PURPOSE!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, no they wouldn't DO that...they're just teenagers right? They were probably playing outside and stepped in their dogs shit or something. It happens! Like <br>\r\nALL THE TIME. There's no WAY they knew it was on there, or they wouldn't have asked me to clean the shoe up. NO way they knew...\" He repeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is running away really not an option?\" He asked himself again. \"Where can I really run away TO? They HAVE the stone. They PROMISED me they'd grow me back if I do this. I can't just run away. I'll never be grown back!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would I even make it home?! I don't even know where I am!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus there's no easy way to travel, and what when I get there I show up having been missing for several days 'hey mom and pop, I'm sorry I'm only 6 inches tall. How's your day?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would I even get out of their YARD. Could you imagine how difficult....\" Ricky stopped talking to himself mid-sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Ricky said, looking up at the giant insect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I went outside, I would die. If this thing is THIS big to me.....\" Ricky said... \"How would I EVER make it back!?\" He started to cry. \"I don't have a choice. I have to clean the dog shit off their shoes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I can't I WON'T! I'm SURE THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO DO THAT! They didn't know. If I just wait here and do nothing, they'll come back and I'll explain to them. They'll understand. Yeah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Ricky decided. \"I'm just going to wait here for them to come back. They said they'd check up on me, right?\" Ricky decided. He lay down and stare at the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're understanding.\" He told himself. \"It will all work out.\" Ricky started imagining how great it would feel to be big again, and take his revenge out on John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were right, if you want to punish someone do it with shit. I'm glad I'm not on their bad side, so they don't use shit to punish me. I mean, holy fuck, dog shit smells so disgusting.. I can't wait for John to EAT mine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started imagining how liberating it would be to shit in John's mouth and be able to walk away from all this, fully grown and going back to his house. The fantasy took up a lot of time. 5 minutes became 50. 50 minutes became 2 hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are they?\" he asked out-loud. \"I'm losing my mind just sitting here. Should I leave the room and go looking for them?\" Ricky asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe played back a memory of Justin speaking \"A real man would stay behind and do what he needs to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A real man...\" Ricky repeated. \"A faggot pussy would try to run away while we were out of the room. Your choice.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I CAN'T leave the room!\" Ricky said. \"I'm not a faggot!... OR A PUSSY! I'm a MAN!\" Ricky stated bluntly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a MAN and I'm going to CLEAN this dog shit off of these teenagers shoes even if it kills me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky got back up after a long break cringing as he wrapped two of his hands around part of the insects body and started to tug. He was gagging and quivering in disgust as only a part of the large insect slowly started to peel off the giant converse. With a loud, gross ripping noise MOST of the insect came flinging off of the converse unexpectedly. Ricky fell backwards as insect guts and juice sprayed out when only a part of it came off at once, falling to the hardwood floor. He screamed and pushed the corpse that fell directly on top of him off, and ran away as fast as he could in a forward direction, having a complete panic attack, his body jittery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It touched me. IT touched me. IT TOUCHED me. IT TOUCHED ME!!!\" He repeated, yelling louder each time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took his trembling hands and wiped the insect goop off of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't they at least have given me clothes...\" he asked himself, completely disgusted with his body. He looked down and started to cry, when he saw some of the insect gut juice had entered his....new opening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around, completely freaking out and realized he had ran 5 feet away from the shoes and the insect. He ran back, avoiding the dead corpse and going straight to the paper towels. Ripping off a piece, he used it to clean up his vagina and threw up as he pushed the towel in to try to get some of the juice out that was now inside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BLEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!\" Ricky retched all over the paper towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his hands on his knees, and bent over a bit, looking down. He looked at the puke and threw up one more time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BLLLLLLLLLARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGG!\" Blowing bigger chunks than before, the tremors in his hand ran down his spine and into his whole body now. <br>\r\nHe started hyperventilating and spazzing out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god I'm small, and my vomit landed on the paper towels...I would hate to think of what Wesley and especially Juice would think of me....hah.\" Ricky started out a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahah!\" He laughed maniacally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Juice would probably make some comment like usual...'You failed. Faggot.' he'd say, all serious. And Wesley, good old Wesley...he'd probably make some witty joke about how the bug juice stopped me from cleaning up Juice's shoes. Those kids are so smart. I can think of it now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY WORM!\" Ricky repeated in a high pitched Wesley-esque voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bug juice gross you out? Huh, wittle crybaby!? OH MY GOD! JUICE! I JUST REALIZED!!! HE couldn't clean the JUICE off your shoes, JUICE! AHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAH!\" Ricky laughed, even mocking Wesley's tone of voice and high-pitched laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky giggled a bit afterwords, sounding a little more like himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, That kid is so observant.\" Ricky looked back up away from his own pool of vomit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to finish this...for me. For them. Yeah...\" Ricky said. \"For them.\" He repeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They haven't done anything wrong, right?\" He asked himself. </span></div></div>",

HE THINKS HE CAN FUCK ME OR SOMETHING!?\" Ricky's rage started boiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope he likes the taste of shit.\" Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've GOT to prove to the boys that I'm not some queer. I'M NOT!\" Ricky said, running over to the bug corpse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the corpse away from the shoe without even thinking about how disgusting it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ripped off another piece of paper towel, used the dried up dog shit coated tread to climb up the shoe and remove the bugs leg and pincer off the sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This shit is so gross.\" Ricky said. \"It's caked in all these squares... how can I get it out....I need something sharp...\" He asked himself, getting off the shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, he couldn't see anything useful that he could reach. Everything useful was on the desk above, or so he thought. He couldn't see what was up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around one more time and stared at his hands for a few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to chip it off with my fingers, and my nails.....\" Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will all be worth it. It will ALL BE WORTH IT!\" He repeated to himself, using his hand like a weapon and striking the dried up dog shit in the tread of the shoe, and pulling bits of it out at a time, tossing it on the floor near the dead insect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're gonna take one look at all this and understand what I did for them. They're gonna know. They'll KNOW.\" Ricky repeated, working faster than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll grow me back, they'll fix me. I'll shit in John's mouth and go home. I'll take a shower...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're really nice boys! They're just teenagers. It's fun to play with toys as a teenager, right? They didn't mean to burn my face or hair off with the <br>\r\nlighter. They even gave me a full set of hair so I wouldn't feel as bad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have to prove to them I'm not a toy, or gay, that's all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky chipped away at the dog shit for several hours, finally clearing out most of the treads. The room grew even darker as night was approaching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get at least 2 shoes done before I go to sleep.\" Ricky told himself. \"All that's left on here is the gum.\" He said, looking up at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wesley's gum...\" Ricky laughed. \"They really ARE careless, like Juice said.\" Ricky climbed up the shoe, and tried to get a grip on the gum, but it was nearly <br>\r\nimpossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands could find no bearing on the gum and actually were getting stuck in it. He snapped his hands harshly out of the gum, some of Wesley's old saliva still active within the innards of the pink-dirt stained substance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THINK RICKY, THINK!\" Ricky said to himself. \"I have to get this off so I can start the other shoe! I WANT THIS DONE TOMORROW!!!!\" Ricky rushed himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The towel will just get stuck....wait....\" Ricky thought to himself. \"Gum always sticks...\" He gasped really loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY HAIR!\" Ricky said. \"MY HAIR!! THE BOYS GAVE ME HAIR!!!!!!\" He shouted triumphantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky pushed the tip of his head into the gum, saliva oozing out around his scalp and running down his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is SO gross!\" Ricky said. With his eyes shut, he was shivering as the saliva ran down his face and lips, dripping down his chin. He pulled his head back, bending his neck and pulling something in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he snapped hard, the gum peeled off and stuck to his ass hair wig, just like he thought it would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!!!!\" Ricky shouted, happy as Wesley's old saliva dripped into his mouth. \"EEEEEEEECKKKKKKKKKK!\" He gagged, running down the shoe as the gum slowly folded downward due to the change in gravity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gum swallowed up his forehead and all his hair, now. Ricky jumped off the shoe and went down to the paper towels. He tried prying the gum out of the hair, but it was no use because the hair was super-glued to his scalp, and the gum wasn't budging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll..just have to work with it...\" Ricky told himself, running over to the other shoe to repeat the process. \"Thank god Wesley was careful enough to not step on TWO pieces of gum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours and hours went by, a total of 11 to be exact. But through hard-work and determination Ricky cleaned off the second shoe when his stomach started rumbling. <br>\r\n\"Where are the boys? They must have forgotten about me.\" He told himself. \"Or they're just so busy fucking with John. Yeah...that must be it. Fucking with John hahahahahaha. What a faggot. I hope they burn him. Faggots should be burned.\" Ricky said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach growled louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I NEED to eat something!\" Ricky said. He looked around the room for something, anything for him to eat that would help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only have Wesley's gum...but that's just going to kill my digestive sys------\" Ricky paused, looking at the floor over at the dead insect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no. I couldn't.\" Ricky said gagging. \"I know they say it's good protein but... no.\" Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO NO NO NO NO!!! GO AWAY.\" He yelled at his own thoughts. \"GO AWAY NO!\" Ricky dropped to his knees, gripping his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Rickyyyyyy.' The voice in his head said to him. 'You haven't eaten at all today. You have to eat Ricky...' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but I can't eat that..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You don't want to die, do you Ricky?' The voice asked him. It had a haunting, almost ghostly tone of voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no.\" Ricky admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Eat the bug, Ricky.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'm a vegetarian!!! Besides, the boys will be back with food for me. They haven't forgotten!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, yes they have Ricky. They've forgotten about you tonight. Look at the clock Ricky. The clock reads 11 pm. They already ate, Ricky.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think they ate?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Some juicy steaks, maybe some mashed potatoes with the skins still in them, and garlic sprinkled on top.' Ricky's stomach growled harder and his mouth started watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do you think the bug tastes good?\" He asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think bug sounds delicious right now, Ricky.' The voice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky walked over to the insect corpse and pulled a chunk of it apart. He shivered just holding it in his hand, the thing felt so gross and hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really? E-eat this?\" Ricky asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, Ricky. Really. You have to eat this.' The voice assured him.<br>\r\nRicky brought the insect part up to his mouth and gagged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Like a bandaid, Ricky...' the voice advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky opened up his mouth and slammed the bug piece into his gullet, and started chewing. He threw up in his mouth but that actually helped mask the flavor of the bug a little. He chewed as quickly as possible and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good job, Ricky. You need to eat a little more. Get more protein, Ricky.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, OK. I GET IT. SHUT UP YOU!\" Ricky yelled to no one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky ate another chunk of the bug guts quickly and did his best to keep it down after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bed time, Ricky. Bed time.' The voice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bed time.\" He repeated. Ricky lay down on the cold, hardwood floor completely naked and shivering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lay in the sock, Ricky.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-the dirty sock?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, Ricky. You'll freeze to death out here. Lay in the sock.' The voice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ok.\" Ricky said, walking over to the ONE lonely sock on the floor next to Justin's bed. He curled his body into it, and his feet touched something still a little wet at the very bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-whats that?\" Ricky asked himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's probably cum, Ricky.' The voice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-C-Cum!?\" Ricky gagged again, almost throwing up. He started to get out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'DON'T LEAVE, Ricky! YOU'LL FREEZE!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But nothing, Ricky. Is laying in Justin's cum even near as bad as laying in Wesley's ass?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You've been through worse, Ricky. You've already drank some of Justin's cum before, remember, Ricky?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Q-quit saying my name like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How else am I to speak to you, Ricky?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-WHO ARE YOU!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's not important, Ricky.' The ghostly voice said from inside his own head. 'You have to survive, Ricky. Try to sleep.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ok.\" Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the sock up, getting his feet and parts of his legs wet with Justin's cum. Ricky wrapped the sock around him, with the stink of Justin's crusted hard, dirt covered cum filled sock wrapped around as an additional layer. Somehow the poor 'man' was able to find some sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky only slept for a measly 5 hours.<br>\r\nThe next day Ricky woke up, and repeated the process he used on the two shoes on the other two, taking him a little bit less time now that he knew what he was doing. He finished up at around 11 and spent an hour imagining just how bad his shit was going to taste for John when he finally had the chance to ruin him. He also imagined what witty line he would say to John as he shit down his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what would sound the coolest...\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought of what Wesley or Juice would say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two are so witty. They could think up of something on the fly...I'm not as smart as they are.\" Ricky told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he heard a noise from outside, and the door opened. Ricky smiled when Wesley and Justin walked in.</span></div></div>",

Sure? Like I guess...\" Wesley asked, completely confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't want me to call you Wes, I don't have to though.\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you WON'T be calling me Wes. That's just a fact of life?\" Wesley said with a question at the end, proving his authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok! Wesley it is! Whatever you want, Wesley!\" Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah.\" Wesley said. \"Whatever I want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin smiled down at Ricky, loving his new attitude toward the boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you cleaned off our shoes...\" Juice said, looking over at the tread and everything. \"They ARE spotless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you requested, Juice! Errr.. should I call you Justin!?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Justin replied in a really dark tone of voice. The coldest voice ever. \"You don't call me Justin. You call me JUICE.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ok. I was just unsure because of Wes..\" Ricky started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you SHUT UP already!?\" Wesley asked, rolling his eyes. \"Jesus Christ.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky signaled 'I'm sorry' in sign language, which neither of the boys really picked up on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to get grown back?!\" Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!!!\" Ricky shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, are we really doing this?\" Wesley asked. Justin elbowed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh. Ricky proved himself. Ricky wants revenge on John, REMEMBER???\" Justin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHHH right. You've proved yourself or whatever. Yeah we can grow you back, for sure!\" Wesley tried to end his sentence more confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I told you guys I'm not a pussy faggot! I didn't run!\" Ricky said, proud of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K.\" Wesley replied, not caring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley took another look down and something caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that on your faggot head?\" Wesley asked. Justin elbowed him again. \"OH, right. What's that on your...man...head?\" Wesley repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your gum!\" Ricky said, excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so happy the boys were interested in knowing how he cleaned their shoes off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to use my hair to get the gum off the shoe! There was no other way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean MY asshairs?\" Wesley asked. \"So, you had to use MY asshairs to clean OUR shoes? Does that even COUNT then? Did you even prove yourself?\" Wesley asked, looking over at Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky's eyes started to swell up with tears. He didn't even think of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE! I-I DID ALL THE WORK. I THOUGHT THE HAIR WAS GIVEN TO ME AS A GIFT, WHICH MEANS IT'S MINE!\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, technically YOU'RE mine, my property if I remember correctly. That's what you said not that long ago, right?\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the lighter under you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I\" Ricky sat there stunned and defeated. \"I'm so sorry, you're right. You're so much smarter than I am.\" Ricky told Wesley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duhhh.\" Wesley said. \"But it's nice of you to admit it...\" He thought. \"I'll let this slide, JUSST this once.\" He grinned down at the poor broken little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THANK YOU!!!! THANK YOU WESLEY!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah whatever.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't run! I think I did a good job.\" Ricky told the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, you didn't run.\" Justin repeated. \"And so now you'll get what was promised to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent over and picked the little tiny up in his hands like a salt shaker and carried him down the hallway into Wesley's room. Ricky's dreams were all coming true in this very moment as the breeze from Justin's walking flittered under the gum stuck to his head and onto his scalp. The boys all entered Wesley's room where Ricky saw something unusual sitting on a desk near the stone he didn't notice before... two hampster or rat cages one right next to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those?!\" He asked in curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well one of them used to belong to John's pet mouse Mr. Squeakie. We took it from his house. It's not like he needs it or anything.\" Justin chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we killed him and all.\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's cool! Who does the cage belong to now!?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..uhmm it's ours but it's really for John. It's where we're going to keep him from now on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Ok. What's the second cage for?\" Ricky asked, completely oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...um..\" Justin was taken aback by the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized in that moment that Ricky thought he was going to be a free man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dipshit didn't realize what we meant when we discussed this earlier?' He thought in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly came up with a white lie that covered it all up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That umm..cage..is where we were GOING to store...the uhhmmm...toilet paper.\" Justin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the fuck am I talking about!?' He asked himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The toilet paper?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, umm.. you know. The toilet paper. We thought it would be great to put some in there to mock John, because he's a toilet and all.\" Justin said quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shit did that work!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh ok!\" Ricky said. \"That makes sense! You're so clever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin held back a laugh. 'Something really fucked this guy up last night... but I'm loving it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is John in there!?\" Ricky asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.\" Wesley said with a snort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached into the back of his pants and pulled out a thrashing John cursing him out and screaming bloody murder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was warming him up for you.\" John heard Wesley say, probably to Justin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO FUCKING WAY AM I GOING UP YOUR ASS TOO JUSTIN! FUCK BOTH OF YOU!\" Johnny shouted at the top of his lungs. Wesley just tossed him on the bed like a piece of garbage in the trash can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin placed Ricky on the floor next to Wesley who was standing to the left of his brother. Justin placed one hand on the stone and carefully worded everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Ricky would go back to being normal height, all PHYSICAL scars removed. Oh, and give him his junk back...for his revenge.\" Justin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky jumped for joy hearing the boy say this, and staying true to his word just like Ricky knew the boys would. His very dreams were coming true, and he couldn't help but shed a tear as a bright light enveloped him and agonizing pain took over his body as his limbs and very cells grew back to normal.</span></div></div>",

I'M NORMAL SIZED!\" He reached out and grabbed both of the boys, hugging them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the boys wrapped their arms around Ricky as he squeezed them tightly.

I think you have stockholm syndrome I remember reading about it in class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to be my toilet.\" Ricky stated bluntly while Wesley laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fucked up in the head, Ricky, listen to yourself!\" He reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm not! THESE TWO ARE NICE AND YOU'RE THE EVIL ONE!\" Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley made a mocking face like a child by pulling down the skin under his right eye and sticking out his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to pay you're going to eat my shit.\" Ricky said as Wesley pointed to his own ass to give John a visualization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and wish on the stone, Ricky. You can wish whatever revenge related thing you want.\" Justin told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky placed his hands on the stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RICKY YOU HAVE TO WISH US BACK IN TIME OR SOMETHING! RICKY YOU HAVE TO WISH US OUT OF HERE. WISH THEM DEAD!!! SOMETHING!!!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish...\" Ricky began. \"John's body was trapped in a toilet in the bathroom. I wish that his mouth was wide open, right near the rim. I wish I had to take a huge creamy turd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOO!! NOO NOOOO NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!\" Johnny shouted as his body began to disappear slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon his entire body disappeared and the boys were looking at where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he's in the bathroom or something right? Sorry. I was texting this chick.\" Wesley said, distracted as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. He's in the bathroom.\" Ricky said, his stomach started gurgling. \"Oh my god. My stomach. I've gotta run!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'VE got to SEE this!\" Juice shouted with the most excitement anyone's ever heard in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys entered into the bathroom and found a brand new toilet sitting where the old one used to be. Juice walked over to it first, his dick spasming at the thought of seeing his annoying fuckhole cousin inside. Being unable to resist, Juice pulled the seat up, leaving the padding down and took a look inside. Wesley walked over and stood next to his brother and looked down. Both of them were wearing a wide grin on their face and Wesley pulled out his cellphone to take pictures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SNAP SNAP SNAP* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha oh my god this is so fucking crazy. This is so CRAZY I LITERALLY DON'T KNOW HOW I'M NOT INSTAGRAMING THIS RIGHT NOW!\" Wesley said with genuine fits of laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice just loomed over Johnny and smiled cruelly at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well Johnny boy.\" Justin said. \"Looks like you're in for a special treat. Can you speak?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn made a loud moaning noise, he was unable to move his mouth because it was forced open as wide as possible. His head facing directly up. He appeared to be normal sized again, but his body was contorted and bent in such a way that the rest of his body was hidden from sight. There was water surrounding his head, but only up to his hair. It was just low enough that it didn't affect his face at all, so his nose, mouth, eyes and forehead were all outside of the water, but the rest of his body was submerged. He was in a decent amount of pain still from the transformation, and his heart was racing thinking he was about to drown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HAVE TO FUCKING GO, MOVE OUT OF THE WAY SORRY GUYS!\" Ricky pushes them out of the way and pulls down his pants as quickly as he possibly could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky's naked ass and drooping ballsack became John's only visualization of the outside world in this moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've thought about this moment a lot.\" Ricky admitted. \"Happy graduation day, John.\" Ricky said. \"I have a present for you.... It's kinda shitty. Sorry. I don't have a lot of money.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley laughed his ass off hearing Ricky say that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing I was recording!\" Wesley said as Ricky sat down, blocking all light from entering John's new prison. \"That was a fucking epic line dude!\" Wesley high-fived Ricky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! Unnngg!\" Ricky grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HERE, MOVE YOUR LEGS I WANT A CLOSE UP!\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky opened up his legs and some light revealed John's shocked and disgusted face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PERFECT! Can you get your tiny, I mean uh manly dick out of the shot please!?\" Ricky grabbed his cock and held it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, friend! I want to watch this later, too!\" Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY FUCKING GOD HAHAHAHAH I CAN SEE THE TURD WORKING ITS WAY OUT IN THE REFLECTION!\" Wesley laughed gleefully his face partly disgusted and partly intrigued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny could see these expressions written all over his face, and he stare up at the yellowish bracer covered teeth with seething hatred. Justin felt his pants get tighter as a giant erection shaped itself. He couldn't help but get excited, this was the most torturous thing he'd ever seen. It was a HUGE turn on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go get the stone real quick!\" Juice said running off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked up, the light revealing his best friends entire ass, a huge turd tip poking its way out of his opened pucker. He saw all the hairs sticking out and his ball-sack drooping down dangerously close to him. He just HAD to see Wesley's smiling face, holding up a phone recording him as the ONLY visual of the outside world. His hatred turned into a whimper when he looked up one more time to face the turd that was working its way out of Ricky's asshole. He turned his vision back onto the only other thing he could look at: Wesley's smile, braces pointing out as the teen ignored John and stare at his phone's screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single tear drop fell from his eyes and down his cheek. He just wanted to go home. He wanted to cry for his parent's help, wanted his mother to show up and save him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mommy' he thought. 'Please help me.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough introspection he realized just how low his two cousins had made him. Whimpering in a toilet bowl crying for his mother. He started trying to scream but it was only coming out as moaning. He thought he heard someone else enter the room, but it was hard to tell with all the toilet water filling his ears. He could hear really disturbing sounds, almost like the ocean or what you might hear from a shell when you hold it up to your ear but with the sound of being submerged under water, and random clanking noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got the stone right here for you Ricky in case you need it.\" Juice said, covering up his huge boner with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRO YOU GOTTA SEE THIS!\" Wesley said. \"SHITS ABOUT TO HIT THE FAN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I plan on watching the theatrical release.\" Juice said, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMM!\" John pleaded just as the turd swirled into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMMMMM!! MMM MMM GOOD HUH JOHN!?\" Wesley asked and Ricky laughed, an accidental fart rippling out of his asshole and cutting the turd loose into John's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn had tears streaming down his face as the tip of a turd jolted out of his best friends ass and straight into his gullet. The fart sputtered shit everywhere into the water surrounding him and on his face. He tried to close his eyes, but for some reason his body wouldn't let him, it was like he wasn't designed to. Instead, the shit juice stung as it hit his eye. But that was the least of his concern as the slimy turd literally oozed its way past his tongue and down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHA OH MY GOD!\" Wesley said laughing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bombs away!\" Ricky said playfully, trying to suck up to Wesley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley laughed so hard the camera shook. \"BOMBS AWAY HAHAHAH OH MY FUCKING GOD SO CLASSIC!\" He yelped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it's nothing we didn't prepare him for a year ago, right?\" Juice asked with a slight giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOO way dude this is MUCHHHHHHHHH much worse!\" Wesley said, filming. Juice almost creamed his pants. \"I see another one coming!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I FEEL it coming! It's a fucking train!\" Ricky admitted.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The one turd worked its way down Johnny's throat and into his stomach where it was already causing a disturbance. The remnants of it remain in John's mouth, coating his teeth and tongue in its foul presence and demanding that he wash it out immediately. Tears of pure horror streamed down Johnny's face as he breathed in harder searching for air, but finding only hot feces filled methane winds whiffing through in this gas chamber of horrors. It was like this toilet had an ozone unique to only itself, the heat of Ricky's ass and warmth of shit was in the air itself, the only warmth John could feel submerged in toilet water. It wasn't a welcoming warmth, though, more of a putrid warmth. An unwanted warmth that stung him and all his senses at once. He could taste the shit from the smell and he could taste the shit from the taste. No matter what he did he couldn't escape this, he'd already tried thrashing his body left and right. The only thing he could do was choose between looking at Wesley's smug smile, seemingly miles away from him in the safety of the bathroom as he watched and laughed at John with each passing second, or look up at his best friends ass as another disgusting piece of shit worked its way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to stare with pure hatred, at Wesley's face imagining all the ways he was going to kill him when he was free. Wesley, noticing this, starting mocking John by making faces and flipping him off. Wesley, loving watching John suffer and taking every minute of his torture as an opportunity to mock him, turned around and slapped his ass as John looked at him, giving him a view of another ass in this hellhole. John's view of Wesley's ass mooning him was cut off as a giant swirling turd blocked his vision and dipped down into his mouth. <br>\r\nRicky got a real kick of Wesley's mocking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful he might take a picture.\" Ricky told Wesley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faggot probably took a mental one. OH SHIT I'M MISSING THE GOOD PART!\" Wesley turned back around and started filming again. <br>\r\nNo one noticed Juice in the corner pulling out some toilet paper to clean the cum off of his dick. Ricky looked down into the opening only able to see so much of his friend's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat my turds you fucking pervert. I bet you won't ever take another picture of me again!\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shit spiraled into John's open mouth, warm and gooey with the consistency of mashed potatoes. The turd was so massive his cheeks puffed out and his entire mouth was full of his friends fecal matter. He cried and cried but couldn't shut his jaw or chew or do anything. He had to wait as the shit wormed its way down his throat, pressing up against his whole mouth and tongue, giving him a real taste of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably eating the bug I had to eat for dinner last night!\" Ricky said. \"I hope it tastes as good for you as it did for me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice was stroking his dick hearing that. He sat the stone up on the counter in such a way that no one could see him doing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate a bug for dinner?\" Justin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I had to eat most of that bug off your shoes Wesley and I'm a vegetarian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A vegetarian?\" Wesley asked. \"That's stupid.\" He said. \"Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's cruel to eat animals just because they taste good...\" Ricky said, while feeding his shit to his best friend below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley rolled his eyes. \"Whatever. Dumb logic. But you ate a bug off my shoe, really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude that's fucking GROSS!\" Wesley said with a little bit of a laugh and a questioning tone of voice that could easily be interpreted as him mocking Ricky. \"How did it taste?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot better than this does, I'm sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 3 boys laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys forgot about me.\" Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OF COURSE THEY DID!' Johnny tried to scream with a mouthful of shit. 'THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU RICKY!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't forget we just didn't care!\" Wesley said out-loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin wanted to reach over and knock sense into him but he was too busy fapping to his own imagination of the events taking place right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't care? Oh like you knew I could take care of myself.\" Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Ricky, because you da man!\" Juice reassured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! I is da man!\" Ricky repeated, pushing his shit into his friends mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny tried not to breathe whenever Ricky was taking a shit, but this one had been flowing out of his ass for so long Johnny didn't have a choice. He was assaulted with the smell of his friends poop more now than ever as it was flowing not even a half inch away from his nose into his mouth. His body was trying to regurgitate but it seemed like he was incapable of throwing up. Everything in his mind was screaming at him that this was wrong, and everything in his body was too. He was unable to even think as the shit flowed into his mouth, he could only look up at Ricky's open asshole, a giant turd still spiraling out of it and down. He tried not to look down directly at his mouth or he was afraid he would die from shock. He knew where the shit was going, he could taste it, but seeing it would be a whole different horror he didn't want to force himself to experience. Instead, the sight of Ricky's ass was much more appealing, and even that was disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice wanted desperately to come watch but with his giant boner and Wesley filming he didn't want to get in the way of the shot. He was comfortable in his masculinity but he was getting off more so on the pure terror and agony his cousin must be experiencing. When he looked over at Wesley and noticed the same excitement, he became a little more open about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope it tastes really fucking good, John you piece of shit.\" Juice said coldly. \"This is what you get for being such a faggot killjoy over the years.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! and for taking pictures of me!\" Ricky added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That too.\" Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hear that, shitlick?\" Wesley asked, getting the camera as close as he would without getting near Ricky's junk. \"Shit is your just desserts. Hahahha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis high pitched laughter echoed in the bathroom stinging both Ricky and Johnny's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UNNNNNNNNG\" Ricky grunted. PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one....ugnnng Wesley.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Rick did you take like 5 laxatives or what?! HAH OH MY GOD IT'S LIKE NEVER ENDING. I HAVE to upload this to youtube!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stone really works!\" Ricky replied. \"I hope he remembers this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he'll NEVER forget it!\" Wesley guaranteed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allllllllmossssssssst done.\" Ricky said pushing the last final bit out in a completely separate turd.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe poop rolled out of his ass, falling into the pit otherwise known as Johnny's mouth. Who cried and somehow jolted back just far enough upon impact that toilet water seeped into his mouth and caused the shit to get gooey. He was able to adjust himself back up by a miracle and he felt the turd slide down into his stomach, which was growling and rumbling angrily at him. The taste in John's mouth was indescribable and Ricky was so exhausted from his shit he started panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always a pleasure to use the John.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys laughed together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yeah!\" Wesley said. \"I hope you ate up every little bit of his poop down there, shitbreath.\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you feel like killing yourself.\" Justin added with a dimmer thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to remember this when I walk away from here.\" Ricky said, getting up off the toilet and giving Juice his first look at what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky, too turned around to see his old best friend's face, now a hated enemy wrinkled in pain and disgust looking up at him with the saddest eyes imaginable. Juice lost it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! I can literally see specks of shit in his eyes! Hahah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he'll think twice before wanting ass again.\" Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think so...\" Wesley commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK PTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley spit a gross loogie into John's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was crying!?\" Juice asked with unrestrained focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LIKE A FUCKING TWO YEAR OLD DUDE! YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE CLIP!\" Wesley pulled up the video on his phone and his brother leaned in to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guys I think my work here is done.\" Ricky said. \"I think I should get going now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait hold on Ricky.\" Juice said, laughing. \"HAHAHAHA NO FUCKING WAYY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys my mom is probably really worried about me, I gotta go.\" Ricky repeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm..yeah sure whatever, there's just one more thing give me a minute.\" Juice said.</span></div></div>",

If you remember I never offered you freedom.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d Ricky said, thinking about it. \u201cUmmm...

Here. I\u2019ve already seen it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, Ricky....\u201d Wesley started pulling his shirt off and revealing his skinny, youthful white body and distinctive V shaped sex lines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make you a deal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? What\u2019s the deal?\u201d Ricky asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo your freedom belongs to us, right?\u201d Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. That\u2019s my understanding.\u201d Ricky repeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we OWN you right now, correct?\u201d Wesley asked, pulling the belt off of his pants one loop at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes. Yes. You own me. Sorry. You said something about a deal?\u201d Ricky asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Yes?! YES!?!?\u2019 John tried screaming from the toilet. \u2018You\u2019re HUGE and near the stone!! You really ARE fucked in the head.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Wesley said, putting a hand in his pocket, and causing his beltless pants to sag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top of his tight boxers were poking out of his skinny jeans. \u201cHere hold this.\u201d Wesley told him, pulling out a fidget spinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d Ricky replied, meekly reaching over to take the device from the teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen these before....\u201d Ricky said, examining the fidget spinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice looked up from the video with a priceless amused face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Wesley has ADHD.\" Juice told everyone in the room. \"It\u2019s supposed to help him. But it really just distracts him more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley flipped Juice off, dropping his skinny jeans to the floor and revealing more of his body. The only thing he had on now were his tight boxer briefs and socks. The rest of his body was completely exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhhh. So much more comfortable.\u201d Wesley said kicking the jeans over toward Ricky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky watched the jeans fling themselves over into his space without comment or protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy brother is kinda right, I GUESS.\u201d Wesley said. Juice flipped him off with a smile. \u201cThat fidget spinner doesn\u2019t help me, but I just thought of a way it COULD help you.....\u201d Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I was thinking....The deal is if you can spin that on ONE finger for 3 minutes straight, I\u2019ll set you free.\u201d Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God, REALLY?!?\u201d Ricky asked totally in shock and amazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What the FUCK do you mean oh my god really?!? It\u2019s not even possible you fucking moron!\u2019 John yelled in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Really. But if you can\u2019t do it, your life belongs to us, forever. Get it?\u201d Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I get it, but it sounds kinda hard, Wesley.\u201d Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh my fucking god it\u2019s a MIRACLE! He understands it\u2019s hard! It\u2019s actually fucking impossible you dumbass! Run!\u2019 John thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice started snickering. John heard his younger cousins mocking laughter and somehow found it in himself to find pity for the man who just shit in his mouth. If Juice was laughing, you had to feel sorry for whoever, or WHATEVER he was laughing at. He was far too serious and too detached to ever laugh, unless he was torturing something. It was obvious to the whole room, Ricky excluded, that even Juice couldn\u2019t believe Ricky was falling for this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo shit, Sherlock.\u201d Wesley replied. \u201cBut your freedom is mine already anyway right? So what do you have to lose? The only difference is that your life would be ours FOREVER. It\u2019s not like we really GAIN anything from you losing. And it\u2019s not like you lose much from losing, either. Your life is already pretty worthless last time I checked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...\u201d Ricky said. \u201cYeah!\u201d Ricky\u2019s voice sounded like realization had just struck him. \u201cYou\u2019re right! I don\u2019t have much to lose! My life IS already yours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m right!\u201d Wesley said. \u201cI\u2019m not retarded! Your losing just makes it OFFICIAL. And PERMANENT. Get it? Like, do you know what those words mean?\u201d Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Makes sense.\u201d Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what else. If you lose, I\u2019ll go ahead and write up a slave contract. Or better yet YOU can write it up as one of your first acts of service to me, your new Master. We\u2019ll include Juice in it too. He\u2019ll be your Master as well. Still makes sense? Then you can be our slave and clean our room and stuff!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Wish it away Ricky!!!\u2019 John was seething in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice was actually slightly concerned about this and hiddenly nudged Wesley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky walked over to the stone and put his hands on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne hand on and one in the air. Like on a Bible.\u201d Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky did as he was told, and Juice stared in awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow say: I Ricky Brown, otherwise known as Buttlick Rick do hereby swear...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI Ricky Brown, otherwise known as Buttlick Rick do hereby swear...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat my life, my freedom, my worldly possessions and my very body all belong to Wesley and Juice from this day until the end of my days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat my life, my freedom, my worldly possessions and my very body all belong to Wesley and Juice from this day until the end of my days..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI vow to always be their slave whenever called upon and whenever not called upon. To always think of them and their benefit. And to call them my Master for <br>\r\nthey are smart and I am dumb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI vow to always be their slave whenever called upon and whenever not called upon. To always think of them and their benefit. And to call them my Master for they are smart and I am dumb.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now I want to make some vows to you, Ricky. These vows also apply to Juice. I vow to always treat you less than human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice laughed, he couldn't actually believe Ricky was letting this happen, with his hands on the stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI vow to put my happiness before yours ALWAYS.\u201d Wesley continued. \u201cI vow to humiliate you in ways you\u2019ve never dreamt of. I vow to belittle and demean you whenever possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky started wincing and it was apparent in his face that he was visually upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI vow to force you to do things you don\u2019t want to for my amusement. And finally I vow you will always have a place, not by my side as an equal. But below me where you belong.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice laughed an idea striking him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf anyone has any disagreements or wishes to speak against this ceremony let him speak now or forever shall he hold his peace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky looked fearfully around the room hoping someone would save him. He looked toward the toilet, even expecting John to help after having eaten his fresh shit. He kept looking and looking but no one answered. His own mind was even absent, not even considering the stone as a get away or option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are now Master and Slave!\u201d Juice pronounced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahaha!!!!\u201d Wesley laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent over in front of Ricky and with both thumbs on the backside of his waistband, he lowered his boxer shorts, mooning him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may now kiss my ass.\u201d Wesley said, wiggling his backside in the air expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn watched with limited vision from the toilet, just barely seeing Wesley\u2019s grinning face as he was bent over, patiently waiting for his kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, Ricky looked onward toward the naked teenager's ass as it wagged in front of his face mockingly like a dog\u2019s tail would as the dog waited for a special treat that he knows he doesn\u2019t deserve but will receive anyway. During his gazing Ricky saw that Wesley's ass hairs were standing up on end, stiffened by the goosebumps of his anticipation of Ricky's expected surrender. Wesley's ass was jiggling slightly as it wagged back and forth in the air in his childish taunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the imperfections on the ass, there were no imperfections. It was as though Wesley's ass, although a horrid sight to Ricky being a boy of course, was molded to perfection. Those minor imperfections, typical things you might see on someones ass especially a boys; a few moles scattered here and there, the goosebumps themselves, peach fuzz sticking out of his ass crack not abundantly but enough to make it clear he's still young, very few pimples (something not found anywhere else on Wesley, setting the expectation that Wesley doesn't wash his ass as often or as well as he does everything else), and finally of course the imperfection of being in Ricky's vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of another boys ass in his face made him want to gag, especially after experiencing what it could do close up when Ricky was only action figure sized. He started having flashbacks to that abysmal place, to the starless void where the darkness enshrouded your vision but offered no light, not even a little, to see what was poking at your body, what was touching you. Ricky realized, the truth was he never actually got to see all of it. Sure, he caught a glimpse just before Wesley snapped him inside the back of his boxer shorts, but while inside he couldn't see ANYTHING. Not that he wanted to, because now he knew things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he knew his former tiny body was rubbing up against pimples and moles, and whatever else...left over toilet paper? Ricky gagged slightly but it went unnoticed. Now he knew why the smell was so strong, not only because he was small but because Wesley doesn't clean himself up back there as he should. Now he knew Wesley could be unhygienic, an intimate personal detail about someone he doesn't want to get to know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just kept looking. Staring. He was staring at the one thing no man wants to see, especially in the way it's being presented to him right now; the ass of another man, no, a boy even, shaking in his face taunting him. Ricky realized now by looking at it how it had overpowered him before, not JUST because he was so small but because Wesley's ass was toned. It had some muscles. It didn't have fat but it was the most anatomically correct ass Ricky could imagine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, he didn't spend time ever thinking about how a boys ass would look at Wesley's age, it's not that. It's just that Ricky had to admit the ass was in good shape. Not too muscular, not fat but skinny, but not too small either. The expanse of Wesley's back had a line leading straight down to the unholy center of shitsville like a road leading straight to hell. Looking at his crack in this way, Ricky shook himself back awake and stopped himself from thinking positive thoughts about that disgusting ass in front of him. The positive thoughts were replaced instead with thoughts of protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that very same scummy, unkempt ass that tortured him for hours was waving in front of his face anticipating a gift from him; a gift of concession and servitude. This yielding act was, in Ricky's mind, completely unforced yet expected. It was to be prompt. Ricky knew Wesley wasn't FORCING Ricky to kiss his ass, but that he EXPECTED it to happen because he asked for it. Ricky irrationally accepted that he has new responsibilities now, the ones he promised toward the two younger boys; to do what they wanted just because they wanted it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these thoughts went through his mind at once, seeming to him like forever but in reality they only took a fleeting second. His eyes snapped back into focus on Wesley's ass as it circled back and forth in front of him as though it already knew he was going to submit. Feeling conscious-stricken and distraught, Ricky conceded and forced himself to bend down, much to John's dismay, working his way toward Wesley\u2019s skinny, yet muscular ass with remorse. Wesley looked back at him with impatient amusement. Reaching back, Wesley slapped his ass several times in a taunting gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, lock lips with it, slaveboy.\u201d Wesley said, flashing an impatient yet toothy grin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ricky took in a breath, giving in to his Master\u2019s demands with the understanding that he was yielding his very life away by locking lips with the teen\u2019s ass cheek. Ricky\u2019s lips puckered up, gracing the ass cheek in declaration of Wesley\u2019s victory  over him and the acknowledgement of their deal. The truth is Ricky never felt so lowly than before now, when even at his full size he had become so docile and serventile that he allowed what was practically a pre-teen have so much control over him. But at the same time, Ricky\u2019s mind had become so shattered that it wasn\u2019t fully registering what was happening in the way a normal persons mind would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley just laughed gleefully when he felt Ricky lock lips with his behind. He couldn't help but think of what a 'good boy' Ricky was, a compliment fluttering through his mind like one a person might give to a dog. Wesley was impressed Ricky was keeping his lips locked on his ass because he wasn't told to stop yet. Wesley figured a test might be needed to prove further Ricky's submission, so he started moving his ass in circles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is TOO fucking great!' Wesley thought to himself, feeling extremely accomplished when Ricky's head attempted to move with his ass at the same speed and in the same direction so as to not break the kiss. Juice got a kick out of it too, Wesley could tell, from the huge smile he had on his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Wesley stood back up, Ricky knew it was time to remove his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood back up, too and he asked \u201cWesley why did you remove your clothes before I started spinning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can call me Master Wesley now. And I did it for the same reason I started moving my ass in a circle after you started kissing my cheeks. I did it because I knew you\u2019d lose, and that you're a bitch.\u201d Wesley snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Ok. I guess if I knew that and I were you, I would\u2019ve done the same!\u201d Ricky replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a fucking SAVAGE, dude!\" Juice proudly told his little brother with a huge smile. \"That was FUCKING AMAZING!\" He said, complimenting him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn wanted to kill himself, being locked in the toilet watching all this and being able to hear them speak so freely. He either wanted them dead or himself dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah bro, it was pretty lit.\" Wesley admitted, bragging about himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It WAS cool.\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole room cringed, especially John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fag.\" Juice replied. \"How did you know he would like actually kiss your ass?\" He asked. \"Or that he wouldn't USE the stone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you listen to anything I just said? Because he's a fucking loser.\" Wesley replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" Juice said. \"True dat.\" Juice reached over and grabbed Ricky's head by the hair, pulling it down as he bent over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tight skinny jeans contoured to his ass as Ricky's face got closer and closer to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice farted right onto Ricky's face and he laughed, letting go of his hair. Ricky's head shot back up straight as fast as he possibly could, completely red and embarrassed by the fart like he had been emasculated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHHAHAHAHA!\" Wesley laughed. \"Did you SEE how fast his face went back!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! LITERALLY RIGHT AFTER I LET GO!\" Juice laughed alongside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude his face is all red and shit. The fuck?\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red like a woman's face when they see how big my dick is.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley made a gagging noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude girls are gross.\" Wesley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice started laughing. \"Nah. You're still young you'll get it when you're older.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ONE YEAR YOUNGER THAN YOU, dumbass.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in experience, I'd say.\" Juice said, trying to sound better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff whatever. Girls are gross. Duh. Everyone knows that. I mean they have pussy between their legs and it's just eww. What even is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice's ears perked up at this. \"Wait, what?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pussy. It looks gross dude. Girls are gross.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're starting to scare me, bro. You're not gay or something are you?\" Juice asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Wesley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Like there's nothing wrong with being gay, I want you to know that. It's just that gays are like... lesser?\" Juice asked not able to find the right word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're like, well first of all they're fucking disgusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second of all, they're just not real 'men' so to speak. Like, no. Just no. Don't be gay Wesley. Hashtag don't be gay.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley rolled his eyes, and so did John hearing them talking about homosexuals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hashtag NOT gay JUSTIN!\" Wesley said using Juice's real name as he became annoyed and shoving him a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you think girls are gross?\" Juice asked, letting his brother call him Justin with zero consequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh?\" Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever had sex?\" Juice asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley's body turned a tiny shade of red and it was visible to everyone with him being completely naked. Embarrassed but unable to control his own bodily reaction, Wesley instead stepped past Ricky who was standing there mindlessly listening to their conversation like it was one of his duties and grabbed his clothing he had kicked over earlier. He pulled his underwear up first and then jumped into the pants asap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derrrrrrr Wesley?\" Juice asked again. \"Have you had sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deeeeeeeerrrrrr no, ok?\" Wesley told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know how?\" Juice asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we talk about something else?\" Wesley asked, facing away from his brother. \"Like how gay these two are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only joy John was able to take today was in seeing Wesley completely embarrassed. He hoped it was as painful as the shit he ate from his best friend that he could still taste in his mouth. He wished he saw the two boys like this a lot more before he killed them. Embarrassed. Ashamed. He decided maybe he should torture them before killing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is important. Circle of life, bro. Haven't you ever seen the lion king?\" Juice asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juice.....\" Wesley said, turning to face him. \"That movie came out in the fucking NINETEEN HUNDREDS ok? Why...no, HOW would I have seen it?\"<br>\r\nJuice just stare at his brother for several seconds, a clear look of disappointment on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaking. My. Mother. Fucking. Head.\" Juice said as he actually did that. John wanted to strangle him. 'DON'T SPEAK IN TEXT YOU ANNOYING LITTLE SHIT!' HE screamed in his mind. 'YOUR FUCKING GENERATION IS SO GOD DAMN MOTHER FUCKING ANNOYING!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck bro. FIRST of all you're GOING to see that movie at some point. It's like a classic. Yeah, it might be old or whatever, but it's a fucking classic like I said, and that's all that matters.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn rolled his eyes again '1994 wasn't THAT long ago dipshits.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second of all, don't be embarrassed bro, you have ME here. Look, this is ME we're talking about, I will totally help you with everything you need to know, ok?\" He walked over and put a hand around his brother's shoulder and looked toward both Ricky and the toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't call me Juice for nothing.\" He said.</span></div></div>",

He started shaking as the wish took effect much to his dismay. The last thing he wanted was to be a plaything in their hands again. His vision went white and when he regained it he was once again in the exact same horror movie he wanted to be exempt from. Juice was bending over, reaching down to grab him before the pain from his transformation had even subsided. These two brats had no idea what it was like to be turned small, but John was going to make them find out one of these days. Or just wish for intense agony for them all over that never ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That would be amazing.' He thought, leaving reality for his imagination instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey fag.\" Juice's foul breath exhaled onto him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU TWO YOU NEED TO LET ME GO RIGHT NOW AND!---\" John started shouting and thrashing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm.\" Was all Juice said. \"You're not going to be like Ricky are you?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn I hate your annoying fucking voice.\" Wesley relayed to John, using his annoying fucking voice that was higher pitched and snobbish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO FUCK YOURSELF AND FUCK NO I'M NOT GOING TO BE LIKE RICKY I'M GOING TO KILL BOTH OF YOU AND---\" John kept going and going but the two boys spoke over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is Ricky so....ummm what's the word?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a bitch?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why is Ricky such a bitch, anyway? Did you wish him that way or something when I wasn't around? I was wondering that earlier. That's why I asked you how you knew he wouldn't just use the stone against us.\" Juice admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude I had no idea, he just did what I said. He kept complimenting us and shit, I assumed it was something you did.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU TWO ARE FUCKING RETARDED?!\" John screamed, which this time caught their attention after a full conversation of being ignored in the palm of Justin's hand. \"CAN'T YOU SEE YOU FUCKED HIM UP SO BAD HE HAS STOCKHOLM SYNDROME!!?!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Juice asked. \"I think I heard about that once or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, on it.\" Wesley said, already having his phone out and google searching. <br>\r\n\"Straight from wikipedia...\" Wesley started with John screaming finally able to vent every bit of frustration he has out as things happen instead of just yelling in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WIKIPEDIA ISN'T EVEN A RELIABLE SOURCE YOU DITZY ASS BLONDE REJECT!\" John yelled. Justin actually started laughing but Wesley looked up from his phone at both of them with a scowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stockholm syndrome is a condition that causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity. These feelings, resulting from a bond formed between captor and captives during intimate time spent together, are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims. Generally speaking, Stockholm syndrome consists of \"strong emotional ties that develop between two persons where one person intermittently harasses, beats, threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other. HAHAHAHA oh my god!\" Wesley said, using his thumb to scroll down further with a huge smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you didn't mind control him?\" Juice asked. \"He just...snapped or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE I PROMISE I thought YOU did something to him with the stone!\" Wesley said, looking back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way he COMPLIMENTED your room when you were gone and how he spoke to us when he was cleaning shit off our shoes!?\" Wesley said excitedly. <br>\r\nJuice started getting a boner from this. \"Noo..no no dude. I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU! You had him up your ass forever!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHA OH MY GOD DOES THAT MEAN MY ASS MADE HIM INTO OUR BITCH!?\" Wesley asked with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice started laughing too, realizing it had to be true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhere in there he snapped or something!\" Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO SHIT THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU TWO FUCKING MORONS!\" John added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no fun.\" Wesley said, looking down at him again. \"Be more like Ricky. He's cool.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL FUCKING NEVER BE LIKE HIM YOU SICK SON OF A BITCH!!!\" John screamed. \"I'LL ALWAYS HATE YOU AND NEVER DO WHAT YOU SAY I HOPE YOU BOTH DIE IN A FUCKING---\" Justin used his finger tip to silence John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" He said, reaching out handing John to Wesley. \"Want to put him up your ass?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh. Not really. I want to read the rest of this.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finee. I was just thinking it would shut him up.\" Justin added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are four key components that generally lead to the development of Stockholm syndrome:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) A hostage's development of positive feelings towards their captor<br>\r\n2) No previous hostage-captor relationship<br>\r\n3) A refusal by hostages to co-operate with police forces and other government authorities<br>\r\n4) A hostage's belief in the humanity of their captor, for the reason that when a victim holds the same values as the aggressor, they cease to be perceived as a threat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin started laughing so hard. \"OH MY GOD!! THIS IS SO AWESOME! I seriously still can't believe it!\" He howled. \"He fits ALL of those, think about it.\" He counted off to Wesley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he developed those positive feelings toward us during the shoe cleaning and we showed him that fake video, remember? Where it was JOHN who wanted him to have a pussy?\" John listened to all this and started thrashing and squirming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's when he started trusting us.\" Juice said. \"He had no previous relationship with us, we'd never met him before. That's number 2. He's refused to like CALL the police or whatever. That has to count as #3!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about #4? Wesley asked. A belief in the humanity of their captor? I don't even know what that means....\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn couldn't help but laugh into Juice's fat finger that was blocking his mouth. He started pushing against it and Justin realized he wanted to talk. He shrugged and let him chime in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you don't you inhumane fucking pile of shit!\" John shouted at him. \"YOU'RE A FUCKING DEMON BRAT AND THE SCUM OF THE EARTH WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT BEING A HUMAN OR KIND!? HUH!? WHAT DO YOU FUCKING KNOW ABOUT---\" Justin crammed his fingertip back into John's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it means in a weird way he thinks we're kind? Like he can justify what we do as kindness?\" Wesley asked Juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice shrugged. \"I really don't know, I don't get it either... but that's what ant brain said. He could be right. Miracles DO happen.\" Justin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley scrolled some more. \"Typically, Stockholm syndrome develops in captives when they engage in \"face-to-face contact\" with their captors, and when captors make captives doubt the likelihood of their survival by terrorizing them into \"helpless, powerless, and submissive\" states. This enables captors to appear merciful when they perform acts of kindness or fail to \"beat, abuse, or rape\" the victims. The victim\u2019s need to survive is stronger than his impulse to hate the person who has created the dilemma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin just smiled. \"That's amazing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'THAT'S AMAZING!?' John wanted to scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted them to understand what being a human was, but they were DEMONS how could they!?

He started laughing with them, but his face still turned red from embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard us talking about your...condition a little didn't you?\" Justin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley flipped out his phone in one hand and started snapping pictures of John all small in his other hand; not really caring about Justin's long drawn out conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes kind of?\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called... shitlocked syndrome.\" Justin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley heard this and started laughing really hard. The obnoxious noises damaging John's eardrums. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shitlocked syndrome?\" Ricky asked. \"What is that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's where you're locked into doing all this shit for us.\" Justin said, grinning at him. \"You'd do anything for us right?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Ricky replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you're shitlocked.\" Justin replied. \"It's like being pussy whipped. But....ummm for your 'friends'.\" He added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit, shitlock.\" Wesley replied laughing again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 3 boys started laughing together, but Ricky was still kneeling in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you're shitlocked but John's not, right?\" Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Ricky replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you understand that situation.

He felt so amazed that these two generous boys would allow him to be in their house, even with his shitlock condition. A feeling of tremendous gratitude overcame him.<br>\r\nIt wasn't long that Wesley snapped the door open, hitting Ricky in the face with it by mistake as he hastily came out. Ricky grabbed his nose in pain, letting go of his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, assface.\" Wesley said, picking up his brother's nickname for Ricky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley laughed a little as the older young man followed behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cum on assface. Cum on assface.\" Wesley chanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ricky walked in the door he saw Johnny on the bed, tiny and screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HATE YOU TWO I FUCKING HATE BOTH OF YOU GET ME DOWN FROM HERE!!!! I'M GOING HOME!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ARE home, duh.\" Wesley replied. \"Your gay parents are dead, remember?\" He laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always hated them anyway.\" Wesley shrugged looking at his brother. \"They never got us good Christmas gifts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god I forgot about how bad their gifts sucked..and they always promised to get us \"good things\" because we were \"used to it\" or whatever? Remember that was what they told us?\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHHAHA OH MY GOD THAT'S RIGHT I FORGOT! WHEN WE WERE LIKE 4! I DO REMEMBER! THEY TOLD US THEY WERE GETTING US 'GOOD' STUFF THEY WOULDN'T GIVE TO JOHN BECAUSE WE WERE USED TO GOOD GIFTS!!!\" Wesley shouted. \"Oh shit, they told us not to tell him that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-they would give you good gifts?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Well, no, not really. Their gifts were always shit actually. But they basically told us they got us better stuff than what they got you. Something about higher expectations. Blah blah blah. They told us not to tell you. Probably just sucking ass because our parents are richer than yours. I guess they really tried to be like, a good aunt and uncle.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's a shame you didn't take more after them and try to be nicer to us.\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean he kind of took after them, right? He might be sucking on my ass later.\" Wesley said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? All of their gifts WERE shit. Especially their last one.\" Justin said...\"You.\" He replied, knocking John down with just a push of his finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I guess a portable toilet isn't a terrible gift, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK YOU!\" Johnny shouted up at them. \"I will NEVER do what you want OR SAY! I'M NOT JUST SOME OBJECT OR PERSON WHO IS GOING TO SIT HERE AND PANDER TO YOUR EVERY WHIM!! YOU CAN GO FUCK YOURSELF I AM MY OWN PERSON AND ALWAYS WILL BE. YOU WILL never NEVER, NEVER TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME!\" Johnny told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky watched the conversation continue and saw Juice shrug. \"I guess you're right. There's nothing we can do about that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. \"Oh well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we were like, thinking....\" Wesley added. \"You could show me how sex works?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not going to be used l-like that by you....\" John said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, we were hoping you could fuck Ricky.\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" Ricky asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we want him to fuck you.\" Juice replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you do that?\" Wesley asked John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK YES! I would LOVE to fuck Ricky. I've wanted to for YEARS! Ever since I took those pictures of him!\" John yelled out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you heard him Ricky. Now go wish yourself small, about his height. Maybe a little smaller.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but but...\" Juice stare at his captor completely exasperated. \"H-he did all this to me and y-you're going to let h-him fuck me....\" Ricky asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're going to wish on the stone to make yourself small and give yourself a vagina again. THEN he's going to fuck you. Get it?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky's mind was running wild. He couldn't do this to himself. He stepped over to the stone frustrated as tears started to swell out of his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why would they want this they're always so kind!?' He started crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice walked over to him and started rubbing his back like before. He reached out with his other hand and dried one of Ricky's tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bud, don't be so down. I know it's inconvenient for you. It's just, well.... I have to teach my brother what sex is, remember? He doesn't know..and...I mean, I'm much to nice to fuck you myself....\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be mean of me. But Wesley has to KNOW how sex works, the ins and the outs. It's going to be important for him. It's something he'll be doing A LOT of for the rest of his life, you know?\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a lightbulb went off in Ricky's mind. \"S-so you're just doing this to help your brother learn sex?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Justin told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I mean, it does make sense you wouldn't be able to do this yourself...you're too nice.\" Ricky replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Juice added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...the only way for Wesley to learn sex is for J-j-john\" he started trembling \"to rape me...\" He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, because you're the only one whose had a pussy. No one else in the room has ever had a pussy. He can't fuck any of the rest of us.\" Juice added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. I will help Wesley learn sex.\" Ricky said, smiling through the tears. He looked over toward Wesley and gave him a huge thumbs up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please watch closely Wesley! I'm doing this for you! You're my friend!\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my slave, dipshit.\" Wesley told him while texting on his phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well I think of you as my friend.\" Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD YES!!! IT'S FINALLY happening!\" Johnny was forced to yell in fake delight as Ricky put his hands on the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that I was small and had a v-vagina again...\" Ricky said, his vision fading as the transformation began to unfold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky's vision returned to him and he saw two adolescent boys staring down at him with huge grins on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw Wesley lean in to his brother's ear to whisper something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing we mind controlled the other one, eh?\" Wesley asked his brother, whose grin got wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing Ricky saw was that Wesley said something that made Juice really happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, Vicky.\" Juice said with his huge smile as he bend down to pick little Ricky up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we're calling you Vicky by the way...\" Juice informed him. \"It's for the demonstration.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like roleplay?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really like roleplay, because you do actually have a pussy.\" Wesley added. \"I mean the reality is that like you're more girl than man so we probably should've been calling you Vicky this whole time anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Ricky said. \"That makes sense.\" He added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The V stands for vagina.\" Juice said. He looked at Wesley \"A vagina is just another word for pussy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW that jackass!\" Wesley said, shoving his brother a bit who grinned at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you did, Wes. Sureeeeeeeeeeee you did.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not GAY ok, I just I've never...\" Wesley said it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be embarrassed bro.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD CAN WE PLEASE GET THE FUCK GOING NOW!? I'VE BEEN WAITING YEARS!!!!!!\" John screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok you thirsty faggot.\" Juice said, plopping Ricky down on the bed. </span></div></div>",

Get him, John.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny ran over toward Ricky completely against his will, tackling him down to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! Are you supposed to do that!?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I think that's just years of pent up sexual frustration or whatever.\" Juice commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn, frozen in terror in his own mind, his body moving against his will watched as he grew an erection looking down at his best friend below him who started sobbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, the guy gets a boner...\" Juice said. \"That means his penis gets bigger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the fuck up Juice holy shit, I'm not retarded. I get boners. What the fuck!?\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ok. My bad.\" Juice said with a snort. \"Anyway, the man puts the penis inside the woman's umm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's body wasted no time, and John was screaming in his mind like never before, wanting to kill himself right then and there. He couldn't even think of revenge on his cousins right now, or anything that would make them experience the horror of raping his own friend who was forced into becoming a woman. He was BEYOND himself in that moment. He just wanted to be dead. He just wanted this to be over. But this was just the beginning instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that? See how he thrusts in there?\" Juice asked, as John thrust his dick into Ricky's vagina. \"That's poor form, really. It looks more like he's trying to please her or something, but I'll be honest with you, pleasing the woman isn't important. You do what makes you happy.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah if you just try to please yourself they end up happy anyway. And if they aren't there are about 20 other girls that wouldn't mind getting fucked by you so it doesn't matter. Or at least, that's how it's been for me.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ok. I thought you had to do stuff to like, please them some too or whatever.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Juice said. \"Lesson Number 1 stick them with the pointy end. Lesson Number 2 jab at them until you climax. It really doesn't matter what THEY think about it because they're just there for you. They're impossible to please as well, anyway.\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, most of the time if you fuck them hard they're grateful, but there are some girls out there who are like 'you didn't kiss my neck first' or whatever the fuck. Who cares. Meh. Just go to town really.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley nodded, taking all this in while John continued to rape and thrust his penis into Ricky who was crying now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does climax mean?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what a boner is but you don't know what climaxing is?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Jesus don't make fun of me.\" Wesley told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I PROMISE you I'm not little bro, listen to me.\" Juice looked over at him, literally turning to face his younger brother. \"I'm sorry that sounded mean.\" Juice said, saying a word John didn't even know the boys had in their vocabulary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you. You're my little bro. I don't mean to sound rude that's just who I am and shit, ya feel?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Climaxing is when you finally cum. I know you know what that is.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh ok. Thanks bro.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Dude, I am so proud to show you this and be the one who teaches you about it.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make this gay, Juice.\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry. Get a little more involved in this, Vicky.\" Juice told him turning his head back to the sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Women don't usually just set there. I know you're gay and you've never had like natural sex with a vagina before, but women will like grab ass or something during.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course. I've been spanked a lot, it's actually a huge turn on for me.\" Juice announced to the room, who didn't need to hear it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love when a woman grabs my ass while I'm plowing her dude, it's fucking lit. You'll love it too.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Vicky.\" Wesley said. \"I'm trying to learn here.\" Wesley rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky reached out and grabbed Johnny's ass and felt his muscles expand and contract with each and every firm thrust into his vagina. He felt so humiliated and penetrated right now. He was being raped by someone who he thought was his best friend, but in reality just wanted to fuck him all these years and there was nothing he could do about it. It wasn't the boys' fault that Johnny wanted to fuck Ricky. Ricky didn't see it that way at all. He saw this as all Johnny's fault. He was being overpowered by Johnny too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Johnny, grab Vicky's arms and hold them against the bed.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny did what he was told under mind control, and he wanted to puke, feeling the wetness of his best friend's manufactured vagina lubing his penis with every push. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some women are into bondage and shit.\" Juice told Wesley. \"They like to be pinned down. Let me tell you something if you ever fuck a woman like that keep her around as long as possible because she's probably into some crazy shit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll keep that in mind.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ricky started slapping and gripping Johnny's ass, the person he despised most in the world, as he thrust his erect dick deep into his pussy. Ricky watched Johnny close his eyes pleasurably and Ricky never remembered a moment where he hated anyone more than this one. He was so absorbed in hatred he almost forgot about the sex act they were performing. <br>\r\nJohnny was more than happy he was able to instinctively close his eyes, but the warmth of his best friend's hand on his ass was not a welcoming reawakening to the world, especially when he started slapping it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't they have to kiss or something?\" Johnny heard Wesley say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OH FUCK NO GOD NO PLEASE NO!!!!!!!!!!!' Johnny screamed in his mind and Ricky had the same thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh. Not really.\" Juice said. Johnny felt the first relief he had felt in a long time, though it wouldn't be the only one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some women want you to but it's really up to you. You're the man. So you can take charge of the sex and everything. Now I WILL say some women....they want to be on top, and that's FINE with me. Show him how that works, guys.\"</span></div></div>",

NOW.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa dude, don't tell me you've used them before?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I haven't but I just KNOW they will. I've had faggot admirers offer before to suck my cock. The cool thing is it's no strings attached but the bad thing is like, they all have aids.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" Wesley said. \"I didn't think about that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. You know they'll do one thing women won't though...\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll suck your ass.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Wesley said, shaking in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude don't pretend to be disgusted. You're always putting that faggot in your ass. You know ass stuff feels awesome don't even sit here and lie to me.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be gay.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no bro. That doesn't make you gay. No no no no. Using a faggot doesn't even make you gay.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fucking way dude. Gay's are there to be used. I don't know what fucked them up in the head, born that way or whatever. It honestly doesn't matter. I don't hate gays because at the end of the day if you NEEED to have your dick sucked they WILL do it, and they WILL suck or lick your ass out. They do NOT care. They have NO standards. A fag will do whatever you want. This year I heard there was this fat faggot eating out the two star football players after a big game.\" Juice said. \"I guess there were pictures of it and everything. I even heard he paid them to do it. PAID them to eat their asses out, Wesley.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That can't be real.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is.\" Juice said. \"It's VERY real. It was even during a powder puff game so the football players were wearing cheerleaders skirts and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The photos went viral in school. Lit sent them to me, grossed out. Said he was thinking about leaving the school over it. I saw them but deleted them forever ago.\" Juice admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did Lit want to leave the school over that?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know how homophobic he is.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley just nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly it was gross like Lit said, but the football players were seniors and I KNOW they get a lot of pussy. If two football players did it, then we can too. I wanted to try it with these two at some point actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley snorted. \"You want to wear a skirt too?\" He asked, looking at his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice shoved his shoulder. \"Fuck you.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, who knows these two might like it more if you were in a skirt.\" Wesley said, grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they would.\" Juice said, looking down at the two miniature men. \"But I'm not doing that, I just want to see what it's like to get my ass licked.\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd be down for that.\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Juice asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah!\" Wesley replied. \"I've...always wanted to...have someone do that anyway.\" He admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just didn't know if that was gay or something...\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO way, Wes. You're not gay for wanting your ass sucked.\" Juice said. \"Oh look, he's climaxing.\" Juice pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky kept jumping all over his former best friend Johnny's dick and Johnny was reacting in such a way everyone knew he was about to blow his load. <br>\r\nRicky was so disgusted with all this he was pushing Johnny's dick into his vagina harder and harder trying to get him to cum already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH REALLY GET IT, BITCH!\" Juice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley looked at him cockeyed. \"Sorry, Wes it reminded me of something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Johnny's dick slit opened up and Ricky felt the warm goo spray 4 piping hot fresh loads of semen into his pussy. Ricky gagged each time but was ordered to stay there while Johnny finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never keep it in there. Pull it out before you cum unless you have a condom.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dick juice is what gets women preggers.\" Juice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh shit I didn't know that either.\" Wesley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand how you didn't know that.....\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley gave him a sheepish look and Juice realized he was embarassed by his lack of knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look it's not your fault it was dads job to teach you this stuff and he is never around. Anyway, Yeah you don't want kids. You want to make sure you're either wearing a condom or force them to take the pill in front of you.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pill?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are pills that stop women from having children. Birth control. I don't give a shit if a woman says shes on it or not, you watch that bitch take one in front of you before you let her fuck you. Do NOT just think she's on it she could be lying.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, bitches be trippin'.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FOR FUCKING REALZ, SON!\" Juice said with a huge grin on his face. \"You're starting to get it!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After a dude climaxes, he gets pretty disinterested for awhile unless you really want it badly and go for round two.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? After I cum I'm pretty much done for a while too. Until like an hour or so later when I go again.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. That's natural. All natural. You fuck it, you leave it. That's really like what nature intended.\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense.\" Wesley said. \"Thank you for this lesson, bro.\" Wesley told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the lesson isn't really over....\" Juice told him.</span></div></div>",

Get it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny turned Ricky back over and got on top of him. He walked over toward Ricky, standing directly above his face. Then he squatted down and pressed his ballsack into Ricky's face and gently glided it back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHHHHHHHHH what!! WAIT!!! I DO THAT TO FUCKING LOSERS ON COD!!!!!!!\" Wesley almost screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!!!\" Juice said. \"Wait, what did you think you were doing?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude I kinda thought I was just crouching my ass in their face or something, like they could kiss it because I'm a winner or whatever.\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. well I guess that would make sense, too....\" Juice said. \"Like honestly Wes I can tell you're into butt stuff.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO I'M NOT!\" Wesley yelled. \"I'm not gay!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, again, I am TOTALLY not saying you're gay....ok? I've seen your google search history. You're just pretending girls are gross aren't you?\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-well yes.\" Wesley said. \"Sometimes I look at boobs and stuff.\" He admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude that's awesome! Boobs are great. They're like giant airbags while you're fucking. Look, Wesley you're NOT gay but that doesn't mean you can't like ass stuff. You want someone to play with your ass that's fine. Nothing wrong with it.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah man, everyone has their own kinks and fetishes or whatever. If you can't get a woman to do it, just find a faggot. Use the faggots, Wesley.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about aids?\" Wesley asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we do have the stone right, just wish the aids away.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH that makes sense!\" Wesley shouted gleefully. \"Can I get Ricky to suck on my ass, then?\" Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yeah! But not right now, I have one more lesson I want to teach you.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, dude, you have NO idea how long I've wanted someone to suck my ass.\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said earlier...I kind of want to try it too....I've never really like DONE that before...\" Juice admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first things first...\" He said, looking down at their two sex dolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was still gliding his balls over Ricky's face back <br>\r\nand forth from mouth to forehead and then back again, this entire conversation. Ricky feel his hairy balls gleam over his lips, then the smell as they lay on his nose and then he'd watch them block out his vision which was directly lined up with Johnny's asshole until they came to take over. The ballsweat of the one he loathed so much smeared across his face from all the fucking they just did, and the wet sweat dripped down soaking into Ricky's pores while the contrasting warmth of Johnny's ballsack itself enveloped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No no no no no no no no!!!!!!!!' Johnny screamed in his mind. 'I don't want to suck ass!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice turned his gaze from the two toys and went over toward the stone instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish these two were normal height on their knees in front of the bed.\" Juice said to the stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys both watched as his wish came true and the two of them were on their knees in front of the two teens. </span></div></div>",

Yes.\" Juice said, unbuttoning his pants. \"Let's show you what a BJ is, Wes.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bj?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn instantly started freaking out, but he was still under the effect of mind control and couldn't move his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it stands for blow job. It basically means they're going to suck our dicks.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is fucking tight fam.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" Juice replied. He kept his hands on the stone. \"I also wish they no longer have aids.\" He told the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good fucking call, Juice!\" Wes told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try.\" Juice shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to wish for a sanitized throat too since fagboy just ate shit.\" Wesley added. Juice's face lit up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! Thank you, you probably saved my life. I wish that turdeater John had a clean mouth and throat for me to fuck.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon John felt completely different, and felt some type of suds in his mouth all over, washing him clean. He gagged a bit, the soap foaming up everywhere in his mouth. Some of it dripped out in bubbles in front of the two boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This stone is amazing.\" Juice said, stepping over in front of the two boys, taking off his shirt too just to give them the full view of his youthful naked body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley followed suit, first removing his pants and underwear, then his shirt, revealing his skinny self. The difference between the two boys was clear. Wesley was a younger boy, skinny, not very tan. Wesley didn't bother keeping up with the way his body looked because he didn't even know what sex really was 40 minutes ago. Juice on the other hand.... you could tell his body was designed to be pleasing. He had a tan in all the right places, his bush was well trimmed, he was toned from working out.. it became instantly apparent to Johnny that Juice was a fuck-boy. He remembered when Juice was just like Wesley, but now Juice was a complete fuckboy and he had worked toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I thought you said you would never fuck me?\" Ricky asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, see, that was before I had a boner from watching you get raped.\" Juice said. \"Plus I'm not fucking you, Wesley is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley grinned down at Ricky who was kneeling of his own free will in front of him, looking at his aching cock and fairly large bush of pubes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but you said that no one would fuck me.\" Ricky started sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice rolled his eyes and tapped on the side of Ricky's face with a fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, duhhh. Earth to Ricky. Wake up Ricky. I NEVER said no one else would fuck you. I said John would fuck you and the rest of us couldn't be fucked by John because we don't have a pussy like you do. You're like a tranny or some shit right now and your pussy is really useful. But no, if you REMEMBER correctly I PROMISED I would not fuck you because I am too kind. But I never said Wesley was kind. Besides, don't you want him to apply what he learned?\" Juice asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I....\" Ricky started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dudes, bottom line...you're going from tiny sex dolls to our personal blow-up dolls, get it? So don't fuck it up.\" Juice told them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny looked down in absolute horror and what he saw made it even worse. It was Juice's full package, freed from the confines of his underwear; and yet even though it was only half erect it still had him trembling with a mixed cocktail of fear and disgust. Johnny was compelled with a morbid fascination to look down at Juice's dick as it grew larger and larger; the blood flowing into it from his pure excitement to finally be able to stuff his pecker down his cousins throat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the most disgusting thing Johnny had ever seen, and what made it worse was that Juice's dick was uncut. John had never seen an uncircumcised penis before, he was only familiar with his own willy, which was circumcised. The fact that he was staring this close to ANY dick meant that he would be physically unable to forget the sight. But even STILL, the fact that it was his younger cousin's dick, and that it was the very FIRST uncircumcised dick he had ever seen was so traumatizing that even when he blinked he could still see it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sight would be etched into his memory forever and uncontrolled memories of the past began circulating through his brain. The memories started to flood in starting with the first moment Johnny realized he truly hated his younger cousin Juice. Johnny couldn't have been very old, maybe 10 or so. Juice was about 6 or maybe even 5, which means Wesley was about 4. Both he and Wesley were visiting Johnny's house because Aunt Lesley and Uncle Benjamin wanted to visit his parents for a few days while they were on another one of their lavish vacations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM do we HAVE to be here!?\" Juice would ask about every 2 seconds, tugging on his mother's shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUSTIN! Show some manners!\" She would shout at him. Wesley would follow suit, doing whatever his brother did, as kids do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Moooooooooom\" Wesley said. \"It's sooooooooo borrring here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle Benjamin stopped them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look kids, you're here visiting your family, end of discussion. We're not going home early and we're not going back to the hotel just because you're whining. Your mother and I haven't seen her family in a VERY long time, not since you were a little baby, Justin...and Wesley, this is the FIRST time your aunt and uncle have even met you, can't you make a good impression?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley let out a long drown out sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes daddy.\" He whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you boys go play with your cousin Johnny?\" Uncle Benjamin asked. Johnny inwardly cringed at the memory reaching this point, remembering all the other times in the future he would hear the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok dad.\" Justin said, walking off toward Johnny. \"We'll try.\" he muttered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny could hear Aunt Lesley laughing in the background, her voice sounding a little embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. Boy's.\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Boys.' Johnny scoffed, thinking to himself. Because that explains it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your house sucks.\" Juice told Johnny privately. Johnny looked down at the annoying little boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it doesn't!\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DOES TOO!\" Wesley chirped in. \"You guys don't even have ANYTHING fun.\" Wesley whined, kicking one of Johnny's favorite action figures across his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Johnny shouted at the boy, bending over to pick it up. \"That's my favorite power ranger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a power ranger?\" Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Johnny replied. Before he could respond, he looked over toward Justin who was leaving the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going!?\" He asked the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of here, this room is BORING.\" Justin said. \"I'M COMING TOO JUSTIN!\" Wesley shouted out at him, running behind as Justin waltzed into Johnny's parent's bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Wait! You guys can't just go in there!\" Johnny tried to tell them, rushing after them but not before first putting his prized Power Ranger toy back on his shelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went into the room after them and saw that Justin had an extremely valuable figurine in his hands. Johnny didn't know this then, but it was a Precious Moments collectible item gifted from his Grandmother to his mother on her wedding day, and it was supposed to resemble the two of them standing next to each other on the day she was married. To her it was the most precious object on earth because it reminded her of her mother who had passed a few years after her wedding. It wasn't the only thing she had to remember her mother by, but it was by far the most important. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Put that down!\" Johnny ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Justin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Put it down you brat!\" Johnny cried out, getting closer to Justin who had no intentions of listening to him just because he didn't feel like he had to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Here Wesley, catch!\" Justin said, throwing the figurine to his younger brother as Johnny got closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest seemed to happen in slow motion, or maybe it happened at normal speed but Johnny could only remember the rest of it at a very slow speed. Johnny watched the figurine launch into the air, flying past him and over his head, Wesley reached out to catch it but just missed, the figurine hitting the tip of his fingers as he tried so valiantly to catch it. He pulled his fingers inward, trying to reel the figurine in but instead the figurine flipped and fell down headfirst almost directly in front of Johnny, smashing the two faces into a thousand little pieces. Johnny remembered the noise the collectible made, sounding like a thousand dishes had fell on the floor and broke all at once. The noise alerted the adults in the living room who came to investigate. The first one to step in was his mother, and the look on her face could never be forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped in complete shock, looking down at the scattered pieces that represented her mother's head with two hands on her mouth and tears already forming in her eyes. Her body was already trembling as the tears started to flow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Who did this?!\" she asked as Aunt Lesley, Uncle Benjamin and Johnny's dad all entered the room. Before Johnny could say ANYTHING <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin's voice pipped up, him clearly having already thought of an excuse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Johnny! We were just playing around and he knocked the figurine off the shelf.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's mother stare at him eyes that showed the wrath of god, and he gulped immediately knowing the consequences would be grave. She ran over to him, easily lifting him up and sitting him on her lap, his face looking toward the door as she prepared to spank him. She slapped him harder than she had ever hit him in his entire life. Over and over and over. The spanking became more than just violent, enticing the other adults to circle around her to try to stop her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary Anne!\" She gasped, watching her sister hit her child so cruelly in front of everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's dad and Benjamin got on her right side, begging her to calm down as Johnny cried and yelped and pleaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom it wasn't me! It wasn't me!\" He remembered screaming in front of his cousins, and his parents, and God. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're lying! MOM! Please stop hitting me!\" He begged, sobbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was only a little boy. He looked up through the tears and saw Justin smiling cruelly at him. The smile turned into something more with each hit, and on the most violent hit, Justin flinched; his left shoulder coming up toward his face as if to block a blow and his right eye closing half way. That hit caused him to finally lose it, and he almost broke out into a laugh but he was forced to stop himself. Unfortunately all of the adults missed it because they were too busy trying to get Mary Anne to stop beating her child. That was the first time Johnny ever saw his cousin Justin laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Wes.\" He told his younger brother and they both stepped back toward the door to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWes exited and Justin made a mocking face at John who was still thrown over his mothers lap. He tilted his head stuck out his tongue and pulled down his right eyelid with a childish \"nah nah na buu buu\" type face. His father Benjamin glanced over at his two children, and just before he could see it, Justin turned his face back into normal, avoiding his father's gaze.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny hated Justin ever since, and Wesley too for not telling the truth. Ever since that day, whenever his cousins would come over they would do whatever they wanted and they were always treated like kings by his parents. Sometimes they would steal Johnny's things and take them to their house, AFTER bragging about how much cooler their stuff was. Sometimes they'd break Johnny's things without consequence. Other times they'd throw tantrums. It's like every time they came over Johnny was at their whim; even their beck and call, and yet it seemed like they would keep trying more and more things to see what they could get away with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered how whenever he would go over to THEIR house, he would be held at a much higher standard than they were at his, and the day he learned that there was a double standard for them whenever his parents wanted to visit he would try to stay as close to his mom and dad as possible. Anything involving them was always completely unfair. But the WORST by FAR was when mother would ask Johnny to let them take over his tv after they whined about it. Or when she would ask him to fetch them something to drink from the refrigerator, as though they didn't know where it was. He HATED being forced to be their servants, but what Johnny was going through right now was on a whole different level and a whole different kind of service. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johnny just couldn't look away from the pulsing cock in front of him. The hatred was boiling inside him but even still he couldn't force himself to look up at Justin, not even with a wrinkled face full of contempt. Instead he stare at Justin's dick, completely flabbergasted and pissed at the same time, gazing for the first time upon an uncircumcised penis that just happened to belong to his younger cousin. His obscene fascination on his cousin's penis stemmed from years and years of animosity and bitterness towards him. He couldn't resist but to look over at Wesley and see that Wesley, too, was uncircumcised, and just the sight of their dicks made him want to vomit. It was like another thing to add to the lists and lists of reasons to hate them. For their disgusting cocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is that even natural?!' John asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice took a grip of Johnny's hair and pushed the back of his head against the edge of his mattress and leaned down to whisper in his ear. Johnny watched as Juice's body curled forward as he bent, and noticed that not a single ounce of fat could be seen on him anywhere; his eyes studying his cousin's body thoroughly, looking for any flaw or blemish. No matter where he looked, Johnny couldn't find a single fault or defect. This level of physical perfection seen on someone so vile and careless infuriated Johnny to no end. Johnny watched Juice's muscles reveal themselves as they moved and the true curves of his body were all fully exposed; taking on their full shape. He put his lips right next to Johnny's left ear and his rugged breath escaped his mouth and wafted into Johnny's general direction with a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm just fucking you, get it?\" Juice's soft voice sang out, questioning him. His grip on Johnny's hair grew tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you've been staring, but don't fall in love with me or anything.\" His lips curled into a devious grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny snapped out of his gaze, furiously wanting more than anything to pound Justin into oblivion like he should've all those years ago. Looking up at his younger cousin now reminded him of something, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just now imagining that smile his cousin Justin had when he was 5 years old, having broke his mothers precious figurine and he looked up to see the same familiar face, wearing that same familiar smile, but this time with a huge erect cock in front of him, poking at his lips impatiently; waiting to penetrate his mouth and rape him of all his dignity. Justin leaned back, standing straight up now. His ball sack sagged extremely low but was still about eye level with poor Johnny, who saw it and wanted to boil his own eyes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide, dolly.\" Juice beckoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny tried to fight it, he really did. He fought against his lips moving with every ounce of will he had in his body. He fought so hard he broke a sweat. But once again it all proved worthless and Johnny was powerless before Justin, just like he had been for all these years, this time literally at his younger cousin's beck and call. The only difference between now and then was that Justin was completely unfettered; Johnny's parents were dead, Justin's parent's were absent and Johnny's will was not his own. Johnny had no choice but to travel further and further down the rabbit hole, giving his cousin Justin exactly what he wanted exactly when he wanted it, and learning one horrible command after another just how unhinged Justin really is. Johnny's mouth opened and he tried his hardest to prepare himself mentally for what was to come, but the reality was nothing he could tell himself could prepare him for what was about to take place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELL YEAH!!\" Wesley screamed. \"Did you HEAR that!? It's dick sucking time!\" He said excitedly, grabbing Ricky's hair and pushing the back of Ricky's head against the very edge of the mattress, following suit with his older brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up, open up, open up open up!!!\" Wesley demanded, poking Ricky's mouth with his penis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPre-cum created a string that attached itself from Ricky's lips to Wesley's dick. Seeing this, Wesley wiped the tip of his dick off on Ricky's face like a rag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice moves bro.\" Juice said, watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was screaming in his mind. 'How can they even perform while watching each other?!' He screamed to himself. 'SOMEONE GET ME OUT OF HERE!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky's mouth finally opened, allowing Wesley's dick passage through. John's gaze shifted back to in front of him, however, when he felt something fleshy coated in slime enter his mouth. <br>\r\nJohn tried to scream but the only thing he could do was glance his eyes over toward Ricky who was already looking his way with a horrified face, watching as Justin pushed his uncircumcised dick into Johnny's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley, who was by far the most eager one got pissed that he didn't get to put his dick inside someone first - but he had a very particular request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Wesley yelled, snapping his finger in front of Ricky's face. \"Eyes up here ass face.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky's eyes shifted back toward Wesley, as his ADHD Master demanded his full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at my dick, keep your mouth open.\" Wesley told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point everyone was looking over to see what Wesley was doing. Wesley pulled his cock out from near Ricky's mouth and held it directly in his line of vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See this?\" Wesley asked, pulling his foreskin back and down. A smell enveloped the room and Juice put a hand over his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude what the actual fuck?! Do you ever clean!?\" Juice asked in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not often. But this bitch can lick my dick cheese off, right?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffff hahahahahahah of course!\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My only regret is that I didn't keep my stick sausage filthy enough for this thirsty ass faggot right here. But I just want you to know Johnny, you look so cute down on your knees for me. I could definitely get used to it.\" Justin's comment only antagonized Johnny and caused him to become more enraged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley inched the tip of his dick and a very small part of his shaft into Ricky's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick.\" Wesley said. \"Then suck my dick cheese off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky looked up at Juice who saw Ricky's eyes shift and returned his gaze. Juice shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude I told you Wesley wasn't kind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Snap snap* Wesley snapped his fingers in front of Ricky again, bringing his gaze back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" He said, gripping Ricky's hair, and pressing him HARD against the bed while he thrust his dick the hardest it has EVER been thrust down Ricky's throat <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID..lick THEN suck. I didn't say stare at Juice.\" Wesley pulled his dick back out to where just the tip and a little bit of the shaft was in Ricky's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Wes, they can't resist. Right babe?\" Justin asked Johnny, sliding his unwanted dick further into Johnny's mouth and looking down at him like some bitch of his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley visibly rolled his eyes, and in his mind Johnny was cutting Justin's out. <br>\r\nRicky brought his tongue and wrapped it around the tip of the teen's dick and watched him ooze with pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh.\" he grunted. \"Suckkkk ittttttt........\" Wesley cooed half-commanding half-mocking as Ricky followed his every word and started sucking his dick cheese right off of his cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of that Wesley started deep throating Ricky who was dangerously close to throwing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhhhhhhh yessssssss.\" Wesley said, putting his dick as far into Ricky's throat as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky started gagging hard as his dick went to the very BACK of his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't puke on me, pussy.\" Wesley said. \"Learn to take it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Wes, you learn real fast how to talk. A lot of women love shit like that.\" He said, expertly sliding his dick across Johnny's tongue, and taking great joy knowing that deep down Johnny was screaming in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want your hands on my ass like you did with the toilet when it fucked you.\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky complied, reaching around and gripping Wesley's firm buttocks and listening to the teen groan pleasurably from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here, cock monger. Grab my ass like your life depends on it.\" Juice commanded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny reached around, gripping tightly onto Justin's ass cheeks. </span></div></div>",

My very own cocksleeve.\" Juice said to Johnny, looking down with a smile. \"Maybe your parents don't give shit gifts after all, hmm?\" Juice thought out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really glad they're dead now.\" Juice said, referring to Johnny's parents<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny had a single tear run down his cheek, and when he saw Juice notice it he felt Juice's dick jump up in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh baby, you know that really turns me on.\" He whispered, thrusting his cock down John's throat who stared up at him with abstract horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny knew how fucked he was, he knew Juice would try to drag out this punishment as far as it could go and do whatever he could to humiliate and demean him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it meant I could've done this sooner, and I, like had the ability? I would've wished them dead years ago.\" Juice told him outright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny really started to cry now, and tried to look away from Juice, to hide his pain. But Juice was staring steadily down at him; his deep brown, beady lustful eyes burning a hole in Johnny's head. Johnny felt the tip of Juice's penis slide over toward his left cheek and poke at it hard, purposely causing him to be in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen John looked over toward Wesley, trying to shift his gaze away from his cruel younger cousin, Wesley noticed and looked down at John with a shit eating grin. Wesley held up his hand in a fist and brought it up to his mouth, and used air to fluff his left cheek up giving John the universal suck a dick in sign language, mocking him for sucking one and also because his brother Juice had Johnny's cheeks puffed out JUST like how the taunt looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, John.\" Juice said. \"Look up at me right now.\" He commanded, John's gaze was forced up to look at Juice with tears in his eyes, and Juice could only smile for a second before his mouth turned formed into an o shaped look of complete concentration as he thrust his dick further and further into John's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This. Is.\" Wesley said with his breathing getting heavy \"THE. MOST. AMAZING.\" He continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....\" Juice said. \"It is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine is such a sword swallower.\" Wesley said, pumping his dick quick and fast down Ricky's throat. \"It's like the pussy gave him superpowers or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh I've had better before.\" Justin said. \"But just because mine isn't great...doesn't mean I'm not enjoying EVERY. SECOND. OF IT.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds went by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love how powerless you are right now, cuz.\" Justin admitted, looking down to John. \"Who knew I'd find a use for you after all these years.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knew you'd be slightly less annoying than you have been.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh yeah......\" Juice sighed relief. \"It feels so fucking good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn continued crying and looked over to Ricky who looked at him with tears in his eyes as well. One would think the two would be bonding over their shared suffering but Ricky HATED John and looking at his face only damaged him further. The two boys were in tremendous pain; both of their knees were aching from the feel of Juice's hardwood floor underneath them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Johnny was performing much the same as Ricky but had a much worse situation. Juice was using his expertise to intentionally bounce his balls off of Johnny's chin to humiliate him more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta really get DEEEEP down, bro but bitches love when your balls touch them. They also love...THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Juice slammed his dick HARD down Johnny's throat and kept it there, even bringing two hands down to squeeze his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHhhhhhhhhhhhh fuck yeah so much tigher!\" Juice gleefully shouted as Johnny choked suffocated to death on Justin's thick cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you two don't agree on 'safewords' before hand, just ease up when you see her turning a bit blue.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Safewords?\" Wesley asked, thrusting his cock into Ricky's throat similarly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah words they say to tell you to ease up.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think they'll be able to speak with my dick in their throat.\" Wesley pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH true, that's what signals are for.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more seconds of this went by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fondle my balls.\" Juice asked. Johnny brought a hand down and played with Juice's balls. Johnny started to turn blue just like Juice said he would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know what our signal can be?\" Juice asked. \"Put a finger in my crack and grab some of my taint and rub it all over your face. You know, when you've had enough.\" Juice added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny reached back with his other hand and put a finger into Juice's ass crack, rubbed it up and down soaking up all the sweat from intercourse and brought it toward his face. He rubbed it everywhere on his face, letting Juice know he was being choked to death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" Juice said. \"But one more second of this though.\" Juice told him, ignoring his signal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds went by and Juice pulled back, releasing Johnny's neck and going back to thrusting regularly. Johnny felt Juice's disgusting dick sleeve roll back and forth from the thrusts in his mouth. One moment it would cover the tip when pulling back and the next moment the tip of his dick behind the sleeve would poke the very back of his throat, and even down into it.<br>\r\nMeanwhile to the left Wesley was still choking Ricky with his fat cock. Ricky was squirming and slapping Wesley, mostly on the ass, trying to tell him he was suffocating but Wesley wasn't getting the message. In fact, Wesley had his cell phone out and was sending a text to someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know my dick is huge. Keep it in there.\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky started mmmphhing and although Juice heard it he was far too focused on humiliating John right now. The only one to notice Ricky's suffering was Johnny himself who was poking Juice's ass to try to get his attention to look over at his brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind a little assplay, either faggot.\" Juice responded, focusing solely on his own dick thrusts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a full minute, during which Wesley started cumming extremely hard. Several jolts of semen burst out of his cock as he looked at some porn on his phone, enjoying the feeling of a tight pussy-like tunnel wrapped perfectly around his dick. Johnny watched in horror as Ricky passed out. Wesley finally got done with his text message and looked down with a look of concern once he realized Ricky had passed out. Instead of freaking out, Johnny watched as Wesley did nothing, and kept thrusting his cock into Ricky's mouth even after cumming just to pretend like he was still fucking him because he was completely unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'MMMMPHHH!!' John moaned 'HELP RICKY!' He tried to say, somehow being able to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No talking.\" Juice said, and immediately John was silenced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it funny how you're down there doing EXACTLY what I said, after you told me you'd NEVER do what I wanted in the bathroom?\" Juice asked him, playing with his emotions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's AWESOME to me.\" Juice told him. \"There's definitely a higher-power at work for all this because it's just too perfect. How things always seem to work out for me, and never for you?\" Juice told him, thrusting his cock harder than before, but not nearly as hard as his brother Wesley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always make your bitch swallow, Wes.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you're ready for your big finish, pull back and really pump those ass muscles into it.\" Juice told Wesley, slapping his brother's naked ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more for the other cheek?\" Wesley asked, pulling back a bit and leaning in a way that made his ass sideways but still kept his dick in Ricky's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For good luck.\" Juice said, slapping Wesley's other ass cheek really hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks bro!\" Wesley said, using Ricky's hair to pull him head up onto the top of the bed. </span></div></div>",

Using his brother's advice, Wesley pulled back, showing off his toned ass muscles as he prepared himself for his final thrusts. He slammed his pelvis into Ricky's unconscious face 4 times as hard and fast as he possibly could, causing Juice to watch in awe. He said one word PER thrust, but it was all fake and for show because he had already came earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SUCK. <br>\r\nMY. <br>\r\nDICK. <br>\r\nBITCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone watched as his ass muscles relaxed themselves and he presumably started to cum buckets into Ricky's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\" Wesley cooed in fake relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was WAY fucking better than masturbating. I'm doing this FROM NOW ON!\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great fucking idea bro!\" Juice said. \"Now let me show you what a white dragon is.\" He told Wesley. \"Watch closely.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny gulped in fear, he was far too inexperienced at sex to know what Justin was talking about, but he had a bad feeling about it. He hated how someone 4 years younger than him could know about a sex act when he didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laugh, faggot and keep laughing.\" Juice commanded. Ricky was knocked out and couldn't see that Johnny was under their spell at this time, but Johnny's body did as he was told to, and he started laughing with Juice's dick in his mouth. Juice started thrusting harder than ever trying to climax. <br>\r\n\"I'm going to force my climax here, I usually can keep this up for a few hours.\" Juice bragged causing Johnny's body to quiver and his throat muscles contracted naturally, which Juice's thick cock opened back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here!\" Juice aimed his dick up toward the roof of John's mouth as he was laughing and shot his loads, which shot out from his mouth up into his nose and started coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY SHIT!\" Wesley said, laughing with his pelvis and dick still covering Ricky's face in an attempt to hide the fact that he was passed out or possibly dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!?\" Juice said, watching his cum ooze out of Johnny's nose, who was crying so hard because it felt like acid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help things either that Juice came 5 times in the same area and Johnny was still forced into laughing which made ALL of the cum shoot into his nose and out of it slowly bit by bit, running down his face. <br>\r\nHe had never been as humiliated as this in his entire lifetime. The pure horror of this causing him to momentarily forget the shit he ate earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice looked over to his brother with a huge smile on his face. That's when his gaze went down to his brother's incredibly unkempt bush, which would catch anyone's eye if seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, bro.\" Juice said. \"I think Ricky err..Vicky passed out your dick was so long, what the fuck?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" Wesley faked, only Johnny knowing the truth. \"I guess so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here get off him.\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shim.\" Juice replied, pulling out of Johnny's mouth who gasped air for the first time in 20 minutes or more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice started looking down at Ricky who was passed out. Not even initially concerned he said something he meant to tell his brother a bit earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have great stamina by the way.\" Juice said. \"You can improve it by edging.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edging?\" Wesley asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was beyond himself again, listening to the two boys discuss sexual related issues while his best friend lay there possibly dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you can masturbate and stop yourself before climax then continue. It helps improve your stamina.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do that already actually, but I didn't know what it was called.\" Wesley admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a fucking natural.\" Juice said, putting a hand on his brother's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny looked over at them, ass height on his knees staring directly into Juice's ass as he placed his hand on Wesley's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do they NOT find it weird they're NAKED in front of each other and he put his HAND on him!? What the FUCK!? Save my friend!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice turned his gaze now over to Ricky who was passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm he's still breathing.\" Juice said. Juice slapped him on the face, HARD a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, wake up, wake up!\" Life came back to Ricky who opened his eyes and coughed out a lot of semen, which flung itself onto Juice's glistening body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww fucking gross!\" Juice said, some of his brother's semen on his chest now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what?\" Wesley asked with a grin. \"Like a reverse white dragon?! Hahahahhahaha!\" He laughed at his brother who had his semen on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude you're fucking dead!\" Juice told Wesley, pushing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you loved it!\" Wesley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck no!\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-where what happened?\" Ricky's raspy voice asked, him completely unable to speak normally with the harsh fucking he just had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt like his throat was going to explode. It was throbbing everywhere and felt like knives had been jammed into it. Tiny ones, that were cutting him in all directions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saved your life, dude.\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" Ricky asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he saved you.\" Wesley told Ricky who grabbed his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA headache was forming from the harsh fuck and the slaps he endured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're awake though. There's one more thing we have to take care of.\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice leaned over and whispered something in Wesley's ear who started smiling wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious?!\" He snorted and laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm always serious.\" Juice said.</span></div></div>",

Wesley asked Ricky to do the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide Vicky.\" Wesley told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasee no more.\" Ricky's hoarse voice asked kindly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm your Master and we just saved your life. WHO are YOU to tell ME no?\" Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky opened his mouth up and Wesley stuck his limp cock into his mouth.

Keep swallowing though, faggot.\" Wesley told Ricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I want you to stop swallowing, Johnny.\" Juice said, pulling his dick back to where it was just the tip of it in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to fill your mouth first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley laughed hearing what his brother said and looked over, watching as Johnny's cheeks puffed up and outwards again. A very long 15 seconds went by for both boys pissing when Wesley's stream went from drizzle to drops. He pulled his dick out, rubbing it inside Ricky's mouth on the inner lip as it slid out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably still have a drop or something. Lick my tip.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky took the tip of his tongue and connected it to the tip of Wesley's penis, right on the cock slit and worked it back and forth up and down and in circular motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. All clean.\" Wesley said, pulling his dick away and looking at it. \"No more dick cheese either.\" He said with a snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at his brother, who had also pulled out but saw Johnny with a full mouth of piss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swish it around.\" Juice told him, grinning down at him. He leaned down toward his cousin who had his mouth full of his piss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really soak it in your gums, and between your teeth.\" Juice whispered. \"Make sure you have it all over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice turned toward his brother, still completely naked and gave Wesley a high five. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fucking epic!\" Wesley said. \"SO fucking amazing. LIKE low-key? Ricky got wrecked bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude didn't just get wrecked. Dude got turnt.\" Juice replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude got OWNT!\" Wesley added. \"I SERIOUSLY want to have blow jobs like that FROM NOW ON! That's like goals as fuck.\" Wesley said. <br>\r\nJohnny wanted to slit his ears off hearing them talk like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you can swallow now, toilet boy.\" Juice said with his grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can make this a permanent thing, you know?\" Juice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Really?\" Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't you want BJS on like order?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK yes! Who the HELL doesn't!?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about....we grow them back when we want some. Or....better yet...................\" Juice put a hand up to his face, thinking.</span></div></div>",

We could tell mom we found him, or he came here, she wouldn't know she's at work anyway.\" Juice said. \"And we can KEEP him like THIS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God.\" Wesley grinned like all his Christmas gifts came true. \"Then whenever I need a blow job he can suck me off.\" Wesley said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like he'll FINALLY be cool to have around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even just that...\" Juice said. \"like that's a big part of it. But know how mom gets in our ass for not cleaning our rooms and all that shit?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Wesley said, looking over at him. His brother nodded in John's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy FUCK this is ALL coming together!\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" He said, looking down at John. \"Your birthday wasn't a buzzkill after all! DAMN! I'm SO glad mom forced us to come over HOLY SHIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! Thank god for that!\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHAA!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Wesley's loud pitched screech rang out hurting everyone's ears as he sucked in air hard through his throat. He pointed at John with an indescribable look of excitement on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PORTABLE TOILET DURING CALL OF DUTY!!!!!!\" Wesley bellowed out loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhahahaha!\" Juice laughed, completely out of character. He couldn't even believe he didn't think of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!!!!!!!\" He agreed, amazed at his brother's wit and giving him a high five. \"You're fucking awesome for thinking about that bro!\" Juice added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess he'll be playing call of duty, too, in a way? The call of doodie.\" Wesley asked Juice who started laughing uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him almost a full 30 seconds for both of the boys to catch their breath from laughing so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a fucking miracle I'm not posting any of this on twitter or instagram!\" Wesley admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude I know!! It kind of sucks it has to be a big secret!\" Juice replied. \"This is the fucking best, like literally.\" Juice brought a single finger down toward the bottom of John's chin, and scratched it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll finally make up for lost time. What do you say, eh?\" He asked, slapping Johnny's left cheek jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley had a single tear drop down his face and a dramatic look on it. John wanted to gouge his eyes out. Wesley put a hand on his brother's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has been the best day of my life.\" Wesley said. \"You need to know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice reached out, and hugged his brother, both of them completely naked. Their arms wrapped around each other. Even with their dicks touching each other's bodies they somehow didn't look gay. It was the most masculine hug that has ever been seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" Ricky's exasperated voice called out. \"What? What does that mean? What do you mean John will do all these things? He hates you both! What do you mean you'll leave him this size?\" Ricky sounded so confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice had a sly grin sneak across his face. The witty boy made up an excuse on the fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh a lot has changed since you were knocked out, Ricky.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley grinned at his brother and just let him continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See it was all Johnny's idea.\" Juice started, lying to Ricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was his idea?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that we shrink you and keep him normal sized, of course!\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what what the fuck do you mean!?\" Ricky asked. \"I don't get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, cum dumpster.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, calm down Ricky. It's no big deal or anything.\" Juice said. \"It's just that John sold you out is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean SOLD me out!?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley rolled his eyes, he was obviously not patient enough to go through this whole lying thing for like a 3rd time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god do you ever just shut up and accept reality?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I just want to know what's going on!\" Ricky exclaimed. \"What did Johnny do!?\" Ricky asked<br>\r\nagain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Wesley, you still have that huge 4k ultra TV in your room right?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff yeah, duh. You've been in there, remember?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say we go to YOUR room and play video games or something, I don't know.\" Juice added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THEN...\" Juice said, \"we'll get to YOUR questions, Ricky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be awesome!\" Wesley said with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't been to my room in forever!\" Wesley added. \"Not since our last sleepover!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice looked down, embarrassed, and then shot his eyes back up to match the excited gaze of his younger brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleepover?\" Ricky asked, confused. John's lips would curl into a smile if they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whose the faggot now, Juice?' He wanted to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have to explain myself to you....OR you.\" Juice said, looking back at John who he knew was loving every moment of this reveal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're both pussy lipped faggots.\" Juice said, defending his honor. He leaned down toward John<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and didn't you just suck my dick?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Unwillingly.' John thought. 'You've been sleeping with your brother, fucking weirdo.' He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain yourself? Brothers can't have sleepovers?\" Wesley looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so cool though?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn stare at Wesley in amazement as he realized how important just that one year of development was between the age of 13 and 14. The pure experience and even mentality behind the two boys was completely different. Not that John gave a rats ass about Wesley's 'development'. He hoped the boy would become a developmentally disabled adult, who was a complete failure at life and who suffered in ways unimaginable because his parents money shrouded his judgement. He hoped the real world ate that brat alive one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, lets go.\" Juice said. \"You two can crawl in front of us.\" Juice commanded, wanting to humiliate Ricky and John further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's body already got on his knees and started making his way toward the door. Before Ricky did he asked \"and you'll tell me what John did when we get there?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, yes already!\" Wesley said. \"GOD!\" He shouted. \"Just go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky got on his hands and knees, completely naked still of course, and crawled over toward Johnny who was in front of the door. Ricky looked over at Johnny who was next to him with a seething rage that Johnny recognized immediately. He knew it was the same kind of hatred he carried for his cousins, and the knowledge of that pained him greatly. But he reassured himself that it was nowhere near as powerful because it was all based on lies and not nearly as developed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open the door.\" Juice said to Ricky, who got up briefly to his knees and pulled the door open in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taking a right.\" He told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys started crawling and could hear Juice's voice whispering to Wesley who started snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE'RE DOING WHAT?!\" Wesley asked out-loud more excited than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley had a high-pitched annoying voice and it seemed like he had no control over it in most situations. Johnny knew Juice was trying to be covert by making sure neither he nor Ricky could hear anything, but at the same time John could catch some of what Wesley was saying as he crawled along the floor like some kind of animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my GOD how did you even come up with that?\" Wesley asked. \"It explains EVERYTHING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny in an instant knew Juice had come up with some nonsense to feed Ricky, who was for whatever reason so fucked up in the head from something they did to him that he was doing everything they wanted willingly.<br>\r\nIn the large hallway passing the stairs, Johnny looked over toward Ricky after hearing Wesley's shouting voice, wanting to see if his best friend heard his cousin. Juice instantly kicked him right in his ass and Johnny yelped from the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you can't resist looking over at Ricky, toilet boy.\" Juice said. \"But you're gonna have to deal with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley snickered again in that laughter that aggravated John to the point that he want to stab someone. Ricky glanced over very briefly at John with a 'fuck you for getting us in trouble' type of look and immediately looked forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny started to look around the hallway, it seemed like he had been crawling forever, but the reality was they had only passed up a few rooms. One on the left which Johnny knew was the bathroom, and one on the right which was next to Juice's gigantic room. These rooms were so huge the doors had to be spaced out accordingly, and the hallway was equally long causing for a terribly uncomfortable and humiliating trip. Soon the boys came up to another room on the right hand side and Juice ordered them to stop.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'This must be Wesley's room.' Johnny thought to himself, having never been upstairs in his cousins house before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe always avoided his cousins and either played outside or stayed extremely close to the adults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't want to go upstairs and play with your cousins sweetie?\" His mother asked him. Johnny shook his head no in front of all of the adults, his parents and his cousin's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, he's a little shy is all.\" His mother told her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ok, my boys will be down any minute now anyway. We have a lot of their friends coming over for the party.\" Aunt Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many are you expecting?\" His mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh gosh!\" Aunt Lesley replied. \"Too many! My boys are really popular at school. It's going to be a mad house!\" She said. The adults laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Johnny's mother looked down at him. \"They're really popular so they must be doing<br>\r\nsomething right.\" She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you SURE you don't want to go tell Wesley happy birthday before all the other kids get here? You might not see him much after that.\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny shook his head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK sweetie.\" His mother replied, kissing his forehead. It made Johnny feel safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really love what you've done with the place. All this for a 10 year old's birthday! You've really put in a lot of work!\" Johnny's mother exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes..I just wish Ben could be here....\" Lesley replied, speaking about her husband. \"I feel like the boys don't really have a father figure because he's always away on business now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\" Johnny's dad said. \"I'm sure he feels the same way about missing his youngest's 10th birthday...\" his dad added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But none of this would be possible if he wasn't out on those business trips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, that's what I keep telling myself.\" Lesley said, losing her voice a bit on the word telling. \"But it's so hard for me to juggle the kids and work and the bills and everything else when I also have a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the sacrifice you're making for your family...\" Johnny's mother said. \"Think of how bright Wesley and Justin's futures are. You can pay for their college! Set up retirement accounts for them!\" She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLesley smiled a little bit. \"The only thing we think about is our children's future.\" She said, brightening up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Ben had his way they'd never have to work a day in their life.\" She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if he makes this deal overseas they might not have to....\" She added. \"But we don't want<br>\r\nthem to know it. We spoil them a little....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A little?' A young 14 year old Johnny thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm trying to make sure they're still good people.\" Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're succeeding.\" Johnny's mother told her. He wanted to throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Lesley said. \"I think they take some things for granted.\" Lesley said. \"I kind of wish..well I wish they would be more like Johnny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's ears perked up a lot. \"We all do.\" His preteen voice rang out-loud by mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother slapped him hard. \"Johnny!\" his mother cried at him. \"Get out of here, NOW.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny got up and went outside as his parents continued their talk with Aunt Lesley. Johnny began to respect her a lot more that day, and what she said about her own children crossed his mind while he was outside. Cars upon cars arrived for the event and Johnny watched parents and kids alike entering the house for his bratty 9 year old cousin's 10th birthday party. He couldn't believe the number of people showing up. He was pretty sure he didn't even know this many people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when something shocked him. He saw someone he did know, someone from his own class in fact! Who was riding up on a skateboard behind him on the sidewalk. The boy with the dyed blonde hair and black hat tilted backward quickly passed Johnny and he watched, amazed at how cool he looked when he stopped off in the distance in front of him, kicking up his skateboard into his hands and talking to a younger kid Johnny didn't know, but looked to be around Wesley's age.<br>\r\nThe two fist bumped and Johnny tried to get closer to hear ease-drop on them speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup Ty!?\" The blonde haired boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude sup Lloyd!? You here for Wes' party?!\" Tyler asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lloyd.' 14 year old Johnny thought, staring at the boy from behind and listening to their conversation while simultaneously trying to read his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt, no doubt.\" Llyod replied. \"I bet this party is gonna be lit.\"<br>\r\nTyler started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro whats up?\" Llyod asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're Lit, dude.\" Tyler said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Lloyd replied. \"I'm not fucking lit. Do I look high or something what are you talking about? I haven't smoked in....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah dude, there's some fag staring at you, he's been checking you out. You're fucking Lit for this faggot dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck are you?\" Lloyd turned around, staring now at Johnny who overheard their conversation and lit up like a Christmas tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Lloyd shouted. \"What the fuck are you looking at you freak!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler broke out into laughter. He was practically crying when he spoke \"Dude he was totally looking at you hah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLloyd got even more pissed off and Johnny turned away real quickly. \"DUDE! Fuck you! Go look at porn or something you thirsty ass homo! The FUCK!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLloyd kept yelling and yelling, and a lot of the kids outside were all staring at the commotion he was causing, which only made things worse for Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, GO AWAY you queer! Oh my GOD like can't I go ANYWHERE!?\" Llyod yelled at this point Tyler was cracking up with laughter. Tyler just repeated what Lloyd said while laughing his voice a higher pitch and inhaling as he spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CAN'T I GO ANYWHERE!? HAHAHHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude what's so fucking funny? How is this funny!?\" Lloyd asked and Tyler had tears in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you-you PFHHAHAHAHA!\" Tyler laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use your fucking words what the fuck Ty? What kind of friend are you?! You just let him check me out and shit? I saw you looking behind me the whole conversation. You saw him like 10 minutes ago and didn't say anything right away!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHA I'm so sorry Lit I mean LLOYD.\" Ty laughed. He then laughed some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get yourself together what the fuck man? You're embarrassing me in front of all these young ass tweens.\" Llyod said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just pfhfhaha do you have some gay cult following or something dude!? Like what the fuck was that bit about 'can't I go anywhere?!' Dudes checking you out everywhere or some shit!? OH my god hahahaha!\" Tyler started losing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude know what!? Oh my god. You're sooooo fucking Lit from now on!\" Tyler replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Lloyd responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, I'm calling you Lit from now on. You lit up that fags life dude pfffhahahahaha!\"<br>\r\nTyler laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call me that and you're DEAD. You hear me!? DEAD!\" Lloyd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Lit I didn't mean it!\" Ty bust out, starting to run inside while Lloyd chased him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny stayed outside the house, completely embarrassed. He was between his cousins house and the fence, too ashamed to enter. Afraid he would be called queer in front of everyone again if he was recognized. He didn't mean to stare at Lloyd like that, he just thought he looked so cool. He wished he had the courage to go explain that to him, but he didn't want to be seen by Lloyd ever again.<br>\r\nJohnny watched most of the party from outside through the window. He saw everyone else having a lot of fun and playing around. Wesley with a big smile opening up his gifts. Even his parents seemed to have forgotten about him as they sat inside speaking with Aunt Lesley and helping her with the party. Johnny put his hand up to the window and pressed his forehead against it, looking down at the ground. He saw some ants by his feet moving back and forth. That day he felt just as low as they did.</span></div></div>",

Wesley of course got a huge slice, at least 3 slices worth of cake because it was his celebration. He was chowing down on it like a madman. Johnny noticed there were only a few slices left and his stomach gurgled. He watched everyone eat real food and party for over an hour and he knew he had to get some kind of nutrition because his parents weren't going to make him anything tonight.<br>\r\nAs Johnny sucked up his fear and mustered the courage to enter, a conversation went on that he couldn't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the faggot was just STARING at you!?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler couldn't even keep a straight face. \"Yeah! He was just WATCHING him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude that's disturbing.\" Juice added, looking at his friend Lloyd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin we've been bros forever now, and on my LIFE I swear to you I turn around and this DUDE is just STARING at me.\" Llyod said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed, gasping. \"Hahahahah guys we HAVE to call him Lit now. He like Lit up that<br>\r\nqueer's eyes I swear to god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLloyd reached out to punch Tyler who braced himself for impact but Justin put a hand on his shoulder, stopping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro...we go way back and I gotta say...... you're the light of my life too, Lit.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLloyd looked at Justin all crooked eyed and crazy and everyone broke up into laughter, the loudest of which was Wesley's who had frosting smeared on parts of his face like a piglet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, Lit...\" Justin told him. \"Did you bring the uhm...your stash?\" He asked, trying to make it covert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah bro...lets hit it.\" Lloyd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler just laughed, pointing at Lloyd. \"Dude he totally accepted his new nickname just now! LIT! PFFHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLloyd looked back at him annoyed. \"Call me that again Tyler!\" Lloyd reached back with his fist and Tyler faked being scared, flinching and holding up his arms in defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLloyd and Justin walked off up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Wes, I gotta go see what they're up to man, it's killing me.\" Tyler said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine bro go for it!\" Wes said, fist bumping his friend. \"I have to stay down here for the party and what not.\" Wes said, acting like he played a bigger role in the celebrations than he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude for sure. See ya in a few.\" Ty said walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight around this time Johnny entered the house, making his way toward the cake. Aunt Lesley was already finished passing pieces out but there was just one final piece sitting on top of the table and several plates nearby.<br>\r\nJohnny picked up the piece of cake with a fork and knife, putting it on a plate in his hands.<br>\r\nHe saw Wesley walk up next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Johnny thanks for the cake.\" He said, snatching it out of Johnny's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you brat! That's my piece! You've had 3 pieces already!\" Johnny shouted, his body trembling from hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you my stalker? Have you been counting what I eat or something you freak?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn remain silent, he didn't have an answer to that question. He realized it was kind of creepy he watched what Wesley was eating.</span></div></div>",

Most of the party looked over with his loud voice bellowing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the kids and adults stopped and stared at the situation when Lesley and Mary Anne (Johnny's mom) walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Wesley?\" Aunt Lesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He stole my piece of cake!\" Wesley said, shouting and gripping his mother's thighs, stuffing his face into her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JOHNNY!\" His mother called out to him. \"What did YOU DO!?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but Mom-I didn'----\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! That kid peed his pants!\" some young boy yelled out, pointing at Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole room burst into laughter except for the adults and tears were staring to pour out of Johnny's eyes.<br>\r\nJohnny's mother took off her jacket and wrapped it around her sons waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give Wesley HIS piece of cake back!\" She demanded. \"AND THEN APOLOGIZE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley stepped out from his mother, standing near her for protection.<br>\r\nJohnny stare at Wesley with the fury of a thousand murderers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the cake back.\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you....\" Wesley said drying his fake tears with his sleeve and sniffling. \"for giving me back my cake.\" Wesley tried to put emphasis on the word my.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And!?\" Mary Anne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...I-I'm sorry....\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For?\" Mary Anne prodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For stealing it in the first place!\" Johnny added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Now I'm going to the car with your Aunt Lesley and I expect you to hug your cousin and make up for what you've done after we leave. You'll be in the car in no less than 1 minute, understand? You can stand here with your pissy pants in front of the rest of these children. I expect that will be punishment enough. Sorry about this, sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ok... I don't want Johnny to be embarrassed though. EVERYONE.\" Aunt Lesley called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to the party. Nothing to look at over here. DO something.\" She said as she started to walk away with her sister outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley who was wearing a big smirk right now, reached over for a fork. He cut into the cake and started eating it in front of Johnny who was looking like death from starvation.<br>\r\nHe took big bites, putting it all into his mouth and slamming it down fast. Johnny watched him chew quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you.\" Johnny said out-loud for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley stopped chewing and stuck his tongue out, revealing all the cake half chewed up and wet with his saliva. His teeth were yellow from the frosting and his tongue and gums were coated in black chocolate bits of cake. Bits of the cake were trapped between his bracers as well, causing a truly disgusting sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!\" Wesley hummed, mocking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's body reacted by violently shaking from anger but instead of punching Wesley and beating the shit out of him like wanted, Johnny turned to walk away.<br>\r\nWesley quickly gulped down the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Johnny.\" Wesley said, Johnny turned around to look at him. \"Didn't your MOMMY say you're supposed to hug me?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny sighed, feeling defeated by today. He just stare at Wesley with a big fuck you written all over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't want to?\" Wesley asked. \"That's ok. I still love you, cuz. Tell you what....I'll give you a slice of cake, ok?\" Wesley told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn pure instinct and hunger Johnny looked over toward the table and back at Wesley who followed his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH shit that's right there is none. But that's ok.... this is what I can do... If you REALLY want a piece of cake, I'll take the leftovers from your cake slice and leave it in the toilet so you can help yourself to it tomorrow, ok?\" He grinned at his cousin. \"Or you can feel free to pick up a spoon and eat it straight from my ass.\" Wesley said, turning his butt toward Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way don't hesitate to come get your piece.\" He said, putting a hand on his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny just walked away, choosing to avoid the fight instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can be my GUEST!\" Wesley shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look it's pissy pants!\" Some of the children in the crowd would say as he passed by, finally making his way outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the party Wesley went up into the room to join his older brother and their friends. When he entered the room Tyler was coughing and aired some smoke away from his mouth, and all the boys seemed like they were hiding something. Wesley just shrugged it off, walking over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My cousin is so fucking annoying.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny?\" Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he tried to eat MY piece of cake. I was looking at that cake for like 5 whole minutes<br>\r\nbefore I decided to go up to grab it. He tries to grab it and says its his. I snatched it out of his hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck him.\" Justin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right?\" Wesley said. \"I told him if he really wanted it he could have it back later along with the other pieces of cake I ate.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler started laughing his ass off, high as a kite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude how fucked up would it be....\" he said with his eyes red as blood \"if you like fed him a cake, you know... with like....ummmmmm....\" Tyler lost his train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Wesley asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give him a minute.\" Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you like fed him a cake....that had like.....ummmm your shit mixed in it or whatever?\" Tyler asked, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLloyd looked over with a disgusted face. \"Dude that's fucking sick. You have some real issues man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley started thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His 15th birthday party IS coming up soon...\" Wesley said, interrupted by his brother's stark laughter. Wesley stared at Justin, completely unused to hearing him laugh like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you're THINKING about this, Wes?!\" Lloyd asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well duh Lit, of course I am.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room broke out into laughter except for Lloyd. \"HE called you LIT!\" Tyler added, taking great joy that his nickname was catching on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah whatever. You fucker. You're lucky I feel so chill right now or I'd kick your ass.\" Lit said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmmm sure you would.\" Ty said, getting up. Lit tried to snatch him but Tyler leaped out of the way. \"I gotta go guys this was fun. I need to go see where my brother Riley went.\"</span></div></div>",

He couldn't be more pissed off. This room was just as big as Justin's but it was decorated slightly different. It looked like a room that would be fit for a younger boy but the things that were littered all over the room were stunning to Johnny. Action figures, a fidget spinner or two, toy cars, legos.... all of it was scattered on the carpet yes carpet. As Johnny's body crawled onto the carpet, he realized the carpet itself was memory foam supported and would feel a hell of a lot better than Justin's room if hard food crumbs weren't littered everywhere and poking against the skin of his hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" Ricky yelped as a Lego pressed its way against the flesh of his knee caps, giving him a temporary scar when the boys just kicked him along like an annoying animal blocking their path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Ricky noticed was the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.....\" Ricky said out-loud looking over toward Wesley's bed. \"Cool right!?\" Wesley said, jumping into it and bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a king sized double decker bunk bed. King. Sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's memory foam, like the floor!\" Wesley bragged. \"And in winter, the floor can be heated too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky's mouth dropped and Johnny just stare at the brat who bounced playfully on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what you meant when you said sleepover.\" Ricky said, reminding Johnny of their prior conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt so pissed now, fully understanding what that actually meant. Wesley didn't mean that his brother slept over in his bed, or on the floor or anything. He meant he slept over in the bunk bed. It's like the one thing Johnny could make fun of Juice for was taken away from him before his very eyes.<br>\r\nJohnny looked around some more, seeing posters here and there but of nothing in particular just race cars and video games like mario brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the mess Juice....\" Wesley said. \"Mildred hasn't cleaned my room in awhile....\" he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old bat.\" Juice said. \"Probably mom telling her not to. She probably wants you to do it to learn a lesson or some shit.\" Juice admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did John say to you guys?\" Ricky brought up and Juice combed his hands through his hair in stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if you keep asking questions we're going to silence you.\" Wesley told him. \"Like toilet boy.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence? What do you mea---sorry...\" Ricky said, realizing that was another question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, I'll answer Wes.... You see, he promised us if we let him stay this size, and we keep you small, he would let us have control over his body.\" Juice said, sitting the stone down on the desk nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PPFFTT hahaha yeah, he basically sold us his soul.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like we're the devil!\" Wesley put his two index fingers on the top of his forehead to represent horns and stuck his tongue out. \"BLEHHHHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Why would he do that?! What do you mean!?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhhhhh.....\" Juice started, clearly making this part all up on the fly \"yeah, he gave us full control of his body with one promise attached, that every so often he gets you.\" Juice finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know, he wants you small sometimes, sometimes normal sized. Sometimes he wants to fuck you sometimes other things...\" Juice continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you let him think he can do that!? You have to tell him no!\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, he had great reasoning. Think about it like this, you both were friends and both of you are missing right now. The cops are looking for both of you and think you ran away together. If we bring him back and have him explain to the cops that didn't happen, not only do we get people off our tails looking for you, but we get to have HIM all to ourselves because we're his ONLY relatives. He HAS to live with us, now...only this time we can do whatever we want with him!\" Juice said. \"The plan is full proof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have an annoying bitch cuz, and he gets to touch you inappropriately from time to<br>\r\ntime! Everybody wins!\" Juice said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T!\" Ricky shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ricky, calm down ok?\" Wesley said with a blubbering voice one uses on a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I CAN'T CALM DOWN! KEEP ME AT THIS HEIGHT AND USE ME, FUCK HIM! KILL HIM!\" Ricky shouted. \"I'M ALREADY PROMISED TO YOU GUYS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Juice said. \"We can't do that, see it doesn't make sense.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How doesn't it!?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're not related to us and mom would be weirded out if you were randomly living with us all a sudden. We can't keep you big.\" Juice explained.<br>\r\n\"THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE HAS TO BE BIG!\" Ricky shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but Ricky...\" Juice said. \"We made a deal with him already. You know we keep our promises....\" Juice said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I.....\" Ricky was still on all fours, stark naked; just a few minutes ago a completely willing cocksleeve for a teenager he had never met before, but hated immediately. \"I do know. First hand.\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, and we have to get the cops away, like we said.\" Wesley added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...makes sense..\" Ricky told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't worry.\" Wesley said. \"You're still promised to us, like you said, so we'll still use<br>\r\nyou whenever we want to.\" Wesley told him with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Juice said. \"And who knows what kind of deals we can make in the future. Maybe one where we let you go.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would we lie to you?\" Juice asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I guess not.\" Ricky replied. Both Juice and Wesley smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we wouldn't!\" Juice said to him. \"But you need to put some pants on or something I'm sick of looking at your....\" Juice gagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH hey! I have a pair of superman boxers under my bed! Grab those and put them on!\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky looked under the bed, reaching around and grabbing the pair of superman underwear he saw there. They were several sizes too small and drenched.<br>\r\nJustin looked at the underwear then back to his brother then back to the underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were gross and used...\" Wesley shrugged. \"I think they have like stains and stuff in them...I don't know I just thought I could use it as...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice looked back at the underwear with a huge grin on his face and he started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a cum rag!?\" he asked. \"More of a spider-man fan aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha yeah, superman is overrated. He can suck my farts.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like he did...\" Juice said, looking at the underwear Ricky held up that had a huge<br>\r\nbrown spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Wesley said. \"Put them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can't fit there's no way.\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley shot back up sitting up straight and looked down to the floor. He grabbed one of his shoes laying around and picked it up, grabbing Ricky by the hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put it on fag.\" He said, pushing the sole of the dirty shoe into Ricky's face and grinding it harshly against his skin like a cheese grater. \"Put it on. Put. it. on.\" Wesley repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinded by the shoe pushing into his face harder and harder with each passing second Ricky reached back, trying to pull the boxers up to cover his genitals which were flashing everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't look like it will fit Wes.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It WILL fit. Make it fit, John.\" Wesley ordered, still pushing the shoe into Ricky's face as he knelt down on his knees in front of the younger brat, not even trying to defend himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny stood straight up, pulling on the disgusting slimy underwear with all his might until he felt it move inch by inch up Ricky's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WEDGIE!\" Wesley cried out with laughter, pulling the shoe back and laughing at Ricky's tread imprinted face.<br>\r\n\"That's a lot better.\" Juice admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks for the clothes...guys....\" Ricky said feeling Wesley's slimy wet cum studded boxer shorts squeeze his waist and press against his vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever slave boy.\" Wesley said looking down at his hand HAAAAAAAAACKKKKKK PTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spit a huge wad of snot and saliva into his palm and started rubbing it against Ricky's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you start sucking my farts now that superman is busy?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's right! So, Ricky... remember earlier we were talking about getting our asses sucked?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah..\" Ricky replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready..................... to SUCK? SOME? ASS?!\" Wesley asked with a really loud booming voice like an announcer at a game show or sporting event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky didn't get a chance to answer because Wesley started talking.</span></div></div>",

This kind of thing is what I call the bitch switch, by the way.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where we switch bitches? That's awesome!\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Juice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You boys want to line yourselves up next to the bed?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn immediately did what he was told, being completely compliant due to his lack of choice. Ricky also did what he was told but he was trembling with fear and felt horrible.<br>\r\nJuice got off the bed, walked over and stepped in front of Ricky who was knelt down in front of his ass cheeks. Turning his head back toward Ricky he asked with puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mind sucking the ass of the boy who saved your life do you?\" And then he followed it by 4 consecutive blinks like a cartoon character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no. Not for you, Juice.\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not going to be fun.\" Juice said with an unhappy face. \"...for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you saved me from...whatever it was that knocked me out earlier! I owe you my life!\" Ricky replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you do!\" Juice replied. \"A debt you'll be paying off for a very long time, ass face.\"<br>\r\nRicky faked a smile up at Juice, who smiled back down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reality was that Ricky didn't want to do this, but he could see no other option. He had grown fond of these two boys and he loved them, and he knew deep down that they mostly were helping him, even though that wasn't the truth, it was HIS truth. Wesley got up, facing his ass toward Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lets get started I suppose.\" Juice said nonchalantly, pulling his shirt off and throwing it to the floor. He also pants down, revealing his tight youthful ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want him to kiss it first.\" Wesley told Juice as he bent his pimple and mole covered dirty ass in front of Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool dude, it's called foreplay. It's something you want to happen BEFORE the actual act. That's totally fine. It's usually what girls want, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it weird I want foreplay?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck no, that's your right as a man. I'm not going to judge you. It's just when women want it that it's annoying. You're a man, take what you want.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So cool! I'm so glad I'm not a woman.\" Wesley said, looking over at Ricky. \"Or gay.\" He said, looking back specifically at Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, little bro.\" Juice said fist bumping with his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's body reacted to Wesley's will and started kissing his ass first like he wanted. The sight was simply unbelievable to Juice, who watched completely fascinated as his older cousin kissed his younger brother's bare ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick my left mole.\" Wesley demanded.<br>\r\nJuice stare seeing a profile view of his annoying as shit older cousin sticking his tongue out onto Wesley's left ass check, rubbing it against his mole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suck on it, Johnny. Suck on his mole!\" Juice added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good call, bro.\" Wesley said, happy with his brother's choice.<br>\r\nJuice looked back, tapping Ricky on the head and causing his gaze to look up and lock onto his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get started too, hmm?\" Juice said expectantly. \u201cYou can show me why we call you butt<br>\r\nlick Rick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky looked forward toward Juice's jungle of an ass, his head pressed against the edge of the mattress just like Juice would have wanted it. He had grown pubic hair littered with very small wads of toilet paper rolled up into a ball which consisted of his ass crack. Just the sight of this made Ricky cringe. Then he looked over just slightly and saw a tattoo on Juice's ass. It was a christian cross upside down on his ass cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can't.\" Ricky said out-loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley snorted, bringing his naked ass against his slave's face with no issue what-so-ever. Juice watched, jealous of his brother and his obedient asswipe's face sinking between his cheeks while he was stuck here dealing with.... \"Don't be such a pussy.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ricky asked, tears growing in his eyes. \"You're so mean to me, Juice. I thought we were friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not friends. We were never friends.\" Juice said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but I think you guys are so c-cool and---\" Ricky was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ARE cool, especially compared to you.\" Juice added. \"Because you're a giant pussy, apparently. Who can't suck my ass. Just like all those girls I've fucked. What a disappointment.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I but I can't! I'm not a girl for you to fuck either! I just want to go home!\" Ricky cried out. \"Please let me go home?! I can't put my face in there. I just CAN'T!\" Ricky repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks so gross and W-Wesley's was.....\" Ricky shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Wesley shouted. \"What are you saying about MY ass crack?!\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's PERFECTLY fine, ok?\" He faked annoyance. \"The only person who can say bad things about it<br>\r\nis ME, get it?!\" Wesley added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey John, my ass crack is really gross actually, while you've got your head up my ass can you start licking? Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh thanks!\" Wesley said pleasurably as John's unwilling tongue lapped around his youngest cousin's crack like a child's tongue that was trying to get to the center of a tootsiepop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice reached into his pocket for something, his pants sagging down juusst far enough for Ricky to see his full ass, but just high enough for him to retrieve something. He pulled it out and turned around quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look here, you pussy ass pipsqueak.\" Juice commanded, his voice not loud but very demanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spoke to the grown young man as though he were still 4 inches tall, but in reality he was taller than Juice was. Juice brought his hand around which held his lighter and brought it underneath Ricky's chin who was gulping as tears streamed down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like your pretty face?\" Juice asked him. A few seconds of silence went by as Ricky was too afraid to open his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked if you like your pretty face.\" Juice repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Ricky shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, because if you don't get your pretty face up my ass and start showing me a good time, I'm going to ruin your pretty face again, just like I did earlier. Get it?\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky only nodded slowly, trying not to trigger the lighter which was far too small to harm him, but was traumatic enough to elicit the fear Juice needed for compliance. In no time flat the dark haired teenage boy took charge of the older teen and showed him who was boss.<br>\r\nJuice removed the lighter from under Ricky's chin and Ricky inhaled air like it was his first time getting a breath all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Juice! I-i-this won't happen again I promise! Please don't hate me.\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, it's a little too late for that.\" Juice replied, turning back around and stuffing the lighter back into his pocket. Ricky's eyes followed it and his stress decreased 10 fold seeing it put away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ONLY way you can make it up to me...\" Juice began, bringing two hands back to his ass cheeks as he bent over in front of Ricky's face \"is through service....\" he finished, opening his ass crack up wide and revealing a swampy forest of hairs and toilet paper sticking out in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center of which was a giant pink pucker making a kissy face at Ricky.<br>\r\nRicky leaned forward, kissing Juice's filthy ass by puckering his lips together like the anus he was staring at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna start licking?\" Juice asked, patiently waiting for some real action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky took his tongue and ran it up and down Justin's left and right bubble butt ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean lick the good part, you know?\" Juice asked, opening his ass again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man I hate when you can't get good service.\" Wesley said, looking over at his brother and his slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice looked over at Wesley who had John compelled; he was fiercely kissing, licking and sucking Wesley's ass with constant movement. His head would bob into and out of Wesley's dirty ass crack, and he ran his tongue up and down his ass crack kissing it. Juice watched as he pulled out to suck Wesley's ass cheeks right where he had a pimple. It was like the most passionate display Justin ever saw in his life. Wesley just looked at his bro and shrugged.</span></div></div>",

Tongue out.\" Wesley said, and John leaned his head back on to the mattress sticking his tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley moved back, putting his fat ass above John's vision and sat down on his face. Then he lifted it back up and sat back down. Then again, then again and again. Juice watched as Wesley aimed his ass crack to where Johnny's tongue would be pressed forcefully against it every time he brought his ass down on top of his face. Juice watched Wesley jump as high into the air as he could and bring his ass crashing down on John's face which was growing red from both the embarrassment and the pain of Wesley's full body weight plopping down on him every time. Juice saw Wesley do that one more time, but this time smirking as he wiggled his ass back and forth onto John's tongue that was still sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile he was still waiting for his ass to get licked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick it already!\" Juice shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky forced himself to press his tongue into the brats ass crack and bring it from the bottom to the top, brushing up against dingleberries, pubic hairs, toilet paper balls and god knows what else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice squirmed in pleasure. \"Damn that does feel good Wesley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't even started bro, here watch this.\" Wesley said. \"On the bed, face up, head near my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's body followed orders, getting straight up and turning at a 180 degree angle so he was facing the exact opposite way. His whole body was on the mattress now, his head facing Wesley's ass crack. Wesley slapped his ass in just in front of Johnny's face, his cheeks jiggling. Then he opened his ass crack up and sat comfortably down on Johnny's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suck it.\" Wesley said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnorting with laughter as he felt his slaves lips pulling on his asshole with wet spurts. Wesley reached up, grabbing the bars that held the bed above and pushed against them, bringing even more weight down upon Johnny's face, who was crying as it seemed like he was getting crushed like a grape underneath the teens sweaty swamp ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh dude it feels sooo good.\" Wesley said, pushing on the bars then letting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing then letting up. Finally pushing again and then wiggling his ass back and forth all over Johnny's<br>\r\nface who felt one cheek slide into the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice looked back at his slave and grabbed him, throwing his head on the mattress and bringing his ass down on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just lick my crack dude.\" Juice said with disappointment, his first ass suck not turning out like he wanted it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can suck it off later.\" Juice pulled out his cell phone looking at facebook while he had Ricky, an older teen who he just met not too long ago, lick his crack clean of all the dingleberries he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley reached up again, grabbing the bars but this time pulling, lifting his ass off of Johnny's face who looked up expectantly. He watched Wesley bring his legs up to the bars far overhead, his whole body holding on like a kid at the jungle gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bunnnnnnnnzaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!' Wesley shouted, dropping his ass down square onto Johnny's face from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny gasped for air as Wesley's whole body fell on his stomach and balls, and he was met with the air from Wesley's ass crack all earthen and gross. Wesley laughed, having the time of his life and his legs went straight up into the air, his ass out in the open for the whole world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffthahaha this is the BEST!\" Wesley said as John's face instinctively lifted his neck up and crammed his mouth against Wesley's asshole, sucking it clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's body brought both of his hands against Wesley's hips as his tongue lunged into the boys asshole causing him to jump with exhilaration. Wesley leaned up a bit, putting the weight of his back onto Johnny's balls and crushing them as he reached out and grabbed Johnny's hair, pulling him further into his ass crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REALLY get in there and suck!\" Wesley said. \"That's it. SUCK it. Suck it.\" Wesley repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words stinging John's ears as he did just that, vigorously sucking Wesley's asshole with the intensity of a lover sucking face with their mate on a honeymoon. Wesley brought his legs back down and his ass with it harshly pushing Johnny's head back into the memory foam mattress. His asshole rested on Johnny's neck now. Wesley reached back, grabbing Johnny's feet and pushing against them, sliding his body slowly further up, his ass crack glazing over Johnny's face until he was where he wanted to be, his asshole directly on top of Johnny's mouth. Johnny<br>\r\nfelt Wesley's drooping balls comfortably rest themselves atop his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep sucking it cuz.\" Wesley smiled when he felt Johnny's lips wrap themselves back into position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe comfortably brought his arms behind his head, crossing them in a relaxed manner like someone who is taking a rest.</span></div></div>",

Can you smell them?\" He asked his ass lurched back into the air ever so slightly as his asshole opened up, still attached to Johnny's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hot gust of wind blew directly down Johnny's throat who immediately gagged on the taste of his younger cousins dry heated fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\" He cooed in pleasure, hands still behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what it's like to have a fart sucked out of your ass.\" Wesley said out-loud. \"And you're the PERFECT person to do it, haha!\" He added with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I think we need to REALLY enjoy it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought his hands down toward his ass, and opened up his cheeks again, sliding Johnny's face further up his crack as gravity pulled his ass down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was stuffed as far into Wesley's ass crack as he could be, with nearly no light whatsoever and sucking on his asshole that just farted in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice looked over at his brother, who was enjoying this far more than he was. He put his phone down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you fart again?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can basically fart on command. Why?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give him a dutch oven.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dutch oven. It's where you fart in someones face with the blankets pulled over you so they can't get any air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley immediately started laughing. \"OH MY GOD YOU'RE A GENIUS!\" He reached back to the corner of the bed and pulled the comforter over his whole body looking like a comfortable blonde haired burrito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny tried his best to fight for control of his body so he could lurch up and wring Justin\u2019s neck but Wesley\u2019s plump soft ass smacked into his face while he was imagining the satisfaction of murdering his young cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley looked down with a toothy grin, sporting his filthy braces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on there isn't going to be a fart of mine you DON'T inhale, fuck face.\" Wesley said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny wanted to prove him wrong, prove that there would indeed be a time he would be free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I won\u2019t inhale a fart from you EVER AGAIN!\u2019 He shouted in his mind. Envisioning his revenge as one of pain and torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPFFFFRRRRRTTTTTTTTTT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley put pressure on his stomach and unleashed hell onto Johnny\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuck my asshole, suck suck my asshole!\u201d Wesley said, feeling Johnny\u2019s mouth wrap around his pucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUng!\u201d Wesley grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPFFFRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTTT<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit dude!\u201d Juice said, waving a hand in front of his face and pinching his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the FUCK was that?! I can smell it through the blanket.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was John\u2019s dinner. Hahahahaha!!\u201d Wesley laughed, comfortably rubbing his ass against<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny\u2019s face and feeling his open wet lips grace different parts of his unkempt ass crack as he gyrated his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck! This is unbearable!\u201d Juice commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh calm down. Half of it went down his throat.\u201d Wesley said, acting like it was no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal...\u201d he even added. Poor Johnny was losing consciousness below, his lips sealed tight against Wesley\u2019s asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was completely unable to find air while being trapped prisoner under his youngest cousins ass between the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the understatement of the CENTURY Wes!\u201d Juice said. \u201cLook!\u201d He pointed to Ricky \u201ceven my ass licker is grossed out by your fart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha I can\u2019t help it! You have to give it your all at the John, you know?\u201d Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould it help if we moved away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! No! I\u2019m not fucking sure! Try it though. Damn! I almost feel sorry for him.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley looked at Juice completely gobsmacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! No way.\u201d Wesley said having never heard his brother utter those words before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo just go!\u201d Juice said with a pinched nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok! Hey fuckface, get your head between the mattress and that ladder.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not done having fun just yet.\" John put his head where he was told to, but it was just barely able to fit under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold pangs of the steel bar from the bunk bed ladder pressed roughly against his neck weren't very soothing; but neither was the sight above him. He watched Wesley climb up to the top of the ladder facing backwards, looking down at him with a smile that partially revealed his braces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' Johnny screamed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BANZAIIIII DROP!!!!!!!\" Wesley shouted, dropping down naked ass first onto Johnny's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone heard the impact Wesley's ass made when it fell straight down onto Johnny's head, but only Johnny could feel it. The cold metal bar that was already squeezing his neck almost snapped it as the full weight of Wesley's body fell atop him in the smelliest, most humiliating way possible.<br>\r\nWesley ignored the pain Johnny was going through, the thought not even crossing his mind. Instead he rubbed his ass into Johnny's face left and right back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having an ass slave is really fun!\" Wesley said, shaking his ass even more in Johnny's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm enjoying myself too.\" Juice admitted, feeling Ricky's tongue lunge itself in and out of his ass crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuhhhh I told you you would, nerd.\u201d Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Did you just call me a nerd?\u201d Juice said playfully. He felt so proud he was bonding with his younger brother again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t ya hearrrd?\u201d Wesley asked. \u201cNerd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dare you sir!\u201d Emo Juice said, continuing this silly role play and finding some enjoyment in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I literally wipe my ass with nerds.\u201d He bragged, getting up slightly and looking back at Ricky\u2019s face with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley looked over and saw Ricky\u2019s ragged looks and started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that a fact?!\u201d He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs a matter of fact it is!\u201d Juice said, continuing the play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny wanted to slice his ears off at this point. Ricky hated everything he was doing but disguised it with his condition and essentially shrugged it off thinking about how glad he was the two brothers were so close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cand I don\u2019t appreciate you coming around THESE parts comparing me to a mere asswipe such as they! I loathe the idea...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley started laughing hard, not believing how cool his older brother is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNay...I fart on it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPFFFFFFRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice unleashed some inner gas that soaked into Ricky\u2019s face like a bowl of rice soaks up a stick of butter.<br>\r\nThe foul hot wind encompassed his whole face engulfing it in Justin\u2019s ass fumes.<br>\r\nRicky tried thrashing but was met with a swift kick in the nads which caused his mouth to open up and gasp the fart in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saved your life. The least you could do is kiss my ass when it gives you a gift.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky forced himself back into kissing Juice\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How great is this!?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not gonna lie pretty fucking great. It sounded really gay at first but I have no regrets.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome!\u201d Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey toilet boy, I'm grateful you HAVE a friend. It seemed to work out really well that you invited Ricky over for your birthday.\" Juice said trying to strike a nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It was almost like this was MEANT to happen, you know!?\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PFff. Closest I've ever come to believing in a higher power.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, but don't you believe in Satan or whatever?\" Wesley asked. \"All the upside down crosses you have? And the horrible \"music\" you listen to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Metal is the BEST bro we'll have to get you listening to some but nah I'm an atheist through and through. But if it WAS Satan that gave us dominion over these two I just want to say 'thanks man you're the coolest.'\" Juice beat his chest twice with a fist and popped a peace sign in the air as a sign of respect for whatever entity, if any, gave them control over their cousin and his friend so they could be ass wipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the boys heard a loud noise. \"Oh shit...\" Juice said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Boys I'm home!\" A familiar voice called out from somewhere downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT!\" Juice said, getting up quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap what do we do!?\" Wesley asked standing up and freeing Johnny from the humiliation of his ass. Wesley pulled his pants up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice walked hastily over to the stone while at the same time pulling up his pants as well; knowing his mother would be coming soon. She crept silently on their memory foam carpet and no one knew how close she was to the room, but Johnny was praying she'd be in immediately. Juice hastily bent over and grabbed the first shirt he saw on the floor, just a regular blue T-shirt. He threw it on and turned to the desk nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice touched the stone \"I wish Ricky was small again! Uummmmmmmm....\" Juice seemed to be at a loss for ideas and Johnny could feel a smile forming on his face. \"hidden in my pants!\" Juice added....\"ummmmm.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice felt the figure of a small young man take shape in the front of his pants, pressed up against his dick. \"NO! IN THE BACK YOU STUPID STONE THE BACKSIDE!\" He felt the figure disappear and reappear stuffed in the back of his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish...the smell in the room went away!\" Juice said, looking over toward his brother Wesley who stunk the place up with his farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys... are you in here?!\" Everyone heard Aunt Lesley open a door two doors down. 'She's in Juice's room!' Johnny thought to himself. 'IT'S TOO LATE TO HIDE ME NOW!!!!!!! YOU'RE GOING TO<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGET CAUGHT YOU FUCKERS!!!!!!!!!!' Johnny screamed in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick! Get your head out from under that ladder!\" Juice ordered. Johnny's body sat up straight on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys?...are you both in here?\" The voice called out from behind the door. She opened it and caught a glimpse of Juice standing near the desk. \"Justin? Sweetie, you're never in here...\" She stepped into the room and started talking some more \"are you and Wes........\" her voice was cut off as she caught a glimpse of Johnny on the bed. Tears started forming in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny!?\" Her voice gasped, and she ran over to stand in front of him, reaching out to hug and kiss him. \"Oh thank god!\" She exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley just looked at Juice with a confused face and Juice was looking back at him with a concerned one.<br>\r\nWesley didn't understand why his mother was so happy to see Johnny, but Juice was only thinking about the smell of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god you're not hurt.\" Lesley said, kissing Johnny's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half-smirk crossed Juice's face when he realized his wish worked perfectly. He quickly itched his ass out of his mother's sight which was tingling because of some movement back there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you didn't want to be with us...\" She said, tears rolling down her face. \"You know I would never let anything bad happen to you, right?\" She asked clutching Johnny's face like he was her long lost child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears started to form in his eyes too. This was the first time he felt safe since coming here.<br>\r\nShe let go of her hug to him. \"Where were you? Where did you go!?\" She asked but Johnny couldn't respond on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was at a friends house mom.\" Juice quickly answered. \"After he heard the news he...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you not want to live with us?!\" Lesley grabbed him again, hugging once more. \"Oh you poor child. I am so sorry. I am so so very sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny started to cry now, his tears streaming down his face. This was the first time anyone showed him some sympathy. Even his best friend Ricky didn't show any earlier, he was too concerned about the pictures that were obviously a lie from the stone.<br>\r\nHe wanted so badly to tell his Aunt how much he loved her. He truly did. He never felt bad about her or her presence whenever he went to visit his cousins or when they came to visit.<br>\r\nLesley started crying again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was my sister too...\" She hugged him one last time before letting go again. \"and he was an amazing man. He must have been a perfect father for you.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He isn't speaking much, mom...\" Juice fibbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's probably in shock of all what's happened. His whole WORLD has changed. What have you boys been doing!? Why didn't you call me RIGHT away when you saw him!?\" She said, a bit of frustration boiling up in her tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny inwardly smiled. 'Gotcha, you fuckers.' He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry mom we didn't want to bother you...\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is only Justin replying to my questions? You boys always do this whenever you're up to something. Why are you silent Wesley?\" Lesley asked, calling them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Johnny was crying because of sympathy just a moment ago some of the tears coming out were of joy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry mom I just didn't want to get into trouble for not calling you...\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Wesley. What have you boys been up to?\" Lesley asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny almost lept for joy if he could control his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm..not much really. Just playing.\" Wesley said, coming up with that on the fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's unusual for Justin to be in your room.\" She said. \"Why is he in your room right now? I thought he was too 'swagger' to hang out with his younger brother.\" She used her hands in a quoting gesture on the word swagger and heard Justin sigh. \"Or whatever it is you kids say these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just giving Johnny a tour mom, and then we came to my room to show him what was in here and to play.\" Wesley said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tour? He's been here before.\" She said. Wesley had a look of complete dismay. For some reason it slipped his mind that his cousin came to their house several times. He honestly had never paid too much attention to when Johnny visited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How is he not sweating bullets!?' Johnny gleamed in his mind. He was so thrilled with this line of questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice started wracking his brain over all the past visits with Johnny and something came across his mind that almost made him jump out of his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...but he's never been to our rooms before.\" Juice added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny felt a pang of despair hit him square in his chest and tingle all over his body. His emotions went from happy to upset all at once. He started thinking back and immediately remembered that on every visit to his cousins house he always tried to avoid them. He NEVER ONCE came into their rooms or went upstairs to see them. He always stayed downstairs with the adults. He even remembered a time when his parents took a tour of the house, going upstairs but he remained downstairs.<br>\r\nJohnny turned as white as paper upon his realization. Not going into his cousins room when he had the free will to do so was FUCKING him right now. His own choice to not visit them or at least take a tour of the house in the past all those years ago and this whole time was causing everything to crumble around him. His freedom from the cruel grip of these teens was now no longer in sight at all, it was miles, no, light-years away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How the fuck did he remember that on the fly!?' Johnny thought to himself. 'I BARELY EVEN REMEMBER!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm I guess you're right.\" Lesley said thinking it over. \"You've always been a shy boy.\" She said, pinching his cheeks like he was still a little kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm really glad I came home from work early for this!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you come home early?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just to check up on my two swagger boys.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley nearly spit. \"That's not how you use that word mom.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh whatever. Swagger, chill. Blah blah. Your mom was pretty groovy back in the day herself you know.\" She said embarrassing the two boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny would smile if he could. He actually saw Wesley turn a shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommmm....\" Wesley said, trying to get her to cut it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok...SORRY.\" She said putting her hands up defensively. \"I didn't mean to make you boys look uncool to your cousin Johnny. I'm sure you've all been having a lot of fun..\" She quickly glanced over to Johnny who had been silent all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope they've been making you feel real welcome.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have.\" Wesley said holding back a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we've tried to make sure he ...got wind of how things worked around here.\" Juice said with a half-smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley almost lost it.Something else popped into Juice's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just trying to make sure he knows he can always find himself a seat when he's with us,\" Juice continued.... Wesley held a hand up to his mouth and faked a yawn but he was really hiding a smile. \"and we're really trying to make him feel at home because his life sucks so much ass right now.\" He couldn't help himself from spitting out that last bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUSTIN!\" Lesley shouted. \"Language!\" She reminded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes mom, sorry.\u201d Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it funny when your brother gets in trouble?\u201d Lesley asked. \u201cYou always laugh when that happens. You two are such little scamps. I'm really glad you boys have been showing your cousin how welcoming our house can be. How about all you boys come downstairs and we sit and talk for awhile.\"</span></div></div>",

She knew exactly how to manipulate him. Wesley had always been a food junkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you haven't been eating too much junk today, Wesley.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't!\" Wesley promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be honest with me. What have you eaten today? Remember, I can just look at what we have and know if you're lying or not.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm...some ritz crackers with slices of cheese...ummm I made a sandwich with that deli meat you had. I ate some HoHos and twinkies earlier...oh I also had some cereal for breakfast and...\" Wesley continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you SURE you're hungry?\" She asked, interrupting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Wesley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You scare me...\" She said. \"I have NO idea how you can eat all of that. Your stomach is like a bottomless pit.\u201d Lesley looked at Johnny \u201cDon\u2019t you hate people who can eat all that and gain no weight at all. I know you understand Johnny, you\u2019ve lost a LOT of weight since you were little. Him and I look at a HoHo and gain 3 pounds.\u201d She said, referring to Johnny. She looked back at Wesley \u201cYou're just a monster. You definitely get that from your father.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Well enough banter I guess. I'm going to go downstairs and take a look at our options..I'm not sure what's open right now, it's pretty late. Why don't you boys meet me down there ok?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mom.\" the boys said in unison with Johnny remaining quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped out of the room and Juice gave it a couple of seconds before he peaked out of the door and made sure she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we gonna do?\u201d Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Juice replied. \u201cThis worked out great. We wanted to keep John here around this size right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah I just thought we would grow him back when we wanted him.\u201d Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Did you even listen to our conversation earlier? Where WERE you? We talked about how we would tell her that we found him or he came back or something. .... this was our plan....? You remember right?\u201d Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh umm yeah.\u201d Wesley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice sighed. \u201cSo he could be your toilet during call of duty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley snorted, the conversation coming back to him now. \u201cAnd blowjobs on command!\u201d He said gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right. Just make sure you clean his mouth more often than you clean yours...\u201d juice reminded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Rude.\u201d Wesley said. \u201cWhat about the whole not speaking thing. He can\u2019t stay like this forever!\u201d Wesley added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I have an idea for that.\u201d Juice said, and Johnny felt the blood drain from his face.<br>\r\nJuice walked in front of Johnny and snapped his fingers in front of his face. \u201cHey dipshit. Congradulations. You now have LIMITED free will. You can do ANYTHING except disobey us, run away, or tell anyone what we\u2019re doing to you directly or indirectly. Get it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny nodded. He felt his control of his mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re basically playing the part of our poor cousin who lost his parents from now on. You can be yourself as long as it doesn\u2019t give anything away or go against what we want you to do.\u201d Juice further specified. \u201cCan you speak you retard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and fuck you!\u201d Johnny said. He felt so relieved he could speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to fuck you again?\u201d Juice asked. \u201cI can get my dick up for round two later, cocksleeve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh baby.\u201d Wesley mocked. \u201cHow about you can\u2019t talk badly about us to anyone else either.\u201d Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate you both.\u201d Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Suck another fart out of my ass, butt boy.\u201d Wesley said. Johnny\u2019s body started inching its way toward Wesley ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo not literally dumbass.\u201d Wesley clarified pushing his face away. Juice snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in the clear. Let\u2019s get downstairs.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Ricky?\u201d Johnny reminded them, actually concerned for his friends well being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Wesley asked. Then he remembered, snickering. \u201cOh right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like him right where he is.\u201d Juice said, just now fully remembering his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought his hand around to scratch his ass one more time, slipping it inside his boxer shorts that were sticking out and moving it around. Ricky was still struggling, moving around fighting for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get going.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell Yeah I\u2019m starving!\u201d Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBottomless pit.\u201d Juice repeated from what his mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled a big grin looking over at Johnny \u201cI\u2019m not bottomless. Tell him, John. You\u2019ve experienced my bottom up close.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfffft and your pit.\u201d Juice said as the boys worked their way downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley laughed but Johnny started talking against his will, his body taking Wesley\u2019s command seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe does have a bottom, Juice.\u201d Johnny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley\u2019s laughter increased and the boys found themselves downstairs. \u201cDid you do that willingly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Johnny unwillingly replied. Letting Wesley know he had control over his very words, even in this state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure YOU want dinner after your butt buffet earlier? You ate shit then you ate my ass. Didn\u2019t my ass taste divine? Tell us about how amazing it was to lick my ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I still want food, shit isn\u2019t real nuticious.\u201d Johnny started, Wesley\u2019s will taking over his body. \u201cIt was the most amazing feeling to lick your ass, Wesley. I\u2019m sure it was tastier than whatever we\u2019re having for dinner.\u201d Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the boys started laughing and Johnny turned completely red. \u201cWell you can always lick my ass whenever you want, fag.\u201d Wesley said, leaving him an open ended invitation.</span></div></div>",

A huge dining table with the perfect amount of lighting could be found quite a distance away from a double decker stove and a separate stove top on a marble island. The refrigerator was massive but disguised as a wood cabinet drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived to find their mother standing up looking at something on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve checked out a few places...\u201d she said as all 3 boys took a seat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice and Wesley sat next to each other and Johnny, with his limited free will, willingly sat on the other side of the table, facing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice\u2019s cute, plump youthful asscheeks were like the sight of a horror movie to Ricky as they pushed themselves into Ricky\u2019s face and all over his body; forcing flesh into his mouth and the earthern taste and smell of ass. He tried squirming but the full weight of the mindless teen above him was crushing his body. Juice was probably only a 120 pounds or so but Ricky was only 4 or 5 inches tall and completely helpless as the teen above him was unaware of his struggles. Juice finally felt something in the back of his pants, and for a split second he remembered Ricky\u2019s presence there. Instead of being helpful, Juice adjusted himself on the seat; moving his ass just so that Ricky\u2019s body was pushed into his swamp of an ass crack.<br>\r\nWhile Ricky was somewhat grateful the full weight of the teen was no longer on him the struggle to breathe only got worse and his body pressed into the hot slimey flesh between Justin\u2019s cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like we can either get late night Chinese or Pizza.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh!!! Pizza!\u201d Wesley shouted. \u201cI want one large pepperoni with extra cheese and some cheesesticks and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWesley?? No way are you getting a large pizza just for yourself. You\u2019re also lactose intolerant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut mommm I can take a pill so that I don\u2019t..\u201d Wesley started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d She said. \u201cNo one in this room wants you to be gassy.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley and Juice shot Johnny a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides it\u2019s just not healthy for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut moommmmm whenever you get Chinese you always get me vegetables.\u201d Wesley whined again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? I\u2019ll let Johnny decide! Johnny what do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley shot Johnny a death glare and he had a half smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChinese sounds awesome.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley wanted to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright sounds good I\u2019m going to order real quick.\u201d Lesley said stepping away from the table and walking a little further away while calling the Chinese restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his mother was far away Wesley looked at Johnny. \u201cYou fucker. I wanted pizza!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t always get what you want, Wesley.\u201d Johnny replied with a grin. \u201cIm sure the vegetables will be really delicious.\u201d Johnny smiled, enjoying this little bit of power he had<br>\r\nover the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can tell me how delicious they taste tomorrow morning, after my shit.\u201d Wesley said, grinning back at him and watching as Johnny\u2019s smile faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe early bird special?!\u201d Juice asked. Wesley laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk boys the Chinese is on the way....Wesley I ordered SOME pizza for you from the other place. But you can\u2019t eat too much ok?\u201d Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Spoiled fucking brats.\u2019 Johnny thought as Wesley smiled at Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes mom!\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to get yourself a beverage from the refrigerator Johnny. Make yourself at home. We have a lot to talk about.\u201d Lesley said.<br>\r\nJohnny got up and walked over toward the refrigerator, looking into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s some lemonaid on the bottom....I know that\u2019s your favorite.\u201d Wesley said, secretly alluding to piss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes there is lemonade. There\u2019s also tea in a pitcher.\u201d Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom that\u2019s my tea!\u201d Wesley cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? You can share it. It\u2019s all you\u2019ve been drinking anyway. You know how it makes your teeth yellow.\u201d Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny pulled out the tea flashing a grin to Wesley that only he saw, infuriating him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe glasses are up in the top cabinet sweetie.\u201d Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh can you pour me one, too?\u201d Wesley asked, smiling because he knew Johnny has to do what he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Johnny willingly answered back in a tone of voice that sounded less helpful but more as a realization. Like \u201cof course I should\u2019ve known he would make me do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLesley caught on to the tension in the room, though she didn\u2019t understand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny brought the tea over to Wesley and sat his down on the table near his seat. He was crouched to set down and just before he did Wesley spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I forgot. I always have sugar with my tea. Can you please add sugar for me Johnny?\u201d Wesley<br>\r\nasked, pushing the glass closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWesley he was just about to sit down.\u201d Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he\u2019s closer.\u201d Wesley said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, of course. It\u2019s no problem.\u201d Johnny said, standing back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the glass and added some sugar. \u201cHow much sugar would you like?\u201d Johnny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep adding until I say.\u201d Wesley told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 5 teaspoons Lesley spoke out. \u201cThat\u2019s plenty for him Johnny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Johnny couldn\u2019t stop. He was under Wesley\u2019s direct control and was told to keep adding until HE told him to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny added one more teaspoon and Lesley said \u201cJohnny? It\u2019s fine. He\u2019s good now. That\u2019s enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohnny?\u201d Lesley asked.<br>\r\n\u201cHey John that\u2019s enough...\u201d Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny\u2019s body stopped and stirred the sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny are you ok?\" Lesley asked.</span></div></div>",

Good job!\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally a comeback snapped into his mind and he went for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that you guys.\u201d He said, making up a lie. \u201cI was flashing back to when you called me, Aunt Lesley... with the bad news.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used the pity train to get out of this weird situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sweetie...\u201d Aunt Lesley said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much we need to talk about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go ahead and start.\u201d Lesley said. \u201cI hired a company to take care of the..arrangements for your parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis news stunned Johnny. She was already working on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI honestly haven\u2019t been at work, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here so early. I\u2019ve been helping plan their whole ..funeral. I know what my sister wanted, and I have everything set up for tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was shocked. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s unusual to have everything finished so fast but.. well, to be perfectly clear I threw a lot of money at this. You\u2019ve been missing and I hoped that you would hear about the funeral and show up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny listened carefully. Amazed at how much thought she put into this. It seemed like a perfectly reasonable thing to do to find a missing teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was too soon to file a missing persons report with the police but too much for me to bear. Don\u2019t worry sweetie, I didn\u2019t skimp on the details.\u201d Aunt Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny believed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise it will be a fitting event for them. Both of them. Most everyone in the family will be going as well. Some people couldn\u2019t get off of work in such short notice but I called their companies and explained the situation. There were only a few problems...a few companies didn\u2019t want to pay their employees. So I set some money aside for those family members and am prepared to pay them in full for their time.\u201d Aunt Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny felt tears sting his eyes again. She did all this just to find him. \u201cThank you.\u201d Was all he could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect for you to be here today...\u201d she slightly glared at her kids \u201cor I would have made arrangements to move your things. I have power of attorney over your parents estate and you should know that their will leaves everything they had to you. I will call a moving company first thing tomorrow and oversee that too. I\u2019ve thought about it a lot and I think you can have the bedroom between Justin and Wesley\u2019s room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight next to us?\u201d Wesley said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited. We\u2019re going to have so much fun with you around, John.\u201d Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018The fuck you will!\u2019 John thought. \u2018I\u2019ll figure a way out of this. Mark my words.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn started thinking back to the hallway he crawled to get to Wesley\u2019s bedroom. There was that one door between Wesley and Juice\u2019s room. That must be the room Lesley is giving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.... please don\u2019t overwork yourself for me.\u201d Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s what your mother would\u2019ve done for my boys if...something had happened.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, we would\u2019ve went to their house?\u201d Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley made a gagging gesture out of her sight, sticking his tongue out and putting a finger in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso Justin, Wesley I hired a tutor to visit us in a couple of days.\u201d Wesley looked down, not even listening. He was playing with the table and his index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis methods are...different. If he asks you questions he\u2019s just trying to get to know you better. Answer them ok?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny I didn\u2019t expect you to be here..but maybe I\u2019ll let him know about you too. It\u2019s important you boys keep up on your studies during summer break.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes mom.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley didn\u2019t even hear a word she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a ring at the door. \u201cOh that must be someone\u2019s food!\u201d She said. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\nShe got up to go get the door, stepping out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d Wesley said, snapping his fingers at Johnny. \u201cYou\u2019re still going to eat my morning shit toilet boy. Just wanted to make sure you knew.\u201d He said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to lick every inch of me clean, too. EVERY inch. Cool right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny opened his mouth to have a comeback but he remembered something and stopped himself.<br>\r\nHe flashed back to a few moments earlier and a grin came across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Juice and Wesley noticed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow you really want to eat my poop, don\u2019t you fag? He\u2019s like imagining it and everything hahaha!\u201d Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice wasn\u2019t laughing he was staring at Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What\u2019s he up to?\u2019 Juice thought. Juice knew Johnny didn\u2019t want to eat Wesley\u2019s shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny remain quiet. Having figured out a way out of their control. His smile couldn\u2019t be helped. He had a master plan. This was all going to be over tonight.</span></div></div>",

I guess you\u2019ll just have to watch us eat Wesley.\u201d Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Wesley the pizza guys just aren\u2019t as fast.\u201d She said, placing the food on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny wore the same smile he had from earlier as plates and napkins were passed around. He started to think about what had to be done. What he would have to do to escape.<br>\r\nHe sighed inwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You can do this.' He told himself.'You HAVE to.' He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'For your parents.... they wouldn't want you to be here.' He said. 'For Ricky....' He said. 'he SHOULDN'T be here. No matter what he thinks about you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'For yourself....' He told himself. 'You can't live like this. This is no way to live life.<br>\r\nIt's time these brats got what's coming to them. FUCK THEM!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe revved himself up, flashing back to all the horrors he's experienced in just this short amount of time, and how they all needed to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to list them out in his mind:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* The fake pictures created of you being gay, and being blamed on you.' He began.<br>\r\n* Learning about the shit cake you ate years ago.<br>\r\n* When you starved at Wesley's party and got ridiculed by everyone.<br>\r\n* When Juice smashed your mother's most precious possession and blamed it on you.<br>\r\n* When you were throat fucked by the most sadistic teenager to ever walk the face of the earth.<br>\r\n* When you were forced to listen to Wesley's obnoxious laughter while he farted in your face and rubbed his ass all over you.<br>\r\n* Watching your best, closest friend get tortured, burned, spit on and turned into a woman who had ass and ball pubes for hair by the will of your younger cousins.<br>\r\n* Forced into...fucking your best friend. Just to teach some brat about sexual intercourse he could've googled on his phone. Not that he needed to. He knew all of that.<br>\r\n* Getting...' he gagged 'no. Eating shit. Eating my best friend's shit.' He remembered... 'as they twisted his mind like putty in their hands...twisted him into this...damaged person. This permanently damaged person who will never be over what happened to him.' He recalled.<br>\r\n'And they think they can turn me into some toilet for them? Some permanent toilet installed between their bedrooms? With no life other than to just wait for them to shit, piss and fuck my throat at their beck and call? FUCK that.' He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let's fucking do it.' He told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny got up out of his seat using his limited free will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over behind Wesley and got on his knees behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley\u2019s comment about eating his morning shit and licking him clean had just damned him. It caused Johnny to remember word for word what Wesley said earlier before they made it to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you can always lick my ass whenever you want, fag.\u201d Wesley told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould that command be enough, Johnny wondered, in his current state for him to raise some eyebrows at the dinner table?<br>\r\nWould it allow him to ignore Juice\u2019s prior commands to keep their control over him hidden? It had to right? Because Wesley said it AFTER Juice told him to be inconspicuous.<br>\r\nIf he could just muster up the desire to lick Wesley\u2019s ass he could pull the brats pants down right now and lick it in front of everyone. Then there\u2019d be some explaining to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Come on Johnny you can do this....\u2019 he thought to himself, looking up from the floor at<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley's lower body from the vantage point his knees gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley was slouching lazily on the kitchen chair at a right angle; his elbows on the table and hands holding up his head in one of his signature bored poses. While his ass was turned almost sideways and facing outwards the upper portion of his body was extended slightly toward the table. Essentially he was using only the right side of his hip to prop himself up on the chair, ignoring every code of ethics ever written about posture. His bleach white shirt was so lustrous it was dazzling to the eye. Not a single stain could be seen on it, not from the backside of it at least. The shirt creased around his stomach from the way he was angled, but in such a way that it looked like a perfect imperfection. The way he was sitting, Wesley was showing some skin; part of his lower back was exposed and flashing everyone from underneath the folds of his white shirt. Where the very tip of his ass crack would be, the top of his boxer shorts began. The black and red striped boxer shorts were sagging; poking themselves out from his skin tight jeans that had a decorative belt with the words \"Quicksilver\" written across with a designer logo. Typically Wesley wasn\u2019t sagging his pants this low, but the brat didn\u2019t care that his shifting around in the chair had caused his skinny jeans to drop a little bit lower than normal, even if his mother was in the room.<br>\r\nWesley was conveniently positioned in such a way that Johnny had easy access to his ass, which at this point Johnny was only staring at. He gulped, wondering if what he was about to do was really worth it. He was, after all, staring at the very ass he despised more than anything and spent over an hour sucking. But yet he knew this time he would have to willingly press his lips into it. He knew he would have to muster enough fake passion to create a scene at the dinner table, but at the same time find a way to ignore the humiliation of it all.<br>\r\nJohnny whimpered, but then he remembered his battle cry from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018You have to WANT to lick Wesley\u2019s ass. For freedom. Lick it for freedom! Yess I can do it. I\u2019m doing it!!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohnny?\u201d Lesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny\u2019s body reached over and pulled Wesley\u2019s boxers down a bit, as far as he could with Wesley still sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA decent portion of Wesley\u2019s ass was flashing the room now, and Johnny leaned down, bringing his tongue against the boys cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Explain this shit!\u2019 He shouted in his mind, lapping his tongue around Wesley's ass and pulling the younger boys pants down even further; little by little with every flick of his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018SHIT!\u2019 Juice thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLesley jumped out of her seat when her nephew pulled her youngest son\u2019s pants down and licked his bare ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley laughed out loud. He couldn\u2019t help it; it was hilarious to him that Johnny was licking his ass in front of his mother. The feel of Johnny\u2019s wet tongue sliding up and down his ass cheeks felt like cool liquid velvet melting on the surface of his hot skin on a summer day. It was as if a breeze just now started to flow on his ass; the feeling of air striking the now wet spots of his buttocks was cooling him down and so relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d Lesley shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley started to grow a boner just thinking about the humiliation of Johnny was suffering, licking his ass in front of his mother; Johnny\u2019s aunt. This was largely taboo, the boy recognized, but it felt too good to stop. He couldn\u2019t help but have a natural reaction to it. His natural reaction was facing his mother dead in the face and very hard to miss in his skin tight jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Mission accomplished.\u2019 Johnny thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cShit!\u201d Juice said out loud. In an instant he jumped out of the chair and made a dash for the stairs, having a plan to fix this made up in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck just happened?! What are you DOING to Wesley, Johnny? Why are you laughing Wesley? JUSTIN GET BACK DOWN HERE!\u201d Lesley shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice ran as fast as he could, pushing a door open and rushing over to the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut my mother in a forgetful, unresponsive state until I wake her from it!\u201d He shouted to the stone. \u201cWhen she wakes up she will forget only about what just happened between Wesley and Johnny, and won\u2019t hear or see whatever happens while in the unresponsive state. She will only wake when I snap my fingers!\u201d He said, making the wish as specific as possible and choosing his words carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe assumed the wish was made and ran back down the stairs to confront Johnny. The friction of his running caused Ricky tremendous suffering inside his ass crack, the globes of flesh bouncing and rubbing; pulling his limbs and skin in painful directions. Unfortunately, Ricky was completely forgotten at this point. He could kind of make out what was going on outside of Juice's pants and determined it was Johnny's fault that Juice was running around, causing him so much pain right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny heard the loud thunderous noise of footsteps running back downstairs, but didn\u2019t look up from Wesley\u2019s ass. He continued to willingly lick it thinking only about his freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey what happened to mom?\u201d Wesley asked Juice who came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother had moved herself back into her seat and was sitting up straight with her eyes closed, her body trembling slightly. Typically Wesley would be concerned it was a seizure or some medical condition, but instead he just shrugged it off and assumed Juice did something with the stone.<br>\r\nShowing no concern over his mother, he remain seated comfortably; continuing to get his ass worshiped by his cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI put her in an unresponsive coma. She\u2019ll forget all of this.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny\u2019s face lit up red with anger and frustration. He pulled his tongue back into his mouth and the taste of Wesley's ass along with it. He just licked Wesley\u2019s ass for nothing. He even slipped in some crack licks as quickly as possible when he was blinded by fighting for his freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean I did that for NOTHING? You son of a bitch!\u201d Johnny shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey our moms RIGHT THERE dude.\u201d Wesley said. \u201cShow her the same respect you've shown my ass.\" He half bragged, half commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juice what exactly just happened anyway? I'm really confused.\u201d Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just assumed you looked at him or commanded him to or something. This is awesome! Yeah, I kind of figured you winked at him and he knew it was go time. Like *wink*\u201d Wesley batted his eye in a wink, \u201cgo lick my brothers ass *wink wink*.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo..I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know how this happened....\u201d Juice said. \u201cI told him he couldn\u2019t blow our cover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was hiding a grin from them. They thwarted his plan but didn\u2019t know how he did it. He might be able to use this again later. He just had to think of how to get the stone away from them. Then everything would work fine.</span></div></div>",

You will do everything we say.<br>\r\nBut if what we say blows our cover somehow, or reveals how we're treating you to other people, you have to tell us. Not only that.\" Juice said, thinking it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to HELP us. You have to ADVISE us of the best possible way we can accomplish whatever we want to do with you, WITHOUT alerting others. You can\u2019t do ANYTHING that compromises us unless I go to the stone and change something drastically. Get it?\u201d Juice asked, more than annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can talk again, shiteater.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I get it but fuck you.\u201d Johnny said. \"I WILL escape. One way or another.\" He promised.<br>\r\nJuice just ignored his promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you. Maybe in the morning. Right before Wesley takes his morning dump. Get your throat nice and slick for his shit. Would you like that?\u201d Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do, I promise I'll kill you somehow when I get free.\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\" Juice looked at him with a completely blank expression. \"In that case....<br>\r\nyou're never allowed to harm us in any way what so ever. How does that sound, fuckface? I want you to think about this when I have you crawling on the floor to my bedroom tomorrow morning, on your knees getting ready for me to skull fuck you silly. We're smarter than you. We're better than you. We'll always be one step ahead of you, and there's nothing you can do about it. It's best if you just give up. Or if you do get free, you should just jump off a building.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it won't last very long.\" He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny stood there, stunned by his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'FUCK YOU!' He shouted in his mind. He started thinking of escape plans immediately. 'I can outwit a couple of teenagers.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWesley how soon does cheese make you gassy?\u201d Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike 2 minutes.\u201d Wesley said, chopping down on his second piece of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm....\" Juice thinks out-loud.</span></div></div>",

But this time it wasn't moving at all.

I--\" Juice lifted Ricky up and put him inside a cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this!?\" Ricky asked. \"Remember Johnny's dead rat's cage we showed you earlier? The one we killed? Mr. Squeaky? It's your new home now.\" He said, shutting the door on the cage and locking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but no please don't do this!\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I'll make sure to buy you some rat food later at the store. For now let me get you something to drink.\" Juice pulled out the container for water and unscrewed the top lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unzipped his pants and pulled out his dick, and started pissing in the container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to a funeral tomorrow.\" He said, his piss stream making a loud noise as it all collected at the bottom of the bottle. \"To be thankful for Johnny's dead parents.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to make sure you're still going to survive while we're gone for the day.\" He said, screwing the lid back on the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate it but--there's a faucet with regular water right there 2 doors down in the bath--\" Ricky was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'll excuse me I need to prepare my speech for when I address the family at the funeral.\" Juice said, setting the bottle back up in the cage and walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky watched Juice leave, completely ignored by his Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-he still loves me...\" Ricky told himself, crouching in the corner of his cage and holding his knees up to his chest, rocking back and forth on top of the bed of cedar they laid below him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He still thinks I'm cool.\" Ricky said. \"and that I'm a good friend. He just has to go to a funeral soon, that's all. He's in a big hurry to prepare his speech so he couldn't get the water. That's why he pissed instead. Y-yeah. Yeah! That must be it.\" Ricky said out-loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice returned back downstairs and found Johnny still sucking on his brother's asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh.\" Wesley sighed in relief. \"They keep getting worse after I'm done eating.\" He told Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice looked around and noticed Wesley was already done eating the pizza. The box wasn't even in sight anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Get back to your seat. It's time to wake mom up before the chinese food gets too cold and she starts asking questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, hold on one second though.\" Wesley said, reaching back and grabbing Johnny by the hair to pull him further up his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTT TTTTTTT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fart never seemed to end and he unleashed a silent but deadly miniature fart at the end, right after the loud hot one was sucked down Johnny's throat from his shit shute.<br>\r\nJohnny broke away, coughing and made it to the trash can just in time to throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHHHHHHHHHHURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blew chunks into the can, feeling dizzy and light headed. His body temperature was fucked up too and he had a headache.

He caught a glimpse of their reflection in a mirror. He checked himself out, looking at his messy blonde hair on the pillow. He traced the curves of his back with his eyes, looking at his silky smooth white skin until his eyes gazed upon his ass and Johnny's face trapped in it with the boxer cloth. He smiled, flashing his braces while looking at his cousin's face laying still between his freckled ass cheeks. He was enthralled with himself right now.

Just a cool sexy kid and his ugly cousin walking along the sidewalk. Ugly dude in a leash. Neat idea, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I'm getting off topic. Sorry about that. I lose my train of thought a lot. The bottom line is in my room I feel really comfortable away from other people and I talk to myself a lot like this, but its cool because no one knows or can hear me. Now I feel like we have this bond you know, where I can talk out loud and you can be my someone who hears me?\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n\"You get what I'm saying? Well, anyway... Enjoy my farts, butt boy.\" Wesley said, laughing as he raised his ass in the air again, and wiggled it back and forth in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloth boxers were tied tightly around his waist and tugged roughly on the back of Johnny's neck, choking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I snore really loudly too, just want to give you a heads up. So if you could like...wait.. hold on. Actually can you open your mouth and keep your lips around my asshole? Sometimes I have these massive farts at night that wake me up from my lactose intolerance and I think it would be better if they wake you up instead so you can check to see if I'm still breathing and make sure I'm ok. Also, just because, well like I know tomorrow is your big day as my toilet and I think we can get a test run of you right now getting a taste of my shit from my sharts at night. OH I'm sorry I forgot its another big day not just because you're eating my shit but like your funeral or whatever. Know what though? I feel like it's a bigger day for me you know? Because I'll be meeting your side of the family and everything and..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny got a headache and started crying. He had no choice but to wrap his lips around Wesley's asshole like he requested. He was drowning out the noise when Wesley raised his ass up again, but this time moved it up and down, choking him every time his hips ascended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey are you listening to me back there? I think I decided to use Ricky as toilet paper instead of you licking me clean. Or maybe I'll use him and then have you lick the rest. That would be cool right because then everyone gets a piece of my ass?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No answer? Well whatever dude.\" Wesley said, disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nighty night.\" Wesley said, clapping his hands twice to make the lights go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...John?\" Wesley said in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPPPPPPPPPPPRRFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I can't control that. Anyway, I was wondering if you'll ever willingly lick my ass again, you know like you did tonight? I thought it was super cool of you. I'd really like it if you did. But only if you tell me you're doing it first so I know this time. I mean I know it won't happen immediately that you'll do it or that you're excited to eat my shit tomorrow, but I hope over time you come to love eating my shit and licking my ass. We could really bond over this you know? Just a teen who needs to take a shit and clean his ass more often and a loser who can like, help him with all that? We'd be like an owner and his dog. Cuz you know right now, you're more like a puppy. You don't know you'll love me yet, but you will. You just need some training you know? To become my loyal pet dog. Eventually, over time I think you'll thank me for allowing you to eat my shit. Hell, you'll even beg me for it. You know how dogs look when they beg to go outside? Or when they beg for a treat? You'll crawl around in circles, chasing your tail. Looking up at me with sad puppy dog eyes. One day I might be constipated and I'll have to take laxatives and sit on your face for like an hour. I might even have diarrhea. That happens to me a lot more than I think it should. But I think liquids, in general, are good for the body, you know? So I mean it will help you, really. Plus you'll be begging for it too and I'd hate to disappoint my loyal dog. I imagine you licking out of the toilet sometimes too. Like the water. Or what if I throw a dildo out in the yard and you go fetch it like a bone?\" Wesley continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTT<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHH....... That's a shart for practice. It was, right? I think it felt wet. Usually, I wake up with boxer shorts that are all gross and I can feel it at night, but now with you here I think I can't really tell. That's pretty cool. Yeah, think of this like your training to be my loyal dog. I might even think of some dog name to give you. Maybe I can wish on the stone to give you a tail to chase when you're begging to eat my shit.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny just kept crying as more farts were poured on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey before I go to bed my loyal doggo in training, can you wrap your arms around my waist? I want to make sure your face is as far up my ass as possible for the most possible practice, because well, I'm going to be fully honest and straightforward here. The sooner you become my loyal dog the happier I'll be as your owner. I mean, I already own you really anyway, but this will be different. I won't have to control you as much. You'll just do what I want when I want it like instinctively.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHhhhh yeah. We're gettin dirty tonight, huh doggo? Oh I really appreciate that you wrapped your arms around me too. I feel almost like it's a loving gesture as well. Like you're on the right path to loving me and everything, and well, I do get cold at night too. And your body heat around my ass is really keeping me warm right now. Ok, goodnight. OH wait one MORE last thing and this is the last thing I promise. I think I'm going to ask Juice if you can sleep with me forever, like from now on forever. Even after mom gives you your own room. Because like, I feel like a dog should be curled up with his Master like you are with me right now and that's an important part of the relationship between a human and his mutt. Plus I really like talking to you. You're cool for a loser and broken dog down on your luck.<br>\r\nOHHH I just thought when you suck my dick it will be like you're playing with my bone. Hah, wait til I tell Juice that one! Oh yeah, right I meant to tell you to, I've never spoken to myself THIS much before going to bed, because I've never been this excited before. I wanted to thank you, personally, for wanting to lick my ass earlier today...because, well, it gave me the idea to turn you into my loyal doggo and I'm really in love with the idea and I think I'm gonna roll with it. My new goal in life is to make you my faithful companion. Imagine that you're like crotch or ass height and you follow me around everywhere on all fours. You'll be my most loyal com-padre. I'll share all my deepest secrets with you, and all of my messiest shits. I'll even train you to go outside when you have to. You'll have to beg me to let you outside and I'll be like 'oh doggo' and shake my head. 'Get on you scamp!' Then I'll open the door so you can take a poop outside and bury it so mom doesn't see. Then you can come back and play find the bone with my dick. I'll rub peanut butter all over my body and you can lick it off me. Ok goodnight for realios, loyal doggo in training. I promise you I will help make this happen. So both of us can be truly happy. Good night doggo.\"<br>\r\nWesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was silence. Dead silence. A creepy kind of quiet. John stare ahead into a dark abyss.<br>\r\nThe only noise some gurgles happening somewhere inside Wesley's body, somewhere up above.<br>\r\nJohn just staring forward, him having stopped listening. He was lost somewhere in the darkness staring into that abyss. An abyss no one had ever looked into, and it wasn't Wesley's wet puckered asshole. It was something else. Something even more horrifying. He was staring into the future. The possible future. He had to escape. And soon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johnny woke from the abysmal nightmares several times throughout the night to find Wesley's ass exploding into his mouth like it was his very own shart collector. Johnny tried to readjust himself a little bit during the night to become more comfortable, but he was commanded by Wesley to have his face in his ass crack and his mouth wrapped around his asshole, so he was very limited in comfort throughout the night. He remembered trying to move back or forward ever so slightly but the cloth tying his face up Wesley's ass was too tight and constricted his movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery so often during the night Wesley's bowels would drop a massive fart that would instantly wake Johnny up, who would immediately start coughing. Wesley just lay there, snoring all night not even hearing him coughing up a lung behind him. The snoring didn't help Johnny sleep, either...nor the gurgling from Wesley's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say Johnny went without sleep for much of the night, only catching shut eye when Wesley's bowels would give him a short break. Johnny's stomach was extremely upset and it was a miracle he didn't throw up at all during the night. He swallowed his own vomit several times, not because he was afraid of Wesley or his reaction to him blowing chunks on him, but because his face would then be lodged in an ass with vomit all over it and it was highly likely his youngest cousin wouldn't wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cried a lot that night. Silently. He didn't want Wesley to know that he felt so small and hopeless. He wanted to remain strong...but he kept thinking about that escape attempt that was foiled by Juice. It was his best shot of getting out and it was ruined by a punk brat who was far too smart for his own good. Johnny reassured himself several times while Wesley farted in his mouth that night, that he WOULD find a way out. He decided the risk was worth the reward, and everything Wesley said the night before had Johnny sleepless as well. He kept laying up, thinking about what he was saying. Johnny couldn't decide if anything Wesley said the night before they went to sleep was honest or if it was just more smoke blowing out of his ass but he decided that if that brat thought he could make a dog out of him, he was going to be sadly mistaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny slept when he could getting a few minutes in here and there. He felt like his body was a bagger attachment for a lawn mower. When Johnny did sleep, he had only nightmares. One such nightmare he had reflected this very thought, and Johnny was transported into the world of a bag for a heavy duty lawn mower. He was the bag, helpless, non-moving. Just laying there getting stuffed to the brim with grass as the mower ignored him completely and just kept going. At first he woke up disturbed greatly by the nightmare but later he became thankful for it. The reality was that the nightmare actually helped him sleep; because he realized that every time the bag was filling up with grass, Wesley was actually farting in his mouth. That nightmare kept him asleep for the longest amount of time all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke this time, things were different. Daylight was coming through the windows and his eyes felt like they were on fire and at the same time they carried that weight of a person who desperately needs to sleep.<br>\r\nHe couldn't see a clock, but he could see Wesley's ass fully, now that some light was in the room. He hated the sight. Wesley's naturally skinny, well shaped ass looked beefy this close up; and the mounds that were his ass cheeks looked like dirty hills on both sides of his vision, cluttered with jagged peach fuzz hair poking out in all directions and pimples galore. He hated knowing these intimate details about someone he loathed this much. No man should know what a teenagers ass looks like, not this up close. Especially not a teenager who spent a great deal of his life mocking and ruining his. Was this truly the end? Johnny wondered.</span></div></div>",

He kept reminding himself of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The one thing,' he thought to himself, 'that Juice didn't account for is...it can't get any worse than this.' Johnny told himself. 'So his threats are meaningless. It can't get any lower than being Wesley's shart collector.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have no where to go from here but up.' He thought to himself. 'And I WILL go up.' He said, determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarm in Wesley's room went off and Johnny saw his body start to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ugh five more minutes.........\" He said, hitting the alarm hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarm didn't stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn it!\" Wesley pouted. \"Why did mom buy us this shit anyway!?

Johnny lay there, staring at Wesley's back like an expanse or an entire landscape, because from his point of view it was. He lay there, staring at it completely stunned by Wesley\u2019s mood swing. Last night he was overly friendly. This morning seemed to be the opposite. Johnny had never seen Wesley get angry before, at least not to this degree; usually he was hyper, or joking. But he was ALWAYS super chill. He couldn't remember too many times where he saw Wesley get really mad like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck...I forgot.\" Wesley said, with a groggy voice. The way he sounded, you would think he was the one who didn't get any sleep.</span></div></div>",

Wesley's hair was a rat's nest, all over the place and he looked like someone had just pissed in his cheerios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you retarded?\" was all he asked with his voice sounding deeper than usual, and a hint of exhaustion in it. He did that same hand gesture with his right hand, shooing Johnny away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JESUS CHRIST!\" he yelled. \"Get out of here ALREADY! I NEED my sleep.\" Wesley yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny couldn't believe how big of a brat Wesley was in the mornings. He's never seen someone so groggy and irked at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny unlocked the door to Wesley's room and stepped out, getting on all fours and crawling his way two doors down.<br>\r\nHe felt completely humiliated but he couldn't control his actions as he opened up the door and crawled inside Juice's room.<br>\r\nJuice was still asleep laying face up on his bed, stark naked from what Johnny could tell. He was snoring loudly with drool in his mouth, one leg out of the sheets and partially off of the bed entirely. The bed sheets were in complete disarray and there was a large wet stain from his saliva on his pillow cover next to him.<br>\r\nJohnny stepped on a pair of pants on the floor and noticed boxers and a shirt next to it, confirming that Justin was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the fuck is wrong with these two, sleeping naked in their beds. That's gross!' Johnny thought to himself. 'Well what am I supposed to do now? He's asleep. This is the time Wesley said he wanted me in here...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\" Johnny laughed. 'Guess I get away with not sucking Juice's dick today. You snooze you lose fucker. I wish I could stab you right now. Ohhh it would be so much more satisfying than shooting you.' He thought to himself, hatred boiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body started moving toward the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa what?\" Johnny said out-loud. 'SHIT!' He thought. 'My bodies going to try to wake him!? WHY!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny put his full body onto the bed, and shook Juice.</span></div></div>",

You finally did something right and killed your parents, then you gave me the stone, literally putting your life in my hands. Now everything can be the way I want it to be, including you. You can lay there with my dick in your mouth and say you\u2019re not gay, but I\u2019ll just make you into whatever I want you to be. And since you were always a pain in my ass before, I think I want to make you squirm until you kiss it and beg for my forgiveness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re insane....\u201d Johnny replied. \u201cYou\u2019re so spoiled rotten and sheltered in your own little world that you honestly believe you\u2019re somehow better than me and everyone like me. I\u2019ve got news for you. You\u2019re not.\u201d Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am better than you. You need proof? Your lips are wrapped around my dick right now.\" Juice said, opening his eyes wide open, tilting his head and pushing it outwards in a \"duhhhh\" face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're NOT. And I\u2019ve NEVER done anything to you. When we first met I was respectful toward you and your brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, like you\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou lost the right to my respect years ago.\u201d Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWesley and I are better than you. You should respect us just for that. Nobodies like you should give us what we want when we want it the way it\u2019s SUPPOSED to be. I don\u2019t have to earn ANYTHING from trash like you. You have to earn from ME. You eat MY scraps. People with money like ME employ dumber people like YOU. That\u2019s the way the world works. But you, you\u2019re the thickheaded one. You don\u2019t get it. You don\u2019t see reality the way it really is. Ricky over there? He gets it.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s finally accepted reality. He\u2019s truly a testament to all of loser kind. He thought he was hot shit for a second, like you all seem to. But now look at him. He learned quickly the way the world works.\u201d Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you fucking crazy? You can\u2019t honestly believe anything you\u2019re saying! You\u2019re not even rich YOUR PARENTS ARE.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I am. My parents are losers too. Just like you. But they worked their whole lives for me and Wes like they were supposed to. Just like you\u2019re going to now.\u201d Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wesley and I you stupid fuck.\" Johnny said, talking with Juice's dick partially in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Learn how to speak English, oh great and powerful one.\u201d Johnny said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're getting it!\" Juice said with faked enthusiasm. \"Now look down and call my dick the same thing, thanks.\" Juice said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's body reacted to what Juice said like it was a command. he looked down at Juice's cock which was partially in his mouth at this point up to a quarter of his shaft and called it 'Oh great and powerful one.'</span></div></div>",

So I don\u2019t risk them resembling you or thinking like you. Or sounding like you. God I hate your annoying voice. I hate your face. I hate EVERYTHING about you. I've ALWAYS hated you.\" Johnny admitted. \"YOU AND YOUR BROTHER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn\u2019t worry about the vasectomy. A failure like you will never get lucky anyway. This is as close to lucky as you\u2019re going to get. I\u2019m 100% sure you\u2019ve never had sex. Know what else? I wouldn\u2019t worry about getting free, either.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cand...\u201d Juice gasped huhhhhhh \u201coh no you hate us!\u201d He said with faked surprise. \"I had no idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fucking play with me, you've always known I've hated you and Wesley.\u201d Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell no shit. It\u2019s natural for someone like you to be jealous of people like me.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe world doesn\u2019t revolve around you, Justin.\u201d Johnny said. \u201cand I only started hating you because you broke my mother\u2019s figurine. It was YOUR fault for breaking it, but you blamed it on me.\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always been rotten. You and Wesley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Juice asked. \"The fuck are you even talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was stunned. 'Didn't he remember?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember me never visiting your room but you don't remember breaking the figurine and blaming it on me?\" Johnny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean when I was like 2 years old dude? Are you kidding?\" Juice snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the big deal about some dumb figurine? Was it important or something?\"<br>\r\nJohnny just stare up at him, looking into Justin's eyes with rage and his dick in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my a gift from my grandmother to my mother. It was the only thing she treasured in the world and YOU broke it. YOU and Wesley. Throwing it around like some ball playing a game of catch. YOU two did it. EVERY time you came over you broke things, stole things or used my things. Fuck both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now we're using you.\" Justin said with a half-smirk. He reached over to the end table next to him and grabbed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we've stole you.\" He said, continuing his speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed Johnny's head, pushed it onto the bed while simultaneously moving his own body, especially his pelvis. He flipped Johnny to be face up on the bed, and himself to be on top of him. At no time during this flip did his dick leave Johnny's mouth. He looked down at him with a grin, taking the item he grabbed from the end table and bringing it down next to Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're going to break you. Like we broke your mommies figurine.\" Justin said. \"Why?\" He asked. Then he shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we can. Because you're one of OUR things now. Just some property we own. Some toy to play with like your best friend over there. You can be MY figurine, John.\" Juice said cruelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his dick out of Johnny's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said. You are what we want you to be. Losers always serve winners. And I don\u2019t care how many farts you have to suck out of Wesley\u2019s ass or how often I have to throat fuck you for you to admit that you\u2019ve always been jealous of us. I don\u2019t care how many more years I have to keep humiliating you for you to learn that your place is beneath us. One day, when you\u2019re broken and finally understand, you\u2019re going to beg for my forgiveness. You\u2019re going to realize if you had just done whatever we wanted and treated us as your betters instead of your equals, you wouldn\u2019t be punished like this. You\u2019re going to come to realize this was all your fault, that\u2019s why you\u2019ll beg for forgiveness. And you know what? After you\u2019re done groveling, after you\u2019ve kissed my ass and come to your senses, when you finally beg me for my forgiveness? I\u2019ll keep you on your knees and have you wipe my ass like the loser you are. Like the ass wipe I\u2019m going to make you. Like the cock sleeve I\u2019m turning you into RIGHT now.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd to get us started, I took this from the bathroom last night, I thought we could have some fun with it.

Now it makes even more sense to use it....\" Justin said, bringing the soap dispenser he had on the end table closer to Johnny's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you speak so much shit, and eat so much of it. I think we need to wash your mouth out with some soap...\" he said smiling \"Now open up for your lube, cocksleeve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny opened his mouth against his will and Juice brought the handle of the dispenser down toward his mouth, pumping it. He pumped it 4 times directly onto Johnny's tongue, who groaned in revulsion. He was already extremely nauseous from all night with Wesley's ass and not having any food, the feel and taste of soap running down his tongue was killing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not enough.\" Juice said, unscrewing the cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poured the whole bottle into his mouth, watching the soap fall into it.<br>\r\nJohnny looked down and saw that Justin's dick was fully erect, and ready to pound him into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny had to gurgle to speak and it didn't sound quite right because he had to keep his mouth wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH HAAAAA UUUUUUUUUUUUUU.\" (I hate you.) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you should speak with your mouth full.\" Justin said, throwing the soap bottle on the floor, and sliding his dick into Johnny's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny stare straight ahead, looking at Justin's body. He couldn't bear to look at Justin's face right now, he could barely stand looking at Juice\u2019s body. He hated how perfect it was. Not an ounce of fat or a single blemish. He had those cut V lines everyone lusts for that Johnny was forced to stare at right now, they got close to his face every time Juice thrust. Juice was just the right amount of tan. Not too much and not to little. Looking at his body made Johnny hate him even more. Someone so disgusting on the inside shouldn\u2019t look so good on the outside. Someone so evil and twisted shouldn\u2019t be as privledged as he was. Johnny closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen your eyes and look at me while I\u2019m fucking you.\u201d Juice commanded, knowing Johnny hated every minute of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet used to looking at me during.\u201d He advised. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a regular sight for you as my cock sleeve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two fistful\u2019s of Johnny\u2019s hair Justin kept going to town. The soap in Johnny\u2019s mouth started bubbling up all over, increasing the pleasure for Justin and worsening it for Johnny. The soap burned and slowly small bits of it would make its way down his throat, bubbling up there too. Mid-thrust Justin re-positioned his dick to hit the back of Johnny's throat just by the wind pipe. Each and every thrust into his mouth now caused Johnny to gag hard and cut off his breathing which is exactly what Juice wanted to do, and was the reason why he was thrusting so hard and fast now. With each and every thrust Johnny could feel Justin's ball sack touch his chin, that's how far down Juice was ramming his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet more involved. Stop acting like some dead body. You\u2019re fucking horrible at this.\u201d He said ramming his cock down Johnny\u2019s throat. \u201cScratch my back and draw circles on my ass like the infatuated faggot you are. Play with my balls. Run your hands down my legs. Do something crazy. Make me WANT it! Convince me you\u2019re a better cock sleeve than my sock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny\u2019s body started doing as he was commanded, running his hands lovingly down Justin\u2019s back and coming back to scratch it. He would use one finger and run it down Justin\u2019s legs then grab his calves and squeeze them with light pressure. He slapped Justin\u2019s ass a few times and really got his engine revving with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it do more of that!\u201d Justin told him. The slaps to Justin\u2019s ass seemed seemed to be encouraging him to perform harder. He started lunging his whole pelvis forward and his dick with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeck up, NECK UP!\u201d Juice said, grabbing Johnny by the neck and lifting it the way he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought his knees beside Johnny\u2019s face, forced his legs underneath Johnny\u2019s shoulders and then he moved both of his legs all the way down, relaxing himself and putting them flush against the bed. Now Juice's thighs were wrapped around Johnny\u2019s neck, which was bent upwards for his convenience and created the perfect straight shot for Justin\u2019s dick to cram itself down Johnny\u2019s throat.<br>\r\nJustin grabbed a fistful of Johnny\u2019s hair again and thrust down for the first time in this new position. He received a nice firm slap on his ass from Johnny as his his head was pushed violently into the mattress. His neck muscles were screaming at him to put the back of his head and neck flat against the bed like before, but he couldn\u2019t move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhh fuck yeah.\u201d Justin said, pushing his pelvis down again and leaving his soapy dick inside Johnny\u2019s wrong windpipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny immediately threw up, his puke hitting Justin\u2019s cock on the way up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing we\u2019re using the soap.\u201d Justin said, not caring as he pulled back again and slammed his pelvis into Johnny\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny\u2019s eyes bulged out. He was getting obliterated. He felt Juice\u2019s foreskin slide back against his tongue again before getting rammed down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook down.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny looked down and saw Juice\u2019s crotch pressed fully against his face. His lips could feel Juice\u2019s pubic hair bush tickling them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou swallowed the full 7 inches.\u201d Justin told him. \u201cLet\u2019s keep doing that.\u201d Justin said, \u201cwe\u2019re only getting star\u2014\u201c</span></div></div>",

Just hold it in!

Anyway where were we?\u201d Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right.\u201d He said, thrusting his cock harder than ever and causing Johnny\u2019s throat muscles to contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began squeezing Johnny\u2019s throat harshly with his thighs as well, forcing the contracting muscles back inward and making the hole smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was it in Wesley\u2019s ass last night? Meh. I guess you can\u2019t really speak right now.\u201d Juice said, continuing his onslaught and raping Johnny. \"Your face does all the speaking for you anyway...you look like shit.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would be disrespectful to show up to your own parents funeral looking as shit as you do right now.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you're just going to be disrespectful hmmm? Too busy worried about sucking your cousins dick than your appearance, right? Too worried about eating shit?\" He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know since you mentioned it, I DO remember breaking that figurine. Honestly, do you want to know what I was thinking in that moment? It was mostly me thinking \u2018meh well that just happened.\u2019 \u2018Better blame it on ass wipe.\u2019\u201d Juice thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...

He started to thrust like a madman hoping he could make his older cousin cry.<br>\r\nJuice squeezed Johnny's neck tighter than ever and thrust equally as hard as his efforts to make John cry increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish I had a video tape of your parents car crash to watch while I throat fuck you.\" Juice said non-challantly. \"It doesn't feel like a real celebration without at least that much, does it?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh that's right, my wishes can come true.\" He said. \"Maybe I'll wish for that later.\" Juice said, grinning down at Johnny who was looking up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice looked down. No tears, but Johnny was getting close. Juice knew if he could get that faggot to cry he could climax faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh I know!\" Juice said, figuring something out that might make Johnny upset. \"What if I kill Ricky's parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was stunned. He stared up at Juice with complete disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! That would be AWESOME!\" Juice said, putting more thought into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make them die however I want!\" He said, looking back down at Johnny and seeing that his train of thought was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a fire. In a car accident... hahahaahhaahah ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!\" Juice faked excitement and then immediately the expression erased itself and he looked back down at Johnny with cold, expressionless eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I turn them into insects at my feet and crush them with my shoes? He can clean their corpses off of them when I'm finished.\" Juice said, deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's eyes lit up with anger and frustration, he started trying to fight against the spell Justin had him under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make Ricky watch...\" Justin said. \"watch his family die. It wouldn't be as fun to make him clean my shoes if he didn't right? Or maybe he can clean them off, and then I'll tell him. Then he'll know. What do you think?\" Justin asked as he thrust his cock further into Johnny's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goal wasn't even to get Johnny to cry anymore, Juice was too wrapped up into this train of thought now, and it was turning him on. He felt his dick quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what kind of excuse he'd make for me if I did it? You think he'd thank me afterword? If I kill his whole family, I mean?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter I guess. If I do it there's NOTHING you can do about it. Is there?\" Juice asked with another thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NO!!!!' Johnny shouted in his mind, trying to divert Justin's mind to something else. He would've screamed it but his mouth was full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew Justin wasn't just speaking shit and started to really worry when Justin's gaze went toward the cage Ricky was in across the room, him being completely unaware of their private conversation right now. Justin didn't look at Johnny again, instead he relaxed his body and let his pelvis sink in around Johnny's face, his slim stomach just above Johnny's head arched down to where Justin's chest was touching the bed.<br>\r\nJustin thrust quicker and harder than ever, getting completely turned on. He was close to his limit and this new line of thought about killing Ricky's family got him so turned on. He just kept coming up with more and more ways to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Flushed down the toilet?' Juice thought with a thrust. 'Fed to my frog?' he added with another thrust. 'Acid?' He paused there. 'Shrunken bodies melting from acid?' He added, his body quivering. 'Maybe stepping on them is still the best.' He wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he hit the real fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What if he has a younger sister?' Juice said. 'His whole family, insects on the floor.' Juice envisioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\"Oops.\"' He imagined himself saying. '\"Sorry Ricky I stepped on your little sister.\"'<br>\r\nHe thrust now harder than ever, his dick ready to jolt cream out of itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\"Oops, sorry Ricky Turdmaker the Toad took a real liking to your insect of a baby sister.\"'</span></div></div>",

That's gross!\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrdinarily Juice might listen but he was one thrust away from bliss. He pushed himself back into Johnny's mouth, and his ass cheeks visibly clenched themselves. His dick slid one more time down Johnny's throat and he felt his foreskin graze Johnny's tongue sensually gliding backwards and causing him great pleasure.<br>\r\nHe moaned as his piss slit squirted piping hot semen down Johnny's throat.<br>\r\nOne, two, three, four full pumps of cock juice shot out oozing down Johnny's throat, who gagged at the pulsating cock rammed down his windpipe and the semen blocking his breathing. Gagging turned in to straight coughing as the semen clogged his throat. The liquids were forced back up into his mouth where he had to swallow them down the correct wind pipe. His whole face turned from red to bluish, completely noticeable against his now unusually pale complexion from the sickness Wesley's ass gave him last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind both of them, and unseen by Johnny Wesley was dancing left and right in anticipation in his suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HURRRRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!\" he said, reaching back, grabbing his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was squeezing his cheeks together with every muscle he had, clenching them so he didn't shit his pants. He stopped dancing, realizing it wasn't helping and tried to stand perfectly still.<br>\r\nJuice quickly lurched upwards, looking down at Johnny who he noticed was crying. Juice now realized the wetness he felt on his pelvis was from Johnny's tears, and just as Juice's dick made its way out of Johnny's mouth Juice came again from the sight, his cum shooting its way directly into Johnny's mouth like it was a cum dumpster. Having no time to really appreciate the view Juice instead hopped off of Johnny and off of the bed altogether<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Face your body toward Wesley and put your head at the edge of the bed. Quickly quickly!\" Juice snapped his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's body picked up the pace and did what Juice said. Soon his head was on the edge of the mattress and the rest of his body was off of the bed entirely. The back of his head was flush against the bed and he was bending his neck uncomfortably.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before he knew it he saw Wesley's ass up close in his skin tight tuxedo pants. It was clearly tailored specifically for his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...Juice?\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can...you help me get my pants off?\" Wesley asked. \"I'm scared if I let go I'll....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, OK!\" Juice said, not wanting the details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hastily unbuttoned the front of his brother's pants and slid them down all while Wesley was clenching his butt cheeks with his hands. Wesley was able to keep his hands on his cheeks at all times by expertly moving them as his pants and underwear were lowered for him. John who could only sit there and stare at his now naked demise in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooopen wiiiide.\" Wesley said, looking back at Johnny with that signature toothy grin that flashed his braces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's mouth forced itself open against his will as he fought for control of his body.<br>\r\nJustin ran to the stone quickly as Wesley began his descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put some foil under my brother and that faggot. I don't want ANY shit on my bed, get it you retarded stone?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice looked toward his brother and his bothersome cousin, anxious to witness this level of humiliation up close for the first time, instead of through a video like the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Juice and Wesley everything happened instantly. Wesley flopped himself on top of Johnny's face like a used piece of furniture that was slowly breaking down from repeated abuse. Soon after the foil appeared underneath his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Johnny everything happened almost in slow motion. Juice's hands just reached the stone as Wesley began his descent, a condescending smile still visible on the brats face as his lower back first bent outward before lowering down. From Johnny's perspective Wesley's ass soon loomed overhead and blocked a lot of the light from the room. He could see the moles and pimples on Wesley's white ass cheeks and vividly remembered tracing the frazzled and disgusting crack hairs that were poking out down and seeing his droopy balls dangling below where his unseen penis must have been. All of this was right in Johnny's field of vision, and unfortunately it was slowly getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley's ass moved in slow motion and stopped briefly mid descent. This pause was like mere nanoseconds to Juice and Wesley; to the point where Wesley seamlessly sat down on Johnny's face from their perspectives, but it was drawn out to Johnny who had a different point of view.<br>\r\nA horrified mind is an active one, and so when Wesley's ass stopped moving Johnny saw, heard and smelled everything. Every little bit. Wesley's ass was close enough now that the natural air it carries with it everywhere finally made its presence here known; involuntarily wafting into Johnny's nostrils as he inhaled. Johnny saw the goosebumps on Wesley's ass as his body not only anticipated, but was dependent on the coming shit. The mere sight of Wesley's natural formation of goosebumps made it seem as though Wesley's whole body, even down to the cellular level, was working against Johnny right now. The reality was that his goosebumps weren't aware he was going to shit into his cousin's mouth. His cells didn't know that he was going to push his feces into another human being.<br>\r\nBut in this moment when Johnny looked up at the goosebumps, to him it felt as if they did know but they simply didn't care. And in that respect, there was some truth to his thought. Wesley's body needed to take a shit, and RIGHT now, and it DIDN'T care where. All of the warning signs were there, staring him in the face. The clutched cheeks. The tight sphincter that was visible now that his cheeks were opened up a little from bending over. The goosebumps. The hairs on his ass and legs standing straight up. All of these were signs his body was ready to let loose. Just then, Johnny felt foil materialize itself behind his head, increasing his heart rate ten fold.<br>\r\nThat's when HIS body realized what was happening, and started having it's own natural reaction. In that moment, Johnny knew this was going to happen, whether he liked it or not; but his body wasn't giving up the fight. Just like every cell in Wesley's body was screaming at him and telling him to take a shit, every cell in Johnny's body was screaming at him, wanting him to run. They were fighting for life, wanting to move and get away from this place.<br>\r\nSimilar to how Wesley's body knew it had a need that had to be fulfilled; Johnny's body knew it needed to be out of here, gone.<br>\r\nIt knew this wasn't it's natural habitat. No one's natural habitat is staring up at their naked younger cousin's ass as he prepares to sit on your face and shit down your throat. That was a fate worse than even death. Everyone knows it. Even down to the cellular level. It was like Johnny's body was trying to naturally jerk itself away from this area, like one might do automatically when one's life is at stake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll open up tooooooooooooooo.\" Wesley almost sang in real time, reaching back and opening up his ass cheeks, quickly plopping himself down and positioning his asshole over Johnny's opened mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha Loser.\" Wesley laughed, getting what he wanted. \"Ugh I can't hold it in any longer.\" Wesley's stomach growled mightily.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From Johnny's perspective before the fall; the light in the room was dimmer than ever, but his field of vision allowed him to see a lot of things. Things that he knew he shouldn't be seeing, not under any circumstances. Details like the shape of the indents Wesley's ass made as his fingers pressed into his cheeks from this up close. How they pushed into the skin almost like a chef's fingers would press into dough. Details like how unclean the inside of Wesley's nails were the dirt making a literal outline around the white part of his finger nails. Details like the dingleberries and toilet paper residue littered inside of his ass crack amongst the pubes hidden from literally every other being in the known universe that wasn't some form of ass parasite or unfortunate cell that made up the very essence of his ass. These details culminated in one grotesque picture; Wesley bent over, his ass mere inches away from Johnny's face, opening up because of his grimy fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny winced when Wesley's ass slammed into his body, the force of the impact painful because the brat just flopped down carelessly. Wesley typically flopped to sit down, not caring about his environment, but this case was actually special; he had a sense of urgency this time. He really needed to take a monster dump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's vision went black inside Wesley's crack and against his cheeks. He felt the teen's plump ass mold itself around his face and the foil behind him creasing as the full weight of Wesley pressured his head against it. He felt Wesley maneuver himself slightly, not only getting comfortable but positioning his asshole directly between Johnny's open lips. Johnny felt the pucker slide across his face along with many ass pubes; making its way to the target location with the accuracy of a computer.<br>\r\nThe full weight of Wesley's body once again forced itself onto Johnny and he felt his open lips press against the sticky humid flesh inside Wesley's butt crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard Wesley laugh victoriously and call him a loser from above, the sound partially muffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe invisible fight between Wesley's body and Johnny's continued. Wesley's cells needing him to relieve himself, Johnny's needing him to flee; as per the natural fight or flight response. It was like something you might read out of a science book.<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Johnny's cells were losing the fight. If you were to look at this invisible battle from a Neo-Darwinistic perspective both Johnny and his cells would be the losers here, just like Wesley considered Johnny to be. So in a cynical sense, Wesley was right to call Johnny a loser. Not just because he was 'uncool', but because he, his whole anatomy, and even his will were all losing to Wesley's. With this Darwinistic perspective you can clearly see who is a winner and who is a loser. Wesley is the younger one. The more evolved one. The new direction of his species. Johnny? Johnny was old news. Washed up. Useless. Not a failure of evolution, just more...obsolete than his counterpart.<br>\r\nAnd this event that was about to happen? Wesley shitting in Johnny's mouth? Isn't anything more than a simple act of domination between one male and his better. You could also argue it a matter of convenience for Wesley at this point because of how badly he needed to defecate. Whatever the case, it certainly wasn't an act of mutualism where both individuals gain something from an event taking place. No.<br>\r\nIf you were to place these two out in the wild and factor in survival of the fittest and then have this happen out there? Wesley would undoubtedly be the fittest and would be the one to survive and procreate. Johnny, well, Johnny would be shunned and natural selection would take it's course. In the wild this act of dominance would be a death sentence not only for Johnny but for his entire gene pool. No one wants to mate with a male who eats another male's shit. That's just a fact of life. Even in animal life, there isn't anything lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActs of dominance happen in nature all the time. But this is a little bit more than a typical act of dominance. This is an act of dominance only a cruel human mind could come up with.<br>\r\nWesley half-smiled, even though he was feeling immense pressure in his intestines that needed to be released. He smiled because there was something amusing about all this. Something fun. The feeling of asserting his dominance over his cousin awakened something in him that made him gloat. It was a natural high. Something pure and innate inside him that made him feel blissful.<br>\r\nHe hated his annoying older cousin Johnny and he was going to make him pay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis understanding of what was happening had him leaking with hilarity, but he couldn't come close to comprehending just how horrible this really was, however. Nor could he even come close to understanding what this meant or even that it was an act of dominance. This action was just natural to him. Just something he felt like doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley's smile faded just like that. Just as soon as it came into existence it disappeared. In a humiliating act of dominance that even the beasts in the animal kingdom would be ashamed of if it happened to them; Wesley un-clenched his butt cheeks and his anus with it.</span></div></div>",

The fart didn't even last for one second; its noise ceased immediately. The sound of Wesleys bowels erupting was replaced by an even sicker noise; the noise of shit moving out of a rectum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 balls of feces instantly fell into Johnny's horrified mouth. These were the kinds of shit balls that would cause a big splash in the toilet bowl below, but instead they fell directly onto Johnny's tongue which crinkled itself as it quivered in disgust. The two little shits were already melting in Johnny's mouth and had a mashed potato like consistency. The taste and smell couldn't be easily described in words but it was so disgusting that tears started to streak down Johnny's face and he was completely beside himself, not even moving a muscle in his mouth as the shits lay there on his tongue like two scoops of bacteria ridden ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is our first shit together.\" Wesley said, reaching down grabbing one of Johnny's hands to hold it romantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's.....it's.....\" Wesley farted. \"so bootyfull.\" He mocked, grabbing Johnny's other hand and using it to wipe a nonexistent tear from his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahah!\" Juice let out one of his rare laughs. \"You might want to let him wipe away his own tears!\" Juice observed, looking down at Johnny who was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice couldn't hide his boner, and wasn't even attempting to anymore. Instead he put his hand in his boxers and slowly pumped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Johnny I'm ready for round two.\" He joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley laughed. \"He's occupied right now.\" Wesley quipped, joking like Johnny was a toilet on an airline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley farted again, this time the noise turning into more of an empty whipped cream canister as more feces pushed against his asshole in a quick fire hurry attempt at exiting his body. Wesley didn't even have to push really, and the feces started to snake its way out of his anus as a fully attached semi-solid into Johnny's still pre-occupied mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh my god!\" Juice said, putting a hand against his nose. \"Did you see his face this morning? You fucked him up last night!\" Juice said, proud of Wesley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think he was fucked from last night? He's about to get WRECKED right now!\" Wesley said, farting into Johnny's open mouth as his turd snapped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAH OH MY GOD!!!!!\" Juice almost screamed, seeming like a completely different person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His cheeks are all puffed up with your shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puffed?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know...puffy.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know what it means, it just made me think of something, that's all.\" Wesley said. \"Now if you don't mind bro, I usually read...you know....during.\" Wesley said, pulling out his cell phone. \"So if you could keep your orgasm to yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is that all it takes to get you to read? Maybe the teachers should let you shit in the classroom an---\" Juice cut his thought off getting an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever douchebag.\" Wesley said, flipping him off with a playful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devious smile grew on Juice's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. No I have a great idea.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know you find me shitting in people's mouths sexy and all, but I wouldn't do it to you, sorry.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, seriously.\" Juice said again. \"Wait did you just joke about me eating your shit? You fucker!\" Juice joked. \"Nice one! You're getting better at that by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better at shitting in people's mouths?\" Wesley asked. \"Or better at.....turning you on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley joked, opening up his legs and running a hand down toward his crotch.<br>\r\nJohnny lay still his mouth full of Wesley's fecal matter while the two boys above him jokingly flirted with each other, making fun of how gay he supposedly was. The tears kept rolling down Johnny's face and the shit inside his mouth started to burn. Some of Wesley's farts were one hundred percent wet, and there was actually a bit of diaherria coming out of his asshole right now because of his body's inability to process dairy. But Johnny remain still, not able to bring himself to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO you know what I meant. Better at being a smart ass. I have an idea, remember. Stop<br>\r\ndistracting me with your ADHD and your dick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love it.\" Wesley smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IDEA! My idea!\" Juice reminded. \"I have a better idea than you reading. How about we watch something instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley's ears perked up as Justin put his hands on the stone.</span></div></div>",

Full HD.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny wasn't sure he had heard Juice correctly as he lay there with acid in his mouth. The acidic liquids burned Johnny's tongue and mixed in horribly with the soap that was still left in his mouth from Juice's fuck fest. He cried harder, feeling the shit still in his mouth deteriorate faster inside the acidic liquid, and he could feel little bits and pieces of turd like small shavings of waste rubbing up against his gums and teeth.<br>\r\nHis tears only increased when he heard what Juice just wished. He wished to watch Johnny's parents death on the television like it was happening in real time. Not on 240p but on FULL HD. Like he wanted a high definition outlook on their death.<br>\r\nHe tried swallowing now as quickly as he could so he could scream at Justin just how he planned on killing him later. He had new plans that involved actual torture. Plans that would bring Justin to the brink of death but keep him alive just a little longer.<br>\r\nThe hatred he had for his cousins could not grow any worse, and was the only thing powering him to swallow Wesley's shit that was clogging up his mouth and in turn his only ability to tell them to go fuck themselves. The pain was unbearable as the acidic liquid shit sloshed down his gullet it was affecting the already inflammed areas of his throat that Justin had just got done fucking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOA this is AWESOME!\" Wesley said, looking at the TV while Juice held the remote control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah this is pretty impressive...\" Juice said. \"I can zoom in and out..and change perspectives. Lets hit play!\" Juice was excited and intentionally turned up the volume on the car accident so Johnny could hear it while he was still trying valiantly to swallow Wesley's shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny couldn't see anything that was happening but he stopped swallowing shit for just a moment as he tried to hear what was going on. He distinctively heard the car horn, the same car horn he had only heard his parents use every once in awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright whoa whoa, freeze frame.\" Juice said as he rewound the tape and slowed it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at this shot? See how close the semi is? Look at how her hands go up. This is like the moment they realized how fucked they were.\" Juice said, referring to his mother's instinctive reaction to a semi that was about to collide with them head on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley just started laughing, his annoying voice cracking and hurting Johnny's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD YOU'RE RIGHT!!! GOOD CATCH!\" Wesley said. \"You're always so good at catching things like that in movies!\" He told his brother, as though his aunt and uncle's death were just a movie to be watched for entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets hit play again.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny started trying to swallow more and more of Wesley's shit while he could, doing everything in his power so he could get a word in and tell them how fucked up they both are, how they're both going to hell. Something. He started chewing on the shit in his mouth and flushing it down his throat expotientially faster than usual when he heard Wesley's stomach gurgle from above.<br>\r\nWesley put his hands on his tummy and winced, still keeping his eyes on the video. He pushed more on his bowels and the tip of a huge turd poked out of his asshole, sticking into Johnny's mouth slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny had no idea what was coming as he just finished swallowing the very last of the previous shit storm, he started to scream out but the tip of the abnormally large turd Wesley was pushing out connected with his tongue and caused him to become silent. He was silenced again, just by the taste alone and he could hear Wesley grunting ever so softly above, obviously trying to push this inconvience out of himself.<br>\r\nJohnny heard the car horn go off again, and this time he heard a loud smacking sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Wesley said. \"Can you play that in slow-mo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah!\" Juice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I FUCKING HATE YOUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' Johnny screamed in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't use his mouth, because it was already full with Wesley's huge, never ending turd. This particular piece of shit was very large and solid. It was moving out of Wesley's asshole like a slow train and pushed against Johnny's tongue where it was bending and finally snapping; breaking apart and sliding down Johnny's throat.<br>\r\nJuice reversed the tape again and put it in slow motion and the boys watched eagerly as they saw the car get hit initially by the semi.<br>\r\nJuice got down as close to the side of Wesley's naked ass as he could bear and instead of whispering into Johnny's ear he spoke regularly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you hear that? That's the exact sound of your parents dying. Cool right? Lets do an instant replay and turn the volume up so you can really appreciate it.\" Juice said, doing exactly that and setting the video up in a loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley laughed out loud, hearing the sound of the semi smack into the car again and again.<br>\r\n\"It's like a horrible GIF!\" Wesley said. \"Like one of those 'caption this' videos.\" He added.</span></div></div>",

He was mind controlled to where he couldn't blow their cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat then, could he wish for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'THINK JOHNNY, THINK!!!! THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING ELSE YOU CAN DO BESIDES KILL THEM!!!!!!'<br>\r\nJohnny heard a pair of footsteps run into the room behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP RIGHT THERE!\" Justin yelled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, Johnny was frozen still and couldn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit I got here JUST in time.\" Justin said. \"Nice try, toilet boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was breaking a sweat, trying to get his wish out verbally and fighting against the mind control Justin had him under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!' Johnny shouted in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I WISH I COULD TURN BACK TIME!!!!!!!!!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I WISH I COULD GO BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE CAN'T YOU HEAR MY MIND!?!!!!!!!!!! GRANT MY WISH!!!!!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin laughed at Johnny as he approached him from behind. \"Heh what's the matter retard? Couldn't think of a wish in time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny wanted to kill this brat. \"You're so fucking stupid. You have the stone RIGHT in your hands.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOK!\" Justin pointed down at Johnny's hands which were on the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooooo close. It's really a shame.\" He said. \"I could think of a few things I would wish for if I were you. But I guess you're not as smart as me eh?\" He laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hands off.\" Juice said. \"and step back.\" Johnny's hands came off the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!' Johnny shouted as his body stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice put his hands on the stone. \"I wish Johnny would be all dressed for the funeral now.\"<br>\r\nIn a puff of smoke, Johnny's outfit changed and he was in the tuxedo Lesley had bought him for the funeral.<br>\r\nJustin took his hands off the stone and turned to face Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I warn you there would be severe...\" Justin dusted Johnny's right shoulder with his hand \"consequences if you tried to escape?\" He asked, gripping Johnny's tie and pulling it down some very tightly as he adjusted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because there will be.\" Justin promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin leaned into Johnny's left ear and whispered. \"You're really fucked now.\" He said, moving back in front of Johnny with a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, by the way, whenever you touch the stone from now on..... I command your body to lose its voice.\" He said with a villainous smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!' Johnny shouted in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go back to your....semi free state. For now.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to find a way to kill you.\" Johnny promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day you're going to beg me to forgive you for that.\" Juice said. \"But for now, we have to go see your dead parents so move your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin led Johnny downstairs near the door leading outside where Lesley and Wesley were standing.<br>\r\nLesley gasped. \"Johnny...are you...ok?\" She asked, looking at his face. \"You don't look so good.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley and Justin looked at him, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that Johnny had pink eye, his skin was an unusual pale color and there were purple bags under his eyes from lack of sleep. He looked like a waking nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks like he ate shit last night.\" Juice said non-chalantly. Wesley started laughing out-loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLesley slapped the back of Justin's head. \"JUSTIN!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Aunt Lesley...\" Johnny said. \"I--I was up crying all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Lesley reached over and slapped the back of Justin's head again for good measure.<br>\r\nJohnny could almost grin, seeing that his response caused that to happen. It was a minor victory but still a victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached out and rubbed his left cheek. \"Here sweetie, take this pill. I don't have any water but this will help if you can just swallow it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...he can swallow that and more...\" Wesley muttered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that Wesley?\" Lesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright well we have to get a move on boys. Lets get going.\" Lesley said as she opened the door outside.</span></div></div>",

So the arrangements I made...your parents have been cremated. I figured it was best due to their....injuries not to have an open casket viewing and cremation is better for the environment...usually anyway.

There's a kind of wake...just family photos being shown on the screen. There will be a point for anyone to speak if they want..I have a priest who will say a prayer, I know your father was religious. Then we will all visit the grave to see the monument. I'll give you your parent's urns after the funeral.\" Lesley said. She then looked at Wesley and Justin \"and YOU TWO.

Treasured family photos were playing slide after slide.<br>\r\nThere was a pianist softly playing a melody and there were tables and tables of food.<br>\r\nA few people Johnny didn't recognize were standing near the doorway blocking the path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of them apologized and when they saw him and how ragged he looked they several said \"Sorry for your loss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the third person to so, Wesley just rudely sighed and said \"He has pink eye he's not crying or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that most of the crowd backed away from Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's not a big deal for just him I was related to them too...right?\" Wesley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was legitimately asking a question but everyone around him assumed he meant it in a rude, snarky way. Then everyone started apologizing to him and that they were sorry for HIS loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, I'm sorry for my loss too...wait a minute.\" Wesley said, looking around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! Finally this funeral isn't such a downer!\" Wesley said, a few of the relatives heard him and gave him a strange look that Wesley either ignored or didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Wesley dashed for the food table and grabbed a plate, throwing different foods on it faster than greased lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley started eating what was on his plate as he walked back over to Johnny and Juice.<br>\r\nHe grabbed some chips and threw them in his mouth chomping down on them. His mouth opened as he<br>\r\nwas chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys wanna sit down? Standing here by the door seems stupid.\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin shrugged. \"Sure why not. Why don't you join us, Johnny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley turned to look at Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Johnny....\" *bbbbuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrp* \"why don't you join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys found three seats near by that were next to each other. Wesley bent over to sit down, but something in the corner caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH no way! They have drinks too!\" He said gleefully. He straightened his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here hold this!\" He said, giving his plate to Johnny and unintentionally mind controlling him to hold the plastic plate as he walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry he's being so disrespectful...\" Juice said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...sure you are.\" Johnny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Juice asked. \"Hey I helped plan parts of this funeral. This is a big deal to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Johnny said. \"Can't you guys just...let me speak to my family? Please? You can't be so cruel that you're going to take that away from me.\"<br>\r\nJuice put his arm around Johnny's shoulder with a big grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ARE your family, Johnny.\" He said. \"and I'm here for you if you need to talk, about<br>\r\nANYTHING. Feelings of remorse... regret... being in the closet. Whatever you want. It's what your parents would have wanted from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What my parent's...\" Johnny started to rage. \"Would've wanted? Don't pretend like you planned this funeral, this was all Lesley you didn't do ANYTHING.\" He shouted, and a few family members who heard him looked over at him. Johnny had to apologize out-loud to Juice so he didn't look like an asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after everyone turned away he looked at Justin and his face turned red with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't do SHIT!\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. Stop saying that. You're going to make me cry.\" Juice said with a completely blank expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EARLIER today you said that we were coming here to CELEBRATE my parents death and NOW you're acting like you're their fucking representative. I HATE you so much you pompous little shit!\" Johnny said, his anger getting worse and worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ARE here to celebrate your parents death. You SHOULD celebrate death, not mourn it you fucking tard.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your parents were important to me but not to you I guess.\" Juice said.<br>\r\nBefore Johnny could reply he got a tap on his shoulder and turned to see Wesley who had another plate in his hands and a drink as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here can you hold this too?\" Wesley asked, holding out the drink in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was forced now to hold the plate and the drink for Wesley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" he said, sitting down on a long forgotten about Ricky who was still lodged in his ass crack completely unseen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whose funeral was this again?\" Wesley asked, leaning over to look at his brother Juice who was sitting on the other side of Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents.\" Johnny said.</span></div></div>",

He could see other members of his distant family he recognized from a distance and wouldn't mind seeing again but they were on the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....I see the pictures...\" Wesley said. \"But I can't place them....\" Wesley said.<br>\r\nJohnny was stunned. \"What? you came over to our house a lot...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well I remember you because you're annoying. But I don't remember them too well....\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's YOUR AUNT and UNCLE! That woman, my mother, is literally your mother's SISTER. How do you NOT remember?!\" Johnny asked, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez! Calm down! I don't know why I don't remember them I just don't really. They look familiar but....\" Wesley started.<br>\r\n\"You're fucking retarded if you can't--\" Johnny was cut off by Wesley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Siri who is Benjamin and Mary Anne Dewitt?\" Wesley asked his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. I found something on the web for 'who is Benjamin and boot it.' Take a look.\" Siri responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STUPID phone!\" Wesley said in aggravation. \"Hey siri!\" He yelled louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind Siri.\" Juice said loud enough for the phone to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say.\" Siri responded, shutting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wesley, it's Johnny's parent's...you remember the ones who gave us those remote controlled monster trucks that one Christmas forever ago?\" Juice reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOHHHHHHH them?\" Wesley asked, immediately remembering now. \"Meh, those things weren't as cool<br>\r\nas the commercials made them seem?\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember how the commercials were saying how cool they were? They had that one with the flames painted on it and the other with skulls and stuff. We played with them for like 5 minutes. If that's their best I guess these two aren't a real loss, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was seething. \"They're still my parents you jackass!\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah yeah right, I knew that.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you remember the gift but not the people who got it for you?\" Johnny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I remember them now, kind of... I was just--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kind of remember my parents?...They bought you the cool monster trucks and sent them to your house as a gift....I wanted those too, and never got one.\" Johnny said.<br>\r\nWesley kind of snorted, laughing at Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you dodged a bullet because they sucked.\" Wesley said. \"I've always had more fun with action figures...\" Wesley said out-loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he said that it was like a light bulb went off for him in his mind, because his whole demeanor even down to the look on his face changed. Wesley got up out of his seat slightly, lifting his butt off of it by about 2 inches, then he sat back down. He did that a few times, clearly having just remembered Ricky's presence from the conversation he was having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny saw how Wesley was rubbing his ass against the seat ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Action figures have always been wayyyy more fun.\" He said with a hint of pleasure in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink.\" was all Wesley said. Johnny looked over at him wondering what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DRRRRINKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK.\" he said again, giving Johnny an annoyed look. Johnny handed the drink over to Wesley who took a few sips and handed it back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm going to go get some food too.\" Juice said out-loud. \"Back in a minute.\" Juice walked up and out of the row of seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the funeral home workers who was rushing around walked into Juice, almost knocking him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the HELL?!\" Juice said in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so sorry!\" The worker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show some respect!\" Juice said. \"My aunt and uncle just died!\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so sorry for your loss I didn't mean--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you didn't.\" Juice said, walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn it I wanted him to take this plate for me but forgot to ask. Here switch me.\" Wesley said, handing the empty plate to Johnny and taking the full one he had in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing you ate first thing this morning and don't have to worry about any of this food here, huh?\" Wesley asked with a smirk, referring to his shit. \"Come to think of it you don't have to drink anything either hahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny bit his tongue and prayed Lesley would stop mingling and come sit down next to them already so he wouldn't have to hear Wesley's annoying teenage voice remind him of how he ate Wesley's shit this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing to say?\" Wesley asked, snorting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more seconds of awkward silence went by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boyyyyyyyyy.\" He said, patting Johnny's head. \"That's a good Puffy dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your hand off me.\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what?\" Wesley said, continuing to pat him on the head like some animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out.\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'aaaaaawwwwwww you're so cute when you're angry.\" Wesley said, patting Johnny one last time and removing his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's what I thought.' Johnny thought to himself. 'Take your hand and get it away from me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out later when we go home that you're not the one in charge.\" Wesley said with that same smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juice told me in a text what you did upstairs with the stone....\" Wesley told him with a few short laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has something planned for you when we get home.\" Wesley told him.</span></div></div>",

He hated how Justin was still pretending that this all meant something to him somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, everyone.\" The priest said, drawing everyone's attention. \"Let's please all have a seat. I'd like to say a prayer and then open the floor up to any family member who would like to share their memories with the rest of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Lesley came over, shifting through the row and walking past all the boys, taking her seat to the left of Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you boys had some food. Did you eat, Johnny?\" She asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had a big meal this morning.\" Wesley snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I didn't see him eat this morning.\" Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley was at a loss. He didn't think about the fact that his mother would've noticed if he<br>\r\nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH uhhh I might be thinking of yesterday.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to eat something, Johnny.\" Lesley told him. Johnny's stomach felt upset, it was still churning the shit and diarrhea from this morning. Even thinking about food made Johnny want to throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" He falsely promised in an attempt to change the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like everyone is seated. If you may all bow your heads, I'd like to lead us in a prayer.<br>\r\nWe are gathered here today to mourn the loss of Benjamin and Mary Anne Dewitt.\" The Priest began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole family bowed their heads and listened to his prayer, but Wesley had his phone on<br>\r\nwhile everyone else had their eyes closed. Johnny saw the light in his eyes and he said \"Please put your phone away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLesley eye's snapped open. \"Wesley!\" she whispered intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wesley put the phone away.\" Justin added. \"This is your Aunt and Uncle's funeral! Grandma Betsy would have a cow if you---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WILL YOU SHUT UP!\" Johnny yelled out-loud, stopping the priest dead in his tracks. \"STOP<br>\r\nACTING LIKE THIS FUNERAL IS IMPORTANT TO YOU!\" Johnny told Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the relatives, the whole gathering now had their eyes set on Lesley, Johnny, Juice and Wesley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is important it's my Aunt and Uncle's---\" Juice started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP! JUST SHUT UP!!!!! YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THEM!\" Johnny shouted. People gasped and were murmuring in the crowd. People who didn't know were trying to figure out who was speaking and people who did know were shaking their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um...\" the Priest said, unable to determine what to do in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are! They ARE important to me, Johnny!\" Juice yelled back with crocodile tears in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO THEY WEREN'T STOP LYING!\" Johnny yelled, feeling everyone's judgey eyes on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLesley was stunned. She didn't know what to do she just sat there, staring at Johnny. She wasn't sure if she should hit him at his own parent's funeral or if she should let this blow over. Her mind was completely blank.<br>\r\nJuice got up and ran through the row of people, running out of the room and to the bathroom with fake tears in his eyes, purposefully causing a big scene.<br>\r\n\"Johnny!\" Lesley shouted, slapping him hard. She then gasped at her own action, covering her mouth with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny couldn't believe Justin had ran off crying. He was such a fake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin helped me plan this whole funeral.\" Lesley told him. Her words shook Johnny to the core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He really cared for his 'Uncle Benji' and 'Auntie Mary'. He always did!\" Lesley told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made a scene in front of everyone, why would do you that!?\" Lesley told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry everyone, please go on Father.\" Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priest cleared his throat. \"Ermherrrmm Right.\" The priest continued reading the prayer from his bible and Lesley whispered to Johnny. \"You had no right....NO right to make Justin feel like that. He has always loved your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny started to become confused, listening to Lesley. Did Justin really always love his mom and dad? Johnny wondered, thinking back. No he couldn't of right? Didn't he call them losers? Or did he just say that to look cool? Was he really that close with them? Truth be told Johnny had no idea because whenever the cousins would visit or whenever his family came to visit he did whatever was in his power to avoid them at all costs. Only interacting when absolutely necessary - like when an adult requested that they spend time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLesley continued her speech while the priest continued his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And at this time I would like to ask if any family would like to share their memories of the deceased with us today. Come on, don't be shy, anyone can come share their memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to share some memories.\" A voice said from the other end of the room. Everyone turned to see Justin standing in the corner of the room, his eyes looking red as if he had just spent some time crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin?\" Lesley asked, surprised he was going up and hoping he didn't say anything horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny watched as his cousin Justin approached the priest and took the microphone away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a brave young man you are.\" the priest said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin covered the microphone with his hand so no one could hear him speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off father, I'm not an alter boy.\" Justin told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old priest gasped, backing away from Justin and stepping down the stairs to where the podium was, allowing him to have his moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends, and family... thank you for being here for this...you may not know, but my name is Justin....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's mouth was almost agape just from him using his real name. He was racking his mind trying to figure it out, did Justin really care about his parents!? Did he just say all of those mean things before to piss Johnny off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, there's no way.' Johnny thought. 'He can't care for my parents....he called them losers like me....'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Johnny remembered something Juice said earlier today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You finally did something right and killed your parents, then you gave me the stone, literally putting your life in my hands.\" Johnny remembered Juice saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's right. There's no way he cares....he's evil. Lesley just doesn't know. This speech probably will be a load of bullshit!' Johnny thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just like that Lesley walked off with an adult, leaving Johnny with just Wesley and Juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin was the first one to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Johnny what do you think of your father's tombstone? I helped mom write them both, one for your dad and one for your mom. She wanted to surprise you with a perfect funeral and she couldn\u2019t handle all the work herself. It took me a few hours...\u201d Juice said. \u201c....but I think I nailed it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny looked at the tombstone. He was shocked to find nothing wrong with it. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Lies Benjamin DeWitt<br>\r\nThe loved ones whom hold your most precious gift still carry on.<br>\r\nMay they read this rite.<br>\r\nYour only son who must carry on; may he also be able to read this rite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin Is \u2764\ufe0fed. And In your son Johnny, Bless you for the gift that is his life, may the memory be everlasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is just...in is his God now, and just in his God may he be forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd God said \u201cMay all my free spirits continue to run freely; and may they be consumed outwith misery, nay... not with misery; but happiness without you there. May every single one of them be consumed with happiness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the angels said:<br>\r\n\"We slay those who would oppose you our dead and your living we shall protect. For precious are the memories of their gifts to us. Precious is your child to us and precious is the remainder of your family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may now Rest In Peace knowing the wish for your son will be realized. He is being watched over by God. God being just in everything he wants and does, anything he wants will be fulfilled. And He wants your son in His hands now. Guided by His will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin is \u2764\ufe0fed<br>\r\nAnd for him we wish this:<br>\r\nBurning he\u2019ll be not; forever be that soul most pure that gets shy tons as you always were. Be that soul that is forever remembered for your most precious gift; your son. For he is loved by God and you too, are loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny read it again, and he began to love it. Maybe Juice was just trying to be respectful for the majority of this funeral. He could've written something horrible on that stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy father was a devout catholic.\u201d Johnny said. Wesley yawned rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it was awkward for you to write all that, being an atheist. I like the part that says is loved. It gives it a nice modern touch with the emoji style icon...\u201d Johnny said finding this whole situation odd. He swallowed his pride and his hatred for Justin only this once. Even after everything he\u2019s seen this was his parents funeral and Justin\u2019s writing on the tombstone was extremely respectful. \u201cThank you for at least\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt actually reads I sharted. Get it? I shearted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley laughs. \u201cNo way!\u201d He snaps a photo for his Instagram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Actually the whole thing is one big hidden message. Want me to read it to you? Well I\u2019m going to anyway. So\u2026. it ACTUALLY says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Lies Benjamin DeWitt<br>\r\nThe loved ones whom hold your most precious gift still carry on.<br>\r\nMay they read this right.<br>\r\nYour only son who must carry on; may he also be able to read this right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin, I sharted and in your son, Johnny. Bless you for the gift that is his life, may the memory be everlasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is\u2026.that parts worthless ignore it.\u201d Juice said. \u201cBut right after the word is?\u2026 justin is his God now, and justin his God may he be forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd God,\u2019 oh that\u2019s me by the way, I\u2019m your god in case you missed that, dumbass.\u201d Juice reminded Johnny \u201cand god said; May all my free spirits continue to run freely; (my shit) and may they be consumed out with misery.\u201d Juice smiled at Johnny.<br>\r\n\u201cConsumed straight out of my asshole I mean. Now where was I? Blah blah May every single one of them be consumed with happiness. Meaning my happiness of course. Your misery. You follow it so far right? Like you\u2019re not completely retarded? Ok here we go\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the angels said:<br>\r\nWesley those who would oppose you are dead. Yada yada Precious is your child to us and precious is the remainder of your family. Yada yada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may now Rest In Peace knowing the wish for your son will be realized. He is being watched over by God (me again!!!).\u201d Juice waved.<br>\r\n\u201cGod being justin. Everything he wants and does... ANYTHING he wants will be fulfilled. And he wants your son in his hands now. Guided by His will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin, I sharted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for him we wish this:<br>\r\nBurn in hell ben; forever be that soul most pure that gets shit on as you always were. Be that soul that is forever remembered for your most precious gift; your son. For he is loved by God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s great, right? It\u2019s not perfect there are a few mistakes.\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley laughed hard, almost choking. \"This is too fucking great!\" he said, snapping more pictures, and then snapping one of Johnny's stunned face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey fag, get a picture of us would you?\" Wesley asked, handing his phone over to Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's body reacted but his mind was blank again. He couldn't process what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice had written a secret message in his father's cremation monument that only he, Wesley and Johnny would understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's body snapped photos of Juice and Wesley. Juice making a rock sign with his hand and Wesley looking at his wrist as if searching for a watch so he could get a better idea of when he would get out of here.<br>\r\nJohnny snapped picture after picture, zoning out and not really paying any attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helloooooooooo?!\" Wesley said, snapping his fingers in front of Johnny's face. \"You still in there?\" he tapped Johnny's head with his fist comically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me my phone.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\nWesley looked at the photo with a smile. \"This one will make us instagram famous!\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you....\" Johnny said. \"You desecrated my father's grave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Desca what?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhere on there...\" Juice said. \"I wanted to put Ben-jam-in my cock down his throat but I couldn\u2019t figure it out and gave up. This will have to do, I guess. There\u2019s only one problem. I haven\u2019t sharted in you yet.\" He said, looking at Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let\u2019s fix that. I took a lot of fiber last night after the Chinese food and all this talk of sharting made me realize I reaaaaaally have to take a massive shit. I mean, you promised mom you'd eat anyway, right?\"</span></div></div>",

They recognized him from his speech, and thought he was crying while he was up on the podium. Some of the relatives gave Johnny a mean look, also recognizing him as the shitty teen who told his own mourning cousin that he didn't care about the death of his aunt and uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the bathroom alone was daunting for Johnny, but his fear and hatred only increased when they finally entered.<br>\r\nJuice opened up the door to the bathroom, holding a hand out in the air ushering Johnny to go inside like he was a gentleman holding a door for a lady.<br>\r\nThe boys entered and Juice saw two sets of stalls and several urinals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. we have the bathroom all to ourselves.\" Juice observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a true psychopath, Juice had walked up to the first stall in the middle of the room instead of the one at the end of it; the stall he chose was closest to the urinals and the sinks and next to another stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny stepped inside first, and Juice after, Juice closing the stall door and locking it with a grin behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your knees.\" Juice's teen voice echoed in the small confines of the stall, his speech bouncing off all of the walls causing it to sound more intimidating than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny got on his knees and stare up into Juice\u2019s eyes with seething hatred that was visible on his facial expression as a scowl with a look that could kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you pretend to give a shit about my parents?\u201d Johnny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust to fuck with you. Pfff I never expected you to interrupt their service.\u201d Juice said with a half-laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve ruined EVERYTHING!\u201d Johnny yelled as Juice edged past him slightly, ignoring his outcry and inspecting the toilet instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had the outburst...I was being an angel the whole time.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy father\u2019s cremation monument... you descecrated it.\u201d Johnny said.<br>\r\nJuice ignored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww man these toilet seats have the fucking slit in the middle. You see this shit?\u201d Juice asked. \u201cThey\u2019re just like two \u2018legs\u2019 not attached instead of a circle. I wanted to put the toilet seat on top of your neck and choke you while I shit. Gaaaaay.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well.\u201d He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou- did you HEAR ME?!? YOU DESECRATED MY FATHER\u2019S CREMATION MONUMENT!!\u201d Johnny yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard you the first time like 30 minutes ago. It's not a big deal. Honestly, if you think that\u2019s something wait til you see your mother\u2019s pffhaha!\u201d Juice snickered. \u201cIt\u2019s even BETTER!\u201d He admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow...would you put your head in the bowl please? Thanks.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny put his head in the toilet bowl while leaning back. His neck fit perfectly between the slit in the toilet seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny found himself starring up at a light above the stall, a frothy, thick smell swathed around his face like two thick layers of clothing on a winter\u2019s night. The essence of this smell was made up of urine and shits past, and the most abominable scum and bacteria known to man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny heard Juice unzip his pants, but he couldn\u2019t see him yet because his head was locked in place where Juice wanted it.<br>\r\nThe next noises Johnny heard was Juice\u2019s pants falling to the floor.<br>\r\nJuice\u2019s naked backside came into view as he bent over. He didn\u2019t even bother to look back at Johnny or mock him. He intended to just drop his ass down on the toilet like everything was normal.<br>\r\nJuice stopped his descent with his ass a measly 4 inches from Johnny\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait....something doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d He said, leaving his ass in front of Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice\u2019s perfect skinny white ass was hovering above blocking Johnny\u2019s view of anything normal.<br>\r\nJuice stood straight back up, turned around and looked down at Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Here comes the mocking. I knew it.\u2019 Johnny thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you believe in God Johnny?\u201d Justin asked in a completely different tone of voice than usual. It sounded like a legitimate question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrow a conscious did you, you fucking demon brat? Suddenly you have a moral compass?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just....\u201d Juice began as he leaned over the toilet, fumbling and making noises with<br>\r\nsomething above that Johnny couldn't see. \u201cWell I was thinking.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a first.\u201d Johnny mocked, trying to get in a few figurative licks before he would be forced to put in some literal ones; throwing punches before he would lose the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father was a catholic so I wasn\u2019t sure what your belief was. I\u2019m an atheist, as you know.....\u201d Juice said changing his tone to that polished arrogance he would only pull out when he was really excited about torturing Johnny, or had just come up with the perfect idea to make him miserable. Johnny recognized the tone immediately, watching as Juice brought over one of those paper toilet seat covers that are designed to put a protective layer between your ass and any potential bacteria. Juice casually fit it to the seat, noticing Johnny\u2019s eyes watching him.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better. That\u2019s what was wrong, I didn't have some kind of spiritual realization. I was just wondering if you were a believer.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m agnostic if it makes any FUCKING difference.\u201d Johnny cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really make any fucking difference to me.\" Juice said with a cold, emotionless voice. \"But you\u2019re unsure? So you think there COULD be a God, like it is possible.\u201d Juice said.<br>\r\nJohnny didn\u2019t respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want my shit to be special, I mean it already is, name\u2019s Juice after all....\u201d he snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWesley... he used mind control to make you eat his. You\u2019re going to eat mine willingly.\u201d Juice said matter-of-factly.</span></div></div>",

It hit me a moment ago, that I mentioned killing his family while I throat fucked you, and I figure 'why not?' See, I don't believe in fairy tales or magical sky beings. I don't believe I'll have any punishment to face later for the things I do. I believe in real things. I believe in science.\" Juice said. \"and scientifically speaking, I'm the closest thing to God you have. I have absolute control over you and everything you do. That's why you're going to call me God and then willingly eat my shit. Then you're going to thank me for it after I wipe my ass with your tongue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no that's not....I won't.\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice shrugged. \"I get what I want either way.\" He said, turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!!!!\" Johnny yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice's turned back to face Johnny again, getting his god awful ass out of Johnny's line of sight. He had an expectant look as he gazed down at Johnny, waiting for his response with the impatience of a small child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds of silence went on. \"I feel like I have to drop a 6 pound deuce, and I don't have all day so you need to figure it out, shit for brains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll do it.\" Johnny said, figuring that Juice had a point; he was going to get what he wanted either way. Even if Johnny didn't do it willingly Juice would just mind control him. The only difference between one option and the other...was the death of an innocent family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice, dipshit.\" Juice smiled down at Johnny who had no idea that his words gave Juice an instant erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you'll have to do exactly what I say...\" He started. \"But before that... do you believe in<br>\r\nGod, John 'Dipshit' Dewitt?\" Juice asked again, turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice bent down and moved his ass in a circular motion in the air above Johnny, mocking him and reminding him of Juice's impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes.\" Johnny forced himself to say, hearing Juice call him by the nickname he and Wesley had came up for him years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't sound too sure so let me ask you again. Maybe you'll have an epiphany. Do you believe in God?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny wanted to die instead of Ricky's family, but he knew he wouldn't be that lucky. At this point it was better to just play along with this sadistic teen and give him what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES I believe in God. You're my God, Juice.\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm? Me? Your God? Well I have ALWAYS been better than you and I DO always get what I want...so I guess it makes sense. Plus you could easily be a virgin sacrifice.... Guess if you want to worship me, why would I complain?\" Juice asked, pretending he didn't just blackmail Johnny into saying what he wanted to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I want to worship you....\" Johnny added for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you weak little fag, why don't we start hmm?\" Juice said, plopping his ass down on the toilet bowl, and in turn on Johnny's face as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you push your head into the toilet water and baptise yourself in my name?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe listened and heard Johnny push his head into the toilet bowl water and his cock twitched in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not into the whole ass kissing thing like Wesley is but...I have to admit it's a decent act of submission...and well, since I'm your God and all if you worship me I'll give you shit.\" Juice hinted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny bent his neck up getting closer to his cousin's rear end. His lips quivered in defiance and the earthen smell of ass encumbered him. He found it difficult to purse his lips together and lean in for the smooch, not only because of the humiliation of it all but also because of the smell. He also hated that doing so would just inflate Juice's ego, and unlike Wesley, Juice took great pleasure in mocking Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Johnny sighed leaned in and started to kiss Juice's ass. He had no choice, he had to save Ricky's family.<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Juice to start the ridicule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think your dead catholic father would feel right now if he saw your head in a public toilet kissing my ass and worshiping me like a god? Hmm?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he would disown you when he saw how low you'd become, just a bottom feeder for your little cousin!? Hahahahha!\" Juice was having a field day with this level of humiliation, even adding the word little to his speech to have a greater impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dignity Johnny was sacrificing to save lives of people he barely knew was hilarious and arousing to Juice. So much so that the cold, heartless teen was upset that he hadn't thought of blackmailing Johnny before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get those lips around my asshole, gay boy. I have some treats waiting for youuu.\" Juice practically sang.</span></div></div>",

It had been apparent that Juice has been sweating, dressed in a monkey suit while standing outside in the summer heat. Johnny with his empathetic nature remembered where his best friend Ricky was, and felt pity for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith ease and without flatulence Juice put pressure on his bowels and immediately pushed out a small ball of shit into his older cousin's mouth.<br>\r\nJohnny coughed and cringed at the minor little shit plopping into his mouth past his lips and landing smack on his tongue. He still hadn't recovered from the shit train and diarrhea Wesley shared with him earlier. His stomach was in knots and he was breaking out in a sweat. His whole body still ached from earlier, and this was just making it worse. He couldn't hold it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny turned his head and threw up, pushing the tiny turd out of his mouth. His body started quivering from head to toe and he found it difficult to breathe clean air; his head trapped inside of a toilet bowl with his young cousins ass directly above him. It was like his face was trapped in a sauna with how much heat was emanating off of Justin's ass, but it didn't explain why he was breaking out in a cold sweat right now with a warm body temperature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just throw THAT up?\" Juice asked. \"That was nothing... not even an appetizer. If you can't make it past that, how am I supposed to enjoy this?\" Juice asked. \"If you can't eat it then I'll just shit on your face now and kill Ricky's family while he watches later on.\"<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you think Ricky's father will feel underneath my shoes when I crush him to death?\"<br>\r\nJuice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you can't!\" Johnny said, his voice taking on a different sound from inside the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I can. Nothing can stop me and apparently you don't have what it takes to entertain me so I'll have to settle for killing Ricky's parents.\" Juice's voice sounded like a verbal shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll entertain you Juice...\" Johnny coughed. \"My stomach is just upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not an excuse. If you want to keep my interest you have to keep it interesting.\" Juice said, repeating what he said when he throat fucked Johnny earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny remembered him saying that he had to prove he was a better cock sleeve than a sock so in this case Johnny assumed he had to be more interesting than a regular toilet.<br>\r\nJohnny bent his neck and licked Juice's ass cheeks willingly, figuring that might be something to keep him interested and hopefully keep him from killing innocent people. Johnny's actions sent a tickle rippling up Juice's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypically Juice didn't enjoy ass play, but the thought of his annoying, straight older cousin willingly licking his ass while he takes a shit was much more enjoyable than forcing him to do it with the magic of the stone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You know you really are a pathetic---\" Juice's thought was cut short when he heard someone opening the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" he whispered. \"Legs up, LEGS UP!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny shot his legs up, praying to God whoever just entered didn't just see two sets of legs in one stall or there would have to be some explaining to do. Johnny pressed his legs against the stall door, above the visibility of the opening below.<br>\r\nWith his legs high in the air and pressed against a wall, the position of Johnny's head in the toilet changed; and he could no longer reach his lips up to Juice's ass with ease because this movement put him at an angle.<br>\r\nBut that wasn't even the worst part about this newfound position.... Johnny soon found the back of his head submerged in the toilet bowl water behind him. The cold bacteria ridden toilet bowl water soaked the back of his head matting down his hair with invisible molecules of feces and urine from potentially thousands of grieving men that have passed through here.<br>\r\nHe felt his whole face turn red when he heard the person who entered sit down in the toilet stall next to the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'FOR FUCK SAKES!' Johnny thought in his mind. 'PLEASE LEAVE!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn it.\" Johnny heard a youngish voice say from the other stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...umm dude in the other stall....do you have any toilet paper to spare? I have to take a wicked dump and apparently the workers here don't restock shit. Oh sorry about my language.\" The young person said, realizing it could've been disrespectful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah it's ight. I gotchu fam.\" Juice replied trying to sound cool but making Johnny cringe. Juice reached over to his toilet paper holder and pulled out the extra roll he had, passing it over to the young man in the other stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god you're not some old person, I swear to god if I get lectured one more time today...\" the voice said. Johnny heard a fart erupt in the other stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice started casually pushing on his bowels now, and the sound of the shit inside his rectum contorting and being forced out reverberated in his stall, especially inside the toilet bowl where Johnny's head was still located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha I know what you mean. So how are you related to the ashes in the box?\" Juice asked, referring to Johnny's dead parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, sorry.\" The voice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta do what you gotta do.\" Juice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how I'm related. Someone married someone from the family line or something...umm somehow related to the dead man.\" The voice answered. \"Honestly didn't pay much attention...this whole thing has been such a drag. What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were my aunt and uncle.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH shit, I'm so sorry!\" the voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guuci bro.\" Juice said. \"They weren't that important to me.\" He said. \"And now we have their loser fucking son, my cousin living with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fuck you!' Johnny said in his mind, but kept it to himself. He didn't want to reveal he was in here, and he also remembered that Ricky's families lives were on the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahaha, tough life man.\" The voice answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny could hear the voice grunting, but that was the least of his worries. He saw Juice's puckered asshole open up revealing the tip of a turd poking out of it. Johnny's body shivered at the sight, the toilet water rippling around his head from his movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, tell me about it.\" Juice said, increasing pressure on his intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take much effort from Juice, his bowel movements somehow as quiet as a church mouse. He didn't have to fart at all, his shit just slid out smoothly from his asshole into Johnny's now open mouth flowing like a hot secretion from an ice cream machine.<br>\r\nJohnny held back his vomit as his younger cousins shit flowed into his mouth. The unbroken turd continued to coil around in circles, choosing Johnny's mouth to be the prime location to gather into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to....hold it in.\" The voice said from the next stall over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean you don't have to wait for me to leave to...go you know.\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm not.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, I just didn't hear anything happening.\" The voice said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johnny sighed. He knew Juice found what that other teenager said to be emasculating, and if Johnny didn't do something, Juice would blame that teen's impression of him on Johnny. Saying that Johnny didn't make his shits sound masculine enough or that the lack of noise made him seem like a pussy because his poop was flowing into Johnny's mouth instead of into the toilet water, where, Johnny thought, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny bent his neck up and simultaneously swallowed as much shit as possible, breaking it down by chewing rapidly. He worked his way toward Juice's ass and then slammed his head backwards into the toilet water to make a splashing noise so that Juice wouldn't suffer from any humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit.\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff yeah hahaha mine come out like bombs dude.\" Juice said, bragging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God fucking damn you're not kidding.\" The voice said. Johnny could hear the other teens bowel<br>\r\nmovements from inside the toilet, and he started to cry wondering when this would end. It was horrible that Juice found a way to blackmail him like this, and Johnny began to wonder if there was any way he could escape Juice's evil clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll think of a way to escape on the drive home.' Johnny told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Right now I have to figure out a way to save Ricky's family and I have to keep Juice entertained.' He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny wasn't sure if he should be grateful or pissed that some random teen was taking a shit in the next stall. On one hand Juice wasn't mocking him during all this but on the other, he wasn't sure Juice was noticing all the effort Johnny was putting in to keep him entertained. And if Juice went on without being entertained, he would use that as an excuse to kill Ricky's parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny found himself worrying so much about Juice killing other people that he almost immediately come up with ways to 'entertain' Juice. Johnny knew that Juice took great pleasure in torturing people and making them out to be lesser than he was. So Johnny figured he would get a kick out of emasculating someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nothing would be more emasculating than licking some guy's ass and kissing it after every piece of his shit entered your mouth.'<br>\r\nJohnny thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at Juice's stained pucker as he swallowed the last bit of Juice's feces with tears in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't know if I can do this.' He thought, seeing the shit coated in Juice's ass crack from that massive turd he just shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny cringed, closed his eyes and bent his neck upwards straining it as he leaned in to lick Juice's ass clean from that last piece of shit.<br>\r\nHis tongue glided right over all of the ass pubes Justin had, tickling him as they grazed it.<br>\r\nAs if the smell taste and embarrassment weren't enough, Johnny felt the tingling of pleasure ripple up Juice's spine like it was a cold chill down his back. His body cooed with bliss, feeling his older cousins sloppy wet tongue run up and down his pube filled crack like his own personal interactive wet wipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny leaned forward and kissed each one of Justin's ass cheeks in a respectful, thanking manner.<br>\r\nJohnny moved his head forward to kiss Juice's asshole, and as soon as his lips graced it, his younger cousin farted into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PFffffthahahahahaha!\" Juice shamelessly laughed with glee, knowing that his fart was much more than that; technically having been more of a shart that he let loose right into his cousins mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny wanted to kill himself right now. He wanted to cut his lips off, cut his own tongue out and all the shit coated on it with it, and also slice his ears off because the sound of his cousin Justin's obnoxious laughing was the most repellent noise he's ever heard; it was ranked right up there with Wesley's everyday voice. The only thing preventing Johnny from creating a plan of killing himself was his desire to stick around and watch Wesley and Justin get smacked by karma, or even better his vengeance. He knew his revenge would be poetic justice, because he planned on torturing the two of them but not exactly in the same way they were him. No. He was going to physically hurt them. He knew one way or the other, justice would be served and he had to be there to see it. But for now he had to deal with Justin's laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice laughed harder than he had ever heard in his entire life, feeling so happy that he was able to blackmail his pathetic older cousin into being his little bathroom slut with such a simple idea. If he had known it would be this easy, he decided he would've done it a long time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughter Juice released created an awkward situation in the bathroom, what with someone else being in it and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok in there?\" the teen's voice asked... \"sound like you're having a spasm...or... something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine man.\" Juice said, getting a little annoyed at this random person ruining his fun now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure, because honestly it sounded like you were having a little too much fun there....\" the voice said, making this even more awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, I'm sure. I was just realizing how cold this toilet water felt....\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How cold the toilet water felt? The fuck?\" The voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't get it? Oh sorry, your dick must not be big enough.\" Juice responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHH!!!!!!!!!!\" The voice started laughing. \"Fucking GOOD one dude!\" The voice added.<br>\r\nJohnny heard the teen flush his toilet and step out of the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn are you still going?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah man, my morning shits are always like this. Drop like bombs but take forever to form up, you know? Oh look here goes another one.\" He lied, expecting Johnny to make a good impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny bent his neck up again toward Juice's ass, he even pecked it with a kiss for good measure before he slammed his head back down into the toilet water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, well...\" the voice began, turning on the facet water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water almost immediately switched off, like he put no effort into washing his hands. \"see you later I guess.\" The voice said as the door opened and he walked out of the bathroom.</span></div></div>",

Johnny bent his neck up, wanting to bash his head against a wall until his brain matter splattered everywhere for even thinking of what he was about to do. He passionately kissed Juice's ass and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahahahahah!\" Juice laughed out-loud, realizing what Johnny just did. \"You're such a thoughtful asswipe. I'm really glad you're learning.\" Juice said. \"And there's more shit for youuuuu.\" He told Johnny, putting pressure on his lower intestines again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny saw the turd poking out of Justin's asshole and braced himself by opening his mouth, and trying to mentally prepare for the taste of human waste.<br>\r\nAgain, the shit effortlessly slid out of Justin's opened asshole, but this time it dropped into Johnny's mouth like the bomb Juice had called it earlier.<br>\r\nThe impact of the feces felt like someone threw a burning piece of coal into Johnny's gullet, but rather than a hot burning sensation from the coal, that was replaced instead with a viscous smoggy incense that engrossed the very air inside the toilet bowl.<br>\r\nJohnny gagged, trying not to disappoint Justin by throwing up again but he could smell the remnants of last night's chinese food and something else, probably a meal Juice had eaten before that all wrapped up into one malodorous smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choke on that, bitch.\" Juice said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny saw his first bit of light as Justin bent over for some reason. Johnny watched Juice start wiping with a piece of toilet paper. While Juice wiped thoroughly Johnny chewed up the solid turd and slowly worked most all of it down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Johnny finished he found Justin's smug face looking down and back at him. Johnny could see the expanse of Juice's back. His ass cheeks closest to him but his smiling face looming far overhead, very much removed from the suffering Johnny was going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up.\" Justin said, grinning. Johnny obeyed willingly, opening his mouth and Justin stuffed the toilet paper into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it open, fag.\" Juice said. \"oh and put your legs down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny put his legs down, allowing him to finally pull the back of his head from out of the toilet water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice got up, clearly having finished with his shit session. From what Johnny could tell, he looked like he had been thoroughly entertained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your mouth open...\" Juice said, milking his blackmail for all it was worth. The brat turned around and pulled out his dick, which was fully erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why isn't you head in the water like it was?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny pushed the back of his head back down into the toilet bowl and Justin unleashed a torrent of piss that soaked the top of his head. He started aiming his dick in different places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey open up your eyes. I want to add some more color to them hahahahahahah.\" He laughed, aiming his stream at Johnny's closed eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Johnny opened them, Justin pushed harder, and his stream hit his right eye at full force, burning it to the point that Johnny could scream. He aimed to the right, hitting Johnny between the eyes and then to the right some more, hitting Johnny's left eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" He said, bringing his piss down to Johnny's open mouth, and the piece of shitty toilet paper that was still in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never looked better!\" Juice said, pissing into Johnny's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Juice's piss stream hitting a surface was echoing in the chamber of the toilet bowl but sounded normal to Juice, like he was just taking a regular piss. The only difference was there was no sound of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice's stream went from powerful to weak and then weaker. Soon only droplets were left, and Juice waled over toward the side of the toilet, purposefully making sure each and every drop of his piss had an opportunity to ruin Johnny's face. He let droplets fall right onto Johnny's eye, smiling down at him as he shake his dick like a wet dog shakes off rain from his fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well I guess I don't have to wash my hands. See you later.\" Juice said, walking out of the stall and the bathroom, leaving Johnny's head in the toilet, a sobbing broken mess.</span></div></div>",

I never saw you enter the bathroom and I didn't see you at the urinal when I washed my hands..where the fuck were you?\" The teen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny looked to Juice for help. He knew how witty Juice usually was with these kinds of things, and he was running out of ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck? Really?\u201d Juice asked, facing Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere were you hiding in there? No wait! What were you doing in there?! Were you watching us<br>\r\nfrom somewhere?

Did you lick out of the toilet!? Well did you, you freak?! DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY FOR YOURSELF!?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny looked at both of them, tears welling up in his eyes and he ran. He just ran. He booked it for outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked everywhere in the crowd for Lesley but couldn't find her. Then he saw her speaking to a group of 5 adults. He ran toward that group of adults, wanting to cry.<br>\r\nHe approached Lesley who looked at him with a stunned face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Johnny!?\" Lesley said, \"Are you ok!?\" she asked him. \"You're all wet.\" She said. \"Please excuse us.\" she asked all of the adults, who quickly dispersed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny started crying and hugged her tightly, his dignity and pride completely shattered by her son Justin. But yet, he was unable to tell her what happened. So he just breathed heavily and cried into her shoulder like a little kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the funeral.\" he said in between tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLesley hugged him tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Justin.\" Johnny heard Lesley say. \"There you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I am.\" Justin said. \"Whoa, Johnny are you ok?!\" He asked, faking concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he's just upset from all of this...\" she said. \"I think we should leave. Well, actually..I was kind of hoping you, Wesley and Johnny could go out and do something... some relatives and I were going to go out to dinner and I doubt any of you guys want to listen to a bunch of old people talking.\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take me with you!\" Johnny sobbed into Lesley's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Johnny. I think you should be with Justin and Wesley. They're really kind boys and they'll help you get through this. You just have to leave here, that's all. Here, I'll give you boys some money.\" Lesley reached into her purse and pulled out hundreds of dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed them to Justin, ignoring the fact that Johnny was the eldest boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and Johnny..I have a surprise for you back at the house. I'll show you later when I get home, ok? Unless you find it first.\" She said. She looked Johnny in the eyes, and grabbed him by the shoulders. \"But for now, go have some fun, ok?\" Lesley asked Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, we will.\" Justin said, grinning.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The poor young adult gasped for air like it was the first time he'd had any in well over an hour, and for all anyone knew, it very may well have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley tossed Ricky mid-air towards Johnny who quickly opened up his palms and caught him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's all yours, dude.

Ricky looked up at Johnny with malice and enmity in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you. I FUCKING HATE YOU!!!!!!!\" Ricky yelled at Johnny. \"THIS IS ALL YOUR FUCKING FAULT!!!!!!!!!!!!\" He screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny ignored him for now and stuffed him into his right pocket, and the underwear in his left. He felt a tear run down his cheek. His best friend had no idea what he just went through to save his family. No idea of anything he had been through or what happened. Ricky was only up Wesley's ass for an hour or so, he didn't have to eat Juice's shit at his own parent's funeral. But that didn't matter. Ricky may not have been through as much or even understood what Johnny had went through, the fact was Ricky didn't care. Ricky genuinely believed everything to be Johnny's fault. Everything. His mind was too twisted by the cousins, so much that he sought their approval at every turn now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny walked out of the bathroom and over to his two younger cousins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Wesley and I are gonna go blow these hundreds at my friend Lit's place. He's coming to pick us up. Gonna make it raaaaaaain!!!!\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're too much of a fucking loser to join us, so for that reason... here's $3 dollars.\" Juice said, handing over 3 crumpled 1 dollar bills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to run an errand for us. I order you to go to the pet store and buy some rat food. Then, I want you to walk home and put Ricky in the cage in my room with his new rat food. Then you can take out my brother's boxer shorts and put the ass end of them over your face, and sit down next to my bed. You'll sit there in silence until one of us gets home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or until Mom gets home.\" Wesley added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, or if she gets home first, you can take the boxers off and move around then. Remember, only limited free will! You can't tell her what we're doing to you or any of that. That whole deal we made before still applies. Get it?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now fuck off.\" Juice said, and Johnny walked away, headed out of the funeral home where his parent's ashes were kept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Johnny forever walking out in the sweltering heat to make it to the pet store, which was on the opposite side of town from the house. Every so often He would pull Ricky out of his pants pocket when no one was around to make sure that he was ok and wasn't suffering from the heat outside, because Johnny was sweating bullets. He would be met with a scowl from his best friend and some harsh words but he just ignored them at this point, which only seemed to infuriate Ricky more. The whole walk Johnny felt sorry for himself and didn't think or do anything useful. He just felt like shit. Everywhere he went people seemed to be staring at him as well, no doubt the red of his eyes were giving people something to talk about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making the pit stop at the pet store he was ordered to go to Johnny began walking home. He had a bittersweet feeling about getting there, because he knew his body would automatically put the ass side of Wesley's boxers over his face when he arrived, so one half of him wanted to walk slowly. But the other half, which was dying in the summer sun, told him to hurry it the fuck up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Johnny reached the house and put miniature Ricky in his cage and set him up with rat pellets for food. Then Johnny sit down, next to the bed pulling out the loathed Wesley underwear, noticing the brown streak down the middle of them before plopping the ass end of them over his face like he was told.<br>\r\nHe sat there, sniffing Wesley's dirty skid marked underwear for hours. At least 3 hours went by, by which time Johnny had become intimately familiar with the stench of both Wesley's ass and his piss on the other side of the underwear. Then...3 more hours went by. Then the sun went down, and it was night fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an entire day of sniffing Wesley's underwear and being utterly forgotten, paralyzed and unable to move Johnny finally heard someone downstairs. Per what Juice said, he was finally able to remove the underwear and go downstairs to see who was here. To his relief, he saw his Aunt Lesley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey sweetie.\" Lesley said walking in. \"I'm sorry I'm back so late. I never get a chance to go out very often, and so I had a great time with some of the family. Are the boys here with you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they left you here?\" Lesley said with a tinge of disappointment in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well did you find your surprise?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sorry.\" Johnny said, having not been able to do much walking around the house these past few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let me show you!\" She said with a kind smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLesley led Johnny back up the stairs, and to the room between Wesley and Justin's. When she opened the door, all Johnny could do is stare in wonderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his new room. Fully loaded with brand new furniture, but decked out with all of his posters and belongings.<br>\r\nHe thought he was going to cry. He wasn't sure if he should be happy or not, because living here would be like a nightmare for him but at the same time this was the first act of kindness he'd received in awhile, so he just grabbed her tightly in a hug and wanted to never let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so very welcome.\" she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when an idea popped in his mind. A way he could escape from this place.</span></div></div>",

He pointed to the floor, where there was a bong out in the open.<br>\r\nShe gasped out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" She said, looking at the bong. \"My son....he's doing drugs?\" She asked. \"What else is he hiding from me!?\" She said, looking around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny wanted to laugh in his own mind. He just KNEW leading her here and showing her the bong would cause her to look around the room, and she would find Ricky in the cage. It was only a matter of time! He can't show her Ricky directly because of the mind control, and he can't show Ricky to her indirectly either. But technically, he wasn't. He was just showing her the bong and she was playing directly into his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLesley began her search near where she found the bong - by Justin's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That boy is going to have A LOT of explaining to do WHEN he gets back.\" She said with a scowl on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent down, looking under the bed and pulled out something she couldn't quite see.<br>\r\nIt was what appeared to be a wash cloth and it was wet with something. She held it up into the light and it immediately dawned on her.<br>\r\nSquealing and screaming out loud, she threw her son's cum rag across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" She screamed, walking out of the room. \"Come on Johnny get out of there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NO, NO!!!!!!!' Johnny yelled in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But don't you think you should keep looking?\" Johnny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't even look anymore, I think I lost vision in my eyes.\" she said, sounding completely grossed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh come the fuck on, I ate your son's SHIT! HIS LITERAL SHIT!!!!!!!!!' Johnny wanted to say, but couldn't. 'You're going to let a fucking CUM rag stop you?! You squeamish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped himself from calling her a cuss word in his mind. She was always kind to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny come with me downstairs.\" Lesley told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" Johnny said, disappointed in what went on in that bed room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them sat down at the table, and she spoke to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know this was in there?\" She asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just saw it in there when we were all......hanging out.\" Johnny said, referring to when Juice's dick was hanging out of his boxer shorts...literally<br>\r\n'hanging out' down his throat the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I messaged my son and he said he would be here soon. We're going to talk to him about this.\" Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait WE'RE going to talk to him about this?!\" Johnny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, please no.\" Johnny said with his limited free will. \"Can't you just say you found it!? Why do I have to be involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're older than he is, Johnny you can be with me when we speak to him. There's no reason to be afraid of him....\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny scoffed in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just a teen. That's all. But he can't be doing these drugs. He just CAN'T. That won't fly in my house.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you please leave me out of it?\" Johnny asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You're going to be here, and you're going to stand by this. You told on him because you're looking out for him. He needs to know that. When he gets in<br>\r\nhere, I want you to tell him how much you love him, and how much he means to you. That's the only way we're going to get him off of these drugs Johnny!\" Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't hear it. I will NOT hear it. You will be here and you will support me.\" She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot 5 minutes passed when Johnny heard the front door open and two very familiar laughs entering the house.<br>\r\nWesley and Juice walked by, noticing Lesley and Johnny sitting at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUSTIN ABERNATHY GOODWIN!!!!!!!!\" Lesley yelled in anger, seeing him walk into the house. \"GET IN HERE RIGHT THIS INSTANT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley gulped and said \"Hey...uhmm see you around bro.\" and darted upstairs before anyone could tell him otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin walked into the room, not knowing what to expect. His eyes darted over to Johnny and he had a cold, calculating expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin, Johnny here showed me something VERY interesting in your room.\" Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a fact?\" Justin said, staring at Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES that is a fact and cut the attitude RIGHT now. You're in deep shit young man DEEP shit.\" Lesley said. \"We have A LOT to talk about. Sit down.\"<br>\r\nJustin took a seat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what exactly did Johnny show you?\" He prodded, unsure of where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom Lesley pulled the bong out from the floor and set it on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin laughed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you THINK this is FUNNY?!\" Lesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\" Justin said. \"Was that ALL he showed you, or...ummm was that all you saw?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was thereeeeeee something ELSE I should have seen!?\" Lesley asked with sass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then lets talk about this.\" Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Justin said, staring at Johnny with an evil look. \"Let's talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now! You WILL NOT threaten him while he\u2019s living in OUR house. If you so much as lay a hand on him for this you\u2019re in HUGE trouble, do you understand? Your cousin is trying to HELP you.\u201d Lesley told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp me? Wait..what? ...What are we talking about? Mom its just a little weed.\u201d Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little weed!?\u201d She starts freaking out. \"JUST A LITTLE WEED!?\" She repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus Christ calm down you did the SAME thing when you were my age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-..I\u2026. Juice you know I love you, right?\u201d Lesley said. \"And you know Johnny loves you too, right?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d Juice eyeballing Johnny harshly from across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell him, Johnny.\" Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really love you, Juice.\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call him by his real name not that....\" Lesley sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really love you Justin. I just don't want you to become addicted to drugs. It's dangerous.\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been worried about you boys.\u201d She said. \"I just knew...\" tears started to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit...I did smoke weed when I was your age. But things were safer then\u2026\" Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it fair that you got to do it but I can't?\" Justin said. \"GOD YOU JUST RUIN EVERYTHING!\" he said with anger, getting up and slamming his hands down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLesley's tears started falling harder now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin, I love you please don't....\" Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, I'M SICK OF THIS!\" he shouted, throwing a literal tantrum. \"I NEVER get what I WANT!\" Justin screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was taken aback but scoffed in his own mind. 'Yeah, right.' He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin, calm down baby please. You're my son and I love you, we just want to help--\" Lesley started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T WANT YOUR FUCKING HELP!!\" Justin said, completely disrespecting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look baby ok ok, please! You're right, it wouldn't be fair to you if I've done it in the past....so I\u2019ll let you smoke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny stare at her with his mouth agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What did she just say?' He said in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But only in the house. But PROMISE me you have to PROMISE me you won\u2019t try anything harder than weed.\u201d Lesley added, tears still wet on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I promise.\u201d Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJustin.\u201d Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI PROMISE!\u201d Juice yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. You can have your bong back.\u201d Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin snatched it off the table angrily and walked upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny honey, you don't have to sleep in Wesley's room anymore, you can sleep in your own room. Unless you like the bunk bed more...\" Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok..\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go.\" she said, tears still on her face from her fight with her eldest son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny left the room going upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe faintly over heard a conversation between Wesley and Justin. 'what if I get the dog collar and---' Wesley was interrupted when Johnny finally made it to the top of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aughhht ohhhhh.\" Wesley said, like Johnny was about to be in real trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fucking dead.\" Justin said to him. \"You are SO fucking dead.\" Justin repeated</span></div></div>",

I'm going to be thirsty from all bugs I'm about to crush.\" Juice said, smiling at Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was beside himself in his mind. He was frantically fighting the mind control but it was no use. His body was moving downstairs and he found himself grabbing the two liter of coca-cola from the refrigerator. It didn't take him long to get back up the stairs and knock on Juice's door.<br>\r\n*KNOCK KNOCK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin opened up the door and let Johnny in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Johnny stepped into the room he saw that Ricky was in his old pet mouse Squeakie's cage on the floor beneath Juice, near his feet. Right next to Ricky's cage was a large aquarium-esque container. Johnny looked down and saw Juice and Wesley's pet frog Mr. Turdmaker staring through the glass at Ricky like he was a snack that was out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Juice said, snapping Johnny's attention back towards the teen as he took the glass and the coke out of Johnny's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice put the 2 liter of coke and the glass on the desk near by and motioned Johnny toward the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's body sat down on the bed. He was still unable to talk. Unable to convince Juice to not go through with this. He could see in Juice's eyes that cold, aloof expression. The kind of expression that made Johnny realize that this was going to be brutal.<br>\r\nAll Johnny could do was sit there and watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at Ricky with pity in his eyes, wishing he could undo all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice crouched down to the floor and then plopped his butt down on the ground, sitting next to Ricky's cage and peering down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-umm..\" Ricky said, looking up at Juice's empty expression. \"What's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing.\" Juice faked, even trying to smile. \"I was just wanting to know more about you. You have a family, right?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Ricky replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about them.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't do it.' Johnny tried to scream but could only make his voice raise higher in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...there's my mother, my father, my brother and my sister.\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Juice replied. \"Your siblings are older? Younger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My brother is older. My sister is only a year younger than me.\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. And can your brother swim?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I I don't know....\" Ricky said. \"I don't think so?\" He asked. \"I've never heard him talk about swimming. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wondering.\" Juice said. \"Wanting to know more about your life, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does my brother's swimming have to do with my life?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your sister pretty?\" Juice asked, ignoring his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She thinks so.\" Ricky said, rolling his eyes. His Stockholm syndrome was really showing now, because he started laughing out loud in a friendly manner toward Juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's always looking in a mirror and putting on make up.\" Ricky added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for telling me.\" Juice told Ricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice stood back up, towering over Ricky.

There was a pair of shoes on the floor that he easily slipped his naked feet into. The teen reached out toward the desk, unscrewed the cap to the 2 liter of coke and poured some into the glass that Johnny brought him earlier. Then he screwed the cap back on, saying nothing to no one. There was dead silence in the room as the plastic cap made a noise, twisting itself back onto the plastic bottle.<br>\r\nJuice sat the glass down on the desk and the 2 liter next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached over and touched the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want Ricky's mother, father, brother and sister here in little cages next to his. Make them as small as he is.\" Juice commanded of the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny watched from above as 4 tiny little cages materialized out of thin air on the floor below, right next to Ricky's cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? Dad?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo tiny people in separated cages turned around, hearing a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman began weeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ricky?\" she asked, looking at her son in a cage not far from hers. \"Ricky is that you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thought you were missing son!\" Ricky's father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the parent's blinded by love for their son were almost completely oblivious to their surroundings, but their teenage daughter was not. She let out a blood curdling scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! \" She screamed, pointing up toward the dark haired teenage boy who was towering over all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the atmosphere in the room became darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who the fuck---how?\" Ricky's brother asked, completely stunned and unable to form words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the FUCK?!?!\" Ricky's dad hollered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry guys.\" Ricky said in a quivering, unsure voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis whole family turned to face him, and saw now more than ever that he was not well. Even Ricky's parent's whole perception of him changed from when they first saw their son 2 seconds ago compared to what they were looking at now. He had an aura about him that was completely different from the son or brother they once knew and loved. They could see purple bags under his eyes, and an expression of pure horror and worry. Anxiety was written all over his face and his body and even voice trembled, even though the words he had spoken were positive ones. He didn't look like the brother or son they've known their whole lives. He changed. He wasn't even looking directly at them when he was speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Juice has always been kind to me.\" Ricky said in a voice that sent a chill down everyone's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny?\" Ricky's mother asked, having turned around in her cage and seeing him sitting there on the bed, normal sized and staring down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JOHNNY WHO IS THAT!?\" She asked, pointing toward Juice. \"Johnny HELP US!!!\" She cried, having already sensed her son was not well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Johnny sat still, unable to move. Hearing his best friend's mother's voice crying for help was tormenting him on a level that couldn't be explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny!?\" She asked again, her scared voice ringing through his ears and shattering his thoughts into a million pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Juice has always been kind to me.\" Ricky repeated out-loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET US GO!\" Ricky's father yelled up at Juice who stare down at him like an insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice ignored everyone's reactions and smiled down at Ricky's crying family.... at his feet like bugs. He bent over, reaching for Ricky's brother's cage.</span></div></div>",

She saw her brother clinging on to the metal bars, holding on and trying not to fall as the teen started effortlessly shaking the cage hard and positioning it so that gravity would be working against him. Ricky's sister started sobbing as her oldest brother was shaken out of a cage and into the palm of the teenagers hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET MY SON GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Ricky's father yelled up at Juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice ignored him. Not saying a word, Juice walked over toward the desk, holding the squirming little man in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT IS HE DOING WITH MY SON, JOHNNY!?\" The mother screamed, not even able to muster up the courage to look, facing instead toward Johnny who remain completely unresponsive to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JOHNNY PLEASE!\" Ricky's mother cried again, getting on her knees and grabbing the bars of the prison she was in. \"JOHNNY you've been over to our house....pl-please!

His head fell below the surface again as his efforts to keep it up became more and more futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice looked down on the family and as everyone elses gaze was set on Ricky's older brother, Juice's was on Ricky's youngest sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled down at her cage, but then turned to face his frog's terrarium. Juice bent over, his shadow looming over the whole family, and they all turned to watch him, scared out of their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent down and from out of everyone else's vision he pulled forward a clear can of grubs that was behind his frog's terrarium. The label on the grubs read \"Gulp! Live Feed for Frogs.\"<br>\r\nJuice popped the cap off of the container and reached into the can of grubs. He gathered up some of the dirt they were in, poured it into the lid and sat the lid in front of Ricky's sister's cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T TOUCH MY DAUGHTER!\" Ricky's dad shouted up at Juice who then merely glanced in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother turned to face her eldest son and screamed, seeing his body floating limply in the coke glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SAVE HIM DALE!!\" She screamed. \"Ricky!! YOU KNOW CPR!!!!

I know what you're GOING to do in a minute pffhahahah!\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Punish Johnny?\" Ricky's voice chimed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley stepped over to Ricky's cage and he pressed his face up against it and smiled, revealing his braces.<br>\r\nHis foul breath wafted in through the metal bars as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juice told me he had an epic plan on how to punish Johnny for telling on him to mom.\" Wesley said. \"He only let me in on half of it earlier.\"<br>\r\nWesley informed, sitting the dog leash down on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see anything happen?\" Wesley asked Ricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in the past is in the past.\" Juice answered for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky got back into the corner of the cage; hearing Justin's voice sounding dominant again brought great fear to him.

Then he looked up at the two boys towering over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooooooooooooooooooooo.............we doin this or WHAT?\" Wesley asked, impatient as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh definitely. But I just thought of something first. Know what Wes?\" Juice asked, locking eyes with Ricky in the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky quickly glanced away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you wouldn't swallow a grub whole.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky looked up at Juice, hearing what he just said, completely stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Yes I would.\" Wesley said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dare you.\" Juice said, grinning down at Ricky and then turning his gaze toward his brother Wesley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Wesley...\" Ricky's shaking voice came through just loud enough so the boys could hear him. \"Please that's---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you should be talking.\" Juice said, letting his voice carry over Ricky's. \"In fact, I think you should be quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny watched this whole transaction, seeing how Juice easily dominated the shrunken caged boy into keeping quiet about his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's??\" Wesley turned to face Ricky. \"That's what Ricky?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice glared at him from behind Wesley, causing Ricky to gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Say it!' Johnny thought in his mind, unable to speak. 'Say 'that's my sister!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny wanted to scream it for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...gross.\" Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so scared of Juice that he was unable to form the necessary words to defend his sister from the death Juice just sentenced her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Wesley said, getting a little offended and shaking Ricky's cage. \"Are you saying my mouth is gross again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky remain silent, putting his hands up to his eyes and sobbing into them at his failure to help his family, even now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to cry about it? REALLY? Well I for one think there are worse ways to go.\" Wesley said, picking up the grub between his finger tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, Mr. Grub?\" Wesley asked. \"There are worse ways to go than in my stomach, right?\" Wesley asked, pulling the grub up in the air and dangling it over his now open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have a fun trip, Mr. Grub.\" Wesley told Ricky's grub sister, flashing a smile and his braces at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just ate some cool ranch Doritos so it should smell nice in there.\" Wesley said, rubbing his stomach. \"OHhhhhhhhh and I also ate a ham sandwich too so you can actually say hello to the ham for me. I think it'd be cool if food could communicate, because I'd really appreciate if you could thank the pig for dying for me. He was yummy.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy kept on talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you will be too, right?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"I could never be a vegetarian like Ricky here, but I think it's important to be grateful for the food I have. You know? Like so thank you, Mr. Grub for your noble sacrifice. My asshole will whistle songs about you for generations to come. One fart at a time hahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky started sobbing really loudly now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH sorry Ricky, you're not a vegetarian anymore I meant no offense.\" Wesley put his other hand up as if telling the grub a secret and started whispering. \"He's a mypoopitarian now.\" Wesley said. \"He LOVES eating my leftovers. You might end up getting eaten by him..you know, AFTER processing.\" Wesley laughed out-loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice stare at his brother. \"You going to eat the grub or what?\" He asked, hand near his crotch in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on bro! I feel a connection with this grub!\" Wesley defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what mom said about playing with your food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, ok ok. Just one more thing.\" Wesley looked back up at the grub. \"I want a clean exit.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A clean exit.\" Wesley said, annoyed and turning his head to face his brother Justin. \"You know, when you don't have to wipe after pooping? It's super convenient and--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, ok, ok. A clean exit. You hear him Mr. Grub?\" Juice asked, trying to hurry this all along. \"Don't hit him where the good lord split him on your way out, k? He needs a clean bum. Clean.\" Juice reiterated. \"Don't be a party pooper on your way out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A party pooper? Hahahahaha!!!\" Wesley laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it, Wes.\" Juice said, having his hand brushing against his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok geez.\" Wes said. \"You heard that Mr. Grub? Rude, right? My bro can be such an ass sometimes. Oh well. I hope you got to say goodbye to your grub family. Please don't squirm too much and upset my stomach. Oh, and treat my ass nicely on your way out, ok?\" Wesley said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you got to say good bye to your grub family.\" Wesley offered meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unpinched his fingers and released Ricky's grub sister into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky watched her fall into his mouth and heard a smacking sound when she landed on his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmm.\" Wesley said, slapping the grub around in his dirty mouth and rubbing her against his tongue and between his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley bent over in front of Ricky's cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He likes it in here, see Ricky?\" Wesley asked, sticking his tongue out and showing Ricky the grub in his mouth trying to worm her way to freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in grub form, Ricky could recognize the fear in his sister's movements. He tried to bring himself to tell Wesley that was his sister, but he glanced over at Juice and quivered in fear. He was too scared to do anything to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley closed his lips around the grub, sucked it in like a piece of spaghetti noodle and then laughed.<br>\r\nRicky watched the Wesley's Adam's Apple stick out further than usual as his throat opened up, then saw it move down slightly as he gulped and swallowed his little sister whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Being a vegetarian is stupid.\" The young teen explained. \"That grub was begging for it. Plus it tastes soooo goood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething amazing caught Wesley's attention next to him. \"Holy fuck it's my lucky day.\" He said, seeing the coke on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the glass and started chugging it, not even feeling the tiny floating body of Ricky's brother slide effortlessly down his throat. When he finished drinking he slammed the glass down on the desk and burped loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley turned toward his brother Juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may have taken me awhile but I told you I could swallow a grub.\" Wesley said, proud of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah... you did.\" Juice said.</span></div></div>",

He went to his dresser, pulled out a pair of socks and threw them at Johnny. Wesley laughed when they smacked Johnny in the face and he did nothing but lay there still. Unable to move or say anything. Juice then started digging really deep into the bottom of his dresser, shuffling around several pieces of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew they were somewhere.\" Juice said, pulling out one of his favorite pairs of jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were black designer jeans created by Cheap Monday - the no bullshit menswear designers. They had holes designed in them and looked like they cost an arm and a leg.<br>\r\nJuice draped the legs of his jeans on the floor and put one of his legs inside. With both of them in, he pulled the jeans up, revealing how tight they were around his waist. He slacked them down a bit, showing his boxer shorts and buttoned them up.<br>\r\nHe then grabbed a belt from on top of his dresser and looped it around the pants as part of his fashion statement. He didn't bother pulling the pants in tighter with it, or anything. The belt was essentially useless, in Johnny's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice then walked over to his bed and sat down next to Johnny. He pulled the socks off of Johnny's head that were draped over his face and quickly put them on as well as his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done. You ready?\" Juice asked Wesley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shot a look over at Ricky and grinned at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a special treat for you, since you said my mouth was gross again.\" Wesley said, bending over and looking into Ricky's cage with a closed eye smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I mean---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure that's not what you meant now, right?\" Wesley asked. \"What did you mean then, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky took one look at Juice whose gaze was as though it was piercing his soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" Ricky said, putting his head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Words don't mean nothing.\" Wesley said. \"So now we're going to work on getting your teeth brown again hahahahahaha!!! It's a long trip where we're going and you're going to have a lot of time to think about what you said when you're up my ass!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO please!!\" Ricky begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley ignored him and reached into the cage, pulling him out. He walked over to Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put out your hand.\" Wesley ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny held his hand out per his command. \"Here help me put your 'friend'\" Wesley said with air quotes, \"up my ass, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley unbuttoned and unfashioned his belt, lowering his pants past his ass cheeks. He lifted up his black shirt and bent over slightly revealing his colorful cartoon embroidered underwear. The tight undies were pressing against his ass so hard some of the cartoons disappeared into his clearly visible crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky looked up at Johnny in the palm of his hand with extreme prejudice and hatred. Johnny's body did what he was ordered, and opened up the back of Wesley's underwear for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky knew that he had few seconds left of breathing in fresh air and he spent them looking down into the abyss of Wesley's multicolored underwear, seeing a dark stain right around where his asshole would be. Ricky noticed that the stain happened to be on some cartoon character's face, and he was smiling almost maniacally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky started squirming, trying to get out of Johnny's hands, but unfortunately that's exactly what happened when Johnny dropped his writhing friend Ricky into the opening.<br>\r\nJohnny stopped the waistband shut and brought his hands down, pushing the mass that is his best friend further and further down, closer toward the asshole of the cousin he despised more than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his index finger he pushed Ricky down further and further into the swamp ass. Once it seemed like Ricky was where he was supposed, to be which was made obvious by the wet stain Johnny felt against the tip of his finger, Johnny's hands pushed against Wesley's ass cheeks and opened them further, he then pressed against Ricky, pushing his face against his cousins asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh yeaaahhh right there.\" Wesley said. \"You know exactly where he needs to be hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley leaned back further and grabbed the back of Johnny's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bulbous ass came into view and then..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfffhahaha I've been brewing that one since I came in here.\" Wesley said, taking personal joy in everyone else's suffering. \"and that was a two for one deal! Buy one get one free! Hahaha.\" Wesley laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his pants up and buttoned them, even putting the belt on as tight as possible so he could be confident Ricky couldn't escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'm ready.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to carry the stone, John.\" Justin ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you worried about him making a wish!?\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can't speak anyway.\" Juice told him. \"But even if he could, I made sure earlier that if he touched the stone his body would lose it's voice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahah you mean he can't ever wish again?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Juice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley grinned as Johnny's body got up and lifted the stone, preparing to carry it wherever they went. Wesley reached over and started fumbling with something on the desk nearby. He pulled the leash off and wrapped it around Johnny's neck. He smiled when it snapped together, fully attached to Johnny now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my doggo for tonight.\" Wesley said with a huge grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's eye brow furrowed and his left eye started twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got something to say, huh boy, huh!?\" Wesley asked. \"Too bad doggos cant speak huh? You can't speak can ya, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny wanted to kill this kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooooooooooooo.\" He said with his cute dog voice. \"You can't speak. Too bad.\" Wesley said, mocking him still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, you and Johnny boy the dog ready to go?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Puffy. Isn't it, Puffy booooyyyy huh?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice started laughing. \"Puffy?\" He asked. \"Lit and I used to call one of our drug dealer---sss uhhhhhhhh one of our ummm acquaintances Puffy. Guy was a total fucking loser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like Puffy boyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!\" Wesley said, rubbing it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Puffy ready to go, Wes?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley knelt down slightly and slapped his knees with both hands. \"OUTSIDE!?!?\" he asked with an excited voice toward Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puffy go outside!?\" Wesley asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley reached out and ruffled Johnny's hair. \"We're ready.\" He said, walking toward the door and yanking on the leash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh!!! But don't forget your bag, Juice.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY SHIT. Thank you for reminding me!\" Juice replied, grabbing a packed backpack and throwing it around his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No prob, bro. Let's go boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Wesley Juice and Johnny got outside of the room Juice went down the stairs first with Wes and Johnny following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley Juice and Johnny found themselves down the stairs, coming near the arched doorway that lead to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny could hear Lesley's frustrated voice on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heel boy.\" Wesley said motioning Johnny to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice decided to take a step across the doorway and see if their mother was paying attention.</span></div></div>",

I have someone who is going to come evaluate them and see---\" Lesley saw Juice walking past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" She told whoever was on the phone. \"Excuse me.... but where are you going at this time of night?\" she asked Juice who was halfway past the kitchen doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out.\" Juice replied simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is almost 10 pm. There's no reason for you to be going 'out'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's what I'm doing.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Lesley said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" Wesley whispered. \"We can sneak past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's mind started running frantically. What if Lesley saw Johnny on a leash in Wesley's hands? He greatly opposed the idea of just 'sneaking' past her while she was talking to Juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley quickly walked past, dragging Johnny with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and where do YOU think YOU'RE going, Wesley?\" Lesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny lit up like a Christmas tree.<br>\r\nWesley pushed Johnny back toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi mom!\" He waved with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you get in here.\" Lesley said. \"We can't have you running around at this time of night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, mom. We're going out.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we are. Johnny's going with us.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny?\" Lesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny gulped, knowing she wanted to see him but he couldn't come to the doorway in this condition!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny can't hear you right now mom...he uhhh....\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has his headphones in.\" Juice said for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are the three of you going out this late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Johnny is uhhh....\" Wesley started...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upset about...the funeral....\" Juice started. \"So we're going somewhere to take his mind off of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Lesley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thought he could meet some of our friends.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny felt so stupid. He was right behind the door with a leash around his neck and the wishing stone in his hands. He couldn't do ANYTHING to get out of this and Lesley probably would buy their story and not look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, he didn't want to be seen like this but at the same time at least she could've stopped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you boys..umm don't stay out too late.\" Lesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny rolled his eyes. He couldn't believe his Aunt's parenting style. It was 10 pm and she was letting her two kids go out this late? Even if it was to their friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jesus they have a lot more freedom than I ever did.' Johnny thought to himself, jealous and pissed all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, ok mom.\" Juice said, stepping toward the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley opened the door and everyone stepped outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Puffy.\" Juice said to Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's brow furrowed again, getting pissed that Justin was calling him by the made up dog name Wesley had given him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice opened the garage door and Johnny saw two bikes sitting in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cousins each hopped on one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's get going.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny felt so embarrassed when the boys left the garage. Juice started taking off and Wesley followed suit, dragging Johnny along behind him. The older boy had to run with the stone in his hands, doing his best to keep up with the blonde asshole in front of him. Occasionally Wesley would be moving too quickly and the leash would tighten around Johnny's neck and disrupt his breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up!\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down bro!\" Wesley replied. \"I can't move as fast with Puffy like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell John to move his ass.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move your ass.\" Wesley told John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny ran as fast as he could, carrying the wishing stone in his hands. He felt so ridiculous. The key to his freedom was in his hands, but while under Juice's control he couldn't speak to wish this all away. Johnny shifted his gaze forward and saw Wesley pedaling with his boxer shorts sticking out of his tan pants, remembering that his best friend Ricky was trapped inside of his younger cousin's ass crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even the cool night summer breeze could calm Johnny whose mind was racing a mile a minute. He kept wondering where exactly it was that they were headed, why it was that Juice had allowed Wesley to put him on a leash, and what was in the backpack Juice brought with him.<br>\r\nJohnny remembered that this was all somehow part of his punishment not only for getting Juice in trouble earlier with his mother, but also for trying to escape the day before the funeral. Juice had warned him there would be 'severe' consequences, even threatening to kill Ricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He better fucking not kill Ricky.' Johnny thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they traveled along the roads started looking more and more familiar to Johnny, who, at this point was amazed that no car had passed by them to see how he was being roped along behind two young teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe prayed no one would show up, because all Juice had to do was come up with some excuse or touch the stone and it would all go away. Certainly Juice knew that too, which is why he decided to do all of this to begin with, Johnny thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile Johnny's legs began aching and throbbing like crazy. Exhausted from essentially carrying a weight and also running, Johnny collapsed behind Wesley; whose momentum from pedaling the bike kept him rolling along. Johnny's body gave out and he face-planted right onto the cement sidewalk with a loud thudd. The leash around his neck choked him to near death and he skid his knee caps on the sidewalk as his body slid forward, suffocating. Somehow if only for Juice's command to carry, he kept the stone held in the air in his hands, but he was broken down and sweating on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley reacted quickly; miraculously slamming on the breaks before the leash snapped in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Juice asked angrily. \"We're almost there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley shrugged and pointed to Johnny who was face down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up.\" Juice ordered. \"Get up and follow. I don't care how much it hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's body reacted as it was told to, and he was forcibly brought to his knees. They wobbled and quivered as he lifted up the stone in his hands and himself with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we have to go slower.\" Wesley said, stating the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine. We're literally there anyway.\" Juice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice started pedaling and Wesley followed suit, forcing Johnny to jog behind them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the boys turned a corner Johnny's mind went from racing to completely blank. He knew he had recognized these roads, and this area. He knew somewhere deep down he had been here before. When he looked straight ahead he found himself in total shock and awe. He couldn't believe where the cousins had taken him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up Johnny saw a sign that read 'Gentle Heart Cemetery' and he became beside himself.</span></div></div>",

Next to it, was his mother's headstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice parked his bike near by and walked over to Wesley, taking the leash from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on over.\" Juice said, tugging on the leash and pulling Johnny with it. \"Get over here and sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's body reacted as it was told, and he sat himself down, facing his father's headstone, already seething with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a reason I wanted to get here quickly.\" Juice admitted, sliding the backpack off of his shoulders and resting it against the headstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped in front of Johnny with a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see...I have to take the biggest shit ever. And what better place to take a dump than on top of your worthless dead father's grave?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley started laughing, seeing this whole thing as some kind of joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the punishment is...you're just going to sit there....\" Juice started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a good boy!\" Wesley interrupted with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and watch me.\" Juice finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I won't be watching.\" Wesley said. \"Because that's gross. So meanwhile I'm going to draw some stuff on your rents headstones. Cool, right?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have the spray paint in the bag bro?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, right there next to the crowbar.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat.\" Wesley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice unbuttoned his pants and zipped them down. Then he unlooped the useless belt and slapped Johnny in the face with it while grinning smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you enjoy the show.\" Juice said, turning around, lowering his pants and underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squatted down in the middle of the grave and started pushing his bowel movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to grunt or anything, it was just like Juice said - he had to go immediately after he squatted.<br>\r\nJohnny watched with unrelenting anger as Juice's pucker opened up wide when he started to push and the tip of a huge brown turd slithered out of his asshole, making its way down toward his father's resting place in the ultimate show of disrespect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of Justin's shit was hard to miss, it was one of those powerful thick and soupy smells like when you've been holding it in all day and you only just now had a chance to release it. The turd was now forming into a big solid log and pushed itself out of Justin's asshole completely while Johnny watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Johnny what do you think your mother would've liked the least? Farting butts or middle fingers, or maybe a dick or two?\" Wesley asked, looking back at him with the spray paint in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm I'm no mind reader but I'm sensing dicks. Dicks would be best. I'm definitely going to do a farting butt or two though.\" Wesley said out-loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny saw Wesley grin and then he turned away to face the headstone. He shook the spray can vigorously for a few moments and then he brought it up toward Johnny's mother's headstone; pushing the button and releasing the paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's gaze automatically shifted back toward Justin's asshole, which started to push out another piping hot piece of shit on top of the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must feel pretty low.\" Juice started his monologue. \"Sitting there helplessly with the stone in your hands while we ruin your parents gravesite. I was just going to kill Ricky like I promised...\" Juice admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"but Wesley enjoys getting his ass tickled too much.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley looked up and over from the dick he was painting and said \"Guilty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and just think...\" Juice said. \"If you hadn't of tried to escape or tell my mother anything none of poor Ricky's family would've died and we wouldn't be here, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...Ricky's family died?\" Wesley asked, completely oblivious. \"My condolences.\" He said, poking his ass crack while laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndoubtedly Wesley was pushing Ricky's face into his anus with each blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well.\" Wesley said. \"They're in a better place, right?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" Juice said, pushing out the remainder of his shit onto Johnny's father's grave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thereeee we go.\" Juice said, farting and dropping a few smaller turds down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice stood up straight, with his pants and underwear still around his ankles.

He pushed Johnny's face to where it wasn't even an inch away from the huge steaming pile of shit he took just 6 feet above his father's remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it looks gross!\" Wesley said, turning around and snickering. \"That's like the creamiest shit I've ever seen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Johnny boy here likes it, don't ya Johnny?\" Juice asked, closing the gap even tighter than one inch between the shit and Johnny's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice pulled tightly and released Johnny's hair, letting him sit straight up like he was a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice saw tears streaming down his face but ignored them, keeping the same cold emotionless expression he has had since the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha bro he's crying!\" Wesley said, turning around and looking at Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny looked over at Wesley and saw that he had completed a few dicks on his mother's headstone. Several of them were exploding cum out of the piss slit. It looked like he was working on the farting butt now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley sensed John staring and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psssst this whole grave thingie was my idea.\" Wesley said to Johnny, whispering out loud.<br>\r\n\"I saw some grave robbers on a movie on TV and like sort of remembered we went to someone's funeral. I couldn't put my hand quite on whose funeral we went to.....\" Wesley said. \"but I knew it was someone we didn't care for, really. I told Juice about the movie and he loved the idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then it clicked in Johnny's head. This whole thing was Wesley's idea. That explained why Wesley was talking to Juice in the hallway when he came upstairs and mentioned the dog leash. That explained the dog leash in general, actually and the fact that Wesley was so excited and impatient about getting here already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley in his thoughtless childlike mentality thought this would be funny, to finally get an excuse to have Johnny on a leash and get his brother to go along with it. But to get his brother on board he had to come up with something that Juice would do. Something cruel and twisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's head started to throb when he realized that he was here at his parent's graveyard, watching his two cousins desecrate it all because of a movie Wesley saw. He felt so low and powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Juice said. \"This whole thing is actually pretty vanilla compared to some of the other shit I've thought of since then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanilla?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeh. Boring.\" Juice said. \"I just didn't want to go too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! You mean you had plans WORSE than this!?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sure.\" Juice said. \"We have the stone so nothing is off the table.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I know his parent's were cremated because of the injuries... but I've thought about wishing Johnny inside a coffin with his mother, and you and I just leaving, for one.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha what?!\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe we would come back later the next day and wish him out or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's ears perked up and he knew then and there, without any uncertainty that Justin was insane. He thought about wishing Johnny into his mother's coffin, and leaving him there with her rotting corpse?<br>\r\nJohnny wasn't so sure Juice had thought about the rotting corpse part, but he was essentially going to leave Johnny in a coffin with his dead mother for a whole day. Apparently he didn't think about the lack of air down there, either. Regardless, now he was stuck here listening to Juice explain how he has the better ideas of the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh what else, what else?!\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought about wishing his father's body in a coffin out in the open...and like...opened up....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...\" Wesley said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that I could take my shit right on his father's face.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley started to lose it so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAAAAAAAAT??!!\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude Wes calm down you'll wake the dead out here.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO WOULD YOUR SHIT!!! HAHHAA!!\" Wesley laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok bro you win!! YOU have the best ideas!!\" Wesley said. \"What else!?!!\" Wesley's voice became louder and more excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm not telling you anymore. You're too loud.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, but bro!!!\" Wesley whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Maybe some other time.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Wesley pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wes.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.\" Wesley asked with an annoyed tone of voice to where it didn't even sound like a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have the backpack right?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toss me the toilet paper, would you?\" Juice asked. \"I can feel the wind in my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffhaha, sure thing.\" Wes replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley started sifting through the backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh ohhhh...\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't pack any.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There isn't any toilet paper in the bag.\" Wesley informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah and a lot of it.\" Wesley replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just get some through the stone.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That's boring?\" Wesley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? What else should I do?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have our obedient dog Puffy next to you and you're going to wish toilet paper into existence?\" Wesley asked. \"YA BORING.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude I'm not into butt stuff like you.\" Juice said outright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't butt stuff.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck it isn't.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah bro, you're not even listening. It ISN'T butt stuff! It's just funny. You don't think it would be cool to wipe your ass with John's face? I know you love fucking with him like I do.\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw the way you watched that video of Ricky using him as a toilet...\" Wesley's voice chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No this is different.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of it like this...\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny sat there, listening to this conversation where his youngest cousin was trying to convince his oldest cousin to use his face as toilet paper in complete silence, unable to speak. He wished he could murder them both in front of his dead parents, but he couldn't. He couldn't even move. He could only sit there, listening to Wesley make more and more convincing arguments while wishing he would at least shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..see what I mean?\" Wesley asked. \"You don't think it would be awesome to wipe your ass with his nose or something in front of his dead parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething Wesley said had struck a true chord with Juice's internal cruelty and sadism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice started grinning he was so thrilled about thinking of it.</span></div></div>",

Sit the stone down on the floor next to you.\" Juice said with a huge boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was forced to sit the stone down and get up on his knees in front of his naked younger cousin who had his package showing. Juice stepped forward, preparing to turn around and wipe his ass with Johnny's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*splat*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a fucking bitch!\" Juice said, looking down at his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAH!! OH MY GOD!!\" Wesley's voice perked up again. \"You stepped in your own shit!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Juice yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny couldn't help but feel this was some minor dose of karma. That fate had finally showed up to punish his cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll clean it after.\" Juice told Johnny with a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice stepped out of the shit and then walked off behind Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Face me.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's body reacted, turning him around to face his young cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice started turning away from Johnny who was forced to face him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice then promptly bent over, reached back and pulled Johnny's face into his uncleaned ass by the hair on his head. He started pushing and pulling on Johnny's hair, rubbing his face up and down, smearing Johnny in his taint on top of his father's grave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's body tried to instinctively lurch away, but it was forced to remain still, suffering the humiliation and stench of being an ass wipe for its younger cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how is it!?\" Wesley asked, barely able to keep his laughter contained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like his tears are the perfect lube.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahah oh my god\" Wesley laughed. \"You two could make ass face gliding a pro sport!\" He joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a solid 5 minutes with Wesley laughing the whole time, and finding every bit of this to be some great big joke while Juice crafted up some cruel and twisted things to say about it.<br>\r\nIt even got to the point where Wesley said he would be bragging to his friends about how his dog Puffy was nothing but an annoying little ass hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Juice was finally finished, Juice let go of his older cousins hair and Johnny remain on both knees, covered in a face full of the shit that was caked in Justin's ass crack only a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny watched Juice pull up his boxers, and pants. Even saw him put the useless belt back in that he doesn't use to hold them up. He sagged them only slightly like before, showing off his designer boxer label on the waistband and solidifying his look as a hoodlum skater punk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next.\" Juice said, wasting no time and lifting up his shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice pushed the feces coated tread into Johnny's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better lick it clean. These shoes are worth more than everything you're wearing put together.\" Juice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny stuck his tongue out and started licking the shit from Juice's sole. His tongue stunk him and his body was boiling over with unquenchable rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice started with his foot pressed lightly into Johnny's face, who kept licking the sole clean. But as the act went on Juice started pressing his foot into Johnny's face harder and harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably thought it was some kind of poetic justice when I stepped in my own shit, didnt cha?\" Juice asked, pressing harder than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know what I think would be poetic justice?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed harder, and forced Johnny on his back to the ground. Behind Johnny's head was the steaming pile of shit Juice had just left on his father's grave. Giving no fucks, Juice pressed his shoe into Johnny's face even harder, leaving an imprint of his shitty sole into the powerless boy's face and pressing the back of his head into the warm gooey shit behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin grated the shit covered sole of his right shoe into Johnny's skin harshly. Pushing the fecal matter into the imprints that he was making with it. He kept this grating action going while Johnny continued to forcibly lick his sole for the next 5 minutes or more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope your dead parents enjoyed seeing that hahaha!\" Juice said with actual enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was using the kind of voice no one ever hears him use. One with real emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAH that was great!\" Wesley laughed with his brother, taking enjoyment from his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go back to sitting down over there now, shitface.\" Juice told him. \"I've got some headstones to ruin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want on his father's tombstone, Juice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better off dead.\" Juice replied.</span></div></div>",

Like one of those really, REALLY hairy guys you see on TV who are all fucked up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley snorted in laughter. \"Oh my god I know exactly what you mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could call him Puffy...half dog, half man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny wanted to shoot himself right now, because he could see from the gleam in Wesley's eye that he was all for this idea, and with the two of them in agreement, he knew it was bound to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walking him could be like, part of your 'show' or whatever.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha oh my god! That would be EPIC!\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody would look twice at me mocking him and pushing him around then.\" Juice said, smiling at Johnny. \"Because EVERYONE would be making fun of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAH!! It's PERFECT!\" Wesley laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he could be shorter though....\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He could be a midget.\" Juice replied. \"....A mute, deformed midget....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley laughed so hard he intentionally flopped down on the ground and started slapping it hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just make mom think she took him in as some kind of charity or something...\" Juice said, masterminding the whole plan. \"Make her forget Johnny ever existed....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god it's amazing! Lets do it!!!!!\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice walked over and put his hands on the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Johnny was......how tall do you want Johnny, Wesley?\" Juice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley quickly stood back up, and put his right hand even with his dick and balls at crotch level. He looked over at Johnny who was still sitting there next to his parents grave completely silent and winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Johnny was at eye level with Wesley's dick...I wish he had a deformed face, and he had that hair growing disease...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Make the disease grow my pubic hair! Hahahahaha!!\" Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Juice said, not understanding. \"I'm not wishing for you to have more pubic hair.\" Juice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Wesley replied. \"Make the disease grow my pubic hair on HIS body!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice snickered, taking the idea in. \"Instead of growing his own hair, I wish Johnny's hair growing disease actually grew my brother's ass pubes all over his face and body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny started to cry, the only bodily action he could still do because he couldn't control it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive him a tail!!\u201d Wesley said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThrow in a tail.\u201d Juice told the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that everything?\" Juice asked, looking at his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes!\" Wesley said, excited to see it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.....oh wait! I also wish my mother thought she took Puffy the circus freak in as an act of charity and that she completely forgets who Johnny is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny felt like he was going to literally die. Any hope he had left had been instantly shattered. His cousins had just changed the name of the game, not just by altering reality to make him small or ugly...but by altering the reality around him and making Lesley forget who he was, making her think he was just some deformed hobo circus freak she let in her house as an act of charity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's stare went blank as his body started to transform with Juice and Wesley staring at him intently, smiles on their faces. Johnny didn't notice the transformation taking place at all, because he was too devastated. He knew Lesley wouldn't know who he was, or talk to him kindly anymore. He knew he had no escape with no voice. No way to break free from his cousins. He knew that his cousin Wesley was going to trot him about in front of his friends, relatives and god knows who else on some pink leash calling him his 'doggo' Puffy.<br>\r\nHe knew that he couldn't look at himself in the mirror anymore....and that his life was now fully in their hands. He couldn't even think of any way to escape. No one would be looking out for him anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!\" Wesley burst into laughter, dropping on his ass and nearly crushing poor Ricky in the process, who still stuffed between his cheeks completely ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at his tail!!\u201d Wesley laughed, pointing to the long curly tail extending out of Johnny\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was covered in the same pubic hair that was all over his body now. Johnny itched all over and it even felt like the bugs around in the area took notice of him immediately. Either that or he just felt a tingling crawling sensation all over. His new body was unbearable already, and he hadn\u2019t even seen it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, before they left Juice took a photo of \u2018Puffy\u2019 and made him look at it. Johnny was devistated. So much so that he didn\u2019t even remember leaving his parents graves, the fresh shit Juice took still laying on top of one of them and the drawings of dicks Wesley made glistening slightly in the moonlight as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo teenager should have this much power. Let alone THESE two teenagers, Johnny thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuice and Wesley arrived home. Much to Johnny\u2019s dismay Aunt Lesley didn\u2019t recognize him just as his cousins had wanted. The two casually spoke with her, with \u2018Puffy\u2019 on a leash right in front of her and she didn\u2019t even bat an eye. Victorious, the two brats prepared themselves for bed. Wesley pulled Ricky out of the tight space between his cheeks and put him back in his cage to be forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Johnny knew it, it was time to sleep with the boy he loathed so much.</span></div></div>",

He, like every average teenager, suffers greatly from his own anxiety-laden thoughts during his High School years. Although he is mostly anxious, he works as hard as he can to keep up his grades so that he can come home to his loving parents and make them proud. His best friend Richard Brown, or Ricky B for short, is the only means of coping poor young John has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Johnny's birthday (June 20th) marks the end of the school year and is steadfast approaching -- it is TOMORROW, in fact! With next year being his last and marking the end of this nightmare known as high school, Johnny dreams of graduation and College grandeur. Young Johnny\u2019s only goal right now is to become a senior, then finally finish out his High School career as a student with remarkable grades. Everyone is sure this boy will make something of himself, and be the first in his family to lead an exceptional life. His parents couldn't be prouder, and his friend couldn't be more supportive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the second to last day of his Junior year of High School over and done, Johnny's closest friend Ricky B comes over to visit his house with the only gift he could procure; one that even Ricky finds to be unworthy. Yet the gift soon proves to be more than intriguing....and as the boys discover the secrets to a gift that at first caused disinterest, poor Johnny receives some soul-crushing news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Characters: <br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nMain Character Name: Johnny Dewitt <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupporting Character Name: Ricky Brown (Johnny's best Friend)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntagonists: Johnny's two bratty cousins<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Wesley Uttridge Goodwin<br>\r\nDescription: Hyper/Jokester/Prankster/Pouty \u201cNo Fair I want one!\u201d attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Name: Justin Abernathy Goodwin<br>\r\nNickname: Juice<br>\r\nDescription: Calm/Moody/Easily Pissed/Low Attention/Cruel and Easily Bored/Lacks Empathy/Dry/Pouty<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Note to anyone wishing to add a chapter:<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story should be focused on the humiliation of Johnny &amp; his friend Ricky by Johnny's younger cousins Wesley and Justin \"Juice\" Goodwin through whatever means possible: stink torture, farts, face sitting, belittling, teabagging, crotch/ass kissing...whatever! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cousins may or may not discover The Philosopher's Stone, a magical wishing stone so that other forms of torture may be added to the story such as: shrinking, mind control, transformation, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry not to be too descriptive of the characters so that the reader can imagine the characters as they wish, or how they interpret them to be.
