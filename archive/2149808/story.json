You groggily get out of bed and go to answer the phone. \"Hello?\" You mumble as you pick up the phone. \"Hey, man. It's Grant. Me and the guys are going out for drinks. You wanna come?\" You glance at your alarm clock. 12:28 AM. \"Grant, it's 12 in the fucking morning. I gotta work tomorrow.\" \"So, does that mean you don't wanna come?\" You rub the bridge of your nose in annoyance. \"Yes, it means I don't wanna come. Good night, Grant,\" you say as you hang the phone up and head back to bed. Right as you lay down, the phone rings again. You groan, and get up to answer it again. \"Come on, man. Are you sure?\" Grant asks as you put the phone to your ear. You start to tell him no again, but then a thought crosses your mind. He'll keep calling if you hang up, and you can't get any sleep with the phone constantly ringing. You could always unplug the phone so he can't bother you anymore, or you could give in and agree to go out for drinks. You decide to...</span></div></div>",

I'll be there in about 30 minutes. So go ahead and change out of your feety pajamas and get ready.\" You roll your eyes, say \"okay.\" and hang up, and begin getting dressed to go to the bar. You just throw on a slightly worn t-shirt and some jeans. It's a bar, not a fancy club, after all. After 30 minutes, you hear a car horn outside your house. You peek out the window, and see Grant and two mutual friends sitting in his car. \"Let's go, Alex! The bar closes at 2!\" You head out and get in the car. Grant looks back at you. \"So, just how wasted you think you're gonna get tonight?\" \"I'm not getting wasted tonight. I'm just gonna have a beer or two. I still have to work tomorrow.\" \"Work's for losers. We're gonna get FUCKED UP!\" The guy beside you responds. \"Shut up, Ian. You only think that cause you don't HAVE a job.\" Grant shuts both of you up, and exclaims that everyone's gonna get wasted, and he drives off. The guy in the front passenger seat, Luis, turns on the radio, and you hear a news report about people being found mutilated, with most of the blood drained from their bodies, in multiple parts of the town. Before you can hear any more of it, Grant tells Luis to \"turn this shit off\", and he turns it to a station, which is playing Girl You Know It's True by Milli Vanilli. Ian starts booing, and telling Luis and Grant to change the station to one that doesn't play music of \"shitty hack liars\". Grant tells him no, and that liars or not, the song is still good. You and Luis agree, and Ian slumps back in the seat, and crosses his arms in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a 20 minute drive, you arrive at the bar. You step out, and look up at the bright neon sign hanging above the building. You sigh. \"Well, no going back now...\" You follow Grant, Luis, and Ian in, and with them at the bar. The bartender asks you what you'll have, and you say just a beer. Grant tells you to get a strong drink first, in order to get drunk faster, and you remind him that you said you weren't drinking more than a beer or two. Luis, being newer to the group, decides to make small talk with you, and asks you what your job is. \"Eh, I'm just a cashier over at Lowes.\" \"Huh. Might come over there sometime and say hi.\" You slightly chuckle, and thank him, and say \"Well, I'm pretty much always in there, so feel free to drop in whenever.\" Just as you and Luis finish the small conversation, a man wearing a torn polo covered in blooded barges into the bar, startling everyone. A woman at a table asks him what happened, and he responds that 'vampires have descended on Ridgedon\" and that they're killing people all over outside. Grant shrugs the guy's story off, and goes back to his drink, when two men and a woman burst through the two front windows, and reveal themselves as vampires. \"Holy fuck!\" Ian exclaims. The three begin quickly attacking and killing the bar patrons, and the guy that had just entered the bar. Grant yells 'We need to get out of here!\" All four of you hop off of the bar stools, and head for the door. While running, Ian trips on a dead body, and falls to the ground. Before he can recover, he's tackled and bitten by one of the vampires, killing him. Nobody in the group notices him missing, until you all get outside, and Grant asks where Ian is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck Ian, man! He's probably dead. We gotta get out of here!\" Luis exclaims, as he opens the passenger side door. Before he can get into the car, however, a vampire jumps off the roof of a nearby building, and lands behind Luis. As he turns to acknowledge the creature, he experiences a sharp pain in his abdomen, as the vampire shoves his hand through Luis's chest, and pulls out his heart, which it promptly takes a bite out of. Luis falls to the ground, lifeless. The vampire drops Luis's heart, and turns his attention to You and Grant. Grant freezes up from fear, and it's up to you to make a decision. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

The vampire rips the passenger side door off, and attempts to grab you out of the driver seat, but you slam on the gas and leave the creature in the dust. \"What the fuck was that?!\" Grant asks, glancing back at the bar. \"I don't know...Looked like vampires,\" You respond. \"Vampires?! But...those aren't real,\" He exclaims. \"Yeah, well how else would you explain that shit back there, huh? Those...things were biting people's necks, and...and that one just...just ripped Luis's heart out.\" You respond, still trying to process what had just happened yourself. Grant says that you should head to the police station, since it'll most likely be safe there, and you tell him that since vampires have to be invited in, that yours or Grant's house would be the safest, but he disagrees. He argues that the police station would have guns and highly trained police officers, but you tell him guns most likely wouldn't work, and the police might already all be dead. You're the driver.

Grant has his mouth wide open at all the destruction around the hood. It looks like a bunch of bombs have gone off.. houses destroyed, walls caved in, and yards full of smoking wreckage. \"Holy shit dude.\" He says in shock. \"I have to check if my family is okay! Where is everyone?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should go in.\" You respond back to him, not feeling sure. Your neighbors' house, the Hendersons, looks completely torn apart. Worse, you see a puddle of a dark looking liquid pouring from under the front door and dripping into the front lawn. \"I told you we should've gone to get guns!\" You tell Grant to shut up, he is going on some rant about how the two of you are going to die. You are taking breaths to try to bring yourself back.. Okay, time to look at this situation. A group of deranged individuals, or <i>vampires</i> if we want to go there, have been attacking Ridgedon. Family might be dead.. but even with all his precautions and your mom's disapproval, you know for a fact that your dad keeps a shotgun in his bedroom.<br>\r\n\"Look Grant, the door to my house looks held together with wooden boards. I don't see anyone around. Can I borrow your phone to call them inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a passenger with no choice, Grant reluctantly hands you the phone. He is concerned that you two are sitting in the car, which is missing a passenger seat and sparking from the blunt damage it just took. He is on the lookout and even with all the damage, it looks like whatever or whoever caused it.. has left the neighborhood. \"Dammit, no reception for some reason.. I can't connect and I can't see if the news is saying anything.\" You hand the phone back to Grant. </span></div></div>",

He watches you in disbelief as you quickly walk over up your porch and try to figure out how to open the boarded door. He is free to follow or do as he wishes yet he just stays in the car, probably too immobilized by the horrors you two have witnessed already. Damn, you think to yourself, I know they keep a key under the mat but that doesn't help too much when the whole door is just blocked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to take one of the wooden planks out, careful not to get your hand caught on a loose rusty nail. No doubt dad had done this in a rush judging by how sloppy it is... \"Come on man, hurry up!\" Grant yells again through the missing place in the car where the passenger door would be. Instead of yelling back and getting caught in some pointless shouting match, you hold your hand up to as if silently requesting him to shut the fuck up. You lift up the welcome mat and find a different key underneath. Knowing dad, he must've put in some other way to get in the house and this has to be it... This one opens a door in the back, there's a gate but it shouldn't be too hard to get their attention from there... \"Grant I gotta keep finding a way to get in here, my parents seem to be safe at least...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grant's right. You two would probably be much safer at the police station. Who knows if these vampires even adhere to movie rules, anyway? Grant slumps back in his seat as you drive toward the police station. \"We left Ian for dead and didn't even try to save Luis. What the fuck kind of shitty friends are we?\" He says as tears begin to form in his eyes and he quickly begins crying uncontrollably. You attempt to console him by explaining that nobody notices Ian was missing until you were all out of the bar, and Luis's death happened so fast. What could either of you even do? \"All that matters now is that we're still alive. And hopefully, we'll be able to stay that way at the police station.\" The rest of the short drive is filled with silence, which is promptly broken as you pull up to the station. \"Fucking Ay,\" You mutter as you see multiple dead officers scattered around the area. There doesn't seem to be any vampires in sight, though, meaning there's probably no survivors. Grant covers his face with his hands in frustration, then suggests you both get out and see if you can find some weapons to defend yourself with. You agree, even if guns won't work very well on vampires without silver bullets. Grant exits first, and you are seconds from exiting when a humanoid entity slams down onto the hood of the car. It's a vampire. You quickly shut your door, and yell for Grant to get back in, but before he can get to the car door, the vampire pounces on him and bites him on the neck. You watch as the bloodsucker seemingly drains your friend, then stands up to face you. He quickly climbs through the door hole on the passenger side and pins you against the driverside door. He is just about to kill you when a female voice speaks up. \"That's enough, Thorin.\" The vampire groans in annoyance and releases you, then climbs out of the car. You stay sitting in the same position against the door for a few seconds, before the voice calls out to you. \"Come now, Alexander. Don't keep me waiting.\" You peak outside and see a woman standing not far from Grant's corpse. She has pale white skin and a look in her eyes that seems to be a mix of hunger, anger, and satisfaction. She orders you to exit the car, and you sheepishly do, and right as you step outside it, she chuckles, then quickly rushes toward you at an inhuman speed. Before you can even begin to comprehend what is happening, you feel a sharp pain on your neck. It's the worst pain you've ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next sensation you feel is a slight tingling. Your eyes jolt open. What the fuck? You notice that the sun is almost up and that the woman and her \"pet\" have vanished. You're not even sure where to begin with the questions, but you're sure that the night prior wasn't just a dream, as all the dead bodies are still littering the area, including Grant's. You notice that the sun seems to be really powerful, even though it's not fully up yet. It should still be relatively cool out, but yet you're still burning up as if it were 100 degrees. With no other ideas, you decide to hop in Grant's car and head back towards the bar. Was that whole incident really as bad as it seemed to be in the moment? You pull up in time to see multiple emergency vehicles, and even a couple of armored trucks surrounding the bar. There are a couple of bodies outside, but the building looks to have been firebombed. Black smoke billows out from what was once yours and your friends' favorite hangout spot. You notice Luis's body on the ground, still with the hole in his chest where his heart had been ripped out. You feel a deep sinking sense of despair, and slam your head against the steering wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a tap on the driverside window, which causes you to look up. There is a man dressed in some sort of priest garb standing outside, with two men in military outfits beside him. The man gestures for you to roll the window down, and you oblige. One of the men in uniform steps forward and asks you for your ID. You nervously ask why he needs it and he points his rifle in your face and tells you that he won't ask again. You quickly take you ID out and hand it to him. He takes it over to the priest. He is currently talking on a cellphone in what seems to be a mix of English and what sounds like Spanish. He looks over your ID, then quickly ends his call. \"<i>Bene</i>, he's local. Let's get him back to HQ.\" You start to question what is going on but are stopped by one of the guards, as he orders you to step out of the car and come with them. You exit and are grabbed by the guard and shoved toward the priest. He scolds the guard and then apologizes. You try to ask what is going on again but are cut off by the increasingly louder and louder sounds of helicopter rotors. You look up to see a nondescript black helicopter slowly landing. Looks like your ride's here. As the chopper lands, and the side door is opened, the priest asks you to get in, and before you can hesitate, you're grabbed by the shoulder and practically thrown into the helicopter by one of the guards. </span></div></div>",

Grant keeps yelling out your name, begging for help until his voice sounds distant and you are too far. Why did you have to go out drinking tonight? Why couldn't you just stay in bed? That still might've not changed things for Luis and your other friends. They still would've been at the bar throughout that.. attack. It couldn't really be what they said, you thought as your heart continued racing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of the rowdy bar scene are past you as you run through a dark alleyway, your heart racing like it is about to explode from the adrenaline and the survival instinct. You pass through the trashcans and cardboard homes of the less fortunate and try calling 911 but for the first time it just beeps that it is busy. You didn't even think that was possible. \"I need help! They started killing people at the Parched Scholar!\" You yell out to the grumbles of the sleeping inhabitants of the alley. \"Please!\" Someone tells you to shut up and get out. A couple of other guys murmur in agreement. Maybe you deserve to just stay here, you did abandon your friends to save yourself. What kind of person does that? You are sickened with yourself and still can't connect to 911 or look up anything on the news. It is like you have been disconnected from the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't bother hiding. She is coming for you.\" A voice says very clearly from a cardboard tent. \"W-what?\" You say back, it is starting to rain and getting hard to see anything. \"Just stay still, she doesn't need another fight right now.\" The wino says again, this time with a chuckle. Before you can try to figure out what he is talking about, <i>she</i> appears. You look towards the entrance of the alley and see a floating feminine figure. Her skin is milky white and her eyes look wild with a mix of anger, hunger, and curiosity. Before you can even think about trying to run out the other, she charges at you, her body soaring like a hawk with its talons out. The last thing you feel is her hand grabbing your mouth to stop you from screaming and then with a quick jab, her teeth sink onto your neck and you feel the most excruciating pain possible until you black out. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your eyelids open up quickly, your heart still pounding as you remember your last memory before passing out. What was that? Were you attacked? You wake up in a puddle and check your body with your hands, expecting there to be open wounds or your organs spilled out on the alleyway. But there's nothing. You feel completely fine, your eyes just feel a little strained from the sun almost coming up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes that mean that horrible event at the bar was some dream? Maybe someone spiked your drink, you have to go find your phone and talk to Luis. You can have a laugh at that vivid scene of him being torn apart by.. vampires? <i>Pssh</i>, you really must've taken some powerful drug to think you saw that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alleyway looks completely different in the morning. The cardboard tents have cleared out, and there appears to be no one around at all. To your disgust, you realize what woke you up was some sludge coming down from a sewage pipe attached to the nearest abandoned building. The sun feels so strange today. It has been an unusually strong summer but this is different. It isn't even fully up yet and yet you feel drained by it, as if you've been working out in the hot sun for hours, or doing yard work in 90 degree weather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, you think to yourself. You must smell like garbage from laying out in actual garbage all night.. and your phone is missing so you can't even check in with your friends yet or let your job know you'll be coming in late.

You aren't in the best of neighborhoods but it seems like an exaggeration... With the sun not up yet, you feel a sense of desperation to talk to your friends again and see if they had something slipped into their drink too. The images briefly come back in your head for a moment. Creatures attacking people? Really, that must've been some drug that you took....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks when you are within eyesight of the bar and you see the small army of emergency response vehicles surrounding the building. There's a couple of firetrucks, plenty of police cars, and what looks like two armored vehicles. A big cloud of black smoke rises up from what is left of the bar. Even the windows look like they've been blown out with explosives. You feel sick at the thought of what the interior must've looked like... All that bloodshed, so my friends are gone? You wanted to run to wherever felt safe. This was too much to wake up to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, young man. I need to see your identification.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart stops. You turn from the horrifying view of the wreckage to find the alarming appearance of a man fully dressed in priest garb with two other men in foreign military uniforms standing right by his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, I... I was just leaving.\" You gulp and look down at the floor to pass by without looking at them but you are immediately blocked by the soldiers. Nervously, you try to fish out your ID from your pocket. You can't imagine how suspicious this looks. You reek of being around garbage for the night and your clothes are nasty and wet from the carnage, the one you were hoping would turn out to be a paint party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the soldiers takes your ID and passes it to their leader. The priest has a cellphone out and is muttering rapidly in a mixture of English and a language you don't recognize while he looks over your driver's license. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Bueno</i>, he's local. We are going to bring him back to HQ just to check him out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can make up any excuse, a hand tightens around your shoulder from one of the soldiers. \"We are lucky we got him before sunrise. He doesn't appear to know yet.\" The priest says in heavily accented English to the person on the other line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't much longer before you realize you're going to be joining this odd trio and there will be no further questions about it. You hear a whirring become closer as your transportation arrives.

You begin to question whether you are still intoxicated from the night before, hallucinating this early morning scene while still heavily drugged. But the soldiers, impersonal and brutish, feel quite real when they physically escort you into the back of the chopper and you feel the butt of their assault rifles. You want to ask why they're traveling with a priest but you aren't even sure what church the man is supposed to belong to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silver bullets! We need a new shipment immediately.\" The priest talks to someone on the phone throughout the whole ride. He mentions the urgency of traveling before sunrise, the \"incident\" which you realize refers to the bloodshed at the bar, and mentions the names of several well-known senators and politicians. He seems to know an awful lot about Ridgedon as well, for someone who you've never seen before in such a small town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah bueno,\" he says after finally hanging up the phone. \"You must have plenty of questions and I do apologize for the hospitality of Sergei and Hans over here.\" He gives the soldiers a disapproving look. \"It has been a long night for all of us.\" Before you can respond, he makes a clicking sound to the helicopter pilot who presses some sort of button. In an instant, the view of the still-abandoned town is blocked away by black panels that slide down from the windows to tint out any light. \"My name is Father Benicio and these gentlemen here were hired by the Vatican to travel with me to America. Tell me lad, do you remember anything from the night before?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was an attack.. My friends are gone...\" You hold your head. It begins to throb as if a great pain is splitting your brain open. Is it sorrow? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the bar....\" Father Benicio says solemnly. \"But you got away. You did what you had to do in that moment of life or death.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to abandon them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was survival, lad. You saw an exit in a chaotic situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priest nods to the soldiers and they go to the back of the helicopter. You can't tell if he just tried to buy you some privacy in such a cramped space or if he has sent them to retrieve something. \"But there was more to it, right?\" He continues talking. \"You were approached by a woman. She attacked you and that was the last thing you remember.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers return with what looks like a mini-fridge. They open it up for you and the priest reaches inside. It looks noticeably empty of food but there are plenty of glass bottles with what looks like a thick red liquid congealing inside. Normally something like that would make you nauseous but instead, your stomach aches as if it is completely empty. It looks delicious... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is happening? You feel disgusted with yourself but you can't control your hand from going to receive a bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That woman's name is Desdemona and she wasn't counting on giving you the gift of immortality and insatiable bloodlust. She also didn't think we would show up but we do have the tradition of cleaning up her messes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand... was she a demon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plenty of names for them! For what they are, you are lucky you survived but that is why we need you to come with us. Ah, we are approaching our destination...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather Benicio points out the window. The chopper begins to prepare for landing as it descends down towards...</span></div></div>",

It had gone unused but was maintained by the US Military until the Red Scare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A contingency plan for what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The creatures you saw last night had been cast away and trapped away to restore the natural order. We knew it wouldn't last forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a good thing Father Benicio seems to be a high-ranking member of this organization. As the elevator doors open into a secured hallway with metal walls and security cameras, you receive dirty looks from the groups of clergymen and soldiers going about their business.\"Don't mind them,\" He tells you reassuringly. \"They've never seen one of you in person before. Everyone's just really suspicious that she left you alive. Maybe just to toy with us all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walk into a locked door with a panel for fingerprints. The priest salutes the soldier at the door and pulls out an identification card that hangs around his rosary. \"Your family is safe. Your government has an accordance with the Vatican for these type of situations and they have gladly relinquished the matter for us, the Italian military, and our circle of mercenaries to handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The town has been locked down under the veil of a deadly chemical spill. With all traffic under our watch and plenty of surveillance, we can track Desdemona and her gang when they go to feed again.\" He said to feed <i>again</i>. Which was a sickening feeling when you remember the lives lost in the carnage back at the bar. What if they make their way to your family or your other friends? \"You don't have a clue where she is, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather Benicio maintains his pokerface. \"Well, there is where you come in. Throughout our entire history of studying vampires, we have very few records of half-human ones. You're either food or you.. become something far more monstrous, which is why given whatever has happened to you...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You flop down on the bed and try to get back to sleep. Just as you start to dove off, you're awoken by a crashing sound outside. It sounds like some garbage cans being knocked over. You groan in annoyance, and try to go to sleep again. You then hear footsteps on the roof. You get up, put your shoes on, grab a flashlight, and head outside to see what's on the roof. You shine the flashlight up on the roof, and yell that whoever's up there needs to go away, and before you can even react, you're tackled by someone jumping from the roof. The guy reveals himself to be a vampire, and readies to bite you. You freak out, and the adrenaline causes you to become temporarily strong enough to push the guy off of you. You jump to your feet, and try to think of what to do. There is a broken piece of the fence laying in the yard. you could use that to pierce his heart. Of course, you could also always run back in the house. Vampires need to be invited in, right? Whatever you decide, you better do it quick, as he quickly recovered from being shoved off of you.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">In 1850, a priest from Boston had come out to the territory that would later become Arizona, after hearing tales of people being slaughtered by unholy creatures of the night, known as \"vampires\" to the old world. He arrived in the small mining town of Old Canyon, and began questioning the residents about the vampires. He was told where to find what most considered to be the main coven, and was told a incantation that he could use lock the creatures in their cave. He went on his way, armed with wooden stakes, holy water, and the incantation. He found the cave that the coven called home, and dismounted his horse, and took out his bottle of holy water. He began dousing the entrance with it, while reciting the incantation. Before he could finish it, though, he was ambushed by members of the coven. He managed to take a few out with stakes to the heart, but he ultimately got pinned by one of them. It taunted him, and then readied to drain his blood, when he began praying. As if by the Lord's hand, the priest managed to break free of the vampire holding him down, and stabbed it in the heart. He then proceeded with reciting the incantation, and did it near perfectly, and just as he finished, a lightning bolt struck the cave's entrance, causing it to collapse, trapping the coven inside. The priest had sealed the unholy creatures away for good, or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n146 years later, in 1996, a group of five teenagers drive out to the fabled cave, with the intent of camping and possibly catching a vampire on film. Some of them get drunk, and manage to accidentally free the coven, which leads to the deaths of four of the teens. and mysteriously, the half-vampire transformation of one. With the coven not sated from the blood of the four teens, they make their way to the nearby town of Ridgedon, which is about two miles from the abandoned remains of Old Canyon. Ridgedon may not have any residents by morning...</td>",
