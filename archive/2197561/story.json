Even with all this training and all this battling, I'm not really seeing any sort of advancement in your skills.\" Sothis yawned as she leaned down on one arm of her throne, gazing down at Byleth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Of course my skills are becoming sharper! I've gotten so much stronger since coming here!\" He argued, not really understanding where the sleeping deity was coming from with any of this nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, you couldn't have even handled that monster last week without the aid of your students. Face it, you're dependent on them. I want you to be strong enough that you can challenge and defeat any foes BY YOURSELF! And I'm afraid these trivial little skirmishes won't be enough to buff you up for future conflicts!\" Sothis sighed, sitting up right as she looked back down at Byleth once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all that said, I believe it's time I take your training into my hands, personally. From this point on for the rest of the month, I'll cast a very unique magic spell upon you. You'll be affected by it for the entire month, and you'll be forced to survive its afflictions on and off the battlefield, is that understood?\" The green haired girl asked. Byleth stood silent for a moment or two, pondering the girl's words. Maybe she was right? Maybe he did need extra training in order to become stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for the month? Right?\" He asked, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, just one month and I'll lift the spell from you.\" Sothis nodded, raising a brow down at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... alright, hit me with it.\" Byleth said confidantly, ready for his friend's little 'training' to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you're so eager.. but.. I don't think you'll be so confident when you see what kind of spell I use on you~\" Sothis giggled as she raised her arm forward, her palm facing him as a golden aura began to glow from her hand. Within a matter of seconds, the boy was blasted with a stream of powerful magic and he was sent back to the world above...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-GAAH!  Byleth sat up, his heart pounding as he awoke from his dream and communion with Sothis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddess.. last time I agree to something as stupid as that...\" The professor said to himself as he pushed some covers away, though finding it somewhat harder to do so. Lifting her hand up to his face, Byleth rubbed his eyes, trying to regain his eye sight for the coming day. But as things came into focus... something seemed.. different? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?! What the?!\" Byleth looked in awe and wonder as the world around him had grown to gigantic sizes.. or he had shrunken, that was another possibility. Turning around, he saw that his pillow was much larger than even a house now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sothis, what did you do?!\" He said to himself in panic as he stood up, now seeing his own bed as a landmass now. A quick estimate put him at roughly two inches tall as he compared himself to his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. I gotta get help!\" Byleth quickly ran to the edge of the bed where the blanket reached all the way down to the floor. That would be his way down, but what he didnt know is who he would try and connect with...</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, from his personal quarters, he was relatively close to where his students would be at this time of day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the students, the one closest in proximity would be Bernadetta. Byleth knew she would be hiding in her room like she always did. He wasn't sure how much help she would be though. Bernie was scared of everything and everyone. If she heard a voice without seeing the speaker, she would probably think her room was haunted. If she saw his tiny form, she might pass out thinking he was a bug or a mouse before she recognized him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he didn't go for Bernadetta, he could likely find Dorothea in her room as well. It was early in the day, so she was probably putting her makeup on and getting dressed to make sure she caught the attention of every guy she walked past. He knew Dorothea would take good care of him if she found him, but for that to happen she would have to notice him. She had a tendency to sing to herself when in her room, and which would make yelling her name difficult. And, as much as it embarrassed Byleth to think this, he had a feeling that Dorothea's.... <i>assets</i> would make it a bit harder for her to see something down at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he was willing to make a longer trek, there was also Petra and Edelgard. He wasn't certain, but if he had to guess he figured Petra would be training in the training area just a bit north of his room, and Edelgard would likely be doing some work in the Black Eagles classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he chose Petra, he was sure the kind foreign girl would do her best to aid him. However, he worried that the language barrier may cause her to misunderstand what she wanted from him. Plus, if she was training, it would be hardest of all to get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he chose Edelgard, he'd have to make a pretty long trek, but she would likely be the best person to help him of all. She was smart, resourceful, and had the resources of the entire Adrestian empire at her disposal. And Byleth knew she liked him a lot. If anything, she might have liked him too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Byleth decide to go looking for?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(And the puns begin.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth considered his options and decided to go with his surefire bet with Bernadetta.  The shrinking violet was almost guaranteed to be in her room. And if she wasn\u2019t, she\u2019d certainly return soon. The other benefit was that he didn\u2019t have to move that far.  All he had to do was go south, and he\u2019d eventually stop just in front of his shy student\u2019s room. It certainly beat going through crowded footpaths to get to the Black Eagles classroom. The less time he spent near the boots of his students, the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trek to Bernadetta\u2019s room was uneventful. It gave him the opportunity to get accustomed to his new stature. The same paths he walked every day were now an incomprehensible scale. He had to give it to Sothis. She found a way to make these slow days at Garreg Mach interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped just short of the door leading to Bernie\u2019s room. At least once a week, he\u2019d stop and check in on her, and she\u2019d turn him away. Now at his current size, he could just bypass the door entirely. Sure, it was an invasion of privacy and most likely a breach of proper conduct for a professor. However, he needed the help before he ended up a stain on the floor. He just hoped he didn\u2019t catch her in a compromising position. He got down and crawled his way through the bottom opening of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Bernadetta seemed to just be resting on her bed, happily reading away. She lay on her back with one foot dangling off the edge of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth considered his option on how to get his attention and came up with a simple flow chart as he walked over to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBernadetta!\u201d He called. There was no response. He tried calling her name again, but it seemed she was just too engrossed in her book. No matter how many times he called out for her, she was lost in the whatever story she was reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Byleth moved onto to plan B. He stared a bit too long at his pupil\u2019s socked foot. He wasn\u2019t too enthused about having to go near them, but he was lacking any reasonable options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer black socks went up to her knees, giving him ample space to climb his way up. Though, he would decide to do that after he prodded the giant student\u2019s foot, hoping to forego the climbing and get her attention now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth rolled his arms before swinging, punching at the ball of Bernadetta\u2019s foot. She didn\u2019t react, and the shrunken professor found himself wishing that he had trained his brawling skills with Catherine instead of his swordplay. At most, her toes twitched, a subconscious reaction as the giant girl paid him no mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen disaster struck as the weight of Bernadetta\u2019s foot came crashing down on him. It knocked the wind from his lungs, sending Byleth sputtering for air beneath the wall of cotton. He didn\u2019t notice it from now, but there was a slight stale scent in the air. Now that it was all that he could breathe for the time being, he definitely realized it was her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squirmed against the weight, feeling absolutely helpless that all it took was the unintentional shift of his meekest student to overpower him. Sothis was right, only in the sense that she rigged the entire scenario against him. He could have sword he heard snickering in the deep recessed of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth continued to fight, refusing to give up and let the Goddess inside him win.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Bernadetta continued to relax in bed, reading some romance novel Dorothea had left in the classroom that she'd been unable to work up the courage to return, she was snapped out of her escapism by a strange tickle. Thinking her socked foot had just rested against a rough part of the stone floor, she experimentally dragged her foot closer to the bed as she tried to find a more comfortable spot for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Byleth, this was pure agony as Bernadetta inadvertently dragged him across the stone floor with her foot. He struggled to grasp onto something as he was forced into a painful roll, feeling both the giant socked foot and the hard stone grinding into him. Out of desperation, he began struggling even more, punching and kicking at Bernadetta's sole in a last ditch effort to get her to notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Bernadetta's eyes widened. Whatever her foot had come in contact with was clearly alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEEEEEK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a kneejerk response, her foot lurched away from the floor as she crouched on her bed. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw something small scurrying near the corner of the bed. Screaming again, she threw her book at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth didn't even have a chance to react before the leather bound missile slammed into him. Mercifully avoiding breaking anything, he nonetheless was pinned down, trapped between the floor and a surprisingly lurid written description of the exploits of someone named Prince Chrom. Apparently, he was well hung. And sex on top of a pegasus, while ill-advised, was still possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, oh my god, there's a mouse in here...\" Bernadetta fretted, eyes locked on the discarded book in the middle of the floor. \"P-professor Byleth is going to find out I've been secretly eating cake in my room! He's going to tell the monks, and they're going to make me clean the whole monastery! While everyone JUDGES me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the quiet snickering in the back of Byleth's mind had grown into full fledged laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The mighty son of Jeralt, felled by a harlequin romance novel,\"</i> Sothis tutted between giggles. <i>\"Clearly, I was right, Byleth. Being a teacher has done nothing for your skills. Can you not even escape on your own?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth refused to dignify the ghost girl in his head with a response as he continued to squirm his way out. After what felt like an eternity, he managed to get one of his arms free, waving it out from under the book as he tried to struggle out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta shrieked again as she saw something under the book move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, it's still alive! I... I have to destroy the evidence!\" Thinking quickly, she grabbed one of her boots from the foot of the bed and slowly crept from the book, brandishing it above her like a weapon. \"S-sorry, Mister Mouse! It's either you or me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How have Chrom and this Sumia woman not plummeted to their demise?\" </i>Sothis wondered before she and Byleth heard the sound of Bernadetta's booming footsteps slowly coming closer. <i>\"Uh-oh. Byleth, you need to find a way to let her know you aren't a rodent before she kills us both! Assuming I'm not already a ghost, but this is not the way I wish to find out!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on... I've got an idea...\" Byleth grunted as he focused his attention onto his free hand. With so many members of Black Eagle house taking an interest in magic, he had been forced to learn it himself if he wanted to be a good teacher for his students. While he wasn't quite at Professor Hanneman's level, or even Hubert, Lindhart, or Dorothea's if he were completely honest, he had still learned enough at this point to perform a basic fire spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Bernadetta gasped in shock as Dorothea's book suddenly began to catch fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SINCE WHEN CAN MICE BREATHE FIRE?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened as her gaze zeroed in on the tiny creature burning a whole through the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... that isn't a mouse at all! It's... it's a...\"</span></div></div>",

Recognizing a familiar head of green hair, she knelt down, the boot in her hand dropped haphazardly to the side. \"Wait... PROFESSOR?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Bernadetta!\" Byleth called out as he finally freed himself from the flaming book. \"I promise I'll explain everything, but first, can you help me put out this fire? I don't want it to spread to the rest of your room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta hurriedly nodded before donning her discarded boot and smothering out the blaze with several well placed stomps. As Byleth recoiled from the quakes, he paled as it occurred to him that absolutely nothing would have prevented her from doing that while he was still trapped beneath the flaming book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... could have been bad,\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I would have rewound time if that had occurred, do not worry,\"</i> Sothis assured him. <i>\"Although that would have meant you failed the training. I also certainly would have mocked you for being crushed to death by your meekest student for quite some time.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Sothis,\" Byleth muttered sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We'll discuss your impertinence and lack of proper gratitude later,\"</i> Sothis said snidely. <i>\"For now, I'll leave you to discuss matters with your student.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-professor?\" Bernadetta's voice got the professor's attention as Sothis faded back to the recesses of his mind. \"Wh-what happened to you? How are you so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a training exercise,\" Byleth said cryptically, deciding that trying to explain Sothis and her powers to any of his students would result in them thinking he was crazy at best and getting dissected by the Church at worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-training exercise? D-did the Knights shrink you?! Can they do that?!\" Bernadetta swallowed nervously. \"Will they do it to us too?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Nothing like that!\" Byleth waved his hands in an effort to assuage her. \"Bernadetta, can you pick me up so I don't have to shout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\" Somewhat reluctantly, Bernadetta held out her hand for the shrunken professor to climb onto. Byleth did so, and felt his stomach lurch as Bernadetta carried him to her desk, her hand violently trembling all the while. Once he was on the desk and she was able to sit and lean close enough to still hear as he spoke normally, he gave her a somewhat edited version of how he'd ended up two inches tall and in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so my room was just closest,\" Bernadetta sighed. \"Yeah, that... that makes more sense than you coming in my room to...\" she suddenly jerked upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bernadetta? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HAVEN'T BEEN SECRETLY EATING CAKE!\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bernadetta, it's okay,\" Byleth assured her. \"I don't care. Lots of students eat in their rooms. It's fine. You're not in trouble.\" Having learned recently why Bernadetta acted the way she did, Byleth resolved to always be as patient with the shy lavender-haired girl and her insecurities as possible (as well as murder her father as soon as the opportunity presented itself, though that was less relevant right now). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, he did need to hurry this conversation along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bernadetta, do you mind taking me to Edelgard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Edelgard?\" Bernadetta swallowed. \"Wh-why do you need to talk to Edelgard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since she's the head of Black Eagle house, she needs to know I'll be like this for a month so we can plan around it,\" Byleth explained patiently. \"She's usually studying alone in the classroom around this time, so you shouldn't have to talk to anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but if this is Edelgard's alone time, she definitely won't want to see me!\" Bernadetta fretted. \"She got really mad when she caught me following her a few days ago, and she hates me now! She'll throw me in an Imperial dungeon if I bother her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she won't,\" Byleth insisted, choosing to table the question of why Bernadetta was following Edelgard around for now. \"I promise she doesn't hate you. She tries to be a good leader for everyone in the Black Eagles. If anything, in our conversations, she's said she worries about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's even worse! I'm such a burden to everyone around me!\" Bernadetta wailed. \"I even almost killed you earlier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you didn't, and I'm fine,\" Byleth gestured to himself. \"See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bernadetta, we've been over this,\" Byleth sighed. \"If you're going to do well at this school, you need to learn to talk to the other students and teachers without panicking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta whimpered louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can talk to me, can't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're different,\" Bernadetta looked down at Byleth fondly. \"I... I don't know why, but you're different. I feel... safe... around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began absently petting Byleth with her finger. Byleth remained impassive as the massive digit ruffled his hair and clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how you're able to handle this,\" Bernadetta mused. \"Everything must be so big and scary to you. You're so brave, Professor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can be, too, Bernadetta,\" Byleth gently urged her. \"And you can start by going out and telling Edelgard about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta swallowed nervously as she looked from Byleth to her closed door...</span></div></div>",

She was especially displeased by the empire's future ruler cuddling the professor close to her bosom and petting him on the head. For some odd reason all these actions internally made her upset. Before she could even make a case to be the one to take care of the professor, the telltale sound of footsteps drew near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone was coming and they'd arrive any second. Bernadetta and Edelgard panicked. Just what were they supposed to do? They couldn't let anyone see Byleth in this weakened state. They needed to hide him and fast. The snow haired girl scanned high and low around the room and silently cursed at how far spread out everything was. She continued her search for a hiding spot until her eyes landed on something rather... unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was certainly a creative place to hid a tiny person. It was close, compact, and no one would think to look in there. But at the same time it also made Edelgards cheeks flush in embarrassment. Could she actually do this? Could she really bring herself to hide her teacher in there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was a resounding... NO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she went for the next best thing. She reached over to the stuttering mess that was Berndetta. Said girl yelped in shock as Edelgard used her free hand to force down her shirt collar. \"Please forgive me for this!\" In one swift motion she dropped their shrunken teacher down Bernadetta's shirt and into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple haired girl gasped in shock and embarrassment as she felt her tiny professor slide down deep into her twin canyons. The contact felt good, but also left her embarrassed beyond all belief! Why did El have to go and that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before she could say more the classroom door opened to reveal none other than Hubert.</span></div></div>",

He had accidentally burrowed his way between her breasts in an attempt to dig his way out. She had to fight the urge to scream and pull him out as other students gave her weird looks.

That was rather odd considering at the very least Annette would be fast asleep at a table. And yet, even she was missing from this picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was just perfect for the recluse. She and the professor could be completely alone where Edelgard wouldn't find them. The meek girl slowly slid into the room and silently closed the door behind her. It was just her now. Her, the books, and the professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the professor... Bernadetta made her way to the very back of the library and found an empty seat obscured by a large bookcase. It was the ideal spot to stay hidden even if someone ventured in. The shy archer hastily sat down as she felt her shrunken professor struggling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis constant struggles between her breasts left her face a bright shade of crimson. He just felt so good. A part of her was actually tempted to leave him be for a few more minutes, but then more rational part of her brain kicked in. What was she thinking just now!? She couldn't leave the professor in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully she grabbed the collar of her shirt and gently slid it down. Bernie felt her breath hitch as again she could feel the professor descending deeper into her bosom. From what she could tell he was already in there deep as she couldn't see him from her angle. Knowing what had to be done... She reached into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth meanwhile was fighting to dig himself free, and was failing miserably. His student's chest was akin to that of quicksand, the more he struggled the quicker and deeper he descended. He still could hardly believe Edelgard had deposited him in here in her haste. \"At least she apologized.\" he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between Bernadetta's cleavage was warm and seemed to be getting warmer still. Not to mention it was also a bit cramped at sweaty. The sweat ensuring he sunk deeper in and was marked by it's owner. Overall it was an unpleasant experience. It also didn't help that Sothis was laughing at his expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually light began to flood his vision, looking up he could see to massive fingers headed his way. Was he finally being retrieved from this sweaty prison? If so it was about time. Byleth might've been patient by nature, but even he had his limits. He allowed the fingers to grip him and slowly he found himself ascending for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFresh air soon filled his lungs and he soon found himself placed down gently on aa wooden surface. Looking up he could see Bernadetta looking down at him with concern like earlier. It would seem he was back at square one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh joy.</span></div></div>",

You've been in there for ages. You need to train!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh!

This training is absolutely crucial to your future.\" Ingrid responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care. I can't handle it today. Please leave.\" Bernadetta yelled back. She wasn't any good at lying, and she couldn't say the real reason today was especially bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you come here then?\" Ingrid asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I come here? I didn't choose to join the academy. I was forced.\" Bernadetta replied, happy that the conversation was steering away from training. Still, she felt her tiny professor squirming in her hand, trying to get her attention again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid paused for a moment before replying: \"I suppose not everyone has to be pleased about being here, but even so... Bernadetta, I'll ask one more time\u2014please come out of there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll tell you one more time. It's not happening. Not right now.

In fact, before he knew what was going on, she'd swung him around behind her back, leaving him hanging in front of shorts clad butt as her other hand lifted up her skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry professor.\" Bernadetta said, and he immediately knew what was about to happen. He tried to should out to her to stop but before he could the hand he was in had made its way to the edge of her shorts, pulling back the the tight black pants with a tug of a finger, and revealing an enormous pair of pale white butt cheeks. They actually we're more or less the same color as her skin, likely because the purple haired girl never went outside if she could avoid it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bernadetta wait let's talk about-\" Byleth began, but his words transitioned to screams as she released her grip, allowing him to plummet down towards her waiting ass cheeks. He dropped straight down, legs first, sliding effortlessly along the steep slope of her silky smooth skin until stopping suddenly as his face smacked into her opposing cheek at the point where they pressed most tightly together. He looked up to see the panicked face of Bernadetta staring down at him, eyes wide with fear and embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta yelped as she felt her tiny professor slip down between her cheeks, sliding down until he was nice and snug in the depths of her ass, right in the center of her cheeks. She could only barely see him, thanks to the contrast of his bluish green hair against her butt cheeks. \"I'll try and take you out soon professor.\" Bernie whispered, before releasing her grip on her shorts and allowing them to snap shut. Byleth was in complete darkness, his only interaction with the world being mediated by the soft booty of his shyest student. The only bright side to this situation was that Bernadetta was one of his least active students, as she spent most of her time in bed. While Edelgard's toned glutes could crush him with a twitch, Bernadetta's big soft butt cheeks could only smother him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Ingrid knocking down the door was loud enough for Byleth to hear it. Unfortunately, it startled Bernadette, causing her to reflexively tense up. Unfortunately, her butt cheeks also tensed up, clenching tightly around Byleth in the process. He screamed in pain as some of his ribs cracked, but any sound he made just bounced around between Bernie's cheeks, lost before it made it to Ingrid or Bernadetta. As it turned out though, there was <i>someone</i> listening, and she stopped time for a moment to talk to him, stretching Bernadetta's brief clench out longer than the second it probably actually lasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're doing really great so far Byleth.\" Sothis taunted. \"You've been shrunken for 20 minutes, and all you've managed to do is got shoved between a teenage girl's butt cheeks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Sothis.\" Byleth said from behind clenched teeth, still having his body squeezed by the giant butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose this is strength training in a way. Seeing how long you can hold your own against a giant butt cheek. And once you masted Bernadetta's butt, you can move on to the other girl's. If you can survive between Petra's cheeks by the end of the month I'll be impressed.\" Sothis teased, laughing at the thought of a whole class of giant girls taking turns using their butts to torment her host. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just unfreeze time already!\" Byleth demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine. You've really got a stick up your butt today.\" Sothis said, letting out one last chuckle before restoring the flow of time. Byleth sucked in air as Bernadetta's butt relaxed, and the conversation above continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! My door! Why?!\" Bernadetta shouted, unsure how she would ever hide now. And if she couldn't hide, she couldn't take the professor out of his hiding spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, nowhere left to hide.\" Ingrid explained. \"Now come along, Bernadetta. You've got lots of training to catch up on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spare me! I'll train! Just... not with you. Anyone but you, please! I'll just go train on my own!\" Bernadette said, just trying to get away. She was afraid that her reaction to the feeling of her teacher squirming in her rear would show on her face, and it did, but it was indistinguishable from the general day to day anxiety everyone always saw in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid didn't like that answer \"Is that so? That presents a problem. I know we are two very different people. But whether or not you like me, we are on the same side and must learn to work together. Now come on, we are going to train.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Ingrid drags Bernadetta out of her room by the arm, planning on training her in Pegasus riding (while Byleth suffers in her butt)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.

That presents a problem. I know we are two different people. But whether or not you like me, we are on the same side  and must learn to work together. Now come on, we are going to train.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please don't make me!\" Bernadetta continued to protest, but her pleas went unanswered as she felt her fellow student's hand gripped her arm and dragged her along. She really didn't feel like training, even less so with her very sensitive cargo. Knowing the blonde as well as she did, there was no way she'd just let her go. She would just have to hope the professor would be alright until she could find some solitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth meanwhile was forced to endure his shy student's movements as it became all too clear she was on the move. Each and every step caused those pale cheeks surrounding him to smother and grind him up. Clearly Bernadetta was unable to deter Ingrid from this joint training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait? Training!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth's eyes widened as the memory of why Ingrid originally sought out the shy archer came to the forefront. Training! If she made Bernadetta train while he was trapped between her pale cheeks then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his struggles began anew. If Bernadetta started training while he was in this state then he'd be crushed or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on back in the outside world, Bernadetta was turning as red as a tomato. She could feel her shrunken teacher's struggles in her rear and the feeling was both good and embarrassing. Mostly embarrassing. Fortunately for her Ingrid wasn't able to tell it wasn't her usual anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the pair arrived at the stables where they kept the Pegasus for combat. \"Here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Ingrid? Y-you don't mean?\" Bernie's eyes widened as she realized what the blonde had in mind for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid blonde nodded as she released the archer. \"Today we are going to work on your skills when riding a Pegasus. You're pretty solid on the ground as an archer but there may come a time when you're called upon for an aerial assault.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was true, but right now the last thing she wanted was to saddle up and go flying. What would happen if she sat down while the professor was pressed between her cheeks? Would he be crushed!? The thought made her sick. He was the one person who she was able to form an actual connection with without passing out. She didn't know what she'd do if he wasn't here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ingrid I don't think this is a good--\" The archer's word's were suddenly cut off as she found her feet no longer touched ground, and were those... arm's wrapped around her? Was Ingrid hoisting her up? Oh no, it was Caspar all over again. All she could do was yelp when she understood why she was being slung over the blonde's shoulder like a sack of potatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was carrying her over to the Pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! Ingrid I don't want--\" She couldn't even finish as she was forced onto the saddle. The purple-haired girl's eyes were as wide as saucers. Ingrid had forced her to sit down. No! No! No! No! No! No! The professor. Oh goddess, the professor! Was alright!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl felt the oncoming sensation of a panic attack, but was only just barely able to keep herself together when she felt the faintest of moment down under. He was alive. Oh thank the goddess he was alive. If he had died because of her then everyone would find out. Edelgard would have her head. No! Captain Jeralt would have her head while the Black Eagles watched and her father gave his blessing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Ingrid said as she took the Pegasus by the reigns and led it outside where she had a few targets set up. She then walked up to one and grabbed a bow and quiver filled with arrows that she'd prepared. She then handed them to the anxious archer who took them with shaking hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid then hopped on the Saddle in front. \"Alright. Let the training begin.\"</span></div></div>",

Sighing deeply, she decided to get this over with.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, I-Ingrid?\" the meek girl said. \"B-Before we get to any of that, I actually have something rather important to show you\u2026\" This caught Ingrid's interest as Bernadetta was normally the person who shied away from just about everything; her wanting to tell Ingrid something very important was a rarity.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really?\" the Blue Lion responded. \"Well, if it's really that important to hold off on training, I'll listen.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, um\u2026o-okay? Can I, um, get you to\u2026well\u2026t-turn around for a bit? I-It'll only be for a little bit I promise, but I gotta get something out first.\" Ingrid was confused as to why Bernadetta needed her to turn around for a little since it sounded like she was going to do something very private; they were both girls, but perhaps Bernadetta was just horribly self-conscious about herself, so Ingrid gave her that privacy by looking the other way. Still, she could hear Bernadetta barely shuffling in her seat, but she could clearly hear the other girl muttering under her breath and the ruffling of her clothes. For a brief moment, Ingrid considered the possibility of Bernadetta pulling something from out of her clothes, but what could it be that ol' Bernie wanted to do? Said archer herself was digging through her underwear for the professor, hoping to the goddess that she didn't somehow crush him or worse\u2014get him holed up inside of her somehow. After a bit of digging, she finally caught him and lowered herself off of her seat to pull him out, squeaking out a barely audible (by Ingrid's standards) apology.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"O-Okay, you can turn around now.\" Red flushed as red as blood, Bernadetta held her professor in her hands as Ingrid turned around to look. The other girl was confused at first, wondering if this doll of their professor was really what Bernadetta wanted to show her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is\u2026that a doll of the professor?\" Ingrid said. \"I\u2026didn't know that you liked him that much Bernadetta, but\u2014\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, what? No! I mean\u2014this\u2026isn't a doll Ingrid. It's\u2026the professor.\" Ingrid looked at Bernadetta as if she told a terrible joke. Bernadetta wasn't the type to joke about anything though, so Ingrid humored the girl just this once to take a look at the \"professor\". Much to her surprise, the professor waved back at her and tried to speak to her. Dolls didn't do that at all, and out of curiosity Ingrid plucked Byleth from Bernadetta's hands, earning her a protest from the other girl.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"H-Hang on Ingrid! Please, be gentle\u2014he'll get crushed if we're not careful!\" Ingrid inspected Byleth a little more, slightly recoiling when she found that he smelled like butt.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Professor,\" Ingrid started. \"That can't really be you can it?\" Byleth replied in confirmation that it was him, and all Ingrid could do was stare mouth agape. So many questions were racing through her mind she couldn't possibly ask just one, but before she could ask any of them Byleth had beat her to it, explaining that it was a form of training gone awry. Bernadetta was asked by him if he could take him to Edelgard and see if the princess knew anything of it, and that was when Ingrid happened upon the two of them. Now that Ingrid was cleared up on the situation, she started thinking of a way to help Byleth in his shrunken down state\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></div></div>",

The distance was also a problem, given how far each of their rooms was from his own. Though he would have to leave his quarters, he needed to come up with a plan for how he would meet up with any of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he went to the training grounds, he could probably find Ingrid, and he could hide by her stuff until she was done.

Although, it\u2019s possible that she\u2019s not even alone, and he may be found by someone else or crushed by someone while they\u2019re training.

He wasn\u2019t sure who else was working today with Mercedes, but he could only hope they didn\u2019t mistake him for a pest trying to eat the food.

Shamir and I need something from you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth\u2019s eyes widened at the giant forms of Catherine and Shamir as they entered his room. While he knew he was small, the sudden point of reference illustrated how tiny he became. The titanic knight wore her usual outfit and had Thuderbrand hanging from her belt as she surveyed the room. The Dagdan mercenary that entered behind her maintained her stoic expression as she also studied the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI told you he wouldn\u2019t be here, let\u2019s just wait for him to come to us. He knows we need that whetstone,\u201d Shamir said. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t like people searching through his things.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to learn more about the guy. There must be something about him if Lady Rhea holds him in such high esteem.\u201d Catherine said to her partner, not caring about her breach of etiquette. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a seat while I do my thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamir simply shrugged before stepping over to the nearby bed. Byleth had been standing on the edge of his bed, waving his arms when he noticed her walk over. He thought she\u2019d seen him, but those hopes were dashed when she turned around and began to lower her butt onto the bed. Byleth tried to run, but Shamir\u2019s large rear outpaced him and collapsed on top of him. He struggled in hopes of being noticed, but this only caused Shamir to grind her butt into the bed, and further trap him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Well well, well,' </i>Byleth heard Sothis speak in his head. <i>\u2018You couldn\u2019t even outrun someone sitting down. You needed this training if your skills have fallen this much.\u2019 </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018It\u2019s hard to dodge something that big!\u2019</i> Byleth thought back bitterly, unsure of what he should do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Shamir gives up on waiting for Byleth and leaves, taking the tiny professor with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Catherine gets bored of looking through Byleth\u2019s things and decides to take a seat next to Shamir. The former mercenary scoots over to make room and frees Byleth, only for him to be sat on by Catherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Shamir finally notices something beneath her and is surprised to discover Byleth. She\u2019s more than a little amused by his tiny size, but will she tell her partner?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.

He and his class were able to see through a mysterious group\u2019s threat of assassinating the archbishop and find them raiding the Holy Mausoleum. They managed to rout the thieves, yet the last one managed to open one of the tombs and steal the artifact inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Byleth was able to reclaim the artifact and use it to defeat the thief, though that was what apparently caused his new predicament. Last he remembered, he was having a conversation with his class\u2019 leader before suddenly collapsing. When he woke, he was in Professor\u2019s Manuela\u2019s office stripped of his armor and the artifact. Now he was currently in the Archbishop\u2019s office, standing on a table that had been brought in for him. The only people present were his father, Flayn, Seteth, Lady Rhea, and himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was here that he learned the artifact he wielded was called the \u201cSword of the Creator\u201d. It was apparently the weapon of Nemesis, a significant figure in Fodlan's history and leader of the original ten lords of Fodlan. It was apparently a very powerful artifact and, for now, it was determined that it had something to do with Byleth\u2019s shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease calm yourself Sir Jeralt!\u201d Flayn spoke before Rhea or Seteth. \u201cWe had no way of knowing something like this would happen, we do not want the professor to come to any harm.\u201d She wanted to speak further, but a motion from Seteth caused her to go quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeralt calmly shook his head at the girl. \u201cI believe you. I don\u2019t suspect anyone in the church having foul intent for my son, I am merely frustrated that this somehow happened under the church\u2019s watch.\u201d He didn't entirely believe the words himself, but Jeralt figured that no one currently in the room wanted to harm his son directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand your frustration, Jeralt. If anything happened to Flayn I would be furious beyond reconciliation,\u201d Seteth began, hoping his feelings for Flayn would resonate with Jeralt\u2019s own, \u201cBut you must understand that the knights had to attend to Lady Rhea. If the assassination threat had been true, then not having every knight available present would\u2019ve been too much of a risk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeralt let an exhausted sigh escape him as he rolled his neck, trying to relax. He knew that was the kind of answer he would get, but he was hoping the church would own up in some way or offer a solution. His attention was drawn to Rhea as she began speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeralt, what happened in the tombs that night is an unprecedented occurrence. It was thought that no one would be able to wield the Sword of the Creator again, yet your child was able to wield it.\u201d She spoke with a sense of awe in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, apparently, because of that sword he\u2019s smaller than the average doll. Two very strange things happened to my son happened last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. It is true that those without the proper crest are not supposed to be able to wield that crest\u2019s weapon, but there have never been reports of side effects such as this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth, figuring now would be a good time to interject, spoke, \u201cSo was I not compatible with the sword? I know for certain that I used it to strike down one of the thieves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have confirmed that you did wield the sword, though even those without crests can use artifacts for a time. Your students confirmed that for us. As for your reduced stature, professor Manuela was the one who saw that come to pass while you were in the infirmary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where have you put the relic? Back inside of its tomb?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we deemed that unwise.\u201d Rhea jumped into the conversation. \u201cFor now it is being kept in close proximity to me. We must have it on hand if we are to figure out what it has done to you. Professor Hanamen and Seteth have begun looking into it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth nodded, though he doubted anyone could see it. \u201cFair enough. Just be careful, I would hate for this to happen to anyone else.\u201d He paused for a moment before talking to Jeralt. \u201cFather, just so you know, I do not regret my decision. The results were not perfectly ideal, but who knows what could have happened if I didn\u2019t act.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cMy my, I do believe that\u2019s the first I\u2019ve heard you call Jeralt \u2018father\u2019. Feeling emotional?\u201d</i> Quipped Sothis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I know you don\u2019t.\u201d Jeralt replied, fully expecting that from his son. \u201cSo what are we supposed to do now? Just wait for the church to find a cure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t just wait around.\u201d Byleth spoke before anyone answered his father\u2019s questions. \u201cI will continue to teach my students. I can\u2019t do anything physical, but I can always impart knowledge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone present looked at Byleth with a shocked expression, except for Jeralt whose face was buried into his hand. \u201cI knew you\u2019d say that.\u201d Jeralt had noticed since Byleth first became a professor that he\u2019d changed. For some reason the kids really resonated with him, they were very special to Byleth. Not even his current ridiculous predicament would keep him away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAre you daft!? Do you understand how fragile you are now!? These students of yours cannot be worth the dangers teaching them would entail!\u201d</i> Sothis shouted, the sound of her voice very forward in Byleth's head now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am well aware of my fragility, but I cannot abandon my students! If you were listening, you would\u2019ve heard I have no plans to engage in anything physical. I will simply give the lectures. My students are fully capable of handling the other tasks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of the conversation Byleth was having, Seteth and Rhea discussed his request between themselves. Flayn silently pouted beside them, well aware that she had no say in the matter. Hearing Byleth\u2019s eager request only made her desire for a life among the students grow stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two took quite a bit of time to debate. Though everyone present knew that Rhea would get some version of whatever she wanted. The two eventually stopped discussing and separated. Clearing his throat, Seteth spoke. \u201cVery well. We will allow you to continue to lecture your students. As you said, you must avoid any physical training with your students; even magic or archery. You will be required to have an escort with you at all times as well. We will provide you with one, assuming you do not find one for yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd will I be considered for the position?\u201d Jeralt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shake of the head was Seteth\u2019s reply. \u201cYou will not. You are the acting captain of the knights of Seiros. You would not be able to watch Byleth at all times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeralt shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI figured that would be the case. I can\u2019t complain I suppose, I barely had time to look out for the boy when he was normal size since I got here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding that his request had been granted, Byleth bowed slightly. \u201cThank you for allowing me to keep up my lectures. I haven\u2019t been here very long, but I feel a connection with my students that I couldn\u2019t leave unattended.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea nodded, a caring smile on her face. \u201cI understand. You have grown quite close with your students in a short time. Just be careful, you are an important member of the faculty and we cannot lose you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I will choose my escort well. Now\u2026 I will need help to get to my classroom. Class should be beginning soon unless I misjudged the time of day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlayn was going to volunteer for the task, but was interrupted by Jeralt. \u201cI\u2019ll drop him off. I\u2019m sure the other professors are setting up for their classes, I wanted to speak to them about him.\u201d Flayn sadly put her hands behind her back, trying not to look too disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly, Jeralt placed a hand near his shrunken son, knowing he would know what to do. Byleth quickly thanked Rhea, Seteth, and Flayn for their time and climbed onto his father\u2019s hand. He was quickly moved to Jeralt\u2019s shoulder and he took a moment to get his footings. Once he was sure they were ready, Jeralt left the room, sparing no words for Rhea or Seteth. \u201cYou know, I did miss the days when you rode on my shoulders.\u201d Jeralt\u2019s voice could be heard outside of the office, \u201cBut I never figured it would happen again, especially like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the trip to Byleth\u2019s classroom was uneventful, not a soul stopped to bother Jeralt about anything. And apparently no one noticed the shrunken professor. Before either knew it, Jeralt and Byleth arrived in his classroom. For now, all Byleth had to focus on was teaching his class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich class did Byleth have to teach?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Byleth was dropped off in his classroom with some time to spare before his lectures were scheduled to start. Jeralt dropped him off on his desk, avoiding complaining about the situation to Byleth. It wouldn\u2019t do his son any good, so he decided to let it go for the time being. \u201cYou stay safe now, alright? Don\u2019t try anything foolish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth gave his father an amused look. \u201cYou\u2019re saying I shouldn\u2019t challenge any of my students to a duel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what I mean. Also, whoever ends up as your chaperone, I want you to bring them to my office. I need to make sure you\u2019re in good hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to keep that in mind\u2026 honestly, I might forget. I\u2019ll have a lot to figure out.\u201d Byleth sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust figure out how to stay safe, that\u2019ll be good enough for me. I\u2019ll visit when I get the chance.\u201d With that, Jeralt left, eager to finish whatever tasks he had assigned to him so he could look for help. Though he knew that he would likely be given every task possible to keep him busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow alone, Byleth took his time to think of a way to explain his current predicament to his class. From what he was told, his students had only seen him collapse and had missed the part where he shrunk. He didn\u2019t have a logical explanation for that. Say that an ancient, magic sword shrunk him sounded ridiculous, even if that was apparently the truth. There was no better explanation though, so his students would have to accept that explanation just like he did. Hopefully they\u2019d take the news well, but he had a few students he figured wouldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Byleth thought about what to say to his class, he anxiously watched the entrance to see who would come in first. Ideally the class would come in one at a time or in small groups; that way he could tell the story to one person and then they could tell it to the others. It would be a slower but more effective way to get the information out. Byleth\u2019s hopes for that would be dashed when his students all filed into the room at once. \u201cSo much for that idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid anyone bother to confirm if the professor was even going to be here?\u201d Felix asked, taking his normal seat near the back of the room. \"I'm not going to waste time with a substitute, especially after seeing our professor wield an artifact. I must test myself against that strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did not receive word of a substitute being arranged, so we should expect him to be here.\u201d Dimitri informed everyone. \u201cI expect everyone to be on their best behavior. The professor should be resting, instead he\u2019s decided to continue his lectures. We should appreciate his dedication.\" Dedue silently nodded, agreeing with his liege like he always did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind if the professor took some time off. Would give me some more\u2026 free time.\u201d Sylvain spoke, a smirk on his face. The people who didn't ignore him rolled their eyes, wondering why he was bothering trying to hide what he wanted to do during \"free time\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh. I think all the girls in the monastery owe the professor a big thanks.\u201d Groaned Ingrid, pushing Sylvain towards a seat. \"Of course he's also keeping me stuck here with you so maybe I'm the one making a sacrifice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain leaned back in his chair smoothly and laughed. \"Come on, you know you like sitting next to me. You couldn't ask for better company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'd rather sit next to that scarecrow you hit on a while ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-hey! Don't bring that up in here!\" The lecherous red head protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshe, who had been trying to ignore the conversation, laughed quietly to himself.  \"Sylvain is quite a character.\" He mused as he got his materials for class ready on his desk. He planned on putting extra effort into his studies today, hoping the extra effort would be seen as a sign of appreciation for the professor's dedication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope this wasn\u2019t all somehow my fault.\u201d Mercedes mused to herself, feelings of regret creeping in her thoughts. \u201cI didn\u2019t really do well with the healing that night.\u201d The gentle girl somehow had convinced herself that the professor's collapse was caused by her neglect. Truthfully, she had performed as well as she always did, but the fact that her professor had collapsed put many negative thoughts in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette gently patted her on the back. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly Mercie! You did great like you always do! That batlle would\u2019ve been a lot harder without you.\u201d Mercedes sighed wearily and nodded her head. She believed what Annette was saying but she still felt like she could have somehow prevented the professor's collapse. Perhaps she was overthinking things, but the idea troubled her none the less. She decided to quietly focus on making sure she did her best to make the professor's day easier. If she focused, she could learn to improve her magic and stop this from happening again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure her friend wasn\u2019t too melancholy, Annette began her own preparations for the day. Honestly, she was just as concerned for the professor as Mercedes. Seeing her usually steadfast and stoic professor collapse after a battle surprised her greatly. Annette figured he would be strong enough to keep teaching however, and planned accordingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelicately, Annette lifted up a neatly wrapped treat buried among her usual stuff. Originally she had planned to work overnight with Mercedes to bake a larger batch of sweets for the professor. But it was obvious that her friend wasn\u2019t up for it, so she had to settle for purchasing one early in the morning from a merchant who was settling in town. It was only one, relatively fresh treat, but Annette knew from experience that sweets always made people feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his students went about getting ready for the lectures, waiting for the professor that was already present, Byleth stood awkwardly on the table. He hadn't motioned towards any of his students, and he was too curious to hear what they were saying to call out to them. He had completely missed his chance to get all their attentions before they distracted themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this is going well.\u201d Sothis noted sarcastically. \u201cYou have everyone\u2019s full attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could do without your commentary, thank you very much.\u201d Byleth replied, not in his usual stoic mood. \u201cI just have to wait for someone to come to my desk. I\u2019m certain someone will come by to see if I have anything set up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then they\u2019ll see an insect on their precious professor\u2019s table, and crush it with the slightest bit of effort. My powers will be able to restore you, but that what stop their hand from falling once again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt that will be an issue. I am not so small that I am beyond recognition. \u2026At least I think I that's the case.\u201d Sothis scoffed at Byleth\u2019s plan, but decided against protesting any further. No matter what she desired, it's not like they had any choice otherwise. For now Sothis just needed to fend off the nagging sensation of sleep. She had to be alert if/when her vessel ended up a stain on a palm. Byleth himself had to be ready for whatever was going to come his way, things could still get stranger, worse, or both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Annette drops off her sweet and recognizes Byleth, telling the other Lions about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Ingrid, frustrated and irritated by Sylvain, comes to Byleth\u2019s desk and sees him\u2026 as a pest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Flayn appears, pretending to be Byleth\u2019s chaperone so she can finally become one of the students.</span></div></div>",

No one can ever find out about this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Edelgard could retort, Bernadetta snatched Edelgard up in her hand, closing it around her waist and torso. The tiny princess struggled, trying to break free. However, Bernadetta\u2019s fingers kept her in an iron vice, refusing to let go as if her life depended on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I can overlook this!\u201d Edelgard promised, trying to assure Bernie and cut off her wild imagination before it got any worse. \u201cI can, um, pardon you.

She didn\u2019t stop for anything as she made a beeline through the student accommodations. Unfortunately for the princess now being jostled around in her \u2018cage\u2019, none of the passerbys sought to question Bernadetta fleeing in terror back to her room, which was 'just a Bernie thing' by now. Edelgard cursed under her breath as she was ricocheted with each frantic step Bernadetta took. This was going to be more problematic than she had hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernie slammed the door shut behind her as she found herself back in her home away from home.

Finally, she managed to dig out a jar that she normally used for water when she woke up in the middle of the night. It would have to do, and it was only a small price to pay to keep her secret crime hidden from the rest of the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBernadetta,\u201d Edelgard began, noticing the jar in the larger girl\u2019s hands. \u201cYou can\u2019t seriously\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Edelgard could even finish, Bernie scooped her up and dumped her into the glass prison. \u201cSorry, Edelgard!\u201d She squeaked, setting the jar back onto her desk. Grabbing the lid, she quickly sealed it tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken princess began to swipe at the walls, finding the thick glass to be too much to even put a dent in. Her pounding landed with a dull thud, and she was beginning to know what if felt like for a bandit to try to pierce her armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes went wide as she realized that Bernadetta was tightening the lid, effectively cutting off her air supply. She kept calm, knowing that her classmate couldn\u2019t be this careless. Though, she did have a plan in mind to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard dropped to her knees and clutched her neck, pretending to suffocate. She needed to make a show of it to prove to her captor just how horrendously stupid this idea was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Goddess, you need to breathe!\u201d she yelped. Thinking quickly, she rushed over to her quiver and grabbing an arrow. Now without thinking, she  slammed it down on the lid, piercing a hole at the top\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd nearly inches away from impaling Edelgard. The tiny princess managed to drop down and against the wall, knowing how south this could quickly go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEEEP! I\u2019M SO SORRY!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard stood back up and began to throw obscenities in her giant warden\u2019s direction. Most of it directed at just how careless she was, especially with the Imperial Princess\u2019 life in her hands. Her voice was completely muffled by the relative inches of wall ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Bernadetta had heard the princess\u2019 threats, she would have resolved to never to let Edelgard out. Though from the looks of how animated and livid she looked, Bernadetta got the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-calm down, please\u2026\u201d Bernadetta begged, dropping to her knees to meet the tiny princess eye to eye. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad in here. I promise to feed you everyday!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother wave of protests came, this time inspired by the fact that she was being treated like a pet now, which was no way to treat the future Emperor.</span></div></div>",

Bernie earnestly wished that the two could trade places, envying the utter safety and solitude the jar must grant, but alas, she didn't think Edelgard was nearly as appreciative of their new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't worry! I'll... I'll go get you some food! I bet you'll feel better on a full stomach, right? No need to have me killed when you've had a nice meal, right?!\" Bernadetta gave a laugh that was more than a bit hysterical as she slowly backed away from the jar, as if she figured it might explode into broken shards and royal rage at any moment. When it seemed evident enough that Edelgard's tiny form couldn't break the glass, Bernadetta whimpered and quickly fled her room, fleeing to the greenhouse to poach what stray seeds and vegetables that she could find. She was in such a hurry that she even left the door slightly ajar (which only served to taunt her prisoner further.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard was left alone, gritting her teeth with frustration as her fists began to ache with each pound on the glass. She knew that Bernadetta could be irrational at times, but this was simply unbearable. How was she going to return to her duties and her ambitions when she was merely an ornament on a shelf? She had no doubt that Hubert would be persistent enough to search the whole of the monastery grounds for his missing lady once he discovered her disappearance, but there was no telling when that could be. Besides, there was a good chance he might have Bernadetta assassinated for her actions, and while Edelgard had more than a few choice words to share with the archer, she'd prefer to avoid such an incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken princess peered around the room, searching for anything that might assist her in an escape before Bernadetta returned. The girl's room had several items of interest, from the stuffed animals huddled together on the bed to the mountain of borrowed books leering on the high shelf nearby. The surface of the desk even housed a few leftover snacks, some writing implements and Bernadetta's bow. However, everything was inevitably out of her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard clenched her fists tight, the fingers sinking into the skin. To be trapped like a rat, away from the sun, powerless... She had promised herself that she would never feel like this again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn desperation, Edelgard eyed the edge of the desk. It wasn't too far from where Bernadetta had placed the jar - just far enough that, if Edelgard stood on the tips of her toes and pressed up against the glass, she could barely peer over the edge. It was a nauseating distance to the floor below, but perhaps...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a slim chance at escape or who knows how long as a pet. Edelgard made her choice, taking what few steps back that she could in her confined space. She steeled herself and then ran forward, tackling the jar's front wall with her right shoulder. A throbbing pain bled through her arm on impact, but her plan was working - the jar had inched ever-so-slightly forward with the force of her slam. It would take several more, but she could make it to the edge. The princess repeated her attack on the glass, over and over. Each tackle inched her closer to victory, but in turn, the pain in her arm rose each time. Soon enough, her right arm seemed fit to snap, yet she wouldn't relent as she switched to the left and continued her assault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, even as both of her arms were numb and aching, the jar teetered on the edge of the desk. The princess took a deep breath, and with a battle cry, she launched herself at the wall one more time. Gravity took hold as the jar fell overboard to the floor below, with its prisoner plummeting along with it...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Edelgard screamed, bracing herself as best she could as the jar collided with the floor below. It bounced a few times on the hard stone, severely rattling the tiny empress but thankfully not injuring her, before finally rolling to a stop halfway between the shelf and the open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Edelgard moaned, recovering from the dizziness as she took stock of her new situation. \"Why didn't the jar break? Oh well, that's probably for the best. Now, to escape before Bernadetta comes back. How do I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed experimentally on the side of the jar. To her delight, she was strong enough to move it, though doing so quickly caused her to stumble again. Thinking of how best to move consistently, she sighed in embarrassment as only one idea came to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope no one sees me like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta was leaving the dining hall with her arms full of food that she remembered Edelgard liking- hopefully the princess would be touched enough that Bernadetta remembered her favorite meal that she wouldn't throw her in prison for shrinking and nearly suffocating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, it's Bernie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta gasped, freezing in place and dropping her food as a smiling Dorothea and Petra approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't run!</i> Bernadetta screamed mentally. <i>If you run, they'll chase you! And they'll find Edelgard and she'll tell them what you did and then you'll die, Bernie! You'll die!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hello...\" Bernadetta greeted the two nervously. She was doing her best not to hyperventilate. She wasn't succeeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is rare to see you out of your room,\" said Petra, already kneeling to help Bernadetta gather the food she dropped. \"Usually you are hidden away like a bear that hibernates. But less hair-ful and growling, and more squeaking, like a creature a bear would eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please stop comparing me to prey every time you talk to me,</i> Bernadetta tried to plead with the foreign princess. What came out instead was a pathetic squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Like that!\" Petra thrust the now somewhat crushed meal into Bernie's hands. \"Here. It should still be good. It is the rule of five seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a market stall in town with imported goods from Brigid,\" Dorothea announced excitedly. \"Petra and I were going to look for you and Edelgard before we left and try to make it a girls' day out. Have you seen her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT KEEPING EDELGARD HOSTAGE IN MY ROOM!\" Bernadetta shouted in a panic. Fortunately for the nervous archer, that outburst would have been in character whether Edelgard was captive in her room or not, so the pair didn't find it suspicious. Unfortunately, it further convinced Dorothea that her shy friend needed some positive human interaction, meaning they wouldn't leave Bernadetta alone anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know that,\" Dorothea assured her gently. Bernie flinched as she put an arm on her shoulder. \"We were just hoping to spend time with you and her today. As busy as we've been with classes and missions, we don't spend enough time just having fun together. Come on, let's find Edie and go to the market.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bernadetta looked around the courtyard nervously and tried to come up with an excuse not to go, her eyes settled on the door to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no, I left it open!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting some movement, Bernadetta looked to the ground, and shrieked in horror upon seeing Edelgard, scampering on all fours like a mouse as she rolled the jar out of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EDELGARD, NO!\" Bernadetta dropped the food. \"IT'S NOT SAFE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edelgard?\" Dorothea frowned in confusion. \"What's not safe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra squinted as she followed Bernadetta's gaze. \"A tiny thing is leaving Bernie's room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh goddess oh no think Bernie think...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hamster's escaping!\" Bernadetta quickly lied. \"I-I named it after Edelgard! Please don't tell her! Or anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good job, Bernie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks, Other Bernie!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that's adorable!\" Dorothea cooed. \"Quick, let's catch the poor thing before it gets hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO YOU'LL SCARE IT!\" Bernadetta yelled as she took off after the shrunken princess. Petra and Dorothea ignored her and joined the chase, determined to help keep what they thought was Bernadetta's secret little pet safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard smiled in satisfaction as she finally left Bernadetta's room, picking up speed as she tried to determine where to go. Once she was somewhere safe, she was fairly sure she could knock the lid off the jar now that it was on its side. She just needed to get out of the open before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EDELGARD, NO! IT'S NOT SAFE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard jerked her neck to look behind her. Just as she feared, Bernadetta had spotted her and was in hot pursuit. Not looking for long enough to see Dorothea and Petra coming after her as well, she took off at a run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll lose Bernadetta, then head somewhere safe and escape,</i> Edelgard decided. <i>Then I'll find Professor Byleth or someone else to help me get back to normal size.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether she'd report what Bernadetta had done would depend on if she was still mad with the archer when all of this was over. As things stood now, she almost certainly would be.</span></div></div>",

The fall had left Edelgard both breathless and absolutely defenseless to the rain of shards. A searing pain shot in her shoulder, and she had let out another cry, this one motivated entirely by pain. She glanced at her side, finding a crystal lance embedded into her chest. Had it gone a bit more to the right, it would have easily pierced her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Still preferable to returning to captivity</i>, she thought grimly. Forcing herself to sit up, the injured princess debated on whether or not to remove the shard from her shoulder. Eventually, she wrapped her hand around it and tried to pull, letting out another cry to vent the pain. The lance didn\u2019t budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard sighed, resolving to just keep it in place. All she had to do was find someone, and surely they\u2019d help her get medical attention. Fueled by a combination of determination and adrenaline, Edelgard made her way towards the open door. Freedom was in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery step filled her with pain. As it turned out, the glass had did a number on her, nearly shredding her into pieces. Cuts tore through her legs, ruining her red leggings. However, that was the least of her issues as it felt like she was being stabbed with each movement. That didn\u2019t matter. She needed out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she got through the door and into the open air. Bernie\u2019s room had the oppressive scent of\u2026 well, Bernie. It was uncomfortably stuffy in there, and the jar only seemed to make it worse. Edelgard was just glad to be closer to freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it seemed that the adrenaline was wearing out, and the pain only got worse by the moment. She was limping, cradling her arm, and looking like a wounded animal. Blood leaked from her wounds, no doubt contributing to her lightheadedness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed forwards, heading straight towards a pair of stationary boots nearby. It pained her so much to even move that she couldn\u2019t crane her neck up high  enough to get a better look at her potential savior.

Take me to the professor or somebody who can fix this!\" She protested once more, though it seemed Bernie was distracted by something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay...\" The shut in quietly said, \"I know what I must do..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard sighed in relief, a smile finally taking form as she calmed down. She was glad that Bernie had began to move, sitting down on her bed. <br>\r\n\"Finally.. I knew you'd come to your senses eventual- what are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the tiny would be ruler, Bernie had not begun to make her way to someone who could turn her back to normal. Instead she slipped off one of her boots and held the tiny girl over the hole. Edelgard could feel the warm air coming from inside and began to squirm in reaction to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Bernie, you can't seriously think this is a good idea?! Y-You'll crush me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no!\" Bernie shook her head in reply, \"I'll be super gentle, you just gotta um.. stay under the arch of my sole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is ridiculous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It'll work, j-just trust me!\" Bernie seemed intent on keeping Edelgard within her boot, obviously not thinking straight what so ever. <br>\r\n\"I mean, you should count yourself lucky! Sylvain and Claude really wanted to see my feet the other day, so they must be cute and soft or something, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean I won't be squashed- Wait, what?! I can understand Sylvain, but Claude?!\" The girl's face turned rather red in shock at the idea that her fellow students had a secret foot fetish. Though it was slowly accompanied by anger as she realized that they had also tried to indulge in their urges with someone like Bernie. Growling, Edelgard decided to shove those thoughts away for now and focus on not becoming her friend's new insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bernie, listen to me-Agh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernie had let go of Edelgard and watched the shrunken ruler fall farther and farther until she landed on the sole of her boot. Edelgard was now covered in an unsettling warmth, the stale and pungent air making her want to start coughing. But it seemed Bernie wasn't going to give her any time to adjust to her new settings. The light from above was slowly replaced with Bernie's foot as it descended towards her. <br>\r\nHer eyes widening in fear, Edelgard jumped to her feet and began to run to the end of the boot. However it seemed that she was much too small to get that far. Bernie's foot came in quicker than anticipated and devoured Edelgard, forcing her under the arch of her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-There! See? Its feels sorta nice! You have space and I don't get any life sentences!\" Bernie quietly said outloud, beginning to calm down a little as she moved her foot around, shifting Edelgard around a little so that she could at least walk somewhat normally without crushing her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard on the other hand was yelling unheard profanities, punching and kicking into Bernie's sole out of anger. Though her little rebellious assault did nothing more than give her captor a little massage. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ah, there you are Edelgard!\" Ferdinand said, speaking so loud he was almost shouting as usual. Edelgard mentally congratulated herself for picking such a secluded meeting location. No one would hear him from their position in the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ferdinand. Glad you could make it.\" Edelgard said cooly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm glad you finally decided to take me up on my challenge! After all the training I've done with the professor, I'm sure I'll easily be able to best you in our sparring match!\" Ferdinand replied, taking a few steps away from Edelgard to get into a starting position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand turned back towards Edelgard just in time to see her snap her fingers at him, prompting a bright flash from her hand that blinded and engulfed him. When his vision returned, he was no longer looking at Edelgard's face. Instead, he was looking at her now giant boots. When he followed them up her legs, he saw that his empress was now towering over him, seeming to be at least 100x taller than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on Edelgard? Why am I so small?\" Ferdinand demanded, looking up at the towering white haired girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shrunk you Ferdinand.\" Edelgard said matter-of-factly. \"I should think that was obvious. The Professor has been helping me focus on Reason Magic recently, and I think it's really paying off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple Ferdinand. You are constantly insisting that we are rivals and that you're my superior, and I've been telling you that that couldn't be further from the truth. But you never seem to get the message through your thick skull. So I decided the best thing to do was to make our sizes reflect the way I see you: as a sniveling insect who ought to be groveling at his emperor's feet.\" Edelgard explained, before stepping out of her boots and dropping her bare feet down on either side of the shrunken redhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we were coming out here to spar?\" Ferdinand said weakly, having trouble accepting the sudden change of scenario. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes Ferdinand. You'll still get your fight. I want to see how you fare against my feet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand was unprepared by how fast she spring into action. All of a sudden, she jumped backwards, putting some space between the two of them, only for her right foot to then come swinging forwards like a pendulum. It caught him between her toes, squeezing him as it lifted him up off the ground into the air. Then she released at the top of her swing, and he was airborne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand had never liked heights. Caspar had occasionally tried to talk him into trying wyvern riding, but he always made an excuse to avoid it. Now he wished he had a wyvern below him, rather than the spastic flight he was currently engaged in. When he finally felt himself starting to descend, he looked down towards the ground, wanting to see what surface he would be splattering against. What he saw instead was the sole of Edelgard's pale white foot, upturned and held precisely under him. She had kicked him up and over her head, and now was going to catch him behind her back with her foot. He landed hard on her sole, face smearing against the somewhat sweaty surface. Foolishly, he thought it was over. With a flick of her ankle, he was airborne again, flying up and over her head once more, towards another awaiting foot. This continued for some time, with Ferdinand getting more and more disoriented with every kick. He tried to catch a glimpse of her face when he flew past it, wanting to see what she was thinking and why she was doing this. He expected her to look angry at him, or maybe like she was having fun, but instead she looked... disinterested? It was like this was an everyday thing for her. Sometimes she smiled after a particularly tricky kick, but overall she seemed rather unimpressed by her torture method. Finally, out of what Ferdinand suspected was boredom, she allowed him to drop to the ground in front of her, leaving him panting on his hands and knees before his empress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard had never had much respect for Ferdinand, but she felt what little she had slipping away with each impact with her feet. He wasn't her rival, he was simply hers. A possession to do whatever she desired with, whose only purpose in life was to ease the burden of her governance. His life was hers to use, and dispose of, at a twitch of her ankle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand felt this change in roles too. He could tell by how she looked at him that she didn't consider him anything more than a temporary distraction that happened to be rather fun to toy with beneath her toes. He always knew in his heart that she took their rivalry less seriously than he did, but to realize that he didn't even register on her radar as anything other than a nuisance. Filled with rage at the realization of how little he mattered to her, he drew his axe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HYAHHH!\" Ferdinand yelled, bringing his axe down on the empress's big toe. The front edge of it struck the skin of her toe, making a small cut before the axe was stopped by her nail. The middle of the axe struck the hard surface and stuck in place, leaving him unable to remove the weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard was furious: \"Did you just <b>strike</b> your empress?\" She dislodged his axe with an effortlessly flick of her ankle, sending it spiraling away, before abruptly slamming her foot down on top of the shrunken man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand had all the air forced from his lungs as her now increasingly dirt covered foot stomped down on him. His surprise at her speed was quickly replaced by surprise that he had survived the strike, knowing a regular bug would have been obliterated by the impact. The ball of her foot came down right on his ribcage, leaving him with his face pinned beneath her big toe. The underside of it was covered in dirt from being barefoot, but that didn't stop her from grinding it on Ferdinand's face, pushing the back of his head deeper into the dirt as she gradually increased the pressure. Just when he thought she wouldn't stop until his head cracked like a coconut, she lifted her foot off of him. He gasped down air desperately, relieved to be able to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't move her foot to the side though. She lifted it straight up into the air, allowing it to hang above him like the blade of a guillotine. And before he could get to his feet, she brought it down on him once more. She stomped him over and over again, driving him into the dirt, squeezing out a little bit of her rage at his rebellion with each stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to spend all day stomping you bug, but as empress, I have responsibilities.\" Edelgard said, smirking at the sight of the tiny man laying in her footprint in the dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean you'll grow me back?\" Ferdinand asked weakly, every ounce of energy extracted from him by the pale feet of his empress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ferdinand, do you still think you're my equal?\" Edelgard asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, of course not. I'm nothing compared to you.\" Ferdinand groveled, desperate not to make her angrier after his axe stunt. He couldn't take any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I don't see why you should be the same size as me.\" Edelgard replied. \"Don't worry, I know you feel very strongly about your duty as a noble, so I'll make sure you still get to support me, in your little insect way.\" Rather than wait for him to ask what she meant, the silver haired empress grabbed her shrunken classmate between her toes, pinching him tightly and lifting him up over the entrance to her boot. She separated her toes without warning, allowing him to plummet down into the darkness of her shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand landed hard on Edelgard's insole and immediately found himself surrounded by the familiar smell of Edelgard's feet. He looked up at his empress through the hole he'd fallen into, seeing her giant purple eyes trained on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking you'll make a good insole. My feet can get very sore after a long day of training, so I'll take any cushioning I can get. Even if it comes from a worthless speck like you.\" Edlegard said, before rising to her full height. Once again, her face was miles above him, and he doubted she could even see him in the dark confines of her shoe. \"You'd better run to the toe section unless you want to be flattened.\" Edelgard warned. This wasn't out of anything resembling sympathy, she merely wanted to ensure that her foot toy stuck around for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand got the message when he saw her foot lift over the shoe's entrance, encasing him in its shadow. He began a mad sprint into the boot's depths, as though there were some exit he could find if he only ran far enough. Of course, no such exit existed. The light in the boot was snuffed out as Edelgard's foot entered, blocking the only entrance. He could see only a faint outline of her toes as they came barreling into him, carrying him the rest of the way into the boot. When they arrived together at the toe of the boot, her foot settled in on top of him. His chest was beneath the ball of her foot once more, but this time his head was between her big and second toes, allowing them to secure his new position in life with a taunting squeeze. And then, without another word from her, she began to walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard smiled as she strode back towards the monastery, feeling Ferdinand squirm against her every step and knowing that he was beginning to understand his place in her world. As she walked, her mind was full of ideas about how she should punish him further. Perhaps a combat training session with Petra while Ferdinand struggled in her boot would have the desired effect? Or maybe she should find someone to share him with? Dorothea had always seemed to hate him. She didn't know why, but that didn't matter. It would be enough to motivate her to join in the fun. Her last idea was perhaps her most devious. She could show him how insignificant he was by letting him be killed by a classmate unaware. She imagined slipping him into some sweets for Bernadetta's birthday today, and letting the timid girl devour him. No matter what she picked, she knew her <i>little</i> rival problem was solved.</span></div></div>",

All the effort the professor went through to get Bernie to warm up to her was now gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken girl squeaked and scurried under her covers. It actually surprised her how easily she transitioned from the life of a hibernating bear to one of a mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cBernadetta?\u201d</b> The now booming voice called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny girl declined to answer, not wanting to be found out.

She closed her eyes and began to think happy thoughts, including the main inspiration to shrink herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a series of children\u2019s novels she grew infatuated with from being locked up in her room. It featured a race of tiny people living inside the walls with a charmingly rustic life of borrowing items from the giant people that were unaware of their existence.

The professor's quiet \"Berni\" seemed to snap her out of the funk as the tiny purplette makes a break for it, only to be easily captured by Byleths quick reflexes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go human, I want to be set free!\" Bernidetta squeaks, hoping to confuse the giant into thinking she is an actual borrower, but given Byleths unimpressed face it didn't work \"Um, hi professor, nice weather were having\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bernidetta, why are you small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean besides magic, why did you shrink yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be left alone, if I'm tiny people won't see me, and I'll be able to have my quiet alone time\" Bernidetta huffs, causing Byleth to roll her eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bernidetta, this is extreme, even for you. How did you even do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bought it from a red headed woman in the marketplace, it was a pretty good price too, just 200 gold\" Byleth pinches the bridge of her nose, of course she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Byleth, with an unhappy and unwilling Bernidetta accompanying her, heads to the marketplace to find a reversal potion and restore the archer<br>\r\n2) it's decided that if she's determined to do this, at least Edelgard needs to be informed (given Byleth already knows), as the head of Black Eagles.

While it was difficult to discern much from her stoic teacher, Bernadetta could spot a hint of concern on their face as their brow furrowed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Hm...?\"</b> Byleth's hand brushed past Bernie's hiding spot (eliciting a barely-audible squeak from the mouse-like student) as the professor spotted an empty vial amidst the objects. The cap was loose and there was still some of the liquid housed within. Byleth picked it up to examine it closer, reading the label for its effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"...Oh,\"</b> was the only response from Byleth. Whether they believed that this 'shrinking potion' could be the genuine article or not, it was irrelevant - either their most anxious and fearful student was now in a far larger and far more intimidating world without her aid, or they had been swindled for their gold to guzzle down what could be poison for all they knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernie whimpered, watching from their hiding spot as the professor pocketed the bottle as evidence. The jig was up, but the shrunken girl had no intention of giving herself up now - the professor would be absolutely furious with her! They'd have her kicked out of the monastery and exiled from Fodlan forever, no doubt about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, Byleth lifted a leg to examine the sole of their shoe, and then did the same with the other. To their relief, they were unblemished. Next, Byleth knelt down to examine the floor, sweeping their hand around the strewn-about items and beneath the furniture. They pressed their head against the ground, their eyeball swiveling around to try and spot any tiny cowering purple-haired creatures in the darkness below the dresser and the wardrobe, but they spotted nothing but dust bunnies and crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, they reexamined the door, trying to ascertain if Bernadetta could have already left the room. While it was unlikely that she would leave, Byleth couldn't rule out the possibility - if she had, then the longer Byleth spent looking for nothing in here, then the longer Bernadetta was in danger of being trodden underfoot by a passing student or plucked up as a meal by that damn owl that keep roosting outside the dorms. There was a slight gap beneath the door, but Byleth couldn't tell if Bernadetta was small enough to crawl through or not without a frame of reference for how potent this potion was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concerned teacher stood back up to their feet, eyeing the seemingly empty room once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Bernie,\"</b> Byleth said, trying to sound as gentle and patient as they could. <b>\"Please come out now. I won't be angry with you. Don't worry, it'll be okay.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence followed.</span></div></div>",

Also, there\u2019s no size interaction in this chapter.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProfessor?\u201d Edelgard called, the last of the Black Eagle students to enter the classroom. \u201cIs there a reason for this emergency meeting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth nodded, laying out the evidence of her investigation onto one of the desks. The other students stepped forward and took a better look, finding it much closer to a strange merchant hunt rather than anything coherent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBernadetta\u2019s run away,\u201d the professor said, a disappointed sigh slipping into her voice. \u201cShe\u2019s taken some extreme measures to ensure she isn\u2019t found.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students stepped up to the table and examined the clues, still struggling to make a solid connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no offense, but this just looks like a pile of junk, Professor,\u201d Caspar said, picking up a carved wooden horse with wheels attached to its legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I loved this book as a child!\u201d Dorothea squealed, hugging the children\u2019s novel tight. \u201cI always wondered what it would be like to be as small as a borrower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard picked up the vial and examined it. \u201cA shrinking potion? I apologize, Professor, but this has to be another one of Claude\u2019s childish pranks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assumed so as well,\u201d the professor said, grabbing the bottle and forcing off the lid with her thumb. She poured a drop onto the stem of an apple, one of the many snacks she had confiscated from Bernadetta\u2019s room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her students stared intently at the fruit, not sure what to expect. Hubert traded a glance with Edelgard, with the latter silently asking if the professor\u2019s newfound lunacy would prove to be harmful in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drop slowly rolled into the core, and the moment the drop was absorbed, the apple began to shrink in size, becoming a small speck that had the students rushing in to confirm it was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the horrible,\u201d Petra gasped, coming to the same conclusions as the rest of the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Bernie,\u201d Dorothea commented sadly. \u201cShe must be terrified. Our poor, defenseless little Shrinking Violet, lost in a big scary world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinhardt\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cThis is absolutely fascinating. I must study the concoction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leapt for the vial, only for Byleth to hold it close to her chest. \u201cOnly for finding an antidote for Bernadetta.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flighty boy groaned, the motivation leaving his body via dramatic sigh. \u201cFine. If you insist, Professor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d she said, holding it out and dropping it on his expectant palm. \u201cHubert, accompany him. Ensure he doesn\u2019t end up drinking it himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of mages left the classroom, leaving the rest of the students to form a search party. Byleth\u2019s expression had become focused, a look the other students had only seen when she was barking orders on the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan, Professor?\u201d Ferdinand asked. \u201cI assure you as future prime minister I will not let any harm come to Bernadetta, or my name isn\u2019t Ferdinand Von\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime is of the essence,\u201d Byleth cut off, sparing the rest of the students from another one of Ferdinands speeches. \u201cI want you and Caspar to notify other students of the situation. I\u2019d prefer if you\u2019d only tell students on the first floor of the dorms. They\u2019re the ones most likely to run into her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight on, Professor,\u201d Caspar said, pumping his fist. Full of energy as ever, he rushed out of the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth pinched her nose. \u201cFerdinand, make sure he watches his steps when he gets to the dormitory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the separate teams were made, it only left the squad of Dorothea, Petra, and Edelgard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about us, Professor?\u201d Dorothea asked, still holding the book close to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and Petra live in the same section of the dorm,\u201d Byleth began. \u201cI want you two to keep an eye out for her. Think of it like hunting for rabbits. They get startled easily, so you\u2019ll have to be quiet and fast to catch her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra nodded. \u201cI will be treating Bernadetta like prey, however I will not be doing the eating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t expect you to.\u201d Byleth turned her attention over to a small chocolate cake she swiped from the dining hall. \u201cDorothea, put this on your nightstand. I confiscated her stash of snacks, so she will almost certainly be scavenging for food later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former songstress accepted the cake. \u201cI\u2019ll just feign sleep and catch Bernie if she tries to sneak a bite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth nodded and turned to Edelgard. \u201cYou and I will be searching the dorms. Bernadetta couldn\u2019t have gotten too far, especially at her new size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, my teacher.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Had anyone else been roaming around at this late hour, they would have thought it strange that Dorothea seemed to be staring down at her own shoes the whole time she was walking. The songstress couldn't take her mind off of each and every step she took, fearful that she'd hear a sickly squishing noise at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Dorothea had returned to her room, she locked the door behind her, and then placed the cake down on her nightstand before going about her nightly ritual of undressing and readying for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn errant thought entered her mind: <i>What if Bernie is already in here? Could she be watching me right now...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea hesitated for a moment as she was about to slip into her nightwear, before shrugging and continuing as normal - she didn't take Bernie for a peeper (and it's not like she was all that embarrassed - the thought of a tiny flustered Bernie was undeniably adorable.) Now, if that <i>Sylvain</i> character had taken the potion, then Dorothea would have swept the room from top to bottom, preferably with some pest removal tool in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlissfully imagining the chauvinistic Blue Lion noble struggling to free himself from the underside of a flyswatter, Dorothea went straight to bed, turning her head away from the nightstand so as to feign her rest. Now it was simply a matter of waiting, listening for the pitter-patter of tiny feet on cloth or the slightest sound of nibbling from the cake behind her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea frowned. The scent of chocolate cake wafted so close to her, yet she could not take a bite for herself. <i>Ugh, great. Now I'm starving.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta jumped on the spot as she heard a growling noise, afraid that some manner of beast was about to descend on her. She flushed red as she swiftly realized that it was merely her own stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe borrower was hiding from the prying eyes of her investigative teacher in a crawlspace that ran beneath the floorboards of the rooms. She could barely see in front of her face with how little light there was shining through the thin gaps in the 'ceiling' above her, and she could practically feel the motes of dust coating her lungs with each inhale, but it was safe from prying eyes, and that was all that mattered to her. Well, except for the unfortunate reality of starvation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta cursed in an unladylike manner under her breath (now that she was convinced that nobody could ever possibly hear her.) She had stockpiled a great deal of snacks in her room for just such an occasion, but there was no way she could go back now. This was her new life as the world's tiniest fugitive, and she couldn't take any chances going back to her 'old hideout.' She couldn't even begin to fathom just how much trouble she'd be in if she was caught now. Maybe the professor would place her on detention in a jar for the rest of the school year, with all the other students pointing and laughing at her every single day. Or maybe they'd just skip straight to the death penalty and they'd display her tiny body in a case like one might do with a dead butterfly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl squeaked as her mind wandered to increasingly-severe punishments. Failure wasn't an option anymore. Nonetheless, she didn't intend to just sit down and starve, so finding food was her priority for now. <i>M-Maybe someone else has snacks in their room...?</i> With a heavy heart, she skulked her way beneath the floors and between the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the archer's keen senses to pick up on the aroma of cake drifting from one of the nearby rooms. <i>Oh, cake! My long lost love, how I've missed you!</i> She was always partial to more than a few slices when she was normal-sized, but the thought of a cake so big that she could dive right into it drove her hungry mind to a craze. <i>Where are you hiding...?</i> Bernadetta followed her nose to a small gap in the corner of what appeared to be Dorothea's room. The borrower cautiously peeked her head around the side to check for any occupants. There was a distinct human-sized lump on the bed, but there was no candlelight in the room. <i>Oh, thank the Goddess, Dorothea must be asleep. Then maybe...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta fidgeted with her fingers, calculating her scenario. Could she be quiet enough that Dorothea would never know? What if someone else came into the room, like the professor doing the rounds to try and find her? If Dorothea woke up all of a sudden, could she still make it back to this gap in time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe borrower's stomach growled once more, as if it had sensed her indecision and decided to make her mind up for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her legs shaking as if they'd fall out from under her at any moment, Bernadetta sneaked as slowly and quietly as she could across the rug and over to the bedsheets hanging over the side of the mountainous furniture. Being extra careful not to make the slightest peep, Bernie grabbed onto the material with sweating palms and gradually ascended the wall towards her sweet-smelling objective. Her aptitude for getting around the battlefield 'like a frightful bunny rabbit' (as Petra had once described it) let her make the climb at a quick pace in almost utter silence, much to her delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if Dorothea was still awake, then they would have felt the tiny tugs brushing on the sheets, but they were asleep, so there was nothing to fear. At least, that's what Bernadetta kept telling herself over and over in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what would have been an impressive display of skill for any of their physical exams, Bernadetta reached the 'peak' with stamina to spare, and she was thusly rewarded with her prize sitting atop the nightstand. It was a giant chocolate cake the likes of which she had only seen in her dreams. It seemed as big as her room, if not even larger. Its puffy texture and its creamy frosting tantalized her like a siren to a sailor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta cast a quick glance to the 'hill' beside her. Aside from the ever-so-slight sound of Dorothea inhaling and exhaling, there wasn't any response from her classmate. That was all the permission she needed to delicately tiptoe over to the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, Bernie, dig in, stuff your pockets, then run away. Piece of cake.</i></span></div></div>",

Or she was simply silent as the night, sneaking in to fill her belly and leave. That was the only one the singer could plan for, as she'd made a detour to the kitchen before going to her room... for caramel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadette moans as she stuffs her face with cake  clearly the really good stuff most likely made by Lysithea as the girl has a bigger sweet tooth than she does. Still even with cake this good it would get hard and dry soon enough, unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeling herself the tiny girl begins to climb the puffy mound, knowing that the frosting will be just as good as the main cake, and remain soft and creamy for days. Reaching  the summit she gulps down frosting as well as fill pockets with the sweet goop, unfortunately in the dark she didn't see the extra addition, until her hand passing into and her body skids forward into a slight puddle of melted caramel which coated most of the roof of the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she stopped sliding Bernadetta attempted to simply pull free... only for her limbs to be stuck in place by the sticky, syrup like caramel. She was stuck, unable to flee and most likely about to become nothing more than an extra bite of her fellow Eagles midnight snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what it feels like to be one of those bugs, I'll never be able to look at pitcher plants the same way\" she whines, cursing Dorothea for ruining her favourite plants on her, even if the method itself was closer to a Sundew in design. Sighing in frustration she looks up to see Dorothea staring across at her with a wide grin...and her face turns milky white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she heard what sounded like skittering on her desk Dorothea had to hold back her reaction to turn, as the skittish rabbit that was Bernie would most likely run if she moved and in her current position would escape before she could catch her. T wasn't until she heard muffled swearing she rolls over quietly, manages to swallow a giggle and observe little Bernie, covered in cake frosting and caramel sauce, looking equal parts adorable and delicious. The trap was sprung, now to retrieve the catch. Knowing both Edelgard and the professor would want her brought to them immediately, she simply picked up the plate and walked to the classroom, where some of the others were working through plans for the next day \"call off the search, I found the wild Bernie\" she teases putting the plate on the desk in front of Edelgard \"oh, one last thing\" she hums before plucking Bernadetta off the cake and bringing her to her lips, sucking and licking the surprisingly ticklish girl clean of cake, eliciting  disturbed look from Hubert, Edelgards raised eyebrows, and a perverse look on Caspers face more at home on say  Sylvain, until getting slapped on the back of the head by Byleth \"here you are Professor, a little damp, but undamaged\" she smiles, passing Bernadetta over to Byleth who looks at her sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Hubert says they MAY have a cure for Bernadettas condition, however they require a test subject to be sure, before using it on their little shrinking violet archer<br>\r\n2)Given the work she clearly put into the plan, Edelgard makes a deal with Bernadetta, if she proves she can still be a useful member of Eagle House borrower size by the end of the month (the start is now) she'll let her remain as such, otherwise she will force feed her the cure herself, never mind Byleth<br>\r\n3)Panic setting in, Bernadetta acts rashly, biting Byleths hand to get her to release her, then make a mad dash, causing the room to dissolve into chaos as they try catch Berni without accidentally stepping on her instead.</span></div></div>",

She's been worried sick ever since you ran away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't even want to go to bed,\" Dorothea answered, recalling the subtle frown on her teacher's face. \"I had to reassure her that the cake plan would work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-plan?\" Bernadetta babbled, the cogs in her head turning. \"You mean... Oh, stupid, stupid Bernie! How could you fall for something so obvious, you idiot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Dorothea snapped, earning a frightened yelp from the tiny girl. \"Don't talk about yourself that way. You're not stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late; Bernie had already curled up into a ball.  Dorothea sighed, knowing there was some deep rooted issues at work. She would just have to find some other way to console the anxious borrower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The professor found a book in your room,\" Dorothea said, changing the subject. \"I used to read it over and over again when I was little... well, not as little as you are right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta remained quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sometimes imagined having a little borrower friend help me get through the day when I was on the streets,\" she said, her voice wistful as she gently rubbed the shrunken girl's back with her thumb. \"If you're okay with it, I'd want you to be my little borrower buddy. I won't even tell the professor about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernie perked up. \"You\u2014you won't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea nodded. \"You can hide with me. You'll be my itty bitty roommate. I'll even bring you food so you don't have to risk going out and getting caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Bernie heard, the more the deal (like the cake) sounded too good to believe. \"Wh-what do you get out of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea thought about what a tiny person could do for her. \u201cAll I ask is that you help me out with some little things, like helping me do my makeup and nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? That doesn't seem like much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist on paying me back...\" An idea went though her mind, and she fought the urge to grin. She leaned forward, getting into Bernie\u2019s personal space as she put on a husky voice. \u201cYou could also keep me company at night when I\u2019m lonely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta squealed at the implication, her face turning an impossible shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I was right. It was adorable.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just teasing,\u201d Dorothea reassured with a slight giggle. \u201cIn all seriousness, I'd rather see you safe and happy, Bernie. If living like this is what you want, then who's to say it's invalid? What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernie nervously eyed the corner of the room.<i> If I make a break for it now... </i> She then eyed the piece of cake. <i>But if I try running now, then she'll keep looking for me.</i> Finally, she glanced up at Dorothea. <i>I think I can trust her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay, I'll stay with you,\" Bernadetta answered. If she were completely honest, one big motivating factor was the fact that she didn't really have a safe place to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Dorothea, used her free hand to reach over and grab the cake on her nightstand. \"How about we celebrate with cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta nodded excitedly before jumping off her friend's hand and resuming her make-out session with the giant slice of cake. Dorothea simply watched, waiting for the purple haired girl to tucker herself out before she went in for some herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Bernadetta collapsed backwards in a sugar induced shock. Her entire body was coated in bits of cake and frosting. Even her hair seemed to match Dorothea's in shade. She let out a little groan as she rubbed her stomach, having had her fill and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Dorothea had her share of the cake, she went back and nestled into bed. She plucked the near comatose Bernie and brought her down to her chest, slowly pushing her into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the borrower had come to, she was halfway buried by her new roommates breasts. \"W-wait, what are you doing!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you needed somewhere safe and warm to stay the night,\" the songstress answered back with a slight lilt. \"It's comfy, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Bernie didn't want to admit it, her accommodations were surprisingly soft. the light pressure from all sides made it feel like she was getting a big hug. It also helped that Dorothea's natural body heat was just as welcoming. A light rhythm sounded deep below, which she quickly pinpointed as her bedmate's heartbeat. It was steady, lulling even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not so...\" Bernadetta yawned, finally letting out the exhaustion she had built up through the day. She turned on her side, resting her head on one of the soft walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep well, Bernie,\" Dorothea said, rubbing her tiny friend's head and  picking out the chocolate from her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(This chapter, and the song within, are inspired by Dorothea and Edelgard's C Support)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night stretched on, and Dorothea heard no tell-tale signs of a tiny Bernadetta sneaking into her room and stealing her food, the songstress's eyes started to grow heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No!</i> She admonished herself, opening her eyes wide and shifting somewhat in bed. <i>No falling asleep before your cue, Dorothea! Edelgard and the professor are counting on you...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath, the smell of the cake next to her bed once again tempting her. <i>Perhaps just one bite will help me stay awake... no, better not. If Bernie's already in here, seeing I'm not asleep will scare her off. And what if she's there already?! I might... eat... the poor... thing...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea's thoughts slowed as her eyes drifted shut and she finally lost her battle against sleep, snuggling against her pillow with a contented sigh. Said sigh put Bernadetta on high alert as she quickly looked back at the giantess, holding her breath and staying perfectly still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe it's like those dragons in that one story I read! If I stand perfectly still, she can't see me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long, agonizing moment, Dorothea's breathing slowed. Bernadetta decided she was truly asleep, and moved on to her prize with a grin. The tiny girl took an experimental bite of the cake. Determining that her former classmates hadn't poisoned the cake as part of a plan to get rid of her and that it was, in fact, chocolaty and delicious, Bernadetta dug into the cake with abandon, stuffing her face and pockets with the first meal she'd been able to get since shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" Bernadetta muttered to herself, content that Dorothea was in a deep enough sleep that a little noise wouldn't wake her. \"Ish good right now...\" she swallowed. \"But anything I take with me might dry out after too long. I should get some icing too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a section of cake she hadn't ravaged yet, she dug her hands into it and began to climb, aiming to get to the top and scoop some of the sweet cream icing into her remaining pockets. Sure, it would ruin her uniform, but what did she care? Garreg Mach's dress code didn't apply to her anymore. No one would judge her because no one would ever see her again. Being a Borrower was so liberating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when she reached the top that disaster struck. The icing was much gooier and stickier than the tiny girl expected. When she tried to grab onto it to hoist herself on top of the slice, it grabbed onto her, and she began to sink into it like quicksand. Having never learned how to escape from quicksand in her somewhat abusive life as a noble daughter, Bernadetta did what came naturally to her: panicking and flailing her limbs. This did nothing to help her escape her sweet, sticky prison, and in fact made things worse as her entire body was now stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta freezed in fear as Dorothea moaned loudly. Was she waking up? Would she see her trying to steal her cake? Obviously, she'd be furious. Would she take her to the professor as punishment or merely end her here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning her neck as much as she dared, she looked towards the giantess. She was tossing and turning in bed, but didn't seem to be waking. Eventually, Dorothea settled down and stopped moving, now facing Bernadetta and her chocolate gulag. Her eyes were still closed, twitching as she dreamed, and a smile was on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This song's just for you, Edie...\" she sighed in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpooked by the giantess suddenly sleeptalking and fearing that she could wake at any moment, Bernadetta renewed her struggles. She was so encased in the frosting that she was only able to tire herself out. Between her aching muscles, the fact that she'd been doing way more physical activity than usual today, and the oddly lulling sound of Dorothea's slow, steady breathing, the tiny archer soon gave into exhaustion, losing consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Dorothea dreamed of staging an opera for Edelgard, which soon turned into an erotic afterparty where the white haired princess fed her chocolate cake, Bernadetta's dreams were considerably darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Still struggling in the cake frosting, Bernadetta was blinded by a sudden bright light as a full orchestral medly played loudly around her. As her eyes adjusted, she saw Dorothea looming above her, resplendent in her finest opera costume. As the giantess glared down at her, the music swelled in volume and she began to sing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"~What do I see on my plate?<br>\r\nA tiny, worthless Bernie!<br>\r\nNow, my appetite I'll sate,<br>\r\nAnd end her pointless journey~\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea's giant hands surrounded the cake as she lifted it into the air melodramatically. As Bernadetta's struggles renewed, she looked behind her, discovering to her horror that not only was Dorothea about to eat her, but they were on stage and everyone she'd ever met was in the audience, with her professor and classmates from Black Eagle House in the front center row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't get opera,\" Caspar muttered as he struggled to read the program. \"When's the fighting start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To think, I thought Bernie could ever amount to anything,\" Professor Byleth shook her head sadly. \"I'm a worthless teacher...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is unfair!\" Petra protested. \"I wanted to do the eating of Bernie! She is like prey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"~Now this tiny louse shall go in my mouth~\"</b> Dorothea belted, bringing the cake close to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a terrible rhyme!\" Bernadetta protested. \"You can't eat me after a terrible rhyme! It's against the rules!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"~NOOOOBODY CAAAAAAAAAAARES!~\"</b> Dorothea retorted loudly and still in song as she tossed the tiny archer into the dark abyss of her mouth.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Bernadetta shrieked, being jolted awake as something happened around her...</span></div></div>",

And it was this time of her life, that gave her some very peculiar reflexes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen one lived on the streets, there were times where she had no guarantee that food would arrive, or when. This had caused her to be able to sense the smell of food even in her sleep, and even to try to eat it while unconscious.<br>\r\nHer nose had caught the whiff of the chocolate cake, and unlike her waking self, her sleeping mind did not know why the cake was there. She reaches over with one hand, groping around for the cake, and grabs a fistful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Bernadetta, she was included in the fistful. She was still exhausted from all the physical activity, but this sent adrenaline through her system. She tried her hardest to free herself from the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea lowered the cake to her mouth, including the tiny student stuck in it.<br>\r\nLuckily for Bernadetta, Dorothea's subconscious was not able to chew. It began sucking on the cake, turning it to mush. This enabled the shrunken student to free herself from the cake. It did not, however, enable her to free herself from the mouth.<br>\r\nSuddenly, Dorothea pins Bernadetta to the roof of her mouth, swallowing the cake and letting her investigate the large solid object that had topped it.<br>\r\nShe begins to suck on the shrunken student, using her tongue to attempt to figure out what it even was.

The texture was similar to that of a grape, but the shape was completely different, and parts of it were covered in fuzz.<br>\r\nEventually, the object stopped moving.

For someone who rarely left her room, Bernie\u2019s speed was surprisingly impressive. Maybe after this whole ridiculous incident was over, she would teach the archer some swordplay and take advantage of her natural speed as an assassin. She had a habit for staying out of sight after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny purple haired girl ducked beneath the next door, sliding right into Dorothea\u2019s room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe emerged the other side to see Dorothea standing in the center of her room. The giantess was wearing a set of robes, most likely her sleepwear. The tiny girl hesitated for a moment before rushing towards the safety of her classmate\u2019s bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she was out in the open, scurrying to safety, things got worse as Dorothea began to dance. The giantess\u2019 foot came down with mighty force, sending Bernie to her knees. The tiny girl let out a terrified shriek as the foot came within inches of coming down on her. She scrambled to her own feet and began sprinting again, tapping into her instinct and will to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former songstress hummed to herself as she practiced the movements. She was determined to bring a win to the Black Eagle house, but what motivated her the most was the need to make her professor proud. The end of her tenure at the Mittelfrank Opera had her phoning in performances to nobles she cared little about. But now, she was doing it for her classmates and her professor. She just had to put her heart and soul into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat translated into spelling out hell for her tiny classmate at her feet. Bernadetta dove out of the way as Dorothea\u2019s massive foot came crashing down. She began to crawl away, horrified at the revelation that she was only about ankle height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too much longer after, Byleth entered the room only to see a bare foot slam right down in front of her. She backed away, slightly stunned as she pieced together the fact that she would have certainly been crushed if she were a bit faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe craned her neck skywards, finding Dorothea practicing her routine that the two had prepared for the White Heron cup. Had she not helped choreograph the dance, Byleth would have found the steps and stomps errant and utterly unpredictable. It just took a few seconds of watching the sleepwear clad giantess to anticipate her path. However, Byleth was less concerned about herself and more focused on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bernadetta!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scanned the room, hoping her student hadn\u2019t been caught by a wayward foot. Thankfully, Bernie had scurried under Dorothea\u2019s bed, just barely avoiding an incoming foot from smashing Bernadetta flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth continued her chase, dexterously weaving her way through the floor and avoiding her giant student\u2019s stomps. The ground shook with each step, threatening to knock Blyeth off her feet. Thankfully, the professor had the benefit of rewinding time. She could afford to take risks in an effort to retrieve her student. However, it did lead to razor thin scenarios as Dorothea's foot came down, almost crushing the professor had she not ended up in the gap between the dancer's largest toes. Any other person not as composed as the professor would have fainted at such a close call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching safety under the bed, Byleth caught her breath before continuing her search. It didn\u2019t take long before finding Bernie taking shelter in a tipped over makeup bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBernadetta.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBernie\u2019s not here! It's just us bottles of nail polish!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor sighed, stepping over to the bag and pushing past massive containers of makeup. She found the anxious student hiding behind a brush that was used to apply blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just want to talk,\u201d the professor said, taking a seat on a small bottle of perfume. \u201cI\u2019m not mad. I just want to know why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta stared at her feet. \u201cI was thinking that I\u2019d be better off if I lived like a Borrower in one of my books. I didn't think anyone would even care if I disappeared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Bernie,\u201d Byleth sighed, stepping forward and bringing her student in for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shy girl let herself melt into her professor\u2019s arms. It wasn\u2019t often that Byleth showed affection to her students. Even less often that it resulted in something physical like this, but Bernadetta appreciated it all the same. The professor was the kindest person she knew, and she felt everything would be all right.</span></div></div>",

And so do Edelgard and the others. We'd all miss you if you disappeared to become a Borrower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta was silent as she considered this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edelgard's proud of all the progress you've made in being less scared of her. Ferdinand and Caspar worry about you being cooped up in your room all the time. And Dorothea's wanted to be your friend for a while now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground beneath them began to shake as the songstress's dance took her closer to their hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Bernadetta, Why don't you give being a normal-sized human one more chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O,,, okay,\" Bernadetta agreed. \"Um... but the potion doesn't have an antidote. Or at least, I didn't bother to buy it... Oh no! That means you're trapped at this size too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, Bern. I'll handle it.\" Byleth raised her hand up expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sorry,\"</i> Sothis apologized from within Byleth's mind. <i>\"You used the Divine Pulse too much when you were avoiding being crushed by the girl outside. I need rest before you can turn back time again...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it,\" Byleth muttered. Seeing Bernadetta's confused, concerned look, she flashed the archer another gentle smile. \"It's fine, Bernadetta. We'll just get Dorothea's attention, and she'll bring us to someone who can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not Professor Casagranda!\" Bernadetta insisted. \"She'll eat you so she can be the prettiest professor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she wouldn't,\" Byleth assured her. \"Not while she's sober, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... still stumbling a little bit on the finale,\" sighed Dorothea. \"Once more from the top! Concentrate, Dorothea. Remember, this is for the Professor. Imagine she's in here with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes, Dorothea began to hum the music as she began to dance once again, soon getting carried away enough for the humming to turn to singing. Byleth and Bernadetta emerged from under her bed to find the young titaness gliding across the room, her eyes shut and her voice ringing far more loudly than theirs had any chance to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Byleth sighed. \"This complicates things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball of Dorothea's foot slammed into the floor directly in front of them, shaking Byleth up and causing Bernadetta to shriek and cower behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-professor, maybe I should wait in the makeup case. I'll just slow you down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Bern,\" Byleth kept a firm grip on her student. \"It's not that I don't trust you not to run off again, but... well... I don't trust you not to run off again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fair,\" Bernadetta sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth scanned Dorothea's room. Now that Bernadetta was with her and time travel was out of the question for now, she was extremely reluctant to go anywhere near the titanic dancer's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get to higher ground,\" Byleth decided. \"Come on, we should be able to climb to the top of her bed from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankful that Dorothea hadn't bothered to make her bed, Byleth took the reluctant archer to where the bedsheet reached the floor and the duo began to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what'll we do once we get to the top?\" Bernadetta asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wait until she's done practicing,\" Byleth told her. \"Then we'll call out to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And hope she hears us and doesn't mistake us for bugs,</i> Byleth thought to herself, not wanting to worry Bernadetta to the point that she'd flee again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the duo almost reached the top of the bed, the singing stopped as Dorothea...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOh, oh, dear!\u201d Bernadetta squeaked, her eyes going wide as she realized that Dorothea was stripping off her robe. She covered her eyes with her hands. However, the image of her giant classmate in her underwear would be forever burned into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth, meanwhile, remained stoic, studying the situation and trying to figure out what was going on. However, no amount of guesswork prepared her to see Dorothea carelessly toss the robe onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large shadow loomed over the shrunken pair as the robe descended onto them. Bernadetta tried to flee. However, the expansive fabric covered nearly the entirety of the bed, easily covering the pair and keeping them trapped beneath the surprisingly heavy weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robe bore down on them, making the pair lose all sense of direction as they tried to find each other in the maze of expensive fabric. From what they could tell, Dorothea invested heavily into the robe, making sure she slept in something absolutely comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was unmistakably Dorothea, overwhelmingly floral mixed with hints of sweat and perfume in choice locations. However, the two managed to meet again as Byleth crawled her away under the robe while following the sounds of Bernadetta\u2019s cries of panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got you,\u201d the professor said, grabbing Bernadetta\u2019s arm. \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t let go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta whimpered. But from what Byleth recognized from the tone, it was an affirmative whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunched over, Byleth led the charge, deciding to move in a certain direction, knowing the end would eventually be in sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Dorothea was quickly getting dressed into her training gear. While her eventual transition into a dancer meant she had a reduced need for sword training, her professor heavily emphasized the importance of self defense, which she couldn\u2019t agree more. Her position as a dancer was to motivate her fellow students. Her corpse, while most likely beautiful, wouldn\u2019t be all that motivating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sword training, she planned to take a long bath, and then change and apply her makeup before heading to the monastery to take care of the rest of her duties for the day. She tied her hair up and looked at herself in a hand mirror before blowing herself a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, she noticed the robe discarded on her bed and remembered today was laundry day. \u201cRight, better drop that off, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, she walked over to her bed and reached under it, pulling out a sack she used to store the rest of her dirty clothes. She held it open with one hand before lazily scooping up the robe and dragging it into the laundry bag before slinging it over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, for obvious reasons, spelled out chaos for the tiny duo. The ground began to shake as Dorothea bunched up the robe. The two quickly got disoriented and lost in the fabric again. They felt a sensation of free falling before hitting something. Thankfully, the robe had protected them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair burrowed their way out from their cloth prison together, following slight traces of light, only to find themselves in a strange room with cloth walls all around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-where are we?\u201d Bernadetta asked, looking around for any hints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth did the same, finding more stray articles of clothing under the cliff of sleepwear. It didn\u2019t take long together to piece together their location. \u201cDorothea\u2019s laundry bag.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-her laundry!?\u201d Bernie cried. \u201cNo, no no no, I can\u2019t swim, Professor!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she reassured, just stick close to me. \u201cWe\u2019ll get out before we have to swim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea walked over to the next room, knocking at Petra\u2019s door. The foreign exchange student quickly opened up, exiting out in her sleepwear of shorts and a thin shirt that barely covered her midriff. \u201cMorning, Petra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said back, eying the sack across Dorothea\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI take it, it is my day to be doing the laundry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup.\u201d Dorothea handed her the bag. \u201cBe gentle with my clothes. Edelgard was a bit stingy with the softening soap I like so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will be trying,\u201d the Brigid girl said, her face souring as she accepted the bag. \u201cI mean, I will try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much,\u201d Dorothea chirped. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe seeing you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Byleth and Bernadetta to realize things would only get worse from here. Petra wasted no time in dropping her own laundry into the sack, drowning the pair in her own pile of clothing. They were caught under what they could only guess was a sock as the heavy, stale scent of sweat washed over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on, the pile of clothes only got heavier as Petra collected clothes from her fellow students. When she got to Bernadetta\u2019s room, she collected the bag in front of the door, the usual routine that didn\u2019t raise any alarms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth and Bernadetta, meanwhile, tried to climb their way to the top, finding it much more difficult to navigate than the robe itself. However, the looming threat of being drowned as Petra did the laundry became real as they caught the sounds of the river just outside the monastery getting louder.</span></div></div>",

He wanted nothing more than to cut off the head of the woman responsible. It meant tearing through an active battlefield between the Leicester Alliance and the Adrestian Empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wouldn\u2019t be given the opportunity to mourn his fallen as he found himself on his knees and at the end of Edelgard\u2019s axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you yield?\u201d Edelgard asked, pressing her axe under his chin and forcing the exiled prince to look her in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri growled. \"I will never rest until I have your head at the end of my lance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I thought,\" said Edelgard. She raised her free hand and made a beckoning motion. \"Hubert, if you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure, Lady Edelgard,\" Hubert responded, his hands glowing with strange dark energy. He cast it right on the fallen prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince let out a pained groan as the aura wrapped around his body. It felt as if flames licked his skin, hungrily savoring every inch. He tried to stand, only to fall back to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finish me off yourself, you coward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard only smirked. \"I'm not going to kill you just yet, Dimitri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri's body went numb. However, that was he least of his issues as whatever spell Hubert put on him began to warp his perspective. It was almost as if Edsel hard was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmug laughter roared high above him and was followed by thundering booms as Edelgard's stepped closer. The tips of her boots were uncomfortably close, the her heels already dwarfing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri was rendered absolutely powerless as Edelgard\u2019s gloved fingers pinched him and lifted hin skyward. He was met with the entirety of her face taking up his vision.

He scanned his surroundings, prepared to fight. However, once his vision cleared, he was met with the same giant Edelgard from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d he grumbled, balling his hands into fists. \u201cYou took everything from me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to rush her, only to walk into the uncaring wall of her palm, knocking him onto his back. She pinned him down with her thumb, absolutely relishing in the power she held over what was once her rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis new size suits you Dimitri. You\u2019re finally taking your place beneath my thumb.\u201d Her comment only sent Dimitri into a frothing rage. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to have a class reunion again and have Claude join you at your stature.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll die for this,\u201d Dimitri said, venom in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s adorable that you think you still have any agency.\u201d Edelgard smirked, pressing her thumb further against his chest and earning more pained groans. \"Guess I'll have to break you like a mount.\"</span></div></div>",

As tired as the routine of taking care of Sylvain\u2019s messes after he broke a woman\u2019s heart was, she had to admit that this one was pretty novel. She had found him on his bed, jumping for her attention after she came in and assumed he had overslept again. After that he quickly explained to her his latest exploit involving a hot goth looking chick he met in town. As it turned out, she was a witch that did not take kindly to his advances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever taking the first no for an answer, he inevitably crossed a line, which led to her cursing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I had to be honest,\u201d Sylvain began, coming dangerously close to genuine self-reflection. \u201cShe was totally worth the risk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid closed her fist around him, squeezing the air out from his lungs. \u201cYou\u2019ve had your fun. I\u2019m taking you to the Professor. She\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cNo! Wait don\u2019t!\u201d he protested with a coughing wheeze. \u201cShe\u2019ll put me in detention if she finds out I\u2019m still\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you need some serious punishment to get it through your thick skull,\u201d Ingrid countered, stepping out of the dorm building. \u201cThat witch could have done much worse to you if she pleased.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019d let her do anything to me for her pleas\u2014\u201d Sylvain was cut off as Ingrid squeezed him in her fist again. \u201cTh-there\u2019s a way to reverse it! We don\u2019t need to involve Professor Byleth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid sighed. \u201cWhat is it then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain racked his brain, trying to remember the witch\u2019s exact words. \u201cS-something about how I always use women. I\u2019m pretty sure she was rhyming, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA witch with rhyming incantations,\u201d Ingrid remarked. \u201cDo you have any restraint, Sylvain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought she was just a moody poet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what was it she said? These hexes are pretty specific in their wording.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken skirt chaser groaned, \u201c\u2018If you want to return to your size again, you must learn\u2026 what it feels like to be\u2026 used by women?\u2019 I think it was that, but it barely even rhymes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slant rhyme, you idiot,\u201d Ingrid countered. She thought about the phrasing. \u201cSo all you have to do is put yourself in a girl\u2019s service.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d Sylvain said, suddenly realizing the implications of such a condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Ingrid hummed. \u201cYou can start with\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Ingrid was not only a beautiful young woman who he knew and admired quite well, but despite her tendency to nag his ears off, she had an endless amount of patience for his shenanigans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid furrowed her brow. \"In your dreams, Sylvain. I'm just doing you a favor here. Tell me...\" Ingrid brought her hand up closer to her face with a quick motion, causing her tiny friend to stumble from the sudden inertia. \"How many girls with broken hearts would kill to have you in their hands right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain looked aside, trying to evade the question. The entirety of his field of view being blocked by the discerning emerald eyes of his giant captor made that more difficult than usual. \"Uuuuuh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid sighed, her mouth in such close proximity that her breath ruffled the miniaturized man's hair. \"You've lost count, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain whistled innocently. Ingrid merely rolled her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then...\" Ingrid lowered her hand with a slower motion this time, positioning it level to her chest. \"If the curse says that you need to be 'used by women', then I have a few ideas of a fitting punishment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain looked from the powerful leering visage of Ingrid above him to the gigantic breasts that were just a single leap away. He was, as Claude had eloquently phrased it once, 'scaroused.' \"Well, uh, wh-what did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid gave a low mirthful laugh, pulling the boy closer to her bust, bringing him just within reach of his desires, granting him a view of them in all of their enormous beauty... before suddenly yanking her arm away, causing him to fall flat on his butt. \"Chores, obviously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on!\" Sylvain shouted back, indignant at the blatant trickery. \"You did that on purpose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have,\" Ingrid admitted, the ghost of a catlike smile on her face. \"But I'm afraid being punished by a lady doesn't always work out the way it does in those tasteless books that you keep losing all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain blushed red for a moment. The memory of his professor looking him dead in the eye with her cold expression as she handed him his lost copy of 'a perfectly respectable romance novel' would stay with him until the day he died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, in case you forgot - and I'm reasonably certain that you did - the professor has tasked us with chores this weekend, and 'I was cursed by a witch' isn't an excuse for lazing about. You remember what we were scheduled for, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain gulped. He was never great at remembering any event that didn't involve cute girls, great theatre or board games (or any combination of those three things, as rare as that was.) \"Oh, of course! I remember it like it was yesterday! We're set to, uuuh... clear out the stables, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong,\" Ingrid declared, much to Sylvain's further embarrassment. \"Not only is it watching the skies for our class this week, but the professor nominated Felix and Dedue, not us.\" The young knight gave pause for a moment. She had no idea what their teacher was trying to accomplish with these strange pairings, and the one time she had asked about it, they had simply shrugged and said that it 'built character.' \"The two of us still have an errand to handle for the class, though. And whether you're the size of a mouse or not, it's your duty as a knight to lend a helping hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain sighed. \"Man, 'duty' this and 'duty' that... Can't you just let me off with a warning and send me on my merry way instead of babysitting me all day?\" The boy chuckled. \"I mean, if you want to give me a light spanking, I wouldn't say <i>no</i>-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid lightly flicked her perverted companion in the stomach, causing him to double over. It wasn't with enough force to really hurt that much, but it sure did knock the wind out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alr-\" Sylvain wheezed, getting some air back into his lungs. \"Alright, alright! Knightly duty it is. But I've got no idea how I can help out like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortunately for you, Sylvain, it's a task that even you can handle. You'll be helping me...\"</span></div></div>",

He slouched down, grabbing a stray lock of hair to keep from falling. Although, judging from the slight bounce of her chest with each step, he wouldn\u2019t mind \u201caccidentally\u201d slipping. The only thing that kept him from trying a stunt concocted by his other head, was the threat of being the main protein in today\u2019s soup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sylvain debated taking the plunge, Ingrid made her way to the Dining Hall, breezing past the usual line of students and heading towards the back kitchen. She pinched him and roughly deposited him on the counter before heading to the stock room and grabbing the ingredients needed for today\u2019s special. With little regard for his safety, she dropped the bunches of vegetables needed to prepare the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain backed away as an avalanche of nutrition came rolling towards him. A turnip rolled at him like a boulder down a hill, nearly running him over. \u201cH-Hey, relax, Ingrid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live,\u201d she said back, grabbing the smallest knife she could from a drawer. She dropped it in front of him, the loud clang causing him to jump back. \u201cHere, make yourself useful and slice up the turnips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain stared down at the knife that was several times as long as he was tall. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be obtuse,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI\u2019m sure that silver axe you insisted our professor buy is much heavier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I don\u2019t use it in battle,\u201d he countered. \u201cGotta keep it clean, so I can show it off to the ladies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid eyed the pot and briefly wondered what human tasted like. While she wasn\u2019t really curious, the idea would make a good enough scare tactic to keep Sylvain in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, Sylvain was struggling to lift the small knife, his balance thrown off as he lifted it over his shoulder. He awkwardly moved it around, trying to find the best way to hold it before dragging it off to the turnip and settling into work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something adorable about just how small he was and how he was earnestly struggling to even accomplish basic tasks. If she wanted, she could have diced the turnip in a matter of seconds, but Sylvain needed the work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe this will humble him,</i> she thought before immediately brushing it off. <i>Who am I kidding? It\u2019s Sylvain.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid focused on her own responsibilities, grabbing a Teutates Loach that was set aside for preparing the Spicy Fish and Turnip Stew. It was a dish she rather enjoyed and surreptitiously learned that Sylvain did as well when they were invited to eat with the Professor a few weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With her own knife, she set to work, bringing it right down and severing the loach\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain jumped with a start at the sudden impact. \u201cH-hey, watch where you swing that thing! I\u2019m down here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid didn\u2019t respond, quickly cutting up the fish and removing its bones. Though, Sylvain could have sworn he saw the lightest of smirks on her face. He wasn\u2019t all that surprised that she was having fun messing with him, but he could do without the giant knife. At the very least, he was glad that it was her rather than one of his many, many scorned lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ingrid was done preparing the fish and added them to the stew pot, she turned to Sylvain to his his output. He had only sliced half a turnip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Ingrid asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder than it looks,\u201d he shot back, pulling the knife back by the handle as if he were a logger cutting a tree with a long saw meant for two people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid pushed him aside with her finger, ignoring his protests as she took control of the knife. With deft hands, she quickly cut it into pieces and did the same with the rest of the pile of turnips. Sylvain, glad to not be doing any more work, simply watched. He found himself staring at her hands, clean and well maintained, skillfully do his assigned job with little effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Sylvain began idly. \u201cYou used me for chores. Shouldn\u2019t I be growing back now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe the hex recognized how awful of a job you did,\u201d she said as she cupped a handful of turnip slices and dropped it into the bowl. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there\u2019s more than enough chores to go around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHooray.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the meal was finished cooking...</span></div></div>",

But now I think you'd be the perfect present.\" Ingrid explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain's mind immediately filled with visions of the gorgeous Dorothea, the beautiful singer with tremendous boobs. He allowed his mind to drift to a vision of his tiny form tucked between her boobs, like two smooth soft pillows... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylvain, snap out of it!\" Ingrid admonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even in his dreams, Ingrid ruined everything. Dream Ingrid came up and hugged Dorothea, and his beautiful pillows were pressed flat against Ingrid's boobs, pulverising him to a bloody spot on the opera singers light skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were daydreaming about Dorothea's boobs weren't you?\" Ingrid asked in annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" Sylvain replied, shook from his daydream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only strengthened Ingrid's conviction. \"Oh yeah, this is definitely the right call. If anyone can teach you a lesson, it'll be Dorothea.\" Ingrid smiled as she remembered her conversation with Dorothea the other day, where Dorothea had told her about something she really wanted to buy. And the thought that she could use Sylvain for that made Ingrid grin even wider. This boy had no idea what he was getting himself into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid placed Sylvain down on her dresser, before opening a drawer and beginning to rummage through it. He felt the entire dresser shake as she opened and slammed drawers, looking for something, until finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! I knew I still had these!\" Ingrid exclaimed, displaying a pink ribbon and a ring box. Sylvain looked confused, so she explained: \"The ribbon is from Dorothea when she was trying to help me make my hair fancy for the Opera she was putting on. And the ring box is left over from some noble or another sending me marriage propositions. Already sold the ring.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain was no less confused. \"Alright Ingrid, but what does any of this have to do with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid just smiled and brandished the ribbon, bringing the pink strip towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ingrid you shouldn't have!\" Dorothea said, feigning flattery. \"Of course I'll marry you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not marrying you Dorothea!\" Ingrid said, annoyed but amused by her friend's constant flirting. \"It's not a ring, it's just a birthday present!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm just teasing Ingrid! Though the offer is always open.\" Dorothea said with a wink as she snatched the box from her friend. \"Though I can't imagine what you could have gotten me that fits in such a small box if it's not a ring.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just open it! I promise you won't be able to guess.\" Ingrid replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea popped open the box, and her jaw dropped at the sight of her present. On the little pillow inside the box was a tiny, hogtied Sylvain, struggling desperately against the pink ribbon that bound him up, which was tied off with a delicate bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took me a few tries to get the bow right. Hard to get it like that without breaking his legs or anything.\" Ingrid said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylvain?\" Dorothea stammered, astonished at the sight of the tiny ginger. \"How'd you get so small?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid answered for him: \"A witch shrunk him for hitting on her, of course. And he won't grow back until he learns what it's like to be 'Used by women', and since you were talking the other day about that thing you desperately needed, I thought Sylvain would be a perfect substitute.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea's eyes widened as she realized what Ingrid was referring to. \"Oh Ingrid this is an amazing gift! And you're right, I do think Sylvain would make a great...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Pendant (Dorothea ties a string to both of his arms, making a necklace and leaving him hanging between her giant boobs)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.

The former opera singer was never shy about her intentions of why she dated men, but she had never been this forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I don\u2019t know who\u2019s more perverted,\u201d Ingrid exclaimed while throwing her hands up. \u201cThe skirt chaser or the female pimp.

Especially one as well-endowed as Dorothea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019know, maybe this won\u2019t be so bad,\u201d Sylvain said while nervously putting his arm around his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you will enjoy it,\u201d Dorothea said while turning around and placing the shrunken noble on her plain bed. Sylvian watched with glee as Dorothea sashayed over toward her dorm door. She locked it and began shedding her clothing, article by article, until there was nothing left but Dorothea\u2019s naked supple body. Sylvain\u2019s jaw dropped and his mind began to race as the gigantic naked women slowly approached him. Was this happening? Was this real?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain couldn\u2019t take his eyes from the constantly bouncing orbs that were attached to Dorothea\u2019s chest. They put him in a hypnotic gaze. Every step the singer took, her breasts bounced in a different direction and grew slightly bigger as Dorothea slowly got closer. The young woman finally stopped in front of her bed, confidently putting her hands on her hips and eyeing the little pervert below her. Despite her pussy being just a few inches away from him, Dorothea could tell that Sylvain\u2019s gaze was directed solely at her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea leaned over, causing her breasts to sway slightly and cast a shadow over the small ginger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you my girlfriends,\u201d Dorothea said while cupping one breast in each hand and massaging them. Sylvian didn\u2019t answer. His glare was completely blank and a small trickle of drool found its way outside of his mouth and onto his garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes,\u201d Dorothea said with a chuckle. \u201cSo are you ready to be inside me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat snapped Sylvain out of his immoral trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea giggled and then climbed on to her bed, her entire body hovering over the warrior. She got on all knees, plucked the tiny man from the bedside and bent over, sticking her ass in the air. She then brought the small man toward her backside, her massive ass taking up most of Sylvain\u2019s vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain was a little put off by this, but quickly shrugged the thought off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll feel better for her if she just sticks me from behind,\u201d he said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sylvain began to mentally prepare himself for what would be his most manly task yet, he noticed Dorothea\u2019s free hand pulling her butt cheeks apart, causing him alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, what are you doing?\u201d Sylvain asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. This is what we agreed on isn\u2019t it?\u201d Dorothea said in an exaggerated high voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea let a few seconds pass before finishing her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you didn\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to use you as a butt plug. I thought I made that quite clear. What else what I use you for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvian screamed as the words \u2018butt plug\u2019 hit his ears. He frantically began struggling, hoping to break free from Dorothea\u2019s iron-clad grip. He screamed, hoping that someone would hear his tiny pleas from beyond the thick wooden walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut both attempts were fruitless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short chuckle to herself, Dorothea forced the tiny man inside her spread asscheeks. Sylvian reacted quickly, managing to prop himself away from Dorothea\u2019s asshole, using his arms and hands that were propped against Dorthea\u2019s buttcheeks to create space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, you\u2019re such a strong man. How will I ever you get inside my ass? Oh wait, I know!\u201d Dorothea shouted before putting her full strength on Sylvain\u2019s body, causing his entire being to be forced inside Dorothea\u2019s butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain\u2019s screams were cut off as Dorothea\u2019s thick buttcheeks slammed together, muffling the screams for the poor man. Sylvain cursed in his head numerous times. His entire body, especially his head, was trapped in a tight, hot inescapable room that wouldn\u2019t let him go no matter how hard he struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn contrast, Dorothea was in heaven. Months of sexual frustration were finally being satisfied thanks to a horny man trapped her in her asshole. It was as if a great burden had been lifted off her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea spent the next few minutes enjoying Sylvain\u2019s presence. She twisted him around the entirity of her butt. Pulled him in and out, but never letting his head get a glimpse of freedom. Pleasurable shocks ran down Dorothea\u2019s body each time she felt Sylvain\u2019s head or shoulder brush up against the inside of her ass cheeks. She was in Heaven and Sylvain was in Hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp me!\u201d Sylvain managed to utter as his head was forced against the inner side of Dorothea\u2019s right ass cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, stop screaming,\u201d Dorothea scolded. \u201cThis is probably the most you have ever done to please a woman. I\u2019ve spoken to most women at this academy. You have a pretty bad reputation, y\u2019know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain began to rethink his life decisions as his body and head were shoved and slammed against Dorothea\u2019s ass cheeks. Maybe he deserved this. Maybe he should stop being a pervert. Maybe women were more than just objects to fawn over. \u201cWould I see daylight again?\u201d He said to himself quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve been a bad person. Maybe I deserve this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a shame that his realization came while he was being used as a buttplug by someone who could rival his carnal ambitions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after nearly half an hour\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Dorothea goes to meet Ingrid for lunch, with Ingrid initially unaware that Dorothea still has Sylvain shoved headfirst up her asshole.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The familiar bell rings. Dorothea heads to class with Sylvain up her butt. Deciding he needs to pay attention as well, she turns him around, so he is shoved feet first up her butt with his head sticking out of her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Dorothea is only getting hornier, and decides to move Sylvain upfront</span></div></div>",

A rather Earth quaking rumble shook the representative of the Golden Deer viciously as he tried to keep his footing from atop the massively lazy girl's leg. Accompanying which was a quiet hum, whispered from the distant lips of his comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you've got to be kidding me!\" Claude exaggeratedly sighed, shaking his head in disappointment. \"Is she trying to compete with Lindhart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, the speed at which she had reached such a sound slumber would have impressed the young deerling had it not been for the unfortunate situation he found himself in. Were he at normal size he supposed he would have silently applauded her\u2026 for at least 30 seconds before banging all the pots and pans he could carry from the monastery kitchen. So easily could he have woken her slumbering form on any day prior to today. Yet now, Claude stood no larger than a pathetic ant. It would be no small feat to awaken the comparable Titan, especially <i>from</i> her feet. The future leader of the alliance grappled silently with his options, limited as they were, before deciding he would have to rely on his own ingenuity rather than luck to attain Hilda's unknowing attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant he needed to brew quite a scheme, naturally\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude eyed the lengthy trail of Hilda's surprisingly toned leg before him. It was easily one of the longest bridges he'd ever thought to pass over. He knew it would prove quite arduous of a trek, to say nothing of the possibility she might move in her sleep. Before he could even think to wake her up, he needed to cross the perilous road presented to him. There was no choice, unless he wished to sleep this night atop the desk she had settled her boot clad feet upon. But then that was hardly a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get started then\u2026\" Claude shrugged unfazed before setting his first foot forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part his journey towards Hilda's distant torso was less than interesting. Unexpectedly so considering the anything but ordinary circumstances surrounding the shrunken victim of hubris. That is until he reached the end of her leather shoe. Claude hopped casually from the slightly risen black flooring he had grown somewhat accustomed to, landing on a plane if indigo cloth. Now this of course was nothing intriguing at all, the fact that Hilda wore these knee-high socks wasn't exactly some forbidden knowledge after all. No, what was worthy of note was the giga girl's reaction to the sudden feeling of Claude's own miniature boots digging into her kneecap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as undetectable as he'd expected his steps to be, Claude's miniscule jump somehow had registered in Hilda's resting mind. Not knowing of the danger looming just over the horizon, Claude merely continued to tread with the same amount of caution as before. He had no reason to suspect she was about to react to the presence of a bug such as he. And yet, as if to thwart his self preserving plans, she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened in an instant. Claude was knocked to his own knees as his legs turned to a viscous liquid, unable to remain firmly planted any longer. The monolithic limbs of his lackadaisical compatriot twisted like pretzels in aggravation of their impeded relaxation. Lifting up and falling down, they rubbed against one another to itch the irritant fawn. It was all Claude had in him just to hold on to Hilda's silky leggings with his hastily fastened grip. All the while her quiet and peaceful snoring exited unhindered in the distance. The leader of the Golden Deer grunted exasperatedly with each swift movement of her legs as they wove together like a tapestry. He had ridden untamed wyvern less ferocious than Hilda's enormous and threatening legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicate as a flower my- oh\u2026 oh no!\" Claude yelped as he noted that the leg opposing his own was now exciting right towards him.

She was clearly going to make this a thing. \"I don't know, Claude. Getting up from my seat to search the whole monastery for Lysithia or Marianne sounds like it'll be an awful lot of work. And I'm just so terribly <i>lazy...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put special emphasis on the last word while glaring playfully at the tiny noble on her boot. Claude winced. He was wondering when Hilda would finally get him back for what he said during Professor Byleth's orientation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, what is it you said when you introduced me to the Professor? Something about how if lazy were in the dictionary...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your picture wouldn't be there because it's already next to 'beautiful!'\" Claude flashed Hilda his most winning smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink haired noble chuckled condescendingly. \"Nice try, Claude. I remember it a little differently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want from me, Hilda?\" Claude shrugged. \"You ARE lazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean I wanted it to be our new teacher's first impression of me!\" Hilda snapped. \"It totally colored her perception, and she's had it in for me since the first day of class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty sure that's because you asked to be a cheerleader so you could skip training,\" Claude muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And because I'm so very, VERY lazy,\" Hilda continued, deliberately shaking Claude up by crossing her legs, taking care to put the one he was clinging to on top of the other so she wouldn't crush him. \"I think instead of helping you get back to normal size, I'm just going to take a nice, loooooong nap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hilda, you're being a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude was cut off by Hilda yawning loudly and obnoxiously as she leaned back in the chair and closed her eyes. He took a deep breath and counted to ten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hilda...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda began to snore in a loud, exaggerated fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude rolled his eyes. \"Hilda, I've seen you fall asleep in class before. Your snoring doesn't sound like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda opened one of her eyes. \"Excuse me? I do NOT snore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty sure Teach and the rest of the Golden Deer would argue differently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda glared at him. \"I am a proud noble lady of House Goneril! I do everything gracefully, including sleeping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, <i>Lorenz,</i> sorry!\" Claude held up his hands, grinning at Hilda's obvious offense to the comparison. \"You don't snore. You just drool. A lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda's eyes narrowed. \"You're not going to let me take my break in peace, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Hilda,\" Claude shrugged. \"I really want to get back to normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda grabbed Claude with her thumb and forefinger, bringing him to her face as she gave him an unamused look. Claude swallowed nervously. While he knew that Hilda would never harm him deliberately, he had been pushing her buttons much harder than usual, and their current size disparity gave her the power to make the next few minutes very unpleasant for him. Besides, for all that Hilda claimed to be a \"delicate flower,\" there were often times that she didn't know her own strength. Harming him <i>accidentally</i> was very much on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she spoke. \"Okay, Claude. If you really won't leave me alone...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...You can make yourself useful. Give me a massage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude made an exaggerated effort to crane his neck up and down as he looked his gigantic classmate over. \"Uuuuuuuh, you sure about that, Hilda? It's gonna take me a while when your back is the size of a courtyard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lucky you! I wasn't talking about my back!\" Hilda said back in a shrewd tone. Before Claude could ask for clarification, Hilda plucked him up by his cape, deftly dangling him over to the empty chair next to her and gracefully letting him down onto its wooden surface. With her passenger now safely disembarked, she twisted around in her seat to face him and knelt down, removing her sleek black boots and long navy-blue socks with a contented sigh - these damn school uniforms were always far too tight for her liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda scooted the discarded footwear beneath her seat before giggling as she leaned back and propped her feet up on the other chair, causing a shockwave for the tiny Claude as her heels hit the hardwood. \"Oh, Claude, be a dear, won't you?\" Hilda asked in her most saccharine sing-song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude stared at the soles before him, and then back over to the reclining Hilda across the gap. \"Uh-uh. No way, not for all the silver bows in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come ooooooon,\" Hilda cooed back. \"Don't be such a prude. If you won't do this for little ol' me, then who will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude tapped his chin in mock thought. \"...Lorenz?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant noble merely stuck out her tongue. \"All I'm asking is for you to put those big strong arms to use for, like, five minutes. Okay, ten, tops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one with the freakishly powerful arms, Hilda,\" Claude retaliated, taking a further step back from the toes that were scrunching with anticipation. \"Rub your own damn feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda pouted. \"You're no fun! Just one itty-bitty widdle massage and I swear to take you straight to the professor, no strings attached, pinkie promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken leader squinted as he scrutinized his friend's Cheshire smile. He wasn't a hundred percent sure that he could trust her on that promise, but he didn't have many options at this point. He really did need to get this condition cured as soon as possible - being humiliated at this size was bad, but staying like this for some rodent or bird to gobble him up was far worse. Frustrated as he was about his powerlessness, Claude had to reluctantly acknowledge that, if Hilda could be easily satisfied with just five minutes of simple servitude, then it was the most practical solution to this current problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude scratched behind his ear. \"And you also promise to <i>never</i> bring this up again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda scoffed. \"Oh, but of course! I mean, it's not like anyone would believe me anyway, right...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude frowned. That was, despite his suspicions, actually a pretty good point. \"Alright, fine, but I'm counting down the seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda flexed her pristine peds. \"Excellent! Now you better hurry up and do a good job, or I'll go ask if Raphael wants to take my place-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I'm going!\" Claude grimaced as the realization that this could always get far more degrading. Without further delay, he stepped forward to the right foot, resting on its heel with the toes pointed upward to a ceiling that seemed out of reach. The foot was even taller than he was, and it was practically spotless and unblemished. Secretly thankful that he had at least chosen the most hygienic member of the class, Claude pressed his hands against the peachy sole in front of him and began kneading the soft skin as best as he could in circular motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda bit her lip as Claude began in earnest. This felt <i>way</i> better than she had expected it to. Nonetheless, she couldn't let Claude get complacent. \"...Uuuh, have you even started yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, laugh it up,\" Claude shouted back. \"I'm charging you for treason once I'm back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude continued to rub away at the sole for some time while Hilda reclined back and enjoyed the strange yet soothing sensation. In truth, this wasn't as awful as he had feared. Hilda clearly took good care of her body, and her claim that she had been walking all day was clearly an exaggeration - with how clean and pillowy her feet were, he would have assumed that she had just stepped out of the sauna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my miniature masseuse,\" said Hilda, idly checking her nails. They were still the perfect pigment of pink, of course. \"Are you enjoying yourself down there? Thinking about applying full-time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude rolled his eyes. \"Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just wondering why it smells like roses. Not that I'm complaining, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take care of myself from head to toe!\" Hilda beamed with pride as she eyed her feet from afar. She prized herself on her beauty and hygiene, after all. \"I should be beautiful in every place where it counts. Oh, move up a bit too, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me-\" Claude grunted as he had to stretch his arms to reach up Hilda's arch, much to her amusement and pleasure. \"-just how often does that actually make any difference?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you'd be surprised. I've gotten some guys to run all the way to town and back on errands for me, and all I have to do is flash them some of this,\" Hilda wiggled her toes to demonstrate her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude quirked an eyebrow as he pushed harder in the soft surface before him. \"I think you're hanging out with some strange guys, Hilda. Do me a favor and hire one of <i>them</i> for this next time, would ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If any of them are dumb enough to botch their next stomach flu poison, I'll be sure to keep that in mind,\" Hilda answered with a smirk. \"Now put your shoulder into it. You've still got Leftie to do after this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude groaned. This was going to be a very long ten minutes.</span></div></div>",

Tragically, he would have to look into getting a new person to fill that position, as Hilda proved to be a traitor to the Alliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the Golden Deer were either a bit too straight laced like Leonie or unreliable loud and unsubtle like Raphael. There was Lysithea, and he was pretty sure she would treat him worse at this size given his penchant for mocking her for her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny noble pressed his fists into Hilda\u2019s heel, earning an exaggerated moan of pleasure. He shuddered. Despite the fact that he knew she did it to emasculate him further, it made him feel humiliated all the same. The two knew just how to push each other\u2019s buttons. If he were totally honest, he would have messed with her if he found her small as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBet you\u2019re getting a real big kick out of this,\u201d Claude said, gliding his hands over the slight wrinkles on the giantess\u2019 sole. \u201cSeeing the future Alliance Leader massaging your feet like a handmaiden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Lorenz,\u201d Hilda said, mocking his tone while getting right back at Claude\u2019s earlier comment. \u201cAfter this, I want you to get right in between my toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude stared up at the digits that were far out of reach. Her toes clenched in anticipation. While her sole was just a way of skin, there was something even more degrading about the idea of squeezing himself between her toes. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had a deal, Claude. You can\u2019t reneg,\u201d Hilda said. She put on a haughty voice. \u201cThe Leicester Alliance was founded on trade agreements and treaties built on the word of a noble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve met your brother, you know,\u201d Claude said, punching Hilda\u2019s heel. \u201cHe does not sound like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe totally does,\u201d she shot back. \u201cAnd quit changing the subject. My piggies are still waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, dear goddess, you just called them piggies,\u201d he grumbled under his breath. He brought his hands to his face in annoyance, only to pull them away once he remembered where they\u2019ve been. He peered over the side of her heel. \u201cYou can see I can\u2019t reach them, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you suggesting I have big feet? That\u2019s a very rude thing to say to a woman.\u201d Hilda puffed her cheeks and crossed her arms. \u201cFine. If you really need the help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude only had a second to react as Hilda dropped her foot right down on top of him. She dragged it across the surface of the chair, gripping him in the space between the ball of her foot and toes. She flexed her digits, making sure to force the tiny noble in the slight gap between her largest toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms were pinned at his sides, now rendered completely helpless to Hilda\u2019s whims. Even her toes were enough to completely dominate him, a reality he didn\u2019t want to reflect on but was forced to recognize. While there was nothing malicious from the way she manhandled him, it was harrowing all the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of roses was still there, but that didn\u2019t really make things any better, just\u2026 less worse. His mind was set on what could have been worse rather than what he was taking for granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda crossed her legs, lifting Claude high into the air as she shifted position. She giggled as she felt his squirming body tickle against her sensitive skin. \u201cJust like that, Claude. Put your whole body into it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately stopped writhing, as if it would do anything other than confirm that Hilda\u2019s mind games were working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Hilda, you\u2019ve had you\u2019re fun,\u201d Claude said. \u201cYou can take me to the professor now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it. But you still have my other foot, ya know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda absentmindedly rolling her ankle. All this did was make Claude feel a bit sick as the constant motion reminded him of the time he was tied to horse as child. Though, this was certainly worse. Even the anger he  felt when everyone laughed at him was nothing compared to Hilda\u2019s taunting combined with being treated like a plaything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just hoped Hilda wasn\u2019t feeling playful anymore.</span></div></div>",

What are youMMPPPH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, Hilda quickly shoved her feet- and tiny house leader- into her boots just as Leonie entered. \"Leonie! How are you? Did you change your mind about your good-luck charm? There's lots of pretty things I can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're both on weeding duty this week,\" Leonie said firmly. \"I've been looking for you everywhere. Come on, let's get it over with before it gets too hot outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda frowned. \"I thought I was working with Raphael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The professor had me switch places with Raphael,\" Leonie folded her arms and gave Hilda an accusing glare. \"You know... after you tricked him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't trick him!\" Hilda defended herself. \"I just wasn't feeling well, so he volunteered to do my share of the work. You know Raphael's a sweetheart like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I hope you don't expect to pull that on me,\" Leonie's glare grew in intensity. \"I had to postpone a training session with Captain Jeralt because of you. You'll do your fair share of the work or you'll regret it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine,\" Hilda rolled her eyes. \"Go ahead, I'll meet you out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie didn't move. \"No, I think we'll go together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda frowned nervously and glanced down at her boot, where she could feel the tiny Claude struggling. While him being in her boot trapped between her toes was hilarious, actually walking around and risking hurting him would take it too far. That said, letting Leonie see him wasn't an option either. As irritable as she was, who knew how she'd react to Claude's situation or how Hilda had been taking advantage of it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonie? Can you wait outside for a sec?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie's eyes narrowed. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind,\" Hilda sighed. With great reluctance, she rose from her chair, putting as much weight on her non-beClauded foot as possible. When it inevitably came time to take the next step, she set her foot down as gently as possible, wincing as Claude's struggles intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that it tickled was doing neither of them any favors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hilda, I just said I wasn't falling for your tricks!\" Leonie snapped. \"Stop acting like your foot's injured. I know you were fine this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... heh... sorry... you got me,\" Hilda chucked nervously, walking normally while silently apologizing to Claude and praying to the goddess she only occasionally believed in that he'd be alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that Hilda would stop messing around and follow her, Leonie turned her gaze to the floor next to the desk and frowned in disgust. \"Who the hell left their socks lying around in the classroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea,\" Hilda lied effortlessly as she joined Leonie outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, kid, thanks for getting me out of training with Pinelli today,\" Jeralt raised his teacup to his daughter in a brief cheer. \"It's crappy to go back on my word, but sometimes her hero worship just gets to be too much.\" He sipped his tea. \"Get enough of that from Alois,\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Byleth nodded as she sipped her own cup. Having just received her class's assignment for the month from Rhea and Seteth, Byleth stopped by her father's office for a visit. It was one of the precious few moments of alone time they'd had since their new life at the monastery began. \"I needed to switch some chore pairings around anyway. One of my students is a helpful but dim sort, and some of the craftier nobles I've been saddled with tend to take advantage of him. Leonie seemed less likely to put up with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeralt scoffed. \"Remind me why you picked that house again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edelgard and Dimitri tried to recruit me to their armies immediately after meeting me. Left a bad taste in my mouth,\" Byleth shrugged. \"Claude has his own issues, but once he's learned some humility, I think he'll turn out just fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hilda, when I get out of this, I'm going to have you tied to a horse,\" Claude grunted as he ineffectually punched her big toe. \"Maybe a wyvern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude had no idea what was going on outside the boot. He heard what sounded like Leonie talking to Hilda, but their voices were too muffled by the thick leather wall for him to understand what they were saying. Things took a turn for the worse when Hilda actually started walking. His arms were strong enough from years of using a bow that he was able to hang onto her toes and not slip beneath her foot. As long as he could avoid slipping beneath her foot, his body would survive, even if his dignity was a lost cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that was the plan before Hilda started to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first warning sign was the inside of the boot growing hotter. \"Crap, she must be outside,\" Claude realized. Then, as Hilda's feet began to bake sockless in their boots in the harsh summer sun, sweat began to run down them, coating the shrunken archer in the saltiest, most disgusting waterfall imaginable. The rose-like scent Hilda took pride in was soon replaced with a more natural stink of foot sweat, and in short order, being in close proximity to her giant foot was every bit as disgusting as he'd initially feared it would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make things worse, the sweat was making him lose his grip. And whatever Hilda was up to, she was constantly in motion. Finally, his arms gave out and he slipped beneath Hilda's sweaty sole. Claude closed his eyes tightly and curled into a ball, fearing his arms or legs would be crushed under Hilda's weight if he continued to struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he could hope for at this point was for the giant pinkette to feel his shift in position and deign to release him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie frowned, occasionally checking to make sure Hilda was actually working as she did her own share of the work. In spite of being called out earlier, Hilda was still visibly favoring one of her feet over the other. Oddly, however, she wasn't complaining about it like Leonie would expect her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is she actually hurt?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf so, her sympathy for Hilda was limited. Her folks had taught her the story of the boy who cried wolf for a reason, after all. But if Hilda was, in fact, injured, someone needed to look at it before it got worse. Not only would she be a liability in battle otherwise, but for all of Hilda's faults, she was still Leonie's friend. Somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, she had been doing her half of the work diligently enough so far that they could afford a quick break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hilda...\"</span></div></div>",

I expected you to milk your injury for all it's worth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda shrugged, balancing on the one Claude-less foot. \"I thought I'd just grin and bear it before I went to see Professor Casagranda for help. It's nothing major.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Leonie stooped down to Hilda's feet. \"If it's nothing major, I'm sure I can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, really it's fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Leonie would leave it at that. However, a previous run in with Lorenz treating her injured foot left her wanting to pay it forward. That, and the feact that she should've taken Hilda's pain seriously in the first place weighted on her. She wasn't going to take no for an answer. Thankfully, she still had the handkerchief Lorenz gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, just let me,\" Leonie began, grabbing Hilda by the ankle and forcing Hilda to sit on the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, stop!\" the pinkette protested. \"I'm fine, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie didn't listen, starting to force off the knee high boot from her friend. It didn't take her long to realize that Hilda wasn't wearing any socks. \"Wait a second, those socks in the classroom. Hilda, gross!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to put them back on, but you wouldn't let me do it,\" Hilda protested, gripping the boot to keep it on. \"I blame you if my feet get blisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've just told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like people seeing my feet,\" HIlda excused, pulling her legs away. \"I'm self conscious about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I have stubby toes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie rolled her eyes, finally slipping the boot off Hilda's ankle.

Instead, she found a shrunken Claude plastered to Hilda's pink sole and gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey?\" he greeted, staring up at the wide eyes of his classmate. As cool of a demeanor he tried to keep at all the times. Now wasn't really the best time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the shock wore off, her confused expression firmed into one with furrowed eyebrows and lip curled. \"What in the Goddess' name is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda racked her brain, thinking of anything that would make it look like she wasn't torturing Claude. The only thing she could think of was her previous conversation with him just before the boots incident. She just hoped it was convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Leonie, you caught us,\" Hilda began, peeling the shrunken house leader off her sole and depositing him on her palm. She let out her most convincing fake sigh. \"Claude loves feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie's scowl only got deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? N-no I don't,\" he protested. \"She's lying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering Claude and Hilda were about the least earnest students in the school, Leonie didn't know who to believe. She was just far too confused to even process what what was going on. \"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's super, I mean suuuuuper embarrassed about it,\" Hilda continued. \"Why do you think he shrunk himself? It makes him easy to hide and keep secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your boots?\" the disgust clear in the redhead's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he loves it,\" Hilda dismissed with another wave. She quickly doubled down. \"Sometimes he'd spend the night in them and use my socks as a blanket. It's cute in its own weird way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie looked down to Claude, who seemed just upset. \"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" He protested. \"I screwed up by adding magic to my stomach flu poison. Hilda found me and turned me into her personal foot masseuse before you came in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when have you even opened a spell book?\" Hilda asked, throwing a wrench into the shrunken noble's truth. \"It's alright, Claude. Leonie won't judge, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still have no idea what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this?\" Hilda began, tripling down on her own lie. \"Claude can give one of his famous footrubs in exchange for keeping quiet about this whole kink thing. Trust me, Leonie, they're the absolute best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda clamped her hand around Claude to avoid his counterpoints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie, meanwhile, was still trying to decipher the truth from the two. Neither of their stories really added up, but from the expectant looks from both of her classmates, Leonie knew she had to pick her truth.</span></div></div>",

It seemed miles better than whatever was causing Hilda\u2019s smile to widen. He struggled against her fingertips. \u201cC\u2019mon this isn\u2019t funny. The others are gonna notice I\u2019m gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda ignored his protests, instead using her free hand to remove the top buttons from her shirt. \u201cI\u2019ll just say you went back home for Alliance Leader duties again. That\u2019ll buy me about a week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny house leader was a bit put off by how quickly she came up with that. It was even more unsettling to hear just how long she planned to keep him hidden. All he could do to fight back now was to keep struggling. However, her pillar-like fingers continued to manhandle him, slowly bringing him down to her exposed cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, Hilda! This is a bit forward, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He said, trying to keep his cool demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta keep you safe, Mr. House Leader,\u201d Hilda said with a wink before stuffing him in between her breasts. \"Don't wanna risk losing you during my well-earned nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrop the act, Hilda,\u201d Claude said, his head, comically poking out from her cleavage. \u201cYou have no intention of helping me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet, you,\u201d she shot back, pushing him down the gorge with the tip of her finger. With a tight smile on her lips, she buttoned her shirt and leaned back against her seat. \u201cI\u2019m trying to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is going to be great, she thought, her mind racing with all the things she could do with Claude once her nap was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hilda was getting into her nap, Claude clawed at the massive walls that threatened to entomb him. Unfortunately, it seemed that everything he did only made things worse. He was mashed between his friend\u2019s generous assets. While the two occasionally flirted, he never expected her to be this aggressive. All he could feel at the moment was the pain and the lingering scent of perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could have sworn that he was sinking deeper into the gorge. He was beginning to worry that he would be lost here forever. It wouldn\u2019t surprise him at all to see her forget about him entirely. Though, he wasn\u2019t particularly sure if it was any better than getting her full undivided attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the giant sloth\u2019s breaths began to slow down, signaling to the tiny noble that he was stuck here until Hilda woke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2026 is not as bad as I thought it\u2019d be,\u201d Claude remarked. \u201cSure it\u2019s stuffy, and reeks of perfume, but it could\u2019ve been worse. She could\u2019ve thrown me in her boot, or dropped me on the seat of her chair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuddered at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 actually kind of comfortable,\u201d he said unconvincingly. \u201cMaybe she\u2019d let me out if it looks like I\u2019m enjoying myself down here. Though, I don\u2019t want to give her the wrong idea. As hot as this situation sounds in theory, I don\u2019t want her thinking I\u2019m too into this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rested his head against the side of Hilda\u2019s left breast, figuring he could catch some sleep as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke back up\u2026</span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t recall his dorm bed being so soft and welcoming, and yet-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrewd boy\u2019s brain was back to firing on all cylinders as he realized his surreal predicament. The awful ache in his neck eschewed any need for pinching himself to see if he was still dreaming - he was back in reality, and that reality was being awkardly sandwiched between Hilda\u2019s breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of the Golden Deer considered his predicament. Any prior attempt to wriggle free had just forced him to sink further down into the depths of the cleavage, so another \u2018prison break\u2019 might just send him falling out entirely. Examining his surroundings (or what little he could, since only the barest amount of light was poking into the bra after Hilda had buttoned up her shirt) he noticed that there was the slightest sway of motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a sec... Hilda, are you awake?!\u201d Claude called out. Given that there was no response, he was either too small to hear or she was simply ignoring him. Either outcome seemed likely at this point. \u201cCome on, let me out! I don\u2019t want to smell like your girly perfume for the rest of my life!\u201d Claude idly kicked into the flesh around him to try and garner some attention, but once more, Hilda gave no reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a frustrated sigh, Claude crossed his arms and slumped back into whatever amounted to a comfortable posture in their very unique circumstances. At this size, he could faintly hear the rhythmic thumps of her heartbeat through the skin around him. Worried as he was about Hilda taking her newfound leverage too far or potentially forgetting him entirely, he had to admit that this would make for one hell of a tale... if he ever chose to share it, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Hey, Teach,\u2019\u201d Claude said to himself. \u201c\u2018Sorry I\u2019ve missed so many seminars, I\u2019ve been living in Hilda\u2019s bra for the past week.

No real spoilers.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude heard a lively yet muffled band in the distance, and it told him all he needed to know about where his giant captor was. There was the same band of musicians playing in the marketplace of the town just outside the monastery. The song playing reminded him of a time where he dragged a girl to dance to the tune in a burst of spontaneity. All he could do now was hope Hilda wouldn\u2019t do the same as that would most certainly beat him into a pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo she\u2019s out shopping,\u201d he said under his breath. \u201cNot surprised.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda floated around the stands, looking for anything cute that would catch her eye. She often did this to find supplies and materials for her handmade crafts and jewelry. However, she wasn\u2019t just browsing as she was looking for something specific. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recalled an earlier conversation she had with Raphael about what constituted a cute necklace for his little sister. While he insisted on something made of animal bones and wood, she had suggested placing a small flower into a crystal bottle and sealed with resin. Though, Raphael seemed to run off once she mentioned the type of flower that would be cute enough. Oh well, at least she could pick up a bottle for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the usual artisan hut, Hilda eyed the basket of bottles before plucking a bottle small enough to house a flower and fit comfortably on a necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she felt a tickle down her shirt. A stroke of genius hit her as she decided to instead grab two of the bottles. INstead of a pretty and rare flower, Claude would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying the merchant, she rushed down the path towards the monastery, excited to begin her next project. There was a slight bounce in her step, which  jostled around her shrunken friend between her breasts. She would let him out soon enough, but for now, she could enjoy the tickling sensation as Claude struggled between her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering her room, Hilda dropped down onto her chair and set her supplies onto the desk. Her chest bounced, and Claude\u2019s wiggles intensified, earning an amused giggle from the pink haired titan. She unbuttoned her shirt, finding his hand sticking out and grasping for freedom. She pinched the exposed limb and dragged him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny house leader gasped for air, clearly making a big show of it that Hilda really didn\u2019t appreciate. She dangled him by the cape, staring him straight in the eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic. I bet you enjoyed it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could\u2019ve died,\u201d he said, feigning concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a way to go, huh?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a ton of boys that would kill to switch places with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Claude could hit back with a snarky comment, Hilda began lowering him to the opening of the bottle. He caught on, fighting against her grip to no avail. He even tried to rip off his cape, yet it did nothing as Hilda\u2019s pillar like finger forced him into the opening. He barely fit as the giantess practically forced him in and nearly bruising his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait, Hilda, just what are you doing?\u201d He asked, banging his fist against the crystal wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d She asked, forcing a needle through a tiny cork. \u201cI\u2019m making you into the <i>cutest</i> li\u2019l necklace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept stabbing holes through the cork, making sure they were big enough to let air in. The last thing she wanted was for her adorable little accessory to suffocate while she was wearing it. That would not be cute. Once satisfied, she  grabbed a thin gold chain from her jewelry box and  slipped it through one of the holes in the side of the lid. Smiling, she pushed it down on top of the opening and sealed it tight, trapping Claude and cementing his new role as a piece of jewelry for the spoiled noble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda lifted the necklace and its brand new charm up to her face, blowing a kiss to its tiny captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Hilda, you can let me out,\u201d Claude said. \u201cThis stopped being funny a while ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis protests were ignored as she closed her hand around the bottle.</span></div></div>",

So far, it was living up to the name as the students from the Black Eagle and Blue Lion houses clashed. The Golden Deer were notably absent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta say, Teach,\u201d Claude began, pausing for a moment to watch Ingrid lunge at Ferdinand with a lance. \u201cThis scheme of ours is probably the best one yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenz scoffed. \u201cIt better be.

But it\u2019s gonna be a hell of a surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, over with the Black Eagles, Edelgard watched from her perch. \u201cHubert, doesn\u2019t it seem odd to you that Claude and Professor Byleth haven\u2019t entered the battle yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree,\u201d he said, squinting to get a better look at the group of Deer across the battlefield. \u201cThey are up to something. Shall we divert our troops?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d Edelgard said. \u201cWe should intercept them before they can execute whatever scheme they have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long before the rest of the Black Eagle squad began to focus their attention to cornering the Golden Deer, cutting through the field and rushing towards the group on the other side of the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Claude began, watching a small army of encroaching soldiers come closer. \u201cLooks like now\u2019s as good as time as any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d Byleth agreed.

Hilda stepped forward, surprisingly unarmed.

The pink haired giantess giggled as she looked at her tiny schoolmates scrambling away from her massive boots. She had to have been taller than the monastery\u2019s tallest towers, a fact that she relished as she raised her boot and brought it down, sending an earthquake and knocking over the grounded units.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is bad,\u201d Ignatz said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, Iggy,\u201d Claude reassured, clapping the thinner boy on the back. \u201cShe\u2019s on our side.

He was looking up her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\"<i>Really,</i> Sylvain?\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain's reply was a collection of barely coherent syllables. His nose then started bleeding. Rolling her eyes, Hilda stooped down to one knee and brought her thumb and middle finger down to the ground next to him. Piecing together what she was about to do, Sylvain snapped out of his perverted stupor and tried to run, but was too late as Hilda flicked her finger, sending the perverted knight in training hurtling through the air towards the Blue Lions home base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the plus side, Hilda could now probably get Sylvain to do her chores for her for the rest of the year. Once he got out of the infirmary, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the hills surrounding the Black Eagles' base, Bernadetta had the sights of her ballista trained on Hilda, and was trembling with significantly more fear than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bernadetta, she's in range!\" Edelgard yelled from the nearby fortress. \"Take the shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but one shot won't take her down!\" Bernadetta tried to argue. \"It... it'll take time to load another arrow, and by the time I do she'll be over here! And she'll be mad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Edelgard GAVE you an ORDER!\" Hubert growled menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pitiful, terrified squeak, Bernadetta closed her eyes tightly and took the shot. The arrow sailed through the air before embedding itself into Hilda's rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\"OW!\"</b></font> Hilda flinched. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\"What was that?!\"</b></font> She looked around before finding the splinter sized arrow sticking out of her skirt and pulling it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\"That was my nicest skirt! Who did this?!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda's eyes scanned the battlefield before noticing a lone ballista in Black Eagles territory. Squinting, she recognized the frail, purple haired girl from Black Eagle House that almost never left her room. Bern... something. Smiling, she slowly stalked towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"Aw... a ballista... isn't that cute...\"</font></b> she cooed, before her face broke into a wide grin and she raised her foot ominously over it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\"...BUT IT'S WRONG!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadetta shrieked and abandoned the ballista seconds before Hilda's boot came crashing down on it, instantly reducing it to scrap and creating a shockwave that sent the poor archer half-running, half-tumbling down the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EDELGARDI'MRETREATINGPLEASEDON'THATEMEBYE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cowardice,\" Hubert muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was right about not taking the shot,\" Edelgard looked towards Bernadetta's retreating form with concern before turning to glare at Hubert. \"We should have listened to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we are to survive what is to come, the loyalty of your subjects must be absolute, Lady Edelgard,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I know...\" Edelgard looked away with a frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth then shook violently as Hilda sat down on a nearby hill, cheerfully humming to herself as she began to pick ballista parts out of the treads of her boot and deliberately flick them towards Edelgard's fortress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you figured out what spell the Golden Deer used on her?\" Edelgard asked her chief mage and adviser. \"Any chance of reverse engineering it? It may be the only way we can salvage this battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be able to replicate it soon,\" Hubert nodded before frowning at something in the distance. \"The Blue Lions are approaching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they are...\" Edelgard muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move in, fellow Lions!\" Dimitri ordered. \"We shall take the Black Eagles' fort while they are distracted and carry the day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a stupid idea, Dimitri,\" Felix growled. \"We should be more worried about THAT.\" He gestured towards Hilda, who had finished cleaning her boot and was about to resume her rampage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let Edelgard be taken in by the Golden Deer's trickery and illusions,\" Dimitri scoffed. \"While they are distracted, we will descend on them both!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Illusion?!\" Felix slapped his forehead in frustration. \"Sylvain seemed pretty sure it was real. The Black Eagles' archer DEFINITELY thought it was real. Illusions don't destroy ballistas, Dimitri!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylvain's judgment is always clouded by members of the fairer sex,\" Dimitri reminded his rebellious classmate. \"And from what I hear, that archer is afraid of her own shadow. Enough talk! CHARGE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix rolled his eyes as the rest of the Blue Lions heedlessly followed Dimitri into the fray. \"Idiots...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Claude grinned as he watched Hilda lay waste to the battlefield. \"This is going even better than I thought!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised the other two houses aren't teaming up to stop her,\" Lysithea mused from her spot under a shady tree, laying against it to relax as she recovered from the intense magic she performed earlier. \"I mean, it wouldn't have helped, but I at least expected them to make the attempt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left a few anonymous notes on the bulletin boards around the monastery,\" Claude winked to the mage. \"Petty house insults attributed to the other one. Stoked some rivalries so there was no way Edelgard and Dimitri would cooperate. It's all in good fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claude, I can't know about that,\" Byleth warned sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Teach!\" Claude waved his hand apologetically. \"Just speaking metaphorically! You heard nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a moment,\" Lorenz frowned. \"How is Claude's subterfuge not allowed, and yet this...\" he gestured in the distance towards Hilda as she started rooting through the Black Eagles fortress like a dollhouse in order to grab Edelgard. \"Is perfectly acceptable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a completely valid exercise of Lysithea's magical abilities,\" Byleth explained. \"One she's getting extra credit for, incidentally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea grinned contentedly as she continued to watch the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... professor?\" a timid voice spoke up. Byleth turned and smiled gently to their newest recruit, who the Golden Deer had heroically saved from heretics the past month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Flayn? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My brother is flying towards us,\" Flayn pointed in the distance. \"And he does not look happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth followed Flayn's finger. True to her words, Seteth was approaching them on his wyvern, and his scowl was more pronounced than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor, what IS this?!\" Seteth demanded. \"Lady Rhea is most upset! This unnatural display is not in keeping with the spirit of the Battle of Eagle and Lion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, seeing as we're neither Eagles nor Lions, I don't see the problem,\" Byleth noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Seteth narrowed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This academy has three houses, Seteth,\" Byleth reminded him. \"Whenever we have these events, the Golden Deer House feels like an afterthought. What's next? Are you going to forget to paint Claude in the house leader portrait and haphazardly put him in upside down at the last minute? My class is constantly feeling marginalized, and as their professor, I have to advocate for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B...be that as it may, this is still unacceptable! The Golden Deer are hereby disqualified!\" This was met with an uproar, as even the students who weren't on board with Hilda being a giantess protested their house's disqualification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Byleth sighed as he walked towards the giant warhorn he and Claude had set up on top of their fort the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Hilda,\"</b> Byleth spoke through it. <b>\"It's over. We're disqualified. Come on back.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, Hilda ignored him and chased the fleeing Blue Lion army, with Edelgard struggling in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Hilda? HILDA!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\"Can't talk, professor! Busy having fun!\"</b></font> Hilda called back distractedly as she reached into the crowd and snatched Dimitri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp,\" Byleth backed off from the war horn. \"She's gone mad with power. I warned you, Claude. That's stable cleaning duty for a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Hilda,\" Claude muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you expected her to go mad with power,\" Seteth growled, \"then why did you approve this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Learning experience,\" Byleth shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Hilda had Dimitri and Edelgard in each hand, and was now roughly mashing their faces together as the pair screamed in terror and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\"NOW KIIIIIISSSSSSSS!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will discuss this later,\" Seteth threatened Byleth as he took back to the skies in his wyvern, planning to summon the knights.</span></div></div>",

All members of the Golden Deer tuned their heads to see none other than the blonde form of ingrid running towards them. She seemed to mirror Seteth as both had an angry scowl adorning their face. \"Do you mind explaining what this is all about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An experiment gone horribly wrong.\" Ignatz answered blandly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aint that the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how do we stop them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to whittle down their battle auras.\" Lysithea stated. \"We need one more giant who won't become consumed by power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Seteth shouted. \"You want to make more giants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone ignored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need someone strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone with pure heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone who can whip two asses at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone blonde.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll paused for a moment before gazing back at Ingrid.

Lysithea's the biggest of them all. \"You'll do.\"<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the battlefield both Petra and Hilda where huffing and puffing. Neither would give up this fight. \"You're going down bumpkin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be going down first princess.\" Petra shot back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before the two could come to blows again, another bright light struck the battlefield. Both giants clamped their eyes shut until the light faded. When it did they were greeted to a new challenger to the battlefield.

Let me do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flayn\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greenette tightened her grip. \"I know you're scared. I'm scared too. But... I have to do this, I'm the only one who can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeteth looked into Flayn's eyes, then back to the giants, and back to Flayn again. It was clear as day he was only delaying the inevitable. With a tired sigh he relented. He knew one day she would have to go into battle and stand on her own. He just never thought it would be today. \"Do you think you can best them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" She said. \"I have no choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She will win.\" Byleth added. \"Because today she doesn't fight alone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I'm going with her, Seteth. And so are you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's eyes widened. \"Are we to become giants as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not possible.\" answered Lysithea. \"But you will be her support. So stand back and get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth did as they were told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're ready Flayn. There may be some momentary discomfort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlayn nodded and embraced the magic.<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard surveyed the remainder of the battlefield while Petra cheered for their supposed victory over the Blue Lions and Golden Deer. She couldn't deny that victory tasted sweet, even if the battle didn't go as expected. Honestly, this was a mock battle that the officer academy would never forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to call out to her fellow classmate until she felt a bizarre feeling on her abdomen. It happened repeatedly like someone was poking her. Turning to the side to see who the culprit was, she was shocked to see another giant had entered the fray. It wasn't just any giant either. She was slightly shorter but Edelgard knew that long and green hair anywhere. It was Flayn. She wasn't alone either as on each shoulder was none other than her annoyed brother, Seteth and an amused Byleth. Had Edelgard not been so stunned she would've found the sight amusing herself. It was like Flayn had a little angel and devil on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edelgard.\" Flayn addressed sternly, startling the Black Eagle leader. \"It's time for you and Petra to lay down your arms and surrender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't know the girl well, but from the few interactions she'd had with her the greenette struck her as the soft and gentle type. So hearing her speak with such authority in her voice gave her pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, this was the battle of Eagle and Lion and Flayn was a member of the Golden Deer house. That made her an enemy in the eyes of the Black Eagle house. Was she trying to make her and Petra surrender, to snatch victory away from them. Unacceptable! They'd gone through hell to attain victory and there was no way she'd allow the Golden Deer to take it from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, Flayn. But we'll not surrender out victory to the Golden Deer after what we've been through.\" Edelgard stated. Her statement didn't go unnoticed as a both surprised and confused Petra made her way over to the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the going on-- er, what is going on?\" Petra asked/corrected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem the Golden Deer are out to take our victory. A ploy by Claude and the Professor no doubt.\" The imperial Princess explained with narrowed eyes. Petra seemed to soak in her leader's words and soon mirrored her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlayn was surprised by the two's conclusion and hastily tried to explain the situation. \"This is no ploy. The battle of Eagle and Lion is over. The Blue Lion's were defeated the moment Ingrid went down and before that the Golden Deer had already been disqualified by my brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two didn't look convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true!\" Byleth added, finally joining the conversation. \"Seteth disqualified us as soon as we unleashed Hilda on the battlefield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Rhea was most upset by the turn of events. The battle of Eagle and Lion is a tradition of the Officer's Academy and all of you brought shame upon it by making a circus out of it!\" said the normal sized greenette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was again Flayn's turn to speak. \"This is why the other Golden Deer sent me here to confront you both. If you don't calm down and let Lysithea undo this spell, then Lady Rhea will take immediate action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that the archbishop would get involved if they didn't end this gave the two giants pause. Flayn was giving them this information as well as the Professor and Seteth. Their fellow giantess must be telling the truth, but at the same time. This was still the Golden Deer house being led by a master schemer. How could they be sure Claude didn't put them up to this? Flayn and Byleth were the enemy and there was no question Seteth would side with them if Flayn was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end. The two giants couldn't trust their words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. But we are not believing you.\" Petra scowled, her pupils glowing a bright crimson. \"You are wanting to take our victory away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right.\" Edelgard agreed as her eyes also began to glow very much the same. \"You merely want to take the prestige of this great victory back to the Golden Deer house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlayn began to back away slowly as her resolve wavered. Something clearly wasn't right here. \"Brother? Professor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay calm Flayn. We've got your back.\" Byleth assured. \"Seteth. Get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeteth nodded. \"Understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone minus Petra drew their weapons. It would seem a battle was inevitable.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seteth was furious at the sudden turn of events at the Battle of Eagle and Lion. This was supposed to be a traditional  battle of honor and respect and instead the Golden Deer house had to go and make a circus out of it. To think Professor Byleth would actually approve the use of a student as tactical weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was worse was said student had let the power go to her head and was now using the other two house leaders as dolls. Shockingly enough it would seem that the professor knew something like this would happen and did nothing. He merely chalked it up as learning experience for Claude. Seteth never felt more justified in his disqualification of the Golden Deer house. Now all that was left to do was summon the knights to clean up this mess before Lady Rhea's patience reached it's end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeteth landed his wyvern on a nearby hill not to far from the battle before reaching into his robe. There he pulled out what seemed to be a mini war horn. He took a deep breath and blew into it. It wasn't the loudest sound, especially with all the chaos going on on the battlefield, but it would do the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough the knights that were on standby raced to his position. There before him stood Jeralt, the father of professor Byleth, Lady Rhea's most faithful follower, Catherine, Alois, Gilbert, and the mercenary turned knight herself, Shamir. All present were on standby for the battle in case things went awry but honestly who could have prepared them for something like this? It wasn't as if they felled giants for a living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a second to calm his nerves, Seteth addressed his team. \"I trust you know why I have summoned you all here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hilda's out of control.\" Jeralt answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green haired man nodded. \"That is correct. Our mission is to take her down by order of Lady Rhea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't want us to kill the girl does she?\" Gilbert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. She's a student here same as the rest. This behavior must be a side effect of the spell.\" Alois cut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, perhaps not. It doesn't change out orders from Lady Rhea. If she wants us to fell a giant then we'll a giant.\"  Cathrine said confidently. Though there was still worry in her eyes as she watched the giant pinkette play house with the Black Eagle fort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easier said than done.\" Shamir scoffed. \"Have any of us ever faced down a titan before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was telling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamir sighed. \"Alright. Who's leading this operation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeralt has the most combat experience here so it only makes sense he take charge.\" Seteth explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder knight nodded. \"Very well. I might have an idea in mind but it's quite risky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No risk is to great. Just tell us what we have to do.\" said Catherine <br>\r\n_ _ _<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the battlefield Hilda was now using the Black Eagle's fort as a children's playhouse. Each and every member tried their best to avoid her massive hands reaching in to scoop them out. Bernadetta being the most successful at being elusive. \"Oh come on guys stop struggling. Don't you wanna play with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we make it out of this alive, I'm going to kill Claude and the professor.\" Hubert fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in line because I have a bone to pick with them too.\" Dorothea argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if my hands are getting on them first.\" Petra added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to go to my room!\" Bernadetta panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the giant hand retracted, confusing the members of the Black Eagle house. The sounds of multiple footfalls and curses filled the air as they dared look outside. Much to their surprise they saw Seteth buzzing around her enormous face like a gnat. Had the situation not been so terrifying they'd find the scene quite funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it. What are you doing?!\" Hilda complained as she used her free hand to try and swat the annoying wyvern rider. Her other hand contained both Dimitri and Edelgard who were both silently praying for a rescue soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile on the ground the rest of the knights prepared to put the rest of captain Jeralt's plan into action. \"Are you all ready?\" The captain asked. The ground force nodded. \"Alright then! Let's move out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground force of knights ran out from behind Hilda with an extremely large rope. \"Remember then plan. While she's distracted wrap the rope around her ankles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the knights began their plan to fell the giantess known as Hilda. While Seteth distracted her like the most annoying bug he could possibly be, she never even realized the situation down by her feet. Within a matter of minutes the knights had her ankles wrapped and the giant's lower movements had ceased. By the time Hilda understood what was going on it was far too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown she went. Taking her two captives with her. The knight all rushed away as fast as they could as Hilda's body collided with the earth. The shockwave was massive, sending dirt and debris in every direction. The knights themselves could do nothing as the dust cloud created by their little stunt swept them away.<br>\r\n_ _ _<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! The Knights of Seiros just toppled Hilda!\" Claude exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible!\" Ignatz gawked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. I don't believe it.\" Lysithea said in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Leave it to the captain to pull off an incredible maneuver like that!\" Leonie cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope Dimitri and Edelgard weren't hurt in the fall.\" Flayn worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat silenced the Golden Deer house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not good.\" Byleth said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's not good professor?\" Claude asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a good look at that dust cloud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golden Deer did as instructed and saw that something was rising from within the dust cloud. It was BIG! SCARY! AND PINK! It was Hilda looking no worse for wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. That's definitely not good.\" Claude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnatz looked between the three remaining members of the Golden Deer who put this plan into motion. \"What kind of spell did you three whip up?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude laughed nervously. \"A really bad one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No spoilers.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWraaaagh!\u201d Raphael bellowed as he tossed a pile of horse saddles into an unruly heap next to the other supplies. Relieved of his load he took a deep breath and stretched, reaching his arms above his head. A small amount of perspiration dripped from his head, the only sign of strain from wielding such a heavy load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside him, a lone knight clumsily let another saddle drop to the ground. She panted heavily, exhausted from lugging around equipment for the past hours. Raphael approached the woman with a warm smile. \u201cYou know, you\u2019d probably be less tired if you didn\u2019t wear all that heavy armor. It\u2019s just weighing you down.\u201d He gave her a hearty pat on the back, encouraging the knight to stand up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven without this armor on, I would still be exhausted.\u201d She groaned, short of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, guess you have been working for a couple hours. That was a lot of stuff to move for one knight.\u201d Raphael mused, scratching his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it would have been a few more if you hadn\u2019t helped Raphael. Your muscles truly are good for tasks such as these.\u201d The knight praised, before looking at Raphael\u2019s work. Raphael had been a big help, bringing a lot of the supplies to the stables, but his organization skills left\u2026 much to be desired. The knight sighed wearily, she still had a lot of organizing to do before she could report her duties as finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaphael, oblivious to the knights worries, laughed heartily. \u201cYeah, my muscles can be pretty handy.\u201d He boasted, while flexing his bicep, straining his already tight clothes. \u201dWhen I saw how much stuff you had to haul I just knew I had to lend a hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring it was time for a break, the knight nodded and gave Raphael an appreciative pat on the back. \u201cThank you again for your help, I hope I didn\u2019t take too much time away from your work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m happy to help anytime!\u201d Raphael waved as the knight left. He was always happy to help however he could. He had just gotten back from the marketplace outside of the monastery. As usual, he had picked up a lot of extra stuff around town. And even though he was hungry, he made certain not to eat any of the food he was sent for; didn\u2019t want Claude to scold him again for the same mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his shoulders, he returned to where he had left the supplies he\u2019d picked up from town. There was all manners of food there, along with some books, weapons, and some training weights a merchant had been selling. \u201cKind of that knight to bring the stuff here for me. I would\u2019ve hated having to go all the way back to the gate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiligently, Raphael gather all of the items into a stack that he could carry. For most people the amount of stuff he had would be too great for one trip, but he knew he could handle it. As her gathered the last of the things, he looked up at a high shelf and realized something. \u201cOh, almost forgot those!\u201d Setting down what he had, he moved over to the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn its surface was a box filled with an assortment of bottles filled with various liquids. This was the most interesting item that Raphael had picked up on his trip. He got them from a strange looking but friendly merchant that most people were ignoring. He had a lot of interesting looking stuff, including things like boar tusks, which Raphael also purchased off him. It was at the merchant\u2019s recommendation that Raphael got the bottles. He talked about how they had all sorts of cool magical properties in them. He figured that Lysithea or some other mage in the monastery might want to take a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised the knight was able to get these up here.\u201d Raphael said as he got on his tiptoes to grab the box. The shelf was really high off the ground, even he had problems reaching what he wanted! Grunting, he stretched as far as he could to wrap his hands around the small box. As one would expect Raphael lost his balance and ended up falling forward into the shelf! With a mighty crash, the shelf gave away under his massive frame and he tumbled to the ground. Unfortunately, the bottles were also a casualty of the accident; there contents spilling all over the massive blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSprawled out on the floor and soaking wet, Raphael groaned uncomfortably. \u201cAw, I ruined those bottles. I bet someone would\u2019ve really liked \u2018em.\u201d He pushed a hand through his hair feeling how wet it was. He quietly wondered to himself if any of those bottles might have had poison in them. He knew Claude made that kind of stuff, so someone else could have too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelp, no use worrying about it. I bet professor Manuela could cure anything like that.\u201d He said getting to his feet. \u201cI should get back to\u2026\u201d Raphael\u2019s  train of thought was interrupted when he saw his surroundings. Everything was gigantic now! The pile of supplies he had created was like a gigantic mountain in the distance, larger than even the monastery! Scattered all around him was the remains of the bottles he had broken, puddles of their content on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I can\u2019t believe it!\u201d Raphael shouted, astounded. \u201cThose potions were crazy powerful, I can\u2019t believe I broke them like that!\u201d He lamented. Only after he got over the wastefulness of his accident did he realize he had bigger issues to deal with, literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this isn\u2019t good. I can\u2019t get anything done at this size. I gotta find help! But uh, I can\u2019t exactly leave. The stables are far away from pretty much everywhere. Maybe I can wait for a knight to get back and get their attention\u2026\u201d Raphael brought his hand to his chin, considering his options. Staying would be the safest bet, but that could take a while. He could try to make it to a more crowded area, but that was pretty dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaphael\u2019s musing was interrupted by a knock on the door. From his spot on the floor, Raphael could see a shadow cast across the floor. \u201cHuh, that\u2019s lucky.\u201d He thought optimistically. \u201cI can get help from whoever\u2019s coming in here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the doors swung open to reveal Raphael\u2019s potential savior. It was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The one who entered the room was none other than Marianne, one of Raphael\u2019s fellow students from the Golden Deer house. Raphael was relieved to see someone he knew, especially someone as gentle as Marianne. He always thought she was too quiet and didn\u2019t open up to people, though she had a fondness for animals. She could even communicate with them! Raphael had yet to figure out how to do that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 hello?\u201d  The giant girl quietly called. The usually quiet girl\u2019s voice was amplified for the tiny Raphael, though it was still quieter than what he thought a giant would sound like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess Marianne isn\u2019t a \u2018fee fi fo fum\u2019 kind of gal.\u201d Raphael quipped, keeping a positive attitude in spite of his dangerous situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne, meanwhile, was very confused. She had just been visiting Dorte when she heard a crashing noise in one of the other buildings. She had expected to find someone inside but there was no one here. Nervously, she held her hands against her chest and moved past the door into the room. Surely there had to be someone here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Raphael, just gotta get Marianne\u2019s attention and you\u2019ll be set. ...But how should I do that?\u201d Raphael looked at the materials around him. He couldn\u2019t really use anything to get Marianne\u2019s attention. Nothing but broken glass or liquid near him. \u201cMaybe if I just stay here and shout she\u2019ll be able to hear.\u201d Raphael\u2019s decided on the simplest conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Marianne had gotten a good look at the stack of supplies that Raphael had made. \u201cThis looks like the stuff students have to pick up from the market in town. I wonder why it\u2019s in the stable?\u201d She wasn\u2019t chosen for this task very often, but she guessed that it didn\u2019t require stopping at the stables. \u201cThis is a big stack too\u2026\u201d She trailed off as she wiped a hand on top of a box. She rubbed her fingers together, checking for signs of dust or neglect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw man. I hope she doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m slackin\u2019.\u201d Raphael thought. \u201cHey Marianne! Look over here!\u201d He shouted as loudly as he could. He knew he was pretty loud, plenty of folks told him that all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Raphael, even his shouting couldn\u2019t reach Marianne when she was that far away. She was too occupied with her investigation to hear. Anxiously, she circled the pile to look for the source of the crash she heard. As she circled around, she noticed the broken shelf and shattered bottles of liquid. \u201cOh, is this it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaphael\u2019s heart began racing when Marianne looked in his direction. He was used to looking down at people when he was normal. So seeing Marianne loom over him in the distance was incredibly nerve wracking. The anxious feeling was only made worse once she started approaching him. The sight of the gentle Marianne become larger and larger, accompanied by the bombing of her footsteps, made Raphael break into a cold sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne looked over the mess Raphael carefully, checking her boot when she realized she stepped in some kind of liquid. She guessed that this was what had caused that noise, maybe it had fallen from the top of the pile? That idea was quickly removed from her mind when she noticed the partially collapsed shelf, currently hanging by one of its hinges. \u201cThat\u2019s strange\u2026 I\u2019m sure that wouldn\u2019t just collapse. Perhaps whoever broke it ran off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne turned to look towards the door once again. She hadn\u2019t seen anyone leave in a hurry, but someone breaking the shelf made the most sense. Worried that she was going to leave him behind, Raphael began shouting again and waved up at the giant girl. \u201cMarianne! Look down here! By the mess!\u201d Whether it was Raphael\u2019s shouting or something else, Marianne turned herself back to the mess. Carefully, she got onto her knees and looked at the mess, picking up a shard of glass and looking it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese were obviously some kind of concoction, but what did they do? I hope they\u2019re nothing like what Claude makes.\u201d She mumbled the last part, nervous about anyone hearing her say something unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019d dare say they\u2019re worse.\u201d Raphael grumbled, wiping at his head. Eager to be seen, he continued to shout and gesture to Marianne as she examined his mess. Surely she would be able to see him when she was this close. He might of shrunk, but he knew he wasn\u2019t that hard to see\u2026 probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne looked over the mess with casual interest, she had no idea that the well being of one of her classmates was dependent on her careful eyes...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mild content warning for violence.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude was no stranger to violence. Their months at the Monastery thus far had given them valuable battlefield experience, and coupled with their cool composure, the future leader to the Alliance was convinced that there was little out there that could faze them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemire Village had proven him wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of smoking wood and charred flesh was impossible to ignore as Claude dashed through the village alongside their stalwart professor. He\u2019d never show the discomfort and disgust, of course - a leader\u2019s gotta keep it together no matter what, right? - but he could tell that this scene would be playing back in his sleep for a long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth, ever the stoic, showed no sign of slowing down as they led the charge, barely regarding the burning buildings or the corpses that decorated their hellish landscape. As two assailants emerged from behind cover to try and pick off Byleth and Claude with throwing daggers, Byleth whisked their relic sword like a whip and cut the men down without a hint of emotion on their face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn, Teach. I guess that\u2019s why they call you the Ashen Demon, huh...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you see anyone?\u201d Byleth announced, shaking the sword once with their strong arm to shed some of the blood before retracting its whip-like form back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t say I have yet,\u201d Claude said, keeping pace while picking off a third assassin hiding behind a nearby barrel with a well-aimed shot from his bow. \u201cUnless you count the bad guys, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult to keep the levity in such a grim situation. Aside from the horror of the village going up in smoke as half of its citizens seemed consumed by some strange bloodlust, the Golden Deer had gotten separated amidst the chaos. Byleth jarred themselves to the side as they spotted another group of villagers under attack. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Claude. They\u2019ll be okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Teach. This is a cakewalk after what you\u2019ve trained us through, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude readied his bow, the string dug deep into his fingers. Everyone in their house could hold their own in a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for maybe one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne stumbled through the blood-soaked mud, her uniform caked and torn amidst the attackers that she had evaded thus far. She had managed to slip away from the maddened villagers with their sickles and pitchforks, but she could feel the exhaustion setting in. Her talent in healing injuries didn\u2019t extent to herself. Self-care had never been her strong suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage had gotten separated early on when one of the houses nearby fell to pieces, the stonework barring her intended path to keep formation with Raphael. Her cries for aid had been drowned out amidst the licking of flames and the clashing of iron. Now, she was alone on the battlefield, with no idea where Claude or Byleth or anyone else might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blast of dark magic erupted from around the corner of a nearby stable. Marianne shrieked and threw herself to the side behind an overturned cart. She couldn\u2019t even tell if that had been aimed for her. It was such a chaotic situation that she could barely tell where she was or where to go. Where was the professor when she needed him...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne heard the whinnying of horses from afar, only for it to be cut short by the telltale sound of lances skewering through meat. She felt her blood run cold, the fear threatening to overtake her entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, somewhere deep in her bones, something was snapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No!\u201d Marianne cried out, her worst fear now coming to life. There was all manner of dark legend about what the Crest of the Beast could do, and she had spent so long keeping it buried as deep as possible, but the smell of hot blood and the sight of frayed meat around her was enticing it like bait. \u201cI-I won\u2019t...!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rumble of thunder echoed across the distance. A scream died out with a gurgle. No matter where she turned, Marianne saw death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid her throat always feel so dry? Was the sound of her heartbeat always so deafening? Was there blood seeping in her gums or was it simply her imagination? The girl doubled over, wincing as pain bellowed from inside her every pore. She dug her hands into her ribs, trying to contain whatever was threatening to burst out from her frail cage of skin and bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter her conviction, it was no match for the Crest of the Beast. Marianne fell to her knees, her breath thin and ragged as if she were being choked by an invisible force. A guttural noise - somewhere between the wheezing of a broken throat and the snarl of a feral animal - escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne disappeared as her eyes went as blank and white as snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude clambered atop a tree that had miraculously remained untouched by the fires thus far (although he didn\u2019t intend to stay up for any longer than he needed to.) He squinted as he scanned the roads around him, trying to spot anyone in a familiar yellow uniform to assist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few houses away, there was a flash of steel as Lorenz fought back against a robe-clad madman, the lance deflecting their attack with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot my first choice, but now\u2019s not the time to be picky...\u201d Claude muttered to himself, before turning his head down to inform the awaiting professor of his discovery. \u201cHey, Teach, I spotted Lorenz. He\u2019s over by-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole village seemed to shake as something erupted in the distance. Byleth staggered and leaned against the tree for support while Claude had to swiftly wrap his hands around the nearest branch for fear of falling straight down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What was that? An explosion? What could cause an explosion like that-?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bestial roar followed, deep and feral. Claude turned his head back, staring out towards the edge of the village. The blanket of gray clouds in the sky and the vista of trees lining around the village border shielded the area from light, but the fires below were just enough illumination to show the source of the bloodcurdling noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA looming figure, towering high above the fragile buildings below, bellowed with rage. The creature looked vaguely humanoid, yet from what details he could make out from the distance,  it definitely reminded Claude of the Black Beast that Miklan had transformed into. It also reminded him of something else, yet he couldn\u2019t <i>quite</i> place it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe savage giant advanced. The Beast was free.</span></div></div>",

Also, heavy violence warning.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude studied the monster in the distance. Its form was obscured mostly by the heavy smoke rising into the air. He couldn\u2019t help but approach, his unquenchable thirst for knowledge beating out the natural instincts to stay away and stay alive. However, as he passed crow of wrecked buildings blocking his view, he caught onto a metal  he could hardly believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster was wearing a torn Officer\u2019s Academy uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d He rushed forward, shooting warning shots at deranged villagers that charged at him. Once struck a guy in the thigh and sent him collapsing onto a pile of rubble. He rounded corners and even cut through some trees until he was at the base of the monsters feet and got a good look at the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat told him all he needed to know about the identity of the monster was the sheer amount of light blue hair everywhere. There was only one person in the academy with hair like that, but he was having rouble comprehending just what caused this to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Marianne!?\u201d He gasped, keeping his bow at the ready. \u201cOh, Goddess, what did Tomas do to you? I should\u2019ve kept an eye on\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself staring at the beast-like features. Her nails had grown long and turned black, resembling claws more than they did fingernails. Her teeth had also elongated, her canines much more pronounced. Her eyes now had anger in them rather than the tired, defeated look. Her ears were pointed and her hair, normally kept up and out of the way, rolled down her back, much longer than it should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is the same sweet Marianne you know,</i> Claude reminded himself. Just as he finished, Marianne swept up an encroaching Flame Emperor Soldier and brought him to her mouth, mercilessly sinking her teeth into his chest and tearing him in half as she shook her neck like a feral animal. The cracking of bones snapping and flesh tearing ingrained itself into the house leader's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude wretched at the sight as Marianne casually tossed the remaining half of the body aside. It hit the roof of a building with a vivid splat. He was just glad wasn\u2019t an innocent. However, he knew that his perception of Marianne would change after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the giantess\u2019 eyes stared back at him. Claude began to back away, pulling at the drawstring of his bow. She stepped closer, her footfalls shaking the ground at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy, Marianne,\u201d Claude said, still backing away. \u201cI\u2019m a friend. I don\u2019t want to hurt you. I just want to help.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long before he backed into what was the last undamaged building in Remire. He slowly took aim, waiting ro the precise moment she was close enough. He didn\u2019t want to hit anything vital, but he needed to stun her just long enough to make an escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let an arrow loose sending it into the giantess\u2019 cheek. She let out a pained roar, sending a combination of spit and blood flying everywhere. She lifted her foot high into the air and over the archer. Claude managed to duck out of the way and into the cover of the trees moments before the massive boot crashed into the building, reducing it to rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She turned her attention towards him again, beginning another march. Another pained roar escaped her lips as collapsed to the ground, nearly pinning him under her body. Half of the patch of forest he was in was taken down beneath her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe telltale sound of a chain went through the air as the Sword of the Creator whipped back into place. The expression on the mercenary turned professor\u2019s face remained stoic, despite having to do battle with one of their students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Does anything rattle Teach?</i> Claude thought, getting up and rushing to the professor\u2019s side.</span></div></div>",

It was a late night, a few days after the battle of the Eagle and the Lion. Even Lysithea had a small smile on her lips thinking about how proud Claude was after the Golden Deer had won the battle. \u201cI wonder if they\u2019ll keep calling this \u2018The Battle of the Eagle and Lion\u2019. We trounced the other Houses so badly I believe a new name is in order. Let\u2019s call it \u2018The Effortless Victory of the Deer\u2019.\u201d That Claude was quite a character, but Lysithea could not argue against his well earned pride after the battle. She herself had done quite-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Creeeeeak*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea cringed involuntarily, startled by yet another creak in the night. She growled in frustration, she simply had to get over her fears. She had just been part of a big mock battle with plenty of talented students, one that people were still resting from, and she hardly flinched at all. But one creak in a dark library in the middle of night put her on edge; ridiculous! All because of a fear of ghosts she knew she should\u2019ve outgrown by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I should be better than this.\u201d She grumbled to herself, continuing to look through the books on the library shelf. The library was rather creepy in its current state. It was rather late at night, so late that even Annette of the Blue Lions, who\u2019d work so long in the library she\u2019d fall asleep, was gone! It certainly didn\u2019t help that Tomas, the man who would usually be managing the library, even at this time of night, had disappeared for quite a while now. So Lysithea was completely alone in a dark library in the middle of the night, well past the bedtime some of the Golden Deer joked with her about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI simply have to put this ridiculous fear of mine to rest, it\u2019s holding me back more than it should.\u201d She said, greatly exaggerating how much effect it had on her. She couldn\u2019t help but be hard on herself at the moment, the creepy atmosphere would feed the fears of anyone with her kind of phobia. This was the only time of day where she could safely accomplish what she wanted to. Well, safely was exaggerating, least embarrassing time was more accurate. Some of her housemates already knew about her fear, but letting them see her looking for a solution meant she would acknowledge it in front of them. For now, Lysithea would rather ineffectually deny she had any such fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of searching, and a few more startling creaks, Lysithea finally found something that could help her. In one of the more hidden corners of the library, she found a book dedicated to spirits and methods to ward them off. To Lysithea\u2019s dismay, this book was the only one of its kind, nothing else in the library even discussed the idea of ghosts. \u201cI guess this will have to do.\u201d Lysithea whispered as she began flipping through the book. She knew that what she was looking for was likely at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer intuitions were proven right as there was a spell at the end of the book that was perfectly suited for helping her put her fears to rest. \u201cFinally! A spell that will help me ward off all those creepy ghosts.\u201d Lysithea daintily folded the corner of the page she was on and held it against her chest. She\u2019d usually have a bookmark, but she didn\u2019t want to bother with it on this night. \u201cOnce I cast this, I\u2019ll be able to forget all about ghosts and never be afraid of them again.\u201d Lysithea let out a frightened squeal when another creak echoed in the library, as if the ghosts were calling her bluff. \u201cT-time for bed!\u201d The white haired girl croaked, setting her now extinguished candle on a nearby table. It was so dark now that she had simply decided to use a single cast of her Fire spell to light the world around her instead of a candle. It certainly wasn\u2019t so she could defend herself from any ghosts wanting to steal the book from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the trip felt like an eternity, Lysithea was able to make it back to her room unharmed by any ghosts. The worst part was getting into her room; she had moved so quickly to open and close the door that she improperly canceled her Fire spell, burning her hand a bit. The young girl was so anxious that she didn\u2019t even bother to get out of her uniform, instead diving under the covers of her bed, apparently a safe haven from ghosts. Eagerly, she opened up the book back to where she left off, making sure to undo the fold she had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes quickly scanned across the page, only confirming the details she considered the most important. The spell would indeed ward off any spirits and she didn\u2019t have to worry about recasting it, ever. It was a one time spell that required a lot of magical energy to pull off. Of course Lysithea had plenty of that to spare, so she cast the spell as soon as she found the method. A feeling of comfort washed over the girl as she felt the spell take effect. With a sigh of relief, she shut the book and deposited it on a nearby shelf. Tired from the long night, she closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep feeling safe with her new spell working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea had no idea that the spell she had used was going to a lot more than make her forget about her fear of ghosts. In the morning she would wake up, noting that her room had changed a lot since she fell asleep. What did her haphazard spell casting do to her?</span></div></div>",

The sun\u2019s not even out yet!\u201d Leonie yelled, still unaware of her classmate\u2019s sudden affliction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d asked a soft spoken voice. Mercedes had just got out of her own room, still dressed in a large sleep robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came as the the white haired girl forced her door open, revealing her giant frame taking up almost the entirety of the entrance. \u201cH-help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, dear Goddess,\u201d Leonie gasped. \u201cWh-what do we do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet me out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie nodded. \u201cRight, I\u2019ll go grab help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead quickly turned the corner of the dorm and ran up the stairs. She had found the other students of he academy standing around, trying to figure out the source of the earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we under attack?\u201d Caspar asked excitedly. His expression soured. \u201cThe one night Professor Manuela took my sleeping axe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie ignored the strange comment. \u201cNo, nothing like that, just head to the first floor. We\u2019re gonna need all the manpower we can get.\u201d She ran down the hall, waking up everyone she could and directing them to Lysithea\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she returned outside, she found a crowd forming as Lysithea was halfway out the door, caught by her hips. Caspar, Raphael, and Claude grappled onto one of her wrists while Dimitri, Dedue, and Edelgard grabbed the other. Everyone was still in there sleepwear, and had the situation not been terrifying, the sight would have been funny to witness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie decided to join in, heading right towards the door, where Mercedes was trying to help guide  the massive body into exiting the gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta say, Lysithea,\u201d Claude began, his tone clearly a set up for a joke. \u201cYou should lay off the cakes. It\u2019s going straight to your hips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea groaned. \u201cMake one more joke, and I\u2019m eating you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright fine,\u201d Claude said with a laugh. \u201cJust thought you\u2019d be big enough to overlook my jokes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess didn\u2019t dignify it with a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie noticed that the archway was beginning to crack under he pressure of Lysithea\u2019s body. \u201cUh, guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep pulling!\u201d Raphael instructed, motivating the others with his guttural yells. \u201cHRAGH\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this wall\u2019s gonna hold,\u201d Leonie continued, drowned out by the others joining Raphael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn three. One, two. THREE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a major tug, the wall crumbled, and Lysithea spilled out onto the the small courtyard. The sudden momentum had caused her to bowl over those who helped her free, pinning them under her. She let out a yelp as she felt her classmates squirm under her. She pushed herself up, forcing herself up to her full height and get a look at how tall she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was currently a few feet shorter than the dorm building, yet she still was roughly triple the heights of the other students. Even Dedue, the tallest student at the academy, was still dwarfed by the white haired giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 thanks everyone,\u201d Lysithea said sheepishly, feeling suddenly embarrassed once everyone\u2019s eyes were on her .\u201dS-sorry for waking you all up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Claude asked, stashing away his jokes for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, magic mishap,\u201d Lysithea admitted, staring down at her feet. The cobblestone was freezing, and she wished she kept her shoes on when she jumped into bed. At the very least, she was still in her uniform and not in her pajamas like the rest of the students. \u201cI\u2019m gonna need some help reading the spell book, so I can change back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes stepped forward. \u201cAnnie and I would be glad to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-thanks,\u201d she looked back to her room, finding it practically destroyed. In fact, the first floor was practically gone as the wall took out Mercedes and Leonie\u2019s room. \u201cThe spell book should be in my room\u2026 somewhere. Sorry for destroying your rooms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries,\u201d Mercedes said sweetly. \u201cI\u2019ll just bunk with Annie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie bit her tongue. She wasn\u2019t taking the loss of her dorm as lightly. Though, maybe she could room with Jeralt until they fixed her room.</span></div></div>",

Lysithea did her best to maintain her composure despite her situation. It was admirable how she tried to stay calm and not freak out. If she did she would most likely accidently damaged the students dorms... more than she already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't find it.\" Mercedes said as she and Annette emerged from the remains of the giantess dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you can't find it?\" Lysithea asked warily. Without that spellbook she might be stuck like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We mean we can't find it.\" Annette reaffirmed. \"We searched that rubble from to bottom. We even searched Mercy and Leonie's rooms. It's just not here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea felt ill. No book meant no cure. Or to be more accurate it would be much more difficult to find solution. Everyone else present seemed to realize what that meant for their giant friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone else could suggest any form of solution, the telltale sounds of footsteps echoed through the empty dorms. Everyone turned to the source to find a yawning professor Byleth fully dressed in his battle attire. He must not have noticed the situation yet because he seemed to preoccupied rubbing the sleep from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you all doing out here? Don't you know what... time... it... is.\" the professor trailed off as he finally became aware of the now towering Lysithea and the wide eyed students. Everyone had gone silent as he looked between the giantess, students, and destroyed dorms. All while his face remained as blank as humanly possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... high professor.\" Lysithea waved awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning. Would anyone care to explain how all of... this came to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter short but sweet explanation, all Byleth could do was no his head. While Lysithea left out some minor details, knowing her he had a pretty good idea what they were. Walking into the destroyed remains of her room and surveying the area, he could picture everything the students told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo think he'd be greeted with this when he first woke up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that all of the students had been made aware of Lysithea's predicament, several groups formed and responded in their own ways. Mercedes, Annette, and Leonie were looking through the ruins of the dorms. There was a lot of to look through, though they were thankful that the upper story hadn't collapsed as well. Leonie wondered if she should have comforted her classmate a bit more, but she was frustrated with the loss of her room and she knew some work would help her stay calm. Mercedes was simply helping out of the goodness of her heart, Annette simply helping her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea sat on the stairs leading up to the mess hall, her arms wrapped around herself. She was understandably on edge at her new size, she felt every fidget of her body. She did have issues with being one of the shortest students in the past, but now she missed being shorter than everyone. After she had unintentionally destroyed three room just by squeezing out of her own, she was concerned for what her new size would do to her classmates if she was careless. Every time someone from another house looked in her direction, she felt sick. She hadn't been particularly warm to most of them, just what were they thinking about her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other members of the Golden Deer were trying their best to comfort their massive friend. Raphael was certainly the most talkative of her supporters. \"Don't worry about it Lysithea. If you think about it, this is pretty cool! Imagine how much muscle power your new size gives you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that she cares about such things Raphael.\" Lorenz rolled his eyes at his large friend. His mind was still on muscles, even in this fantastic situation. \"Lysithea, do you feel ill?\" He addressed the girl directly, hoping to distract her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea turned her focus away from the other students and looked at Lorenz. He tended to infuriate her, but he seemed sincerely concerned right now. \"No I'm alright, just a little nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenz nodded in understanding. \"That is understandable. You are handling yourself very well, I am certain that Leonie will find your book soon. If necessary I will lend my own magical talent to aid you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As will I.\" Marianne added. She was rubbing Lysithea's left shoulder, working with Ignatz to ease the tension in her shoulder. \"I'm not much help but every bit of magic should be useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can count on me too.\" Ignatz spoke from the other shoulder. \"It's been some time, but I can work a little magic myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I will provide moral support!\" Hilda perked up. The others glared at her, her usual laziness wouldn't cut it today. \"You guys! Of course I'm going to do more than that. Someone will need to help her get ready in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm no good at magic stuff... or book stuff in general, but I can still help out. I'll bring you anything you need. I'd even bring you a whole cow if you were hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Raphael say that put a gruesome image in Lysithea\u2019s mind. The idea of eating a whole cow made her sick, but more troubling it made her seem like a monster. She imagined the look of horror on people\u2019s face if anyone saw her eat a whole animal. The thought made her flinch. She covered her face with her hands, her shoulders tensed so hard that Ignatz and Marianne were nearly tossed to the ground, and a squeak of terror escaped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 was it something I said?\u201d Raphael got a swift slap in the back of the head from Lorenz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on the fishing pier, Claude was gathered with the leaders of the other houses. The other two had called him over to get information. They were frustrated to learn that he had no idea how this happened. \u201cTrust me, I have no idea how this happened.\u201d He insisted honestly. \u201cIf I did, I likely would have used it to make our last battle a literal stomping rather than a figurative one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Claude\u2019s taunting, Dimitri spoke, \u201cThat is unfortunate. I suppose we will have to wait until we find the book. Hopefully the spell can be reversed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard nodded, \u201cIndeed. She seems understandably distraught, the quicker we find a solution the better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell aren\u2019t you two astute, stating the obvious.\u201d Claude shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think things will be as simple as: find the book, cast the spell backwards, and everything\u2019s normal. It could take quite a while before we fix out dear Lysithea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard\u2019s expression soured. \u201cOf course I know that, I just thought we should focus on the best case scenario. As the leaders of our houses, we must ensure that we set a good example for our fellows.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are, of course, right Edelgard.\u201d Dimitri tried to assuage the future empress, \u201cBut Claude also has a point. We must not only focus on the best outcome. We should, at least, consider how we will explain these\u2026 changes to the professors and the knights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping their distance away from the giant girl, but trying not to look like they were doing so, were the members of the other houses. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how big Lysithea is now!\u201d Caspar shouted excitedly, earning him harsh shushes from everyone around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou moron! Don\u2019t go shouting things like that around her. She\u2019s clearly upset.\u201d Dorothea scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d Ferdinand began, ready to go on one of his spiels. \u201cOne should never be so careless about their words around someone in distress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinhardt yawned loudly. For once, his tiredness was actually justified. \u201cI wonder what kind of spell it was that could lead to such a spectacular result. This clearly isn\u2019t what she wanted, but its impressive all the same.\u201d Another yawn escaped him as he lazily stretched. \u201cI\u2019m going back to sleep, I will see you all in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you can\u2019t just leave! What if they need our help?\u201d Ingrid protested as the layabout left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-um. I-I\u2019m going to head back to my room too.\u201d Bernadetta squeaked, already trying to slink away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBernadetta\u2026\u201d Dorothea began before stopping. She knew that there was no way that Bernie was going to stay, she was shocked she had even come out at all, in her pajamas even! \u201cJust try to be stealthy, it\u2019ll probably hurt Lysithea if she saw you running away from her.\u201d The purple haired girl simply nodded and hurried off back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to waste my time. This has nothing to do with me, I\u2019ll see you all in the morning. Try to get some sleep.\u201d Felix left, unconcerned with whatever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Felix.\u201d Sylvain groaned. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have shown just a little support?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the rubble of the dorms, Leonie overturned another piece of wood to find nothing under it. \u201cGoddess, this is such a mess. Is the book even still here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFound it!\u201d Leonie heard two voices say at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, good. I getting worried for a second there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Annie? Did you say you found the book?\u201d Mercedes called to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 but didn\u2019t you just say that too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence hung between the three searchers before a realization dawned on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d The three said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing their best to remain discreet, the trio had made there way to the pier and discussed their findings. Unknown to them, a curious Caspar had followed behind, having been pushed out of the conversation with the other students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshamed, Mercedes and Annette presented their findings to the three house leaders. Both held a torn half of Lysithea\u2019s book, the pages shredded or torn out. Leonie had a small collection of paper in her arms, but they amounted to little more than various scraps. \u201cWe\u2019re really sorry!\u201d Annette apologized, clearly distressed. \u201cWe just found the book like this, Leonie helped us get some of the missing pages but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut they\u2019re just scraps\u2026\u201d Claude mourned, holding his head in a hand. \u201cCrap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaspar had now put himself in position to listen in on the conversation, wondering what he had missed while trying to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is quite troublesome.\u201d Edelgard\u2019s brow furrowed. She had feared the book would be damaged, but she hadn\u2019t thought it would be this bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it is. We must keep this a secret. It would be easier for people to think the book was just lost. We cannot let anyone, especially Lysithea, know that it was destroyed.\u201d Dimitri said seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for everyone, Caspar heard that part of the conversation loud and clear. \u201cThe book was destroyed!?\u201d He unintentionally shouted, loud enough for all nearby to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what!?\u201d Lysithea\u2019s reaction could also be heard by everyone nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-oh.\u201d Caspar turned to the leaders of the houses. \u201cUh\u2026 I messed up.\u201d Leonie had a few choice words for the short loudmouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lysithea\u2019s stress peaked higher than it ever was before. Holding her head in her hands, she nervously mumbled to herself. \u201cWithout the book, it\u2019ll be much harder to figure out a cure! How long am I going to be like this? What if the knights think I\u2019m a monster and chase me out? What if-\u201d The girl continued to mutter to herself, her housemates\u2019 attempt to calm her doing little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is quite a conundrum.\u201d Claude shrugged, trying to keep a cool disposition.</span></div></div>",

The white haired giantess was in a panicked stupor, imagining all kinds of horrible scenarios. What if society abandoned her, kicked her out? She\u2019d have to get adopted by a pack of giant wolves and live with them! Then, when one of the wolves inevitably ended up in a fight with some thieves or soldiers, she\u2019d have to help protect the only thing she could call family. She\u2019d probably end up as a joint house assignment, the house to get the killing blow would get an extra reward and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLysithea!\u201d Another familiar voice called out to the distressed girl, but this one got her attention. Though it was familiar, the voice was louder and more assured than usual. She recognized it as Marianne\u2019s voice. Still scared, but drawn to Marianne\u2019s voice, Lysithea uncovered her face and turned to Marianne. Her usual tired look was gone, replaced by a determined and understanding look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLysithea, it\u2019s alright.\u201d Marianne spoke softly, stroking Lysithea\u2019s hair. \u201cYou\u2019re not a monster, you\u2019re a good friend to all of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea stared at the blue haired girl amazed. \u201cH-how did you guess that\u2019s what I was thinking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne smiled gently. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of easy to tell. You just have to read between the lines.\u201d She neglected to mention that she understood that feeling. \u201cI know what you\u2019re going through is scary, but hang in there. We all just want to help. We aren\u2019t going to leave you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLystihea, relieved to hear those words, let her body relax. \u201cThanks Marianne\u2026 I needed to hear that.\u201d She could feel her nerves starting to go away a tiny bit. She could finally try to relax a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Marianne! Who\u2019d have thought that you would be so good at comforting people?\u201d Marianne could only blush and stutter a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, you did quite well.\u201d Lorenz added. \u201cNow then. Lysithea, is there anything I can do to help you right now? Just ask and I will do my best to assist you.\u201d Lysithea looked at Lorenz and then at the ground. She was embarrassed to say it, but he had asked\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy feet are freezing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenz gentle smile immediately disappeared. \u201cAh I see. Well I think I have a way to fix that, but-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could use your fire magic to warm them right?\u201d Hilda suggested helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenz subdued a growl and glared at the pink haired bum, who winked at him coyly. \u201cIndeed. That was what I was going to suggest.\u201d He forced himself to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-it\u2019s alright!\u201d Lysithea squeaked. \u201cIt\u2019s just cold feet, it\u2019s not a big deal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenz desperately wanted to agree with Lysithea, but his noble nature would not allow it. And he knew Hilda would say something if he didn\u2019t. \u201cPlease, it is a noble\u2019s duty to help a fair girl such as yourself with any problem she has. I shall\u2026 warm your feet for you.\u201d Having said his piece, Lorenz moved down the stairs towards Lysithea\u2019s feet. The white haired giantess squeaked an apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea\u2019s feet  bashfully rubbed against each other as Lorenz approached, occasionally twitching. Lysithea felt horribly embarrassed and regretted ever saying anything. Lorenz felt a similar sentiment when he was ready to begin. His irritation rose when he heard Hilda giggled in a wicked tone. \u201cHow noble of you Lorenz.\u201d She started, amusement poorly disguised. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to include this in my letter to my brother when I praise your other deeds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather you not, really. I do not want to risk him thinking I have an interest in this sort of thing.\u201d Lorenz answered without looking at Hilda. With a snap of his fingers, he produced a flame he assumed large enough to warm Lysithea\u2019s feet. With great reluctance, he held it close to her massive feet, which seemed to relax in response. Lorenz heard Lysithea offer a meek thanks and he forced himself to smile and nod.<br>\r\n -----<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that you would just shout that outloud!\u201d Leonie continued  tear into Caspar, giving yet another slap on the head. She had been giving Caspar a piece of her mind for a couple minutes now, the excitable boy held up his arms to defend himself, fearing any serious assault from the upcoming mercenary. He was starting to think that she was taking her frustration about her destroyed room out on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Edelgard wasn\u2019t coming to his rescue, Claude decided to speak up. \u201cLeonie, give Caspar a break. We don\u2019t want him broken too.\u201d He nodded appreciatively when Leonie stopped. \u201cGood, now I need you to go help the others calm down Lysithea.\" Leonie simply nodded and left to go help Lysithea, Caspar cautiously followed behind, not wanting to look like he was running away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go too.\u201d Annette said, handing her half of the book to Mercedes. \u201cI want to apologize about what happened.\u201d She quickly dismissed herself and followed after Leonie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll just take everything we found and store it somewhere. Does anyone have a place in mind?\u201d Mercedes asked, stacking the torn halves with as many scraps as she could in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind, drop them off in my room.\u201d Claude suggested. \u201cShe\u2019s part of my house, so I\u2019ll take responsibility.\u201d Mercedes nodded sweetly and started the walk to Claude\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is troublesome.\u201d Dimitri began. \u201cWith the book in the condition it is, I doubt it will be of any help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude shook his head solemnly. \u201cAgreed. But I\u2019ll keep it around just in case, perhaps we can use its remains later. Let\u2019s forget about that for now. We need to figure out what to do with Lysithea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems obvious enough to me.\u201d Edelgard began. \u201cWe should report this to your professor as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree, that seems the most logical course of action.\u201d Dimitri added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude sighed and crossed his arms. \u201cDo you two really think that\u2019s for the best? You see how nervous she is, you thinking bringing more people to see her will help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what would you suggest, Claude, if our answer is unacceptable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncrossing one arm, Claude motioned outward to some direction. \u201cI say we remove her from the monastery. We can take her to where we had our first mock battle. It\u2019s close and there won\u2019t be dozens of strangers staring at her every moment she\u2019s there.\u201d He stressed the last part of the sentence, trying to show why Edelgard\u2019s idea was wrong. \u201cWe can bring the professors and a select group of others over later. And the Golden Deer could have class outside for a while.\u201d He joked.<br>\r\n ----<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Lorenz? What are you doing?\u201d Leonie asked, baffled by what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLysithea informed me that her feet were cold. So, as a gentlemen and noble should, I insisted I help her warm up.\u201d Lorenz spoke elegantly. \u201cPlus, Hilda was going to say something if I didn\u2019t after I offered to help.\u201d He added bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 I guess that makes sense. Keep up the good work?\u201d Leonie answered uncertainly before going past Lorenz and up the stairs. At the top Leonie found Lysithea and the others standing around her. \u201cHey Lysithea, how are you feeling?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea eyes widened hearing Leonie, quickly returning to normal. \u201cOh, Leonie\u2026 sorry about your room.\u201d She apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie frowned and waved her hand dismissively. \u201cForgot about that.\u201d She insisted, mostly for herself. \u201cI just want to make sure your fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea tried to have a relaxed smile. \u201cI\u2019m doing alright. Or as well as I can. I freaked out a bit for a moment, but Marianne helped me get it under control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I remember you freaking out more than once.\u201d Raphael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I might have panicked a little more than once. But only one time was really bad.\u201d Lysithea insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re doing alright. A few freak outs is alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey Lysithea.\u201d A nervous voice spoke out. Leonie scowled when she saw it was Caspar. The blue haired boy had gone up the other side of the stairs, making sure to be on the other side of Lysithea safe from Leonie. \u201cSorry I just shouted about the book being destroyed. That probably wasn\u2019t the best way to give you the news.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea looked at the Caspar confused. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It wasn\u2019t really the best way to hear it but I would\u2019ve heard about it sooner or later. It\u2019s better than being lied to about it being lost. How bad is the book anyways?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d Leonie admitted bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s torn in two and a lot of the pages are shredded or torn out. And I probably missed some of the torn pages since the halves were on opposite sides of the wreck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought it would be something like that.\u201d Lysithea sighed sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d Annette appeared suddenly, apologizing. She had been delayed by Lorenz who asked her if she would help keep Lysithea\u2019s feet warm with her fire spell. It took a moment to dissuade Lorenz before she could get up the stairs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry the book got destroyed! I hope it\u2019s not too much of a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you two apolgizing to me? It\u2019s my fault for casting the spell in the first place, you don\u2019t have to apologize.\u201d Annette sighed in relief and nodded. Caspar looked at Leonie incredulously, which she silent waved off dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Claude wandered up  and greeted everyone. \u201cHey guys! Do any of you know what the heck Lorenz is doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about it.\u201d Lysithea answered flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude shrugged. \"Fine by me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClaude, did you figure out what we\u2019re going to do next?\u201d Ignatz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed I did. After we gave up on finding a beanstalk for Lysithea to climb up. The leaders of the three houses came to an agreement.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Spoilers should be minimal.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a deep breath of fresh air and wiping the fog from his glasses created by the early morning dew, Ignatz took a moment to admire the view as the sun rose, lighting the outer walls of the monastery and the forests surrounding it. He found a relatively dry log to sit on and brought out his satchel of art supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis reasons for being out so early were twofold. First, the sunrise made an excellent subject for his next painting. Second, and most importantly, he still felt the need to keep his hobby a secret from the others. While Professor Byleth and anyone else that happened to discover his love of art never seemed to have a problem with it- in fact, many of his housemates had even encouraged him- he still couldn't shake the fear that someone would report to his father that he was wasting time painting instead of training to be a knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was because of this fear that he had to buy his art supplies in secret. His most recent purchase, acquired during his free day last week once he was able to shake Raphael and his constant ill-advised attempts to rekindle their childhood friendship- was a strange set of paints offered by an enthusiastic but somewhat off-putting woman named Anna, who offered the paints at a steep mark-up because she claimed they had \"mystical properties in battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnatz sincerely doubted that. However, he was out of paint, and couldn't order supplies by mail for fear that his father would find out. So, he was now the proud owner of a set of ridiculously overpriced \"mysterious battle paint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe examined the bottles. They seemed to be perfectly normal paints with a respectable variety of colors. The only thing unusual was that some of the bottles had a \"G\" inscribed on the cap while others had an \"S.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have something to do with the pigment,\" Ignatz mused. \"Though I can't think of what those letters might mean. I guess I'll just have to experiment with them and find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the red bottle first, planning to start with the pinks in the sky. Unfortunately, the top of the bottle was loose, and as soon as he tried to open it, the paint spilled out all over him. Cursing quietly to himself as the paint seeped through his clothes and made contact with his skin, he gave the bottle a closer look...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Spoilers for Chapter 5)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he registered the letter \"S\" engraved on the bottle of paint that had spilled all over him, Ignatz hunched over as he felt an intense sensation of vertigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no... were those paints somehow meant for battle after all? Have I been poisoned?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe collapsed on the ground, almost the verge of passing out when the pain and disorientation suddenly disappeared as quickly as they came. Still breathing heavily from the intense experience, he slowly got to his feet. Once he got a good look at his surroundings, his heavy breathing quickly turned to hyperventilation. Wet blades of grass surrounded him, almost taller than the trees he'd been surrounded by earlier. As he turned around, he saw a gigantic wooden wall several yards away that seemed to stretch almost as high as the walls of the monastery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning his neck up to the top of is, he saw a corner of his impossibly giant sketchbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... how is this possible?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several long moments of freaking out, Ignatz finally took a deep breath. Remembering Professor Byleth's lectures on tactics, he thought about his situation objectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This happened immediately after I spilled paint on myself. What was different about it?\" He snapped his fingers. \"That's right! There were S's and G's on the bottles. Let's see... the one I spilled had an S on it... that must stand for 'shrink!' If the other one stands for 'grow,' that should grow me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up to the giant wooden log his supplies were on top of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... it's a long climb that my muscles really aren't built for... but I guess I have no choice but to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnatz was cut off by an ominous hiss behind him. He turned and shrieked as he saw a gigantic field mouse, roughly the size of the beast Mikan had turned into during the Golden Deer's last mission. It opened its mouth to hiss again, its sharp teeth clearly capable of snapping Ignatz in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAHHH!\" Ignatz fled. With a snarl, the mouse chased after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you chasing me?!\" Ignatz demanded desperately as he wove around blades of grass to evade the giant furry beast and its bites. \"You don't even eat meat!\" The tiny artist was so focused on the chase that he didn't notice the thundering booms in the distance gradually getting closer and closer, until finally a gigantic black boot slammed into the wet earth in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mouse squeaked in terror and fled, its meal forgotten in the presence of this much larger creature, Ignatz craned his neck up to get a look at his unwitting savior. The boots gave way to socks, which gave way to two relatively thin legs, one with a knee guard on it. The legs disappeared into a school skirt with a recognizable orange sweater tied around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"IGNATZ?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Leonie?\" Ignatz muttered as he finally got a look at his classmate's face. He'd hoped her calling out his name meant she saw him, but no, she was simply looking around the forest, expecting to find him at normal size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Strange... his art supplies are here...\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she took a step towards the log, her massive feet creating craters in the muddy earth. Ignatz swallowed. Seeing his friend dwarf him so imposingly finally drove home just how tiny he was and how much danger he was truly in. He needed to get her help before something happened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie made her way to her usual training spot in the woods outside the monastery at the crack of dawn, a training bow and spear strapped to her back. She was up early to get in some last minute training because today, she was going to demand Professor Byleth spar with her and not take no for an answer. Maybe if she did well it would impress Captain Jeralt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she reached the clearing, her eyes brightened as she spotted a familiar satchel and art book on a nearby log. <i>Ignatz must be out here,</i> she thought, looking around in hopes of greeting her friend before getting started. Not seeing him anywhere nearby, she frowned in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignatz?\" She called out. \"Strange... his art supplies are here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of the fact that she had just saved her classmate from a strangely carnivorous mouse, she walked towards the art supplies. \"He wouldn't have left them here... would he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed in concern as she remembered what Ignatz had said the last time they talked about his art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So my art won't do anyone any good. At all. Ever.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ignatz...\" Leonie muttered sadly as she approached the supplies. One of the paint bottles was broken, the red paint already dried where it had spilled on the log. She took the rest of it and packed it into the satchel as carefully as she could, and decided to keep an eye on it while she trained. If Ignatz came back for his supplies while she was here, great. If not, she'd take them back to the monastery and give him a talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Leonie mused as she finished putting away the paint and eyed Ignatz's book. \"Now that I think about it, I've never actually seen his work...\"</span></div></div>",

However, as Flayn\u2019s growth had been stunted at roughly six or so centimeters tall, Seteth had an excuse to never let her out of his sight. This led to the green haired tiny to live a sheltered life, one she hated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even his diligent watch wasn\u2019t enough to keep her safe. Flayn had a habit of running off and exploring the world at her size, leading to a few close calls involving everything from almost being stepped on, sat on, and even a few occasions of nearly being eaten. The green haired girl couldn\u2019t resist sampling slices of cake several times as tall as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that was nothing compared to her kidnapping at the hands of the Death Knight. Thankfully, she was rescued by Byleth and their students, leading Seteth to finally trust in the new Professor. Which is why he called them to a meeting over tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlayn hugged a cookie and gnawed into it with no remorse as her caretaker nervously took a drink from his tea. His nerves were soothed as he took in the taste of Angelica tea. Surely if the Professor was conscientious enough to procure his favorite brew, then she\u2019d be the right person to watch over Flayn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I owe the pleasure?\u201d Byleth asked, taking a sip from her own cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about Flayn,\u201d Seteth began. He looked down at her and sighed. With his free hand, he wrestled the cookie out from her grip, earning a few hisses from the shrunken student. He ignored it as he broke it into much more manageable pieces for her to tear into. \u201cI fear she is no longer safe under my watch alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d Byleth hummed simply, appreciating him getting to the point. \u201cI suppose you want me to watch over her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeteth nodded. \u201cYes. More importantly\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to be a part of your class!\u201d The tiny girl chirped, her face and hair covered in a layer of crumbs and sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth pursed their lips, a subtle show of emotion they never recalled having before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ha! That little pipsqueak?</i> Snarked a voice from the deepest recesses of her mind. <i>She\u2019s barely fit to clean the dirt from your nails.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Seteth interjected. \u201cHowever, my dear Flayn is rather adept at magic. Overwhelmingly so, actually. I\u2019d like you to hone her talents, and teach her some Reason spells for self defense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I learn fire spells, brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d He turned to the professor. \u201cI think wind spells would suit her best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth nodded. \u201cI\u2019m honored that you would trust me to take Flayn into my care. I\u2019ll protect her as if she were my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s reassuring to hear,\u201d Seteth said, finally letting out an exhale. \u201cI\u2019d like to check in with her every once in a while, but I trust that she will be safe in your hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd one more thing,\u201d Seteth began. \u201cPlease make sure she doesn\u2019t wander off. She tends to land herself in some precarious positions if she\u2019s left unattended.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor nodded again as she set her hand down on the table. On cue, Flayn clambered onto Byleth\u2019s palm, sitting crosslegged in the center. She nibbled on a chunk of cookie the size of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I take it back!</i> Sothis cooed. <i>Protect that precious wittle child with your life or I will smite you!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeteth let out a sigh as he stretched a finger out to pat Flayn\u2019s head. \u201cStay safe, Flayn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make no promises,\u201d she said back with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Byleth cautiously stood up from the table, making sure not to disorient her new charge. \u201cCome now, little one. Let me formally introduce you to the rest of your fellow\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Fight me.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamir really needed to stop making bets with Catherine. At first, the prizes were small. Loser pays for drinks. Minor stuff like that. However, the two quickly got bored and found ways to raise the stakes on each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, as Shamir found herself centimeters tall at the feet of the blonde knight, she was beginning to feel these bets weren't all that good of an idea. She was confident she would win, but Byleth apparently preferred Catherine, handing over the whetstone and settling their petty bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Hey there, little lady,\"</b> Catherine boomed obnoxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn earpiercing scratching forced the mercenary to cover her ears as Catherine's boots slightly shifted on the ground when she squatted down to get a good look at her new prize. She grinned, thinking of all the ways she could exert her power over Shamir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny knight stared up at the incomprehensibly massive figure above her. Her knees went weak. Although, she didn't quite know why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, her partner was attractive, and they certainly had intimate nights together on long journeys to missions with nothing but each other. However, Catherine was also brash and thickheaded, something she didn't value in people. Though, as Shamir quickly came to realize, she put a lot of value into strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at this size, Catherine was the most powerful thing in the world to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat fact was quickly made obvious as the blonde plucked her partner high into the air to meet her face while also standing up. This led to a gut churning pressure as the g-forces pressed down onto Shamir thanks to the movement. Even then, Catherine's powerful fingers held an impossibly strong grip on her, reminding the tiny knight just how helpless she was to her partner's every whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Oh, the things I could do to you,\"</b> Catherine said with a husky tone. She rubbed her thumb over Shamir's body, enjoying the feeling of her squirming in her fingers. She made sure to press her thumb between Shamir's legs, chuckling at how her tiny prize instinctually closed her legs around the digit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reserved mercenary let out an involuntary moan through grit teeth. She wasn't about to give her the satisfaction, yet a part of her wanted to be toyed with. She was manhandled easily with just two of Catherine's fingers, and there was nothing she could do in her power to stop it. The worst part was that she wanted more of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was supposed to be a humiliating punishment, but why was she into it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine pulled her thumb away, only to be surprised to see the tiny woman desperately clinging onto her. <b>\"Bit excited there, aren't you, Shamir? Don't worry, we'll have a lot of time together.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right. The punishment would last until the end of the month.Until then, she was just Catherine's plaything, something she dreaded until just a few moments ago. Now, she wondered just how Catherine would have her way with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde brute loosened her armor, letting her breastplate hang loose as she used her free hand to pry open her collar. She brought Shamir up to the gap, chuckling to herself before letting go and letting the purple haired knight tumble down into the dark canyon waiting below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLosing all sense of direction but down, Shamir slid across the giantess' skin, which was slick with sweat despite the cool wind of the Wyvern Moon. It didn't take long for her to be wedged between Catherine's hulking breasts.  What little air there was smelled of stale Catherine. Her face and upper body was spread eagle across the top of the giant blonde's breast, which was surprisingly spacious up until the point where Catherine tightened her breastplate, flattening the tiny knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamir let herself get lost in the hazy heat. The way her body had been splayed out was like she was hugging the massive hills, something she didn't know she wanted until now. She rested her head against Catherine's soft skin, deciding to enjoy her time here while it was still private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Catherine cannot know I'm into this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce light and Catherine's fingers returned, Shamir found herself...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With both a surprising amount of delicate balance and a not-so-surprising amount of sheer speed, Shamir was plucked out of her personal heaven. She was immediately thankful for the crisp fall air she could breathe now, and yet she already found herself pining for the heat she had been ripped away from. Once again, Shamir found herself held in the air at a height most people would find dizzying, although her attention was anywhere but the ground below her, as Catherine leaned so close that Shamir could likely reach out her arm to touch the tip of their nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I bet you enjoyed yourself in there?\"</b> Catherine asked, giving a hearty laugh as Shamir, despite their best efforts, failed to hide the blood rushing to her cheeks. <b>\"Relax! Here, let me set you down for now.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's hand gave a swift descent (threatening to send Shamir's lunch of spicy fish and turnip stew straight back up) and the herculean fingers unpinched, letting their catch drop a relative few feet onto a wide wooden surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that her vision and attention wasn't dominated by Catherine, Shamir's keen senses could take stock of her new surroundings. She had already acertained that she was on a barren table, as she noticed the once-small knicks and dents that were no doubt dug by copper coins and sharp nails belonging to idle daydreaming students, now magnified to exemplify how tiny she was. Beyond the mesa of wood, there was a wall that rivaled the cathedral in height, but instead of stonework and stained glass, it was row after row of books. In the distance to the 'south', a fireplace akin to a forest inferno sizzled in its pit. Benches were lined around the gigantic room, some seated near the aforementioned fireplace while others had been lined up by the table. A desert of grey stone awaited below, while the sky was now replaced with dark wood. Most humans would fail to see much beyond that, but Shamir's eagle-eyed vision could even spot the bulletin board and training dummies across the vast distance to the other end of the hall, and her hearing picked out the calls of crickets and owls beyond the doorway that seemed fields away to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the Knight's Hall,\" Shamir announced, certain in her deduction. She craned her head to look up at Catherine, who was looking back down with a telltale smile on her face. While Shamir had acclimated to her new stature far quicker than most likely would, it was still humbling - and quite exhilarating - to see her fellow knight looming over her, radiating raw power without so much as saying a word. It took Shamir a second or two to stop staring into Catherine's eyes and finish her thought. \"I hope you're not planning to show me off to the other knights.\" Shamir dreaded the thought of bearing with Alois at a scale where his abundant energy could be more than a little detrimental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine gave a laugh, deep and boisterous enough that Shamir could swear that she felt the table itself shake (or maybe it was just her knees again.) <b>\"Of course not! If it were up to me, I'd have you all to myself right now!\"</b> Shamir angled her head away, aware of the blush returning to her face and now astute enough to hide it behind her hair. <b>\"But you see, I didn't really think I'd <i>win</i> our wager. The professor usually tends to play you as their favorite, after all.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't wrong - Shamir had noticed that Byleth had invited them to tea more than once this month, while Catherine had been left conspicuously absent. <i>Then again,</i> Shamir thought to herself, <i>Catherine isn't exactly the best when it comes to teatime etiquette.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Since I didn't expect this <i>little</i> present of mine-\"</b> Catherine made sure to emphasize her wordplay with a lick of the lips, and Shamir somehow felt even smaller than before. <b>\"-I'd already made plans for tonight. I just blocked out the hall for a private game between some friends and I, and it's a bit too late for me to cancel all of a sudden.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Shamir said, walking closer to the folded arms of Catherine on the edge of the table. In their steel bracers, they looked more like mighty metal pillars that had fallen atop one another. \"What's the game? No more wagers, I hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine gave a low mirthful chuckle as the hand nearest to Shamir drummed its fingers in mock thought, causing the archer to brace so that she might not be tripped over. Shamir bit her lip - even the slightest tremors of Catherine's most idle of movements exuded power. <b>\"We'll see - we're just waiting for our guests to arrive. You <i>will</i> be joining in, right? It'll be fun, promise!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamir nodded, allowing herself a faint smile. This wasn't exactly the evening she had planned, but it was still an interesting situation and... Well, for whatever else she wanted to try, she had the rest of the month left anyway. \"Of course. It's not like I could say no, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"No,\"</b> Catherine said, flashing her teeth at her shrunken partner. <b>\"You're mine.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their difference in size and being <i>considerably</i> distracted at the moment, Shamir was the first to hear the sound of footsteps in the distance, as Catherine's intended party entered the Knight's Hall.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shamir was just as awestruck to see the Catherine's guests enter the Knight's Hall. Even in the distance, she knew they were titans compared to her. They only commanded more of her vision as they stepped up to the table, each carrying something that wouldn't lead to anything good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Manuela, seemed to be fanning herself with a spread out deck of cards as she made a remark about how stuffy the Knight's Hall always was. To her left, Professor Byleth carried a cask of what Shamir presumed to be ale. The barrel had to have a small sea's worth of alcohol that would almost certainly be greedily imbibed by the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but wonder just what would the professor's reaction be once the Catherine inevitably let the reason why she shrunk slip. Even as stoic as the professor was, she had to at least raise an eyebrow or something. Maybe her new size could make perception subtle changes in Byleth's expression easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Right on time,\"</b> Catherine said, leaning back in her own seat as the others joined her. She kicked her feet up on the table, making sure to drop her boots dangerously close to Shamir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the dropping shadow, Shamir jumped out of the way from her giant partner's incoming boot that nearly crushed her into a paste. The crash shook her to the inside of her bones, almost rattling her had she not seen it coming. She stared up at the wall of leather, eying pebbles trapped in the treads far larger than she was. Once again, the experience of feeling as small as the dirt beneath Catherine's feet was breathtaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until the screeching of chairs sliding that Shamir turned her attention away from her giant partner. She was in the presence of two more giants, both of which unaware of her current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela dropped the cards on the table and proceeded to shuffle them. The simple act of the cards flipping and interlocking was enough to send gale force winds racing towards the near minuscule Shamir. However, the tiny knight planted her feet and held her ground as the man made storm nearly swept her off her feet in both a literal and figurative sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Manuela's not looking too bad down here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth dropped the cask onto the table and began to pour drinks out. The impact was more than enough to startle Shamir, who felt the quakes tenfold. She fell to her knees and planted a palm on stable ground, keeping her steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Careful there,\"</b> Catherine hummed, her concern insincere. <b>\"You almost crushed my plus one.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"What do you mean?\"</b> Manuela asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine pulled her hand out from resting behind her head and pointed to the speck by her boot. Manuela leaned forward to get a better look, her half-exposed chest resting on the table and giving the tiny knight an enticing view of a valley she wouldn't mind traversing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Sh-Shamir!?\"</b> Manuela asked, her eyes wide. <b>\"What happened?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lost a bet,\" Shamir answered flatly, raising her voice to be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth glanced at Catherine as she slid over a filled glass of ale. <b>\"Did this have anything to do with the whetstone?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Yep!\"</b> Catherine answered, another grin forming. <b>\"Why did you choose to give it to me?\"</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth shrugged. <b>\"Petra needed a new sword.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine let out a laugh at the answer before taking a swig from her mug. <b>\"Hear that, Shamir?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if I couldn't,\" Shamir said flatly. While she was certainly annoyed at the answer combined with her partner's gloating, a part of her was a bit glad she discovered whatever this was about herself. Depending on how the rest of this month went, she wouldn't mind losing more bets like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Enough smalltalk,\" </b>Catherine cut off, emphasizing the word 'small.' <b>\"You gals ready?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two nodded as Manuela began dealing the hand. Shamir merely watched, quickly picking up that they were playing poker. A few rounds went by with either Catherine and Manuela taking the win with early folds from the others. Nothing notable really happened until Byleth took up and contested Catherine's bluff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"For someone with the best poker face in the world,\"</b> the blonde knight said while wiping her lips with her sleeve. <b>\"You're pretty terrible at it.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth didn't protest or even look upset when she began to shed off her coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So they're playing <u>that</u> kind of poker...</i> Shamir thought, her face heating up. <i>Explains why they're not throwing gold around.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rounds went on, Byleth continued to shed clothes, unconcerned that she was without a top only two hands later. All the while, the three got looser with more glasses of alcohol draining from the cask. Eventually, through a drawing of unfortunate cards, Catherine had lost the next round. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde knight smirked as she looked at the others, who were expectantly waiting for her to shed some clothes. <b>\"Well, Shamir? They're waiting.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blush returned to the knight's face. \"Wait. What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"You heard me,\"</b> she said. <b>\"You have to do whatever I want, remember.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" Shamir rolled her eyes as she slid off her jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Gotta give 'em more skin than that,\"</b> Catherine commanded, the faintest hint of a slur in her voice. <b>\"Take your top off.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamir bit her lip but did as she was told, removing the tight shirt and standing there with only her bra covering her upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine whistled, causing Shamir's blush to deepen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rounds went on, Shamir began to suspect that her parter was intentionally throwing rounds. She forced off her boots and socks with each losing hand. The only thing keeping her from going completely in the nude was Byleth's terrible play. All this combined, left Manuela (who had only taken off her white fur shawl) feeling a bit frustrated at her lack of action in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela groaned as she slammed down her glass against the table, startling Shamir. <b>\"It'sh not fair!\"</b> she cried to no one in particular. <b>\"Why do I have to be attracted to men? At times it seems like not a single member of the opposite sex is interested in me whatsho-ever.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine chuckled. <b>\"If it's any consolation, I think you're hot. Me and Shamir would be happy to show you that you don't need a man in your bed to leave you satisfied.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamir stared up at the two women, who were both clearly loosened up by their drinks, and shuddered at the thought of taking part in a drunken, sloppy threesome with them at her size. Even then, she wasn't entirely sure if the chill came from fear or excitement. Or perhaps the cold, considering she was now down to her smallclothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"As lovely as that propo-zishun sounds,\"</b> Manuela began, her voice still a drunken purr. She leaned over to Byleth and cupped one of her massive, half-exposed breasts before jiggling it. <b>\"This does absolutely nothing for me.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth didn't protest. In fact, she didn't even say anything at all. Her eyes were still focused on her own cards. The new Professor's absolute indifference to  Shamir's new size drove the tiny knight just as wild as seeing Catherine lord over her. She definitely wouldn't mind spending the night with her and exploring the mountains that Manuela was taking for granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Steel yourself,</i> Shamir scolded, standing there awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine yawned. <b>\"Gettin' kinda tired here.\"</b> She thumbed through her hand, seeing potential in her cards. <b>\"Let's make things interesting.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no...</i> Shamir thought, noticing the glint in Catherine's eye. It was the same one she saw when the blonde brought up the bet where the loser took a shrinking potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"One last hand,\"</b> she said. <b>\"Whoever wins gets to take Shamir home for the night.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamir turned to her current owner. \"Catherine, you can't\u2014\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Yes I can,\"</b> she snapped back. <b>\"It was in the bet. Besides, I've seen you staring. You wouldn't mind this at all, wouldn't you?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamir stared down at her feet, hating that Catherine was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I'm down,\"</b> Byleth said, an equally competitive look in her eyes. Shamir could only imagine the kinds of things Byleth would do to her if she were at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela took in the last drops of her drink.<b> \"I dunno...\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine grinned. <b>\"Think of all the places you can put her to let out your frustrations.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Shamir's bottom lip was bitten raw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"What do you get from this?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Simple,\"</b> Catherine said.<b> \"I get the satisfaction of taking a prize I've won twice over home. And when I do...\"</b> She leaned closer and loomed over Shamir, getting right in the tiny knight's personal space. The alcohol in her breath was absolutely overwhelming. <b>\"I'm gonna stick her where the sun don't shine.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Catherine!\" Shamir protested, the teasing becoming a little too excruciating as her voice came close to a squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine only grinned, leaning back in her seat. <b>\"So?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I suppose, I could try experimenting,\"</b> Manuela hummed, her own ideas coming to mind spurred by Catherine's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Great,\"</b> she hummed. <b>\"Show your cards, everyone.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamir's heart was racing as she watched everyone reveal their hands. At this point, she didn't care who it was, she just wanted to go with someone to end the merciless teasing. She studied the table, quickly realizing with excitement that the winner was...</span></div></div>",

The re-recruited captain of the Knights of Seiros had somehow shrunken over night. If he had to guess he would say he was about 1/2 an inch in height, a mere bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow had this happened too him? Was he exposed to something? Or perhaps more than likely he was being targeted. It wouldn't really surprise him honestly. It wouldn't be the first time someone tried to kill him, and the monastery had a history of being infiltrated before. Even still, this was a rather... Unique way of getting rid of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a normal fight he could pretty best any would be assassin out for his blood, so it made sense that his assailant would want him at a severe disadvantage. In his current state all it would take to kill him was one well misplaced stomp. But thankfully for him the halls of Garreg Mach were currently empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was all alone. So that begged the question... Why was he still alive? Where was his attacker? Why haven't they revealed themselves? He was vulnerable and there were no witnesses currently. So why not snuff him out now while they could get away with it? It didn't make sense to just leave him to wonder about unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh his executioner had twisted sense of humor. They must have left him be so that any unsuspecting student or knight could crush him flat without notice. What a cowardly way to dispose of an enemy. They would rather sit and watch instead of getting their own hands dirty. How low could one get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Jeralt guessed it didn't matter now. He might as well use his secret assassin's hubris to his advantage. He needed to get noticed so he could get some help. Lady Rhea with all of the vast resources at her disposal could definitely find a cure for his condition. That is... If he got noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still had to be careful. His would be assassin could change their mind at any time and snuff him out whenever they wished. Then there were the students and knights. They could easily mistake him for a bug and crush him. That wouldn't be pleasant. He would have to be doubly cautious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. It's time to get a move on.\" Jeralt told himself. It was time to get moving. There was no sense in staying stationary. </span></div></div>",

Minor spoilers.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight, Byleth was regretting several of his life choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had started with constantly finding lost items and returning them to the students. Then he started doing random odd jobs and favors for anyone who'd ask whenever he had a free day. Then he started replying to requests for advice in the confession box. He tried to be anonymous, but apparently, his handwriting was distinct enough that everyone knew it was him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Byleth knew it, he had become the go-to professor whenever students needed help or advice, whether they were part of his house or not. Sometimes it was rewarding, like when he got the likes of Marianne, Felix, or Bernadetta to actually participate in school activities and interact with their fellow students voluntarily. Sometimes it was terrible, like the night that Dimitri came to his room at three in the morning on behalf of Sylvain, who, in the words of the befuddled prince, \"put it in a scabbard this time, and now it's stuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight hadn't reached that level of unpleasantness yet, but was rapidly coming close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... yoooooouuuuu're the besht, Professhor,\" Manuela slurred her words as she drunkenly leaned into the stoic younger professor. \"Byleth'sh good people. Dorothea! Ishn't Byleth good people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he sure is, Manuela. We're lucky we ran into him tonight,\" Dorothea dutifully answered her former opera costar and mentor as she put one of the drunk woman's arms around her shoulder and mouthed yet another \"sorry\" to Byleth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, Dorothea,\" Byleth assured her as he took Manuela's other arm and helped the Black Eagle half-walk, half-drag her to her quarters. \"Let's just get her inside before someone else sees...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" a somewhat pompous voice said. \"Good evening, Professor Byleth,\" Hanneman greeted Byleth as he left the dining hall. \"I was unaware that you were also on partrol tonight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trailed off and sighed in disgust as he saw Manuella. \"Oh, you must be joking. Really, Manuela? And so soon after your run-in with the Death Knight? Your wound so easily could have reopened from all your gallivanting about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Manuela's head jerked up as she glared lazily at her rival. \"Watch out, Byleth! Hanna... Hammerman'sh got a case of the stickbutt! You'll catsch it if you exshpose your butt to him! Trusht me... I'm a doctor... You should expose your butt to meeee...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are all manner of things wrong with what you just said!\" Hanneman huffed indignantly. \"First of all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor, please,\" Byleth said, tilting his head meaningfully towards Dorothea. \"Not now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanneman took a deep breath. \"Yes... it is inappropriate to discuss this in front of a student. Very well, Professor. I will leave her in your hands. Are you still available for me to study your crest tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\" Byleth agreed offhandedly, already working with Dorothea to put as much difference between Manuela and Hanneman as possible before the drunken songstress could provoke another argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your butt'sh forfeit Byleth... I waarrrrrrrned yooooouuuu...\" Manuela slurred as she reached under Byleth's cloak and pinched his rear end. Byleth's eyes widened slightly but he otherwise did not react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manuela, please,\" Dorothea sighed tiredly. \"You're better than that. No offense, Professor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm you're a good, Dorothea. You're... mmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela went slack, passing out with an undignfied snore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that simplifies things,\" Byleth declared. \"Come on, Dorothea. Let's get her to her room before something else happens...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor!\" Lysithea called out. spotting Byleth as she was leaving the library and running up to meet him. Byleth's eye twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are certainly popular tonight, Professor,\" Dorothea joked lightly. Manuela grumbled incoherently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claude and I have been working on our plan for the Battle of Eagle and Lion!\" Lysithea announced excitedly, holding up a small bottle. \"We were able to produce the effects to a potion instead of a spell, and...\" she trailed off as she finally noticed that Byleth wasn't alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a great time, Lysithea,\" Byleth gently scolded her. \"We'll discuss it after class tomorrow, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point, professor,\" Lysithea nodded before glaring at Dorothea. \"We don't want to discuss things in front of the enemy. And Edelgard better not learn of any of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Lysithea,\" Dorothea smiled indulgently. \"I have bigger things to worry about tonight. Your secret's safe with me.\" She smirked. \"But as much as I respect Professor Byleth... your house is going down, little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do NOT treat me like a child...\" Lysithea stomped towards Dorothea menacingly, only to slip and fall. The bottle in her hand was inadvertently flung into the air, where the loose top came off and the potion within splashed all over Manuela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... wassat?\" Manuela woke from the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... Manuela, you're so much heavier, all of a sudden,\" Dorothea grunted, now struggling to hold her mentor's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth and Lysithea's eyes widened. \"Dorothea,\" Byleth said gravely. \"Let go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela's arms suddenly expanded to the size and weight of heavy tree branches, nearly pinning Dorothea before she managed to shake the limp professor off of her. Manuela hit the ground with a thud and a grunt, both of which were considerably louder than they should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manuela, I'm so sorry, I...\" Dorothea trailed off as she stared, slack-jawed at the sight before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela was growing. Already, she was twice as large as normal, and the growth was showing no sings of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to her?!\" Dorothea demanded with a shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our secret weapon!\" Lysithea cried. \"I've been working on it all month and now it's ruined!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manuela,\" Byleth moved towards the professor's ear. She was already fifteen feet tall and the growth was accelerating rapidly. \"Come on, we need to get you somewhere out in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... the groundsh comfy,\" Manuella sighed, damaging the stone walkway as she rolled onto her side. \"Nighty-night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela fell back asleep. Her body was now big enough that it was starting to rub against the north wall of the reception hall creating an ominous groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on out there?!\" Seteth's voice demanded loudly from within. \"What's blocking the archway?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now Professor Casagranda's butt has everyone trapped in the reception hall,\" Lysithea sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least she's still outside,\" Byleth half-heartedly consoled his student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get expelled for this...\" Lysithea fretted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You SHOULD get expelled for this!\" Dorothea snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one's getting expelled!\" Byleth insisted as he walked around the expanding body until he was in front of Manuela's sleeping face. She was now fifty feet tall. \"Professor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess grumbled a bit as she exhaled a gigantic, alcohol-laced breath onto Byleth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMANUELA!\u201d Byleth shouted. \u201cWAKE UP!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her legs easily broke through the narrow walls that contained courtyards and the amusingly named Amiibo Gazebo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth dove out of the way of her growing legs as they nearly ran over him. Her heel, now as thick of a tree, would have impaled him had he not had the foresight to get out of the way.

A demonic beast has infiltrated the monastery!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all, rude,\u201d Byleth began, looking up at the slumbering form of the massive diva. Aside from the fact that she was a bit awkwardly hunched over from her new size, there was nothing about her resembling a monster. \u201cSecond, Dorothea, be a dear and quiet him up before he wakes up the whole monastery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn it, Professor,\u201d Dorothea said, rushing off towards the stable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this I hear about a demonic beast!?\u201d Seteth\u2019s muffled voice called from the inside of the reception hall. \u201cI\u2019m going to try and break through this barrier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a false alarm,\u201d Byleth answered. \u201cAnd keep trying to bust through.

The professor didn\u2019t really know how to break it to the holy figure that he was pressing himself into Manuela\u2019s rear, but that would be a bridge he\u2019d cross when he came to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cMmmm,\u201d</b> the giantess sleepily moaned from high above. <b>\u201cFeelsh, gooooooood.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was way more information than Byleth was willing to learn right about now.</span></div></div>",

He blinked several times, his blurry vision keeping him from being able to identify his surroundings. All he knew for sure was that his head hurt, the world was far too bright for his eyes, and that something smelled amazing... and yet, familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" Claude groaned as he struggled to piece together how he got here... wherever this place was. \"Last thing I remember... I was at the library researching relics... and I found... something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claude!\" a deep voice called out in the distance. \"Yo! Guys! I found Claude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude's vision and wits started to barely return to him as he spotted Raphael running towards him, followed closely by Ignatz and Lorenz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" Claude waved to his housemates, wincing and barely opening his eyes in deference to his still present headache. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you gone blind?!\" Lorenz balked, his normally snide voice containing a very noticeable undercurrent of panic that Claude had never heard from him before. \"Look around you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowering through the pain, Claude forced his eyes open and took his first proper look around since waking up. They were on a massive white plain that seemed to be made out of some kind of linen. Next to them was a massive porcelain structure hundreds of times their size. If he didn't know better, Claude would swear it was a giant tea cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around. Looming far in the distance was a great tower stacked with what seemed to be enormous cookies and scones just before the great white plain seemed to end with an abrupt cliff drop. At this sight, Claude was finally able to place where he'd smelled this delicious smell before- from Professor Byleth's tea parties that she would hold for her students on their birthdays or if they had done well in class or battle, and occasionally for students in other houses that she was not-so-subtly trying to recruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're surrounded by giant food,\" Claude observed, deciding that he was having a fever dream and rolling with it. \"Raphael, this has to be the best day of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It kind of is!\" Raphael agreed cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food's not giant!\" Ignatz yelled. \"We're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnatz was cut off as a loud boom echoed behind Claude. The other three looked up and began backing away with varying levels of fear. Swallowing nervously, Claude turned around, only to see a very familiar amulet surrounded by two of the largest breasts he had ever seen. He craned his neck up, and his jaw drop in shock as he took in the impossibly giant visage of Professor Byleth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expressionless face framed by long green hair was visible in more detail than Claude had ever seen before. Her eyes were focused on the teacup next to them as she poured from an equally giant teapot, the normally quiet sound of the tea meeting the cup echoing like an oppressive waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teach!\" Claude snapped out of his stupor and called up to her. \"Hey! TEACH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother,\" Ignatz sighed. \"We all yelled to her when she was setting up the table. We're way too small for her to hear us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to further prove his point, Byleth lifted the teacup and took a sip as if nothing was wrong in the world, completely oblivious to the tiny quartet watching her from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Hmmm,\"</b> her voice echoed, lower and more sonorous with her giant size. <b>\"Not my favorite blend. It could use more sugar...\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude turned to the others. \"Okay... any idea how this happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was assuming this was one of your idiotic schemes gone awry,\" Lorenz said with a sneer. \"I seem to recall an incident with a shrinking potion...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" Claude shook his head. \"It wouldn't have made us this small. Besides, I threw it out after what happened last time.\" He frowned as he considered the situation. \"I hate to say it, but this must be someone trying to get rid of us. I mean, a lot of weird stuff has been happening, and creeps like Jeritza, Tomas, and that Flame Emperor guy keep getting into the monastery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And whether we plan to or not, Golden Deer keeps getting caught up in it,\" Ignatz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And kickin' their butts,\" Raphael added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Claude pointed to the two in agreement. \"We're probably a thorn in a lot of people's sides. Which is awesome, but not when it leads to something like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"CLAUDE!\"</font> a tiny, feminine voice called out from a great distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" Claude looked around. \"Was that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see the girls!\" Ignatz exclaimed. \"They're on the dessert tray!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, good eye, Ignatz,\" Claude praised. Now that he was concentrating on it, he could see some of the female contingent of the Golden Deer trapped on the scones in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScones that a normal sized person could come and eat at any moment. Claude frowned as the implications set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's not a great place for them to be. We need a plan. Lorenz, you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a noble's duty to aid those in peril!\" Lorenz interrupted, already running for the tray. \"Fear not, ladies! I am coming to save you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lorenz, you ass...\" Claude muttered as he pinched the bridge of his nose. \"Okay, I guess Lorenz is going to save the girls, and I'm going to follow him to make sure he doesn't get crushed or eaten. You two get Teach's attention and let her know what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Raphael held up his hand. \"How are we supposed to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck!\" Claude took off after Lorenz. Ignatz continued to stare at the tower of food as Raphael put a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Ignatz, I know you're worried about them, but those two have this. Let's figure out how to get the Professor to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only see three of the girls from here,\" Ignatz noted worriedly. \"I wonder where the fourth one is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Ah,\"</b> Byleth finally spoke again, a small smile gracing her features. <b>\"I'm glad you could join me.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Thanks for inviting me, Professor,\"</b> a second voice boomed as Byleth's normal sized guest sat at the other end of the table, directly within reach of the dessert tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Ignatz muttered as he looked up at the giant face of...</span></div></div>",

No major spoilers.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs tough as Byleth normally was with her students, she was particularly soft with Marianne. The downtrodden girl seemed beat up by life, and the professor wanted to make things a bit easier for her outside of battle. Their tea times together were much more regular than her other students, mostly because she felt the need to check up on Marianne often. Her reasons were currently just minor suspicions, but she enjoyed these quiet moments, even if the blue haired girl wasn't much of a conversationalist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we found the fourth,\" Raphael said, stating the obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goddess\u2026\" Ignatz gasped. \"Marianne's so\u2026 big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne eyed the tea cup below her. The soft scent of lavender blend tea wafted through the air. It was always nice of the professor to go out of her way and brew her favorite. Her gaze then drifted towards the plate of scones. She has skipped lunch earlier, mostly because the line in the dining hall was bustling with people. It wouldn't hurt to grab a treat or two. After all, Professor Byleth had a habit of bringing too many treats. She\u2019d just hate to see any of it go to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the ant-like Deer below, the irony was not lost on them that their meekest classmate and healer was the one currently threatening their lives. Marianne was more than intimidating at their current size, as she could easily kill them several times over without even thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey, Leonie, stay put, you\u2019re going to fall!\u201d Lysithea nagged, rushing to the edge of the scone. A sense of vertigo washed over her as she looked over the steep cliff of flaky dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuh-uh!\u201d Leonie shot back, scaling down the wall as if it were a mountain climb. \u201cYou can stay up there and get eaten, but I\u2019m getting out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda stepped up to the edge. \u201cUgh, this would be so much easier if my wyvern shrunk with me.\u201d She knelt down and also began making her way down the baked good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Just where are you going!?\u201d Lysithea cried, realizing that she would be the only one left stuck on the scone. She hesitated again as she gazed over the edge. It wasn\u2019t that she disliked heights or anything, it\u2019s just that her two crests, while making her magically gifted, also kept her physically feeble. She lacked the constitution and the strength to make it the whole way down. The last thing she wanted was to end up as a stain on a pristine porcelain plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she just decided to stay put at the top of the mountain and wait for help.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just lovely that you go out of your way to catch extra fish for the kittens around the monastery, Professor,\u201d </b>Marianne said. <b>\u201cThey might be stray, but they deserve love and affection as well.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor nodded, taking a sip from her own cup. She leaned forward as she placed it back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, that might be the most I\u2019ve heard Marianne speak,\u201d Raphael commented. He was a bit too distracted to notice his massive professor\u2019s chest coming straight towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRaphael, run!\u201d Ignatz cried, turning around, and running from the encroaching shadow. The larger student did the same, surprisingly catching up to the archer and barely escaping being crushed under the professor\u2019s generous bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair found themselves just inches away from the giant pair of breasts. They caught their breath, just glad that they hadn\u2019t met their early end just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Raphael got an idea. \u201cYo, Ignatz, we can climb her necklace thingy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnatz blanched. \u201cAre\u2014Are you sure, Raphael? W-wouldn\u2019t the professor get mad if she finds us\u2026 on her chest\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaphael sprung to his feet. \u201cNah, she\u2019d understand,\u201d he answered as he grabbed Ignatz\u2019 arm and practically dragged the weaker boy over to the cloth hanging off the metal. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna want to hold on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnatz did as he was told, gripping onto the pink fabric tightly as Byleth leaned back, lifting the two high in the air. His stomach jumped up into his chest, making it hard for him to breathe, and sending a nauseous sensation. He closed his eyes and gripped tighter, not even wanting to think about the fall from this height. If he didn\u2019t die on impact, he would most likely land on her lap and get lost in her intricate leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI noticed that you like looking over the bridge,\u201d</b> Byleth said. <b>\u201cIt\u2019s quite a lovely view.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne looked down at her hands, watching as the drink in her hands shook slightly with her hands. <b>\u201cUm, yes\u2026 The view is... nice.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Claude and Lorenz continued their wild sprint across the dining table. Time was certainly of the essence as the pair of giant women above made small talk, letting the tea cool down. It wouldn\u2019t be long before one of them decided to fill the gap of silence with a treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>As much as I like the professor, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to go to another one of her tea parties ever again,</i> Claude thought, his heart racing from his impromptu cardio session and the adrenaline kicking in. By the time the pair mad it to the dessert tray, Leonie and Hilda were roughly halfway down their climb.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cAre there any good books you\u2019ve read recently?\u201d </b>Byleth asked, gently leading the conversation around her shy student\u2019s interests. <b>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for something new.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne nodded, some light returning to her eyes. <b>\u201cI\u2019m in the middle of one now. It\u2019s about a long lost princess in Valentia.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIt sounds wonderful,\u201d</b> Byleth said, lazily stirring the spoon around her cup. While the slight grinding noise was almost too quiet for her to notice, it was a loud, painful screech for the shrunken students down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah, stop that, Teach!\u201d Claude yelled, shielding his ears. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was his ears ringing or the stirring spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe can\u2019t hear you, genius!\u201d Yelled a voice from above. The pair of boys looked up to find Lysithea still at the top of the scone mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude cupped his hands over his mouth. \u201cWhat are you still doing up there? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re also afraid of heights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no!\u201d Lysithea countered, unintentionally sounding like a child. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to fall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie hit the ground first, jumping from just high enough to make a safe landing. Hilda followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCatch me, Claude!\u201d the pink haired girl called as she let go of the wall and free fell. The house leader simply let her hit the ground. \u201cYou dick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsider it payback for my first shrinking incident,\u201d he said, helping her up after a quick laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey, I\u2019m still up here!\u201d Lysithea called, getting everyone\u2019s attention again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just warp yourself down!\" Claude yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would if I could,\" she argued. \"Don't make me warp you up here with me.\"</span></div></div>",

Marianne looked down towards her stomach, blushing self-consciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marianne,\" Byleth's brow furrowed in concern. \"Have you been skipping meals again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... just lunch today,\" Marianne admitted. \"There were a lot of people in the dining hall. I was uncomfortable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth resisted the urge to scold Marianne for not taking better care of herself. If her concerns about her student were warranted, she needed to make sure their tea times were as pleasant and comforting for her as possible. Instead, she offered a gentle smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you help yourself to a scone, then? That's why I brought them, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you, professor,\" Marianne nodded with a shy smile as she reached for the dessert tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on the plate, Marianne's ant-sized classmates began to panic as her long, tree-trunk sized fingers grasped the scone next to Lysithea's, bringing the hulking, sugary land mass into the air with absolutely no effort as it disappeared into Marianne's mouth, the sounds of her chewing echoing ominously above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lysithea, seriously, you need to get off the cookie! Right now!\" Hilda yelled to the young mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can't!\" Lysithea cried. Between her fear of falling and the fear of what would happen to her if she didn't get off the scone in time, she was starting to cry. Her four friends below were deliberately not drawing attention to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just jump at this point!\" Claude shouted. \"I'll catch you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you caught Hilda?\" Lysithea sniped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will catch you, Lysithea!\" Lorenz cut in front of Claude. \"I give you my word!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young mage whimpered in fear, still paralyzed by the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"These are delicious, professor,\"</b> Marianne boomed as she swallowed the scone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"It's a new recipe I got from Professor Manuella,\"</b> said Byleth. <b>\"Please, have as many as you like.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, SCREW this!\" Leonie exclaimed as she started to climb back up the sugary wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonie, what the hell are you doing?!\" Claude demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be ready to catch us both!\" Leonie snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their last battle in Renue Village, Leonie had a clear shot at the Death Knight. Just as she shouted her challenge to him and drew her spear, Lysithea warped her away from the battle, then used her magic to knock the fearsome adversary from his horse and force him to retreat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time, Leonie was furious. She was convinced that the young mage deliberately ruined her chance to show her skills in front of Captain Jeralt. However, after some time to reflect, as well as a firm dressing down from both Claude and Professor Byleth, Leonie was forced to admit that she had grossly overestimated her own skills. In fact, it was very likely that by pulling her from the battle, Lysithea saved her life that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs someone who detested debt more than anything, Leonie would not rest until she repaid the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Leonie?!\" Lysithea blurted out as Leonie finished scaling the wall. \"What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not leaving you behind, Lysithea,\" Leonie held her hand out to the younger girl. \"Come on! We'll climb down together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I can't!\" Lysithea flinched away from her. Leonie growled in frustration and grabbed her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then hold onto me and don't look down!\" she ordered. \"Because we need to get off of here before... oh no... AHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground around them shook as five gigantic fingers closed in around it, and a strong downward wind forced the two girls to their knees as their sugary platform was lifted up at terrifying speed. Marianne had chosen their scone to eat next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lysithea,\" Leonie gasped urgently as Marianne's face loomed ever closer, the massive healer completely unaware that she was about to devour two of her friends along with her sugary treat. \"Lysithea, you have to do what Claude said. You have to warp us down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The spell doesn't work that way!\" Lysithea argued. \"I can only bring people to me! I can't teleport!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then MAKE it work that way!\" Leonie began to tremble as Marianne opened her mouth. Thin cords of saliva dripped from the roof to the tongue as it stretched out slightly in anticipation of the sugary confection. Mushy remains of the previous scone were visible between her teeth, serving as a grim reminder of the fate that awaited them. \"Lysithea, I don't know much about magic, but I know that you're the best mage at this academy! And it's not because of your second crest, it's because you're you! Now work your magic and save us just like you did in Renue Village!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll...

To teleport both herself and someone else across a vast distance would be a monumental task, one that was practically impossible even for the best spellcasters in all of Fodlan. However, whether it was by the 'blessings' of her dual Crests, her months of training in the arcane arts, or just the sheer adrenaline when she felt darkness fall upon her as the scone finally passed through Marianne's lips, Lysithea von Ordelia did the impossible. The mage screamed in pain as she pushed beyond her limit, and in a puff of light, both Leonie and herself disappeared (just as their unaware classmate finally closed their jaw and bit into the scone.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it always took Lysithea the utmost concentration to use her warping spell. When she had saved Leonie from the Death Knight in their prior mission, she had thankfully been defended from any distractions or attacks, and she had focused clearly on the spot right in front of her with her own eyes. Suffice to say, being the size of a speck and filled with the dread that she might be turned into mush by her friend's teeth had been far more distracting for the mage. Now, as she and Leonie tumbled through the space between spaces for the briefest of moments, her thoughts of Claude and the others on the table were consumed by the gigantic Marianne that could have been their unwitting executioner. Consequently, it was all the spell needed for a destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight, sound and air returned to the two girls as they were deposited back into the waking world, landing together in a crumpled heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie groaned - it felt like their stomach had been flipped, turned inside out and then flipped again. \"Uuuuugh...\" Leonie took a few seconds to flex her limbs until the feeling returned to them before pushing herself back to her feet. She was more than a little dizzy, but patting herself down, she seemed intact, alive and not currently drowning in saliva or melting in stomach acid. \"B-By the Goddess, you did it! Lysithea, you really did it! I knew you could-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea coughed up globules of blood in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right... I guess that did a number on you, huh? Don't worry, I can take it from here...\" Leonie quickly sought to return the favor, kneeling down and hoisting the borderline-comatose mage over their back, wrapping their thin arms around her shoulders so that they might carry them. Leonie was thankful that Lysithea was so short and light compared to her other classmates (although they were still slightly heavier than she would have expected for someone so frail - she chalked it up to all the sweets and desserts that they must have eaten as of late.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You good?\" Leonie asked, turning her head to eye her piggybacking partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea mumbled something that vaguely sounded like an acknowledgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie nodded, before turning to examine her surroundings, now that her senses were finally starting to return to her in earnest. \"Now... Just where the heck are we anyway...?\"</span></div></div>",

She wasn\u2019t going to allow herself to have her last memories be of the chewed up mush inside her friend\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie, while not the most spiritual person, made silent prayers to the goddess as she was carried into the dark cave that took them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny deer below watched in terror as two of their classmates disappeared into the depths of Marianne\u2019s mouth. All that they knew of them, from their idle chatters to fighting at each other\u2019s side was reduced to the sounds of chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda winced, feeling bile rise up to the back of her throat. Lorenz dramatically dropped to his knees while Claude stood stone faced, shocked by the sudden turn of events. For once, he was left with no idea of what to do. Even getting the Professor\u2019s attention wouldn\u2019t help unless she somehow had the power to turn back time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a chance they\u2019re still\u2026\u201d Claude trailed off. He hated relying on chance, but he hated not knowing what was going on even more. For all he knew they were simultaneously alive and dead. But it wouldn\u2019t remain that long as Marianne continued to snack on the treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any way\u2026\u201d Lorenz didn\u2019t finish either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Goddess, I\u2019m gonna be sick,\u201d Hilda groaned, joining Lorenz on her knees and clutching her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude\u2019s eyes went wide, digging into a pocket and pulling out a bag of powder. \u201cThat\u2019s it! All we need to do is spike Marianne's tea with my stomach poison. Hilda, you\u2019re amazing! I could kiss you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda threw up in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut not right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny trace of light disappeared within the confines of the healer\u2019s mouth as Marianne bit down. The sudden break, had sent the pair of tiny teenagers tumbling down. In the panic, they had let go of each other, quickly losing track of the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea got off relatively easier as she slowly slipped down the back of the massive tongue. She tried to claw onto anything to latch onto, but found nothing as she fell into a deep chasm, sliding down the already lubricated muscles that were Marianne\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie, however, was much less lucky. She had managed to grab onto a crumb, one that had already been soaked in the giantess\u2019 spit. However, that didn\u2019t matter as it extended her chance to survive, giving her a buoy to hold onto in the lake like pools of saliva collecting in Marianne\u2019s mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was thrown all around as she learned what it was like to be a piece of meat. She kept her grip tight embracing hits as she collided with Marianne\u2019s molars. She wasn\u2019t going to let herself get swallowed so easily. Unfortunately, it seemed everything conspired against her. The smelling the humidity was nauseating. The constant earthquakes threatened to throw her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe survived all that. However, it was not enough as her latest obstacle proved much too overwhelming to navigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight flooded the inside of her mouth, giving the microscopic Leonie a view of the outside world. It was only a sliver, her lips barely parting, and the light diluted even more through the giantess\u2019 massive teeth.  However, it was just enough for Leonie to realize that  Marianne was taking a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tidal wave of tea came flooding in, chasing after the shrunken knight in training. Leonie bolted up onto her feet and tried to run to find some sort of refuge. Unfortunately the near boiling tsunami came in at an unfathomable speed, sweeping her away and dragging her to the back of the giantess\u2019 throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was a destructive force of nature for Leonie actually was just a cursory sip of tea for the quiet mage. It was still much too hot to enjoy fully, but it did wash down the cookie rather well.</span></div></div>",

She watched in a mixture of awe and terror as Marianne moved a mountain, hoisting it up and crunching into it with barely a waiver of effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paralysis of indecision was over - even if she was likely to go careening down to the hard porcelain below, she\u2019d rather die here than grinded to pulp between her friend\u2019s incisors. Lysithea whimpered and finally pulled herself over the edge to begin her descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise and relief, the surface of the scone was not as difficult to scale as she had initially thought. Perhaps it was due to the sugary treat and its properties, or perhaps the adrenaline of the moment was simply pushing Lysithea beyond her limits. Then again, the professor had been tutoring her in the art of brawling recently. She had no earthly clue as to <i>why</i>, but if it gave her the arm strength to make her way down to relative safety, then she wouldn\u2019t look the gift horse in the mouth. She didn\u2019t want to think about mouths at all right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttagirl, Lysithea! You got this!\u201d Leonie called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, way to go!\u201d Claude followed. Even now, his fellow students found new ways to surprise and impress him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea continued to scramble down as best as she could. Her breath was running ragged and she felt light-headed, but her arms and legs pushed on. She was probably going to faint the moment she reached the tray, but as long as she could hold out until then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage was just nearing the base of the scone when the Golden Deer was swathed in shadow. Lysithea, far too focused on staying alive at the moment, couldn\u2019t turn to face whatever was causing it. \u201cWh-what\u2019s going on?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer remaining classmates slowly turned to face the source of the eclipse - a hand far larger than anything that they\u2019d ever seen before hanging over them. Far above, the cold emotionless eyes of their colossal professor stared down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Goddess...\u201d Lorenz muttered under their breath, taken aback by just how imposing their giant teacher truly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeeeey! Professor! Down heeeeeeere!\u201d Hilda jumped up and down on the spot, waving their arms with all their heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor remained indifferent. Their eyes showed no reaction - not even the slightest hint of alarm or surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude felt a cold chill run up their spine. \u201cThat\u2019s not good...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Byleth reached over to pluck a scone for herself, her hand faltered as it neared her bounty. Her emerald-green could just about spot a few specks wriggling around at the base of the nearest scone. There was even one clinging to the surface of the scone itself, no doubt nibbling away at the sugary treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth felt a flicker of frustration. She was certain that she had wiped the table spotless before setting up for her tea party, and yet bugs were still insistent on their invasions. She had hoped that the days growing colder would stave them away, but perhaps her baked treats were just too delectable for the foraging creatures to pass up. Nonetheless, she couldn\u2019t have pests infesting the tea table, especially if they were going to crawl all over the dessert tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-Professor?\u201d Marianne asked sheepishly, having just finished another one of the baked treats herself. \u201cIs something the matter...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth flexed their hand.</span></div></div>",

Minor, minor spoilers for Lorenz and Leonie\u2019s B support.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Byleth answered. \u201cJust some ants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne didn\u2019t respond, instead taking a sip of her own drink. While she cared for most forms of life in nature, she felt rather indifferent to most insects, including ants. Sure, the Goddess had a role for them in the world, but it wasn\u2019t something she particularly valued. Though, for some inexplicable reason, she was fascinated by the way Byleth decided to cast judgement on the puny pests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comment had sent the shrunken students into a panic. They were found, but they were logically mistaken for a group of insects. Lysithea hurried down, but still found a ways to go before she could safely let go. Meanwhile, the others hesitated, unsure of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re not ants, Professor!\u201d Hilda cried, panic settling in on her voice. \u201cWe\u2019re your students, who you love so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pleas went unheard as the massive tip of Byleth\u2019s finger came crashing down, crushing the tiny pink haired girl immediately. Everyone jumped back at the suddenness of Hilda\u2019s death. Arguably the most lively student in the house was now gone, reduced to a red smear stuck in the ridges of the massive professor\u2019s fingerprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Goddess!\u201d Leonie gasped, tearing her eyes away at the gruesome sight of Hilda\u2019s remains on the formerly spotless plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way,\u201d Claude said coldly, failing to comprehend the sudden reality that one of his closest friends was now gone. \u201cHilda? HILDA!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to rush in, only for his cape to pull him back. He turned to see Lorenz holding onto him. \u201cPull yourself together, Claude! She\u2019ll do the same to us if we don\u2019t retreat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude nodded, taking in a pained breath. \u201cR-right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could truly get their bearings, the shadow returned, this time heading straight towards poor Lysithea stranded on the cliff of sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLysithea! Just let go!\u201d Claude demanded, hoping to prevent another senseless death. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was far too late as the tiny mage was caught between Byleth\u2019s thumb and index finger. She didn\u2019t even survive the lightest of pressure as she popped almost immediately. It didn\u2019t help that she was basically ground into a pulp as the giantess rubbed her fingers together, mashing her with some crumbs she tore off the dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBits of flaky crust and mashed Lysithea rained down on those below, threatening to crush them flat if they remained still. The three took action, running away from the shadow of the giantess and looking for any kind of safe place to hide. Unfortunately, it seemed that the vengeful titan was determined to eliminate them, not content to just let them escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rushed to the edge of the plate, hoping to hop down and take cover under the rim. The gap, while high, was survivable if they just landed the right way. Claude took the lead, landing on both feet and letting his momentum break into a roll. Lorenz followed suit, surviving the fall, but finding it incredibly painful on landing as he limped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Leonie jumped off, landing awkwardly on an already injured foot. She let out a yelp in pain as she collapsed to the ground. Lorenz quickly rushed to her, already knowing the cause of her sudden fall. He helped her up and draped her over his shoulder, throwing away any noble pretense as he was more concerned with helping a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Byleth returned, stabbing her finger right on top of the pair and snuffing out their screams. The pad of her finger had crushed Leonie, while the tip of her fingernail cut right through Lorenz\u2019 waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ironic,</i> Lorenz thought grimly. <i>A noble life reduced to the death of a lowly ant.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude stood, mouth agape in horror as he seemed to be the last remaining survivor of the incident. He turned to Marianne, who seemed to be watching him from high above. <i>Didn't she love animals? Why didn\u2019t she put a stop to this?</i> He shook those thoughts out of his head, deciding to run to her and hope he could get her attention rather than the Professor that looked intent on killing him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne watched as Byleth exterminated the ants on the table. There was something odd about the way they acted. The way they hesitated before moving or stuck together or reacted to the events differently than just an animal instinct. The professor\u2019s methods of eliminating them were strange as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Was she\u2026 having fun doing this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth dragged her finger across the table. The blood of her students blended in a little too well to the reddish tint of the tea table. The existence of blood would have been a giveaway if she really looked out for it. However, no red flags were raised other than the need to get rid of these pests ruining what was a perfectly good tea time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last remaining ant seemed to be making a break for it, heading towards Marianne at the other end of the table. Byleth leaned forward, extending her reach just far enough as she rested her chest up on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaphael and Ignatz screamed as the table came closer at an alarming rate. The professor\u2019s leaning had spelled a quick death for the both of them as her massive (even at normal size) chest came down onto the tabletop. Raphael, despite his muscles and brute strength, crumpled under the weight of Byleth\u2019s breasts. Ignatz also succumbed, becoming a splotch of red not too dissimilar to spilled paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Byleth hung her finger over the last ant, completely unaware that she had just killed two more of her students without even thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"Wait!\"</b></font> Marianne bellowed.</span></div></div>",

I'd imagine having to frequently rewind time to prevent their students' deaths would do a number on their psyche, no matter how stone-faced they are in the game. Also, mild spoilers for Sothis's identity.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Byleth leaned over the last remaining ant, Marianne squinted to get a good look at it. Why was it moving towards her? And was it her imagination, or did it seem to be... waving?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\" Marianne bellowed. Byleth awkwardly straddled the table, further smearing Raphael and Ignatz's remains as she looked to her student with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Marianne? Do you see more of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't think they're ants!\" Marianne answered as she leaned in to get a closer look. She gasped as Claude's form finally became recognizable to her. \"P-professor! They're... they're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a mounting sense of dread from Marianne's behavior, Byleth put her finger down to the side and took a good look at the insect she was about to crush. Her eyes widened as she saw Claude, waving frantically to her with a look of sheer terror and despair on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was covered in blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Byleth breathed as she slumped back into the chair. She looked down and noticed a pair of red stains on her chest. She made the mistake of examining them closely, spotting what she was pretty sure was the mangled body of Raphael. \"No, no, no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor...\" Marianne stared at Byleth in terror. \"You... you killed them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth stared at her trembling hand, soaked in the blood of her precious students. \"NonononoNONO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth collapsed, falling out of her chair as she lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth awoke in a dark tomb. Across from her, sitting on a familiar throne, Sothis looked at her sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I killed them!\" Byleth cried, collapsing onto her knees. \"I killed them with my own hands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't have known,\" Sothis said gently, approaching Byleth and embracing her in a hug. \"I was there in your mind, Byleth. I thought they were ants as well. This isn't your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-send me back,\" Byleth pleaded to the amnesiac goddess. \"Please... please send me back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Sothis nodded. She may not have been willing to allow use of the Divine Pulse during Byleth's first disastrous tea party after she mispronounced Lysithea's name and awkwardly asked her about boys in the monastery, but she would certainly let Byleth rewind time for this. \"I'll send you to just before Marianne arrived. They should all still be alive then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth nodded. \"Thank you, Sothis,\" she said with a shaky breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to figure out how they came to be so reduced and on your tea table,\" Sothis said, returning to her chair with a contemplative pose. \"Whoever did this to them clearly placed them there with this exact outcome in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The monastery's been compromised,\" Byleth mused, thinking of Tomas and Jeritza and their betrayals earlier that year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be careful of who you trust,\" Sothis agreed. \"For now, go back to the start of the tea party. Your students need you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food's not giant!\" Ignatz yelled. \"We're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnatz was cut off as a loud boom echoed behind Claude. The other three looked up and began backing away with varying levels of fear. Swallowing nervously, Claude turned around, only to see a very familiar amulet surrounded by two of the largest breasts he had ever seen. He craned his neck up, and his jaw drop in shock as he took in the impossibly giant visage of Professor Byleth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expressionless face framed by long green hair was visible in more detail than Claude had ever seen before. Her eyes were focused on the teacup next to them as she poured from an equally giant teapot, the normally quiet sound of the tea meeting the cup echoing like an oppressive waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teach!\" Claude snapped out of his stupor and called up to her. \"Hey! TEACH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother,\" Ignatz sighed. \"We all yelled to her when she was setting up the table. We're way too small for her to hear us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to immediately prove Ignatz wrong, Byleth suddenly gasped in shock as she dropped the teapot, which shattered loudly on the floor below. She began to scan the table, her eyes sweeping over it methodically until she spotted four tiny specks near her teacup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Claude? Boys? Is that you?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Teach!\" Claude waved casually. \"Glad you found us so quickly. Little help here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth smiled, barely blinking back tears as she nodded. <b>\"Where are the girls?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"PROFESSOR! OVER HERE!\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Byleth was actively listening for it, she could hear the tiny cries of her students from the direction of the dessert tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Stay there,\"</b> she ordered the tiny boys as she carefully got up and approached the tower of scones. Almost immediately, she spotted Hilda, Leonie, and Lysithea waving to her. Byleth reached for them before wincing and jerking her hand back, remembering the sight of her students' blood on it. Looking around, she saw a clean stirring spoon and brought that to them instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Climb on, girls,\"</b> she instructed, holding the spoon as steady as possible as she watched the trio board it, with Hilda and Leonie holding each of Lysithea's hands to ease the younger girl's fear of heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Professor?\"</b> Byleth looked up to see Marianne enter the room, taking in her teacher's odd behavior and the broken teapot on the floor and frowning in concern. <b>\"Is everything alright?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude barely restrained himself from throwing up. Glancing at the other six shrunken students, he could tell they were similarly afflicted. Apparently, having Physic cast on you when you weren't actually injured was a nauseating experience- like the magical or spiritual equivalent of eating too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most annoying thing was that there WAS something wrong with him and his friends, and Physic was doing nothing to fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Again,\"</b> Byleth ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please no...\" Claude muttered. This plea went unheard by the two giantesses up above as Marianne once more cast Physic on her shunken classmates in the vain hope of growing them back. This was too much for Hilda, who finally threw up off the side of the desk they were sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I don't think it's working, Professor,\"</b> Marianne said apologetically as she slumped onto an empty seat in the empty classroom they had relocated to. <b>\"I'm sorry. It must be my fault. If I were only a better healer...\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"No, Marianne,\"</b> Byleth shook her head, immediately stopping her emotionally fragile student from blaming herself. <b>\"Whatever's happened to them must be too advanced for normal Faith magic to counteract.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should consult Professor Manuela and Hanneman,\" Lorenz suggested. \"Or perhaps even bring the matter to the Knights of Seiros or Seteth and Lady Rhea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You must be careful of who you trust,</i> Sothis's warning echoed in Byleth's mind. <b>\"No. We don't know who hasn't also been compromised like Tomas. And if the last thing Claude remembers is trying to search for forbidden relic information in the library, we can't rule out Seteth either.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Captain Jeralt?\" Leonie immediately suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"We can probably trust my father,\"</b> Byleth agreed. <b>\"But he's away on a mission for the rest of the month. Remember?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnatz suddenly shot up as the mention of Seteth reminded him of something. \"What about Flayn? We still need to find out if she's shrunk too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth frowned. Once the seven tiny Golden Deer were secure and out of the way, she and Marianne had searched every inch of the tea table trying to find the young green haired girl that had transferred to their house midway through the year. That they'd found nothing hopefully meant that Flayn was safe and normal sized somewhere in the monastery, but the idea of her being mistaken for an insect and killed just as Byleth had done to her students filled the concerned professor with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"We should look for her while we investigate,\"</b> Byleth agreed. <b>\"Marianne, let's split up and search the monastery. If you find Flayn, no matter what size she is, bring her here.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne swallowed. As daunting as searching the monastery by herself was, her friends were counting on her. <b>\"A...alright.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about us?\" Claude spoke up. Byleth looked at her shrunken students. The guilt she felt for killing them earlier was weighing heavily on her. On the one hand, she felt they were safest as far from her as possible. On the other hand, she didn't want to let them out of her sight for fear of accidentally harming them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Professor?\"</b> Marianne's voice brought Byleth back to reality.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't easily carry her shrunken students in such a way that wouldn't be dangerous, and she needed to search the monastery for clues and possibly a shrunken Flayn. Finding Flayn was important enough that Marianne, as the only normal sized person she knew she could trust, needed to search too, and her uniform didn't have pockets. The choice, therefore, was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marianne, can you carry your classmates to my room?\" Byleth asked. \"I'll give you the key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... of course, Professor,\" Marianne nodded. \"But... wouldn't it make more sense for you to do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I hold them in my hands, it will make me think of seeing their blood on them.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd prefer to start the search for Flayn as soon as possible,\" Byleth came up with an excuse on the fly. \"Once you drop them off, can you search around the fishing pond? I see her there on occasion. I'll check near the library and Seteth and Lady Rhea's quarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Professor,\" Marianne lowered her hands to the desk so the shrunken Golden Deer could climb on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and Marianne? I hope I'm wrong and that Flayn was just somehow missed like you were, but in case I'm not... watch your step.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as nervous as Marianne was, her hands were gentle and steady, calling upon a life's experience of dealing with birds and other skittish animals. In what was a surprisingly short and uneventful trip- save for having to take the long way to avoid Shamir and Catherine, who were having an unusually animated conversation in the courtyard- she brought her shrunken friends to the professor's room and placed them carefully on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Are you all alright?\"</b> Marianne asked. <b>\"Can I get any of you anything before I go?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could go for some food!\" Raphael answered immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie groaned in exasperation. \"Seriously?! Is that all you ever...\" She was cut off as her stomach loudly growled. \"Huh... okay, I guess it's been a while since any of us have eaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"The professor and I never finished our tea party,\"</b> Marianne recalled. <b>\"It would be a shame to let those snacks go to waste. Hold on, I'll be right back.\"</b> With that, Marianne quickly left. The sound of her closing and locking the door echoed throughout the cavernous room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Claude sighed with relief. \"At least we're safe now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But who could have done this to us?\" Ignatz wondered. \"Was it the Flame Emperor? Could they really be here in the monastery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After Tomas... or Solon, I guess, did what he did, anything's possible,\" Claude shrugged. \"Honestly, I'm more concerned about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude was cut off as Marianne returned with a plate of cookies from her ill-fated tea time with Byleth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Here we are,\"</b> Marianne gingerly set them on the desk next to her friends. <b>\"I promise I'll get you something healthier from the dining hall later, but these should at least tide you over.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have our thanks, Marianne,\" Lorenz bowed. \"But... were you not supposed to search for Flayn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Oh my goodness!\"</b> Marianne gasped. Fearful that a delay on her part could lead to the possibly shrunken girl's demise, Marianne bolted from the room, not thinking to lock the door behind her this time as she slammed it hard enough to create a small quake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea eyed the giant dessert tray before her. \"If any of you tell the Professor about what I'm about to do, I'm using you for spell practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, Lysithea,\" Hilda nodded. \"We know you want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shout somewhere between a cheer and a war cry, Lysithea charged for the nearest cookie, intending to devour as much of the giant sweet as possible. Raphael, never one to turn down food of any kind, was close behind her. As the rest of the class began to eat at a more sedate pace, Hilda approached Claude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Claude? You've got that 'thinking about a mystery too hard for your own good' look again. Still thinking about who might've shrunk us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah,\" Claude nodded. \"But at this point, I'm worried more about Teach. Did she seem... off... to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Hilda tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's subtle, but she seems kinda freaked out about this,\" Claude said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look at us,\" Hilda gestured towards the two of them. \"This isn't something that happens all the time, Claude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but when Miklan turned into a giant monster, she didn't even bat an eye,\" Claude countered. \"But something about this has her so freaked out, she doesn't even want to touch us. Like when she used that spoon to get you and the other girls off the cookie, or how she had Marianne take us here instead of doing it herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is odd,\" Hilda agreed. \"What do you think it means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir conversation was cut short by a booming series of knocks on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Professor?\"</b> a woman's voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretend we're not here!\" Claude quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie frowned as she looked up from the cookie. \"Wait... is that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ominous creak silenced the shrunken students as the door slowly opened. The giantess on the other end was visibly just as surprised by the door opening as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marianne forgot to lock the door!\" Hilda shouted as yet another normal sized person, unaware of their plight and all the more dangerous because of it, set foot in the room...</span></div></div>",

It had been long enough now that the other students had stopped needling her with pointless queries about if she was 'really okay' or 'putting on a face.' <i>Oh, if only they knew,</i> she thought to herself. Now she was free to go about her business, and if anyone asked, she was merely looking for the professor to assist her with some stubborn spellcasting problems of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Monica's plan. Kronya's plan was quite different - she just wanted to check the likely places where a few pests might be hiding now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'relic' she had planted in the library had worked like a treat, easily falling into the hands of that insufferable 'Claude' creature and the whelps that crowded around him all the time. She did wonder why Solon hadn't opted for something more immediately lethal against those who had interfered with his work in Remire, but if it could have meant a far more despair-inducing end at the fingertips of their own beloved professor, then Kronya was more than happy to oblige. It made her all the more furious that such a satisfying end of the story had slipped away. She had tracked down the table where Professor Byleth usually held their tea parties, only to find it woefully bereft of tiny red stains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, this was an error she could now correct herself. After checking the other tables and the dining hall, she had surmised that the professor might have discovered them and taken them to their room for safekeeping. Kronya could feel a tingle in her spine as she skipped closer and closer, imagining all the weird and wonderful ways she could dispose of these interlopers. <i>Perhaps I'll pick them off one by one?</i> She wondered, already making a murderous flowchart in her head to maximize the misfortune she could sow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Monica stood before the hardwood door of the teacher's room. \"Professor?\" She knocked upon the door, and was pleasantly surprised to see it swing forward in response. <i>They didn't even lock their room? This is just pathetic.</i> She poked her head to the seemingly vacant room, remaining in character just in case. \"I, uh, was having some trouble with my spells, I was wondering if you could help me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no response, the girl stepped into the room, and her murky red eyes began to skim around for her prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Monica entered the room, leaving the Golden Deers in awe at another impossibly large figure looming in the 'distance.' Claude watched intently as the enormous student scanned her head around in apparent confusion as to where the professor may have gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, thank goodness, it's just Monica,\" Ignatz said, thankful that it wasn't a far clumsier individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenz cleared his throat. \"We'll be in danger if she remains unaware. We should do our utmost to get their attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, yeah!\" Hilda agreed. Hilda began to inhale as much as she could with her surprisingly powerful lungs, but just before she could shout out in the hopes of grabbing the giant's attention, a hand swiftly slapped itself over her open mouth. It was Claude's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, behind the books now!\" The house leader dragged a protesting Hilda along with him behind the books to evade Monica's line of sight. The students who heard quickly followed suit (despite their confusion) and fled from the plate to the 'cover' of the stacked books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's gotten into you?\" Leonie asked, eager for an explanation as Hilda wrestled herself free and stuck her tongue out at Claude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude peeked his head around the 'tower' and kept his eyes locked on Monica as she pivoted hers around the room. He had always found Monica more than a tad suspicious. He was no stranger in insincere smiles, and she had recovered from her kidnapping a little <i>too</i> quickly for his liking. However, it was more than that now. \"Doesn't anyone find it odd that Monica is looking for Teach when they're not even in our house? And on a day like today? Doesn't that seem like too much of a coincidence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenz scratched his nose. \"I... I suppose that's not the norm, but it hardly explains your rash behavior. It's very unbecoming of a noble to act this way, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then tell me why they're looking around on the surfaces instead of just leaving. They can plainly see that Teach isn't here, so what else could they be looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda furrowed her brow in a very Claude-like manner. \"...Us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo,\" Claude continued. \"And how do you think they could know about us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grim realization fell upon the students. It wasn't definitive proof, but it raised a lot of unsettling questions, and now they could understand why Claude was erring on the side of caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so let's just sit this one out. We'll wait till she leaves, tell Teach about it, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude did a quick head count... and felt his blood run cold. They were one man short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea grunted with pain as she tried to wretch her leg free from the gooey chocolate chip puddle it had been submerged in by one misplaced step. The sweet sticky 'quicksand' kept her limb glued in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great!</i> Lysithea thought to herself. <i>How could this day get any worse?!</i></span></div></div>",

Even Claude was more or less frozen in place at the rare sound of Marianne raising her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something the matter?\" Byleth asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this moment Claude began to feel relieved. Marianne had just saved him from a similar fate as the rest of the Golden Deer. All he had to do was get their attention and quite possibly some help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know what he'd tell the professor and Marianne about the rest of their class. He hadn't known the teach long, but he knew despite her lack of emotional response she cared a great deal about all of them. If she found out she'd snuffed them all out common insects then it would destroy her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne was very much the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid girl began to grow slightly nervous at the revelation that she'd actually raised her voice. \"I-I think that maybe,,, I should get this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Byleth's face remained blank while Claude's eyes widened in terror. Did she just say she should be the one to kill him? <i>\"I thought she loved animals!\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you loved animals...\" Byleth began. \"Although, I guess that doesn't extend to insects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne shook her head. \"It's not that I hate insects, I just don't particularly care for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I understand.\" Byleth replied before moving her finger away. \"He's all yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No.\" Claude whispered as he began to back away. These two were never going to recognize him, instead they were going to turn him into a nondescript stain. \"Teach?! Marianne?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice never reached them, the size barrier was too great. Had he been loud enough he might've been able to save everyone. Now he was all alone about to meet the same grizzly end. Not on the battlefield like a warrior, but as an ant in his own backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet felt like cement as the tip of Marianne's finger was now the one looming over him. Unbeknownst to him or the professor she'd never actually smashed a bug before, at least not on purpose. She'd always either shied away or found some other means of scooping them up, but this was the first time she was willing going to snuff one out. As bizarre as it was, watching the professor crush pests with her finger was fascinating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the simple act of bringing her finger down spelled doom for the bug that otherwise ruined a good tea party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA punishment befitting the crime...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne brought her finger down... and Claude was no more.</span></div></div>",

He'd recognize that snow white hair and those violet orbs anywhere. It was none other than the missing female member of their house, Lysithea. This was the worst outcome the golden deer could have asked for. Even though she tried to hide it, it was no secret the young mage had a sweet tooth. If professor Byleth had invited her for tea time then that only spelt disaster for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...\" Ignatz gulped. \"...This is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whaddaya know? Looks like Lysithea finally the tallest student in the Golden Deer house.\" Raphael half joked. It was more the truth than an actual jest. They'd all shrunk so by default she was the tallest. Although his little observation did little to calm down his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea eyed the spread with a smile adorning her face, the smell of her favorite tea reaching her nose... Honeyed-Fruit Blend. No other tea compared. Then there was the mouth watering sight of sweets. Outside of the professor she hadn't told anyone else about her sweet tooth. Oh how she loved when professor Byleth would pull her aside like this. Sure she did this sort of thing with all the students, but with her it always seemed like she did just that little bit extra. She couldn't wait to sink her teeth into those scones!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look in those eyes made the rest of the near microscopic Golden Deer nervous. They all now knew who was joining their professor for tea. This wouldn't bode well for any of them. They needed to figure all this out and get off this tea table yesterday. If they didn't... no one would ever find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marianne! I want you to stay close to me, got it?\" Leonie ordered/asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.\" The blunette stuttered,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shake a leg you two. If we don't get off this scone soon we're finished!\" HIlda barked before carefully scaled  down the baked desert. If she were normal sized she wouldn't mind taking a bite herself. Too bad for her, Lysithea beat her to it and snatched a thankfully empty cookie from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken members of the Golden Deer watched on in both awe and horror as Lysithea's massive jaws crushed the large cookie into paste. They could each make out each and every crunch made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT WAS GREAT PROFESSOR! YOU'RE COOKIES ARE THE BEST!\" Lysithea smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THANK YOU!\" Byleth smiled back. \"I JUST DO WHAT I CAN!\"</span></div></div>",

Plus knowing the truth about me would probably drive him insane. Better that his friends be the ones to eat him, without knowing the truth.\" Edelgard said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I'll commence the spell then.\" Hubert said with a sinister grin. Edelgard smiled, glad her plan was moving ahead nicely. Still, she couldn't help but wonder what the tiny prince would taste like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri woke up in an unfamiliar place, laying stop a brown boulder. He pushed himself to his feet, confused, before toppling over again as the boulder he braced his feet on slid away, toppling down across several identical looking boulders. When he used his hands to brace his impact, he found they sunk into the rock, covering his hands in brown goop. Then his nose kicked in, and he realized this was no rock, but a giant chocolate chip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" a familiar voice called from behind him. He turned to see Ashe, pinned under the chocolate chip that had rolled away from him. Next to him was Dedue, stoic and silent as always, trying to push the offending sweet off of Ashe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like we on top of a pile of giant chocolate chips.\" Sylvain cut in, appearing from Dimitri's left. Felix was right behind him, irritable as always. \"Glad you guys are here too. I woke up a few minutes ago and I thought I'd accidentally broken up with a witch again.\" Sylvain said, rubbing his neck in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how is something like this possible?\" Ashe asked. \"If these are chocolate chips, we must be no more than a centimeter or two tall!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Ashe, we will figure this out. First, we should check if any others are here. Sylvain, you've had a chance to look around, is it possible the girls are here somewhere?\" Dimitri asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, it's just us. I can sense women a mile away.\" Sylvain said, joking despite the dangerous situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to prove him wrong, the sky suddenly split open, as though clouds had parted in an instant. The boys looked up through half covered eyes towards the light source, only to find Mercedes staring down at them, her giant face framed by the sides of the bag of chocolate chips they were trapped in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think your senses work very well.\" Felix snarled at Sylvain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercedes! We are in here!\" Dimitri yelled, hoping the giant cleric would hear him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she didn't. All she said was \"I have a feeling these are going to be my best cookies yet.\" before tipping the bag to its side and starting a chocolate avalanche. The shrunken boys grasped for a handhold, but everything in the bag was in motion, and before long all of them had fallen out of the bag and into the mixing bowl filled with cookie mix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys lost track of each other as they landed in the mixing bowl. They were each temporarily submerged under the cookie mix, barely able to swim to the surface of the mucky mix. When they did, they were met with a cloud of descending flour as Mercedes dumped the contents of a flour bag down onto them. Coated in flour, the tiny lions were completely unrecognizable, and Mercedes didn't notice them as she lowered a wooden spoon down towards them. Mercedes began the familiar process of stirring the mix, with no regard for the tiny people being stirred with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny people could barely breath or see as they spun in dizzy circles. They were struck by the fast moving wooden spoon, slammed against the walls of the bowl, and forced under the thickening mix. As they struggled to remain conscious, the mixing slowed to a stop, leaving them gasping for breath and nearly buried alive in cookie dough. They had no energy left to fight back as Mercedes began to scoop cookie sized globs of dough onto a tray, preparing them for baking. Only when she lifted the tray to bring it towards the waiting oven did the tiny boys begin yelling again, their fear of the oven snapping them out of their spoon induced daze. But Mercedes didn't hear a thing, and just smiled cutely as she slid the tray into the oven and slammed the door, sealing them in hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat was unbearable. The cookie dough surrounding them insulated them enough to keep them alive, but it was still a living hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which girl do you want to get eaten by?\" Sylvain asked, trying to lighten the mood in the horrendous heat. No one was amused, and Ashe couldn't help but let out a desperate, fearful sob at the thought. \"Jeez, tough crowd.\" Sylvain murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of us should be here but you Dimitri! You're the wild boar, you're the one who should be hunted and eaten like the animal you are.\" Felix scowled, taking his anger out on the future king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it a rest with the boar crap already Felix! Just shut up and hope you get crushed by a girl's teeth before you're digested!\" Dimitri yelled, unable to contain his anger. Ashe sobbed again, but things were silent otherwise after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken lions had never been as relieved as they were when they saw Mercedes open the oven. There was the smiling face of their friend and healer, the girl who had saved them from death dozens of times. But now she wasn't smiling at her friends as she healed them, she was smiling at her food as she outstretched and oven mitt towards them. She pulled the tray out of the oven, and 4 tiny sighs of relief were let out as they escaped the hellish heat of the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes leaned down over the tray and inhaled deeply, loving the smell of her completed work. She happened to be right above Dimitri when she did this, who saw the dark abyss of her nostrils hanging above him. The suction of her breath might have pulled him in if he wasn't trapped in a cookie. Instead, he stayed rooted in place, looking up at her beautiful face as she licked her lips. \"Ah the girls are going to just love these cookies! Especially Annette.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes turned and walked out of their sight, no doubt to go call her friends in. The tiny lions were running out of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do? We are dead!\" Ashe yelled, panicking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remain calm Ashe. I believe the girls will notice us before we are consumed.\" Dedue said stoically, somehow always calm. But even he had a hard time staying calm as the girls stampeded in, Mercedes in the lead. 3 giantesses stood eagerly around the round table, watching as Mercedes brandished a spatula above them. Ashe screamed as the spatula came down for him first, slipping underneath the cookie he was trapped in. His screams were pulled away from the rest of the boys as he was deposited down onto Ingrid's plate. The beautiful blonde knight smiled at the sight of her cookie, but didn't grab it yet, waiting patiently for the other girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain was next. He was feeling very conflicted about this. He had no interest in dying, but he couldn't help but hope that if he was going to be eaten, that it was by one of the hotter girls. Ingrid was taken, so Mercedes seemed like a good choice. Unfortunately, Mercedes scooped him into Flayn's plate. Sylvain sighed with disappointment. Sure, Flayn was cute, but she was also younger than Lysithea. At least, that's what he guessed from her appearance. And even if they did get noticed before being eaten, he expected he'd be getting a lecture from Seteth on getting too close to Flayn. It almost made him wish for death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes quickly scooped Dedue's cookie onto her own plate, not hearing the young man from Duscur shouting her name as he was raised up and lowered back down. Then she turned her spatula to Dimitri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri assumed that Annette would be his executioner, watching as the red head licked her lips in excitement, her eyes fixed on him, or rather, the cookie he was in. She was the only one left without a cookie, so it seemed natural it was hers. However, Mercedes surprised them both by scooping him into a different plate that was sitting in the middle of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the big idea Merci?\" Annette asked, dying for a cookie at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Annette you'll get one.\" Mercedes said, moving her spatula towards Felix. \"It's Edelgard's birthday, so I'm just saving one for her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri nearly snapped at the thought. As if being eaten wasn't humiliating enough, it appeared he was destined to end up as a bit of fat on the ass of his greatest rival. Not only that, but he was forced to watch as Felix was deposited on Annette's plate. Once again he was powerless, forced to watch his loved ones die with no way to save them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Flayn notices a funny looking chocolate chip, and is shocked to discover it's Sylvain. Felix is already in Annette's mouth though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The girls dig in, and the boys are devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Before they can eat, an emergency calls them out of the room, leaving their cookies on the table. But this is just a trick from Lysithea, who comes in and eats them all. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Spoilers for Edelgard and Dimitri\u2019s past as revealed in Blue Lions route.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys of the Blue Lions remained absolutely helpless as the girls dug into their plates of cookies. Their eyes were focused on the massive lips devouring sweets hundred of times their size. All the while, they were anticipating their demise, fearing the worst as the girls enjoyed their time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first boy to meet misfortune was Ashe, as he felt a considerable amount of air pressure weigh down on him as Ingrid lifted his cookie up to her mouth. Ashe struggled against his sugary binds, finding it impossible to break out. He found himself staring at her awaiting mouth, ones that had excitedly recited tales of valiant knights with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, he would be a bit of nutrition for the blonde knight. It wasn\u2019t much of an honorable death, but he wasn\u2019t all too sure he deserved one in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was carried into the dark abyss of Ingrid\u2019s mouth, her hot breath covering everything. Ashe cowered as he passed under her teeth, hoping she wouldn\u2019t bring them on him. Luckily, she didn\u2019t as he was brought to the center of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went dark as she bit down, locking him inside and securing his death. The heat began to melt the chocolate chip, turning it into a sludge as it mixed with her saliva. It didn\u2019t take long for the wave of chocolate ooze to roll onto her awaiting tongue, where Ashe was left helpless and left at the mercy of Ingrid\u2019s chewing as a boulder sized crumb came rolling towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshe!\u201d Dimitri cried, barely managing to force an arm out from his prison. He couldn\u2019t do much else but watch in abjection as Ingrid swallowed, a lump sliding down her throat. If he survived the mashing, he would almost certainly die in the pit of the the blonde\u2019s stomach, a fate that made them sick to the core. Though, unlike Ashe, they hadn\u2019t experienced what it truly meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix would learn next. Annette giddily grabbed cookie in each hand with only one containing the black haired knight. The red haired giantess hummed a song Felix found all too familiar, and if he were honest, charmingly horrific in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, this mountain of sweets, and treats that I long to eats~</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf fate had a sense of humor, it was a dark one, as the lyrics to Annette\u2019s song about food rang through his head. Felix couldn\u2019t help but laugh. It was a fleeting experience that disappeared as he was carelessly tossed into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was deposited into her mouth, landing in a pile of mush. He fought his way up to stand, only to find Annette greedily taking another bite of her cookie, sending a mountain of sweets racing towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo thoughts rang through his mind, first, he couldn\u2019t help but feel Dimitri was the root of all this somehow. The second was that Annette needed to close her damn mouth when she chewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelix!\u201d Even if there most recent interactions were mostly hostile, Dimitri was  still wounded by the loss of his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Sylvain and Dedue\u2019s cookies were lifted up by Flayn and Mercedes. Both thrashed against their bindings, coming up with nothing as they were being carried into the mouths of the healers. Sylvain was crushed by Flayn\u2019s descending teeth, while Dedue had to watch as Mercedes slowly nibbled at her own cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was slowly brought over to her awaiting mouth as each bite brought him closer to death. He was caught in the unfortunate position of being directly under her them for her next bite. His weak attempt to shield himself with his hands was useless as he was crushed into paste by the sheer force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDedue\u2026\u201d Dimitri sighed, almost resigned at this point. There was nothing he could do to bring them back. His struggling barely helped. Though at this point, he felt that he could only save himself. After all, he had the most time before his designated executioner devoured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs Edelgard joining us?\u201dAnnette asked, eyeing the last bit of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes shook her head. \u201cI was just going to take it to her. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s too busy to stop by.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the rest of Garreg Mach from his new size was utterly surreal. Everything was just so incomprehensibly huge. And as Mercedes paraded him from the dining hall to the dorm building, he caught other students eying him, looking right past him and focused more on the treats itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to struggle against his binds, slowly breaking free. He was getting close. Though, he wasn\u2019t sure what he would do once he was free, his yelling never registered, and he wasn\u2019t really liking the idea of spending the rest of his days like a mite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a knock at the door, Mercedes waited for the birthday girl, a warm smile on her lips. Dimitri was unprepared to see the massive form of Edelgard as she answered the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Mercedes, it\u2019s nice to see you,\u201d she greeted politely. \u201cIs there anything you needed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes shook her head. \u201cJust wanted to give something to the birthday girl on her special day.\u201d She held the plate of cookies forward, pushing it onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard paled at the implications of the gift and nudged the plate back \u201cUm, my birthday\u2019s under the Garland Moon, but I appreciate the thought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes\u2019 eyes went wide. \u201cOh, really? Silly me, I always get the dates confused.\u201d She then giggled, not really to upset about her airy nature. \u201cBut even still, I prepared these cookies with you in mind. I insist you take them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess quickly scanned the plate, looking for any hints of Lion in the dish. She could have sworn she saw a royal blue speck moving somewhere on it. \u201cIt\u2026 does look delicious. However, I have a strict diet to uphold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d Mercedes countered surprisingly firmly. \u201cYou train harder than anyone, and I recall you tasking Hubert to swing by the dining hall to pick up cake for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard forced a chuckle. \u201cYou caught me. I guess I can take it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d the baker cheered. \u201cJust bring the empty dish back to the dining hall when you\u2019re done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Edelgard said, her voice stiff. \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mercedes turned and walked away, Edelgard brought he tray of cookies into her room and set it on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Dimitri had barely broken free from his chocolate prison, and was now rushing towards the edge of the cookie, looking to save himself from the same fate of his fellow students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he needed to do was get Edelgard\u2019s attention. Even if they were currently rival house leaders, she was his stepsister, but more importantly an old childhood friend. She even cheered him on after he defeated her at The Battle of Eagle and Lion and set his sights on fighting the Golden Deer. She just had to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dimitri shut his eyes in horror and shame at his uselessness. He never wanted to feel like this ever again. But there was nothing he could trapped in this chocolate baked prison. His fate was sealed and so was the fate of his friends. They'd be gobbled up and go right to the girls hips and no one would be the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before the girl the girls could dig in however, a knock was heard at their door. Mercedes was the first to get up and see who it was only to find one of the knights awaiting her. \"Hello there. Is there something you needed from us?\" she gestured inside to the other female members of the Blue Lions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I merely stopped by to drop off a message for the Blue Lion house.\" The knight answered before holding out a sealed letter. This caught the attention of the room as they stood up to get a better look at the letter. This brought a feeling of relief to the shrunken members of the Blue Lion house as it seemed their lives would be spared... At least for now. Ashe being the most grateful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes gently took the letter before ripping it open to read it's contents. As her eyes scanned it over Annette, Flayn, and Ingrid leaned over her shoulders. \"What does it say?\" Flayn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the professor's called for a meeting in the classroom.\" Mercedes answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Ingrid questioned. \"Why not just tell us in person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure the professor had a good reason. Besides it's not uncommon for the other professors here to communicate via messages.\" said Annette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. Let's go everyone.\" Mercedes smiled. \"Oh and thank your for the message Mr. knight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it's Jon, but your welcome.\" The knight nodded before he and everyone else left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the table the other members of the Blue Lions sighed. Thank goodness for the professor. Even unaware of their situation, she's still providing them with aid. If the girls were truly gone then they needed to be before they got back. \"Can any of you hear me?!\" Dimitri shouted,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loud and clear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed my friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Unintentionally the professor has bought us enough time to escape. We need to find a way out these... chocolate prisons!\" Dimitri struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're trying but these damn cookies won't break!\" Felix growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To think I'd be trapped by comfort food.\" Sylvain complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Less talk and more struggling!\" Ashe said franticly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are indeed sturdy prisons.\" Dedue struggled. \"I still wonder who could have caused this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As do we my friend. But we'll never find out if we don't escape first.\" said Dimitri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two the remaining members of the blue lions turned their heads back to the door as the sound of footsteps drew close. Were the girls back already?! If so they were doomed. The group began to struggle more desperately than ever before. Death by an unaware friend was the very last thing they wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door finally cracked open all present eyes widened. It wasn't Mercedes, Annette, Flayn, or Ingrid who returned. It was none other than the snow haired girl of the Golden Deer, Lysithea. What was she doing here? Wait a moment, maybe she could be of assistance if they got her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noe that there gone, Mercedes cookies are all mine!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that made the Blue Lions' hearts sink and their blood run cold. She was going to eat them! The miniscule members rewed their struggles with vigor they never knew they had as the violet eyed girl drew closer. Too bad it was all in vain as in less than a second, she was staring down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lysithea! It's us don't eat the cookies!\" Ashe screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do it!\" Sylvain agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir words didn't seem to reach her as she reached down for Ashe's cookie. Her massive tree trunk like fingers clasped around him and hoisted him up high in the air. \"Help me! PLEASE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashe!\" Dimitri cried as the silver haired boy was casually tossed into the giantess' mouth. All the remaining members felt ill when the giant girl began chewing. Ashe was gone. Chewed into paste by Lysithea enormous teeth. They wanted to cry for the loss of their friend but another horrifying thought crossed their minds. They were next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Dedue!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed the man that had been the prince's closet friend throughout the years was next. \"Forgive me my friend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were his last words as he was embraced by the hot and moist darkness. This time the tears did flow from the prince's eyes. He was gone. Dedue was gone. The other members could only watch the small lump slide down Lysithea's throat as she turned her sights to the rest of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fate would have it, Felix was next on the chopping block. His eyes widened but he said nothing. After what happened to both Ashe and Dedue, he had long since given up. The darkness embraced him as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? How can this be?\" Dimitri cried. What would Rodrigue think of his failure to protect his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow these are so good.\" Lysithea mused. \"I better finish up quick though before everyone else gets back. It was Sylvain's turn and all he could do was beg for mercy. Mercy that would never come as no one could hear it. The last thing he saw were the bone white pillars that were Lysithea's teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri was the only one left now. At this point he was broken. More people to join the dead and haunt his nightmares. Lysithea licked her lips and didn't waste a second to go straight for him. He didn't bother to fight back or even struggle. What was the point? He closed his eyes... and met the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was delicious!\" The snow haired girl cheered while she rubbed her stomach. I have to remember to ask Mercedes if I can cook with her one of these days.\" </span></div></div>",

While she remained blissfully unaware of the five lives tragically cut short by her sweet tooth, she was acutely aware that she had just eaten a bunch of cookies that didn't belong to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would not help her convince the rest of the students that she wasn't childish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should probably go,\" she declared, quickly getting up and running for the door. As soon as she entered the hallway, her escape was cut short as she roughly bumped into a tall, imposing figure, getting knocked to the ground in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Sorry!\" Lysithea rambled as she got back to her feet. \"Those cookies were gone when I got here! You can prove nothing!\" Lysithea finally looked up, only to find Hubert glaring down at her menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was fairly sure it was his only facial expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... my apologies, Hubert. I thought you were one of the Blue Lions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should watch where you are going,\" he said in a quiet, menacing voice, his glare never wavering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed! I should. Once again, my sincerest apologies,\" Lysithea repeated, bowing for good measure. \"Um... I'll be on my way now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea went the opposite direction, moving just slow enough to not be running. Paying the young Golden Deer no further mind, Hubert took a peek in the room she'd just vacated. Spotting an empty plate, he crept in, intent to get a closer look and deal with any survivors. Seeing nothing but cookie crumbs, he nodded grimly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is done. I must report to Lady Edelgard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriskly yet silently, he made his way to the second floor of the dorms to Edelgard's room. Just as he finished knocking on the door, he had a sudden dizzy spell and blacked out for a few seconds. When he recovered, he found that the door was now hundreds of feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? Could the spell have... no... it was flawless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened with a loud creak. Hubert found himself faced with two gigantic high-heeled boots that he immediately recognized. After all, the most important person in his life wore them every single day. He craned his neck up to take in the full view of Edelgard. She was impossibly gigantic, her imposing figure looking every bit like the empress that she deserved to be. That she soon would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHubert felt an odd tickle beneath his nose. He felt it, only to discover it was bleeding. That had never happened before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"That's strange,\"</b> Edelgard's voice boomed, as powerful as a goddess to his ears. <b>\"I thought I heard someone at the door.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the door creak again as his liege prepared to shut it snapped Hubert out of his stupor. If his spell could go so disastrously as to shrink the one that cast it, Edelgard wasn't safe either. She had to be informed of the situation. He sprinted towards her, making it through the doorway just before she sealed it, then continued to run after her as her gigantic footfalls took her back to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran across the stone floor towards her, he tried to think of how best to get her attention...</span></div></div>",

Aha, ha... ha...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard looked around the hall to see if there was anyone there. However, he halfhearted search came up empty as there were no signs that anyone was in the area. She wouldn't be that surprised if Claude had knocked on her door and rushed back into his room just to mildly annoy her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tapped her foot idly, the only sign of frustration she let out. That last thing she wanted was to give the prankster the satisfaction. Although he couldn't really see what she did, it was the principle that mattered. Her eyes drifted down as she noticed her subconscious tick before landing on an ant by her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perhaps I should stop sneaking sweets in my room.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Hubert was rushing towards the pair of boots that were far larger than the monastery. While mages weren't known for their mobility, he covered a surprising distance in an attempt to reach her before she returned to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Edelgard!\" Hubert called, hoping that she had a superhuman sense of hearing as one of her many talents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the imperial princess\u2019 gaze turned downed towards him. However, instead of a look of recognition, Edelgard\u2019s lip simply turned into a slight sneer as she leaned her foot back, raising the platform of her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Ugh, bugs...\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a look was enough to crush his spirit entirely. A large part of his life was spent making every living thought about Lady Edelgard\u2019s benefit. Sure, he had often dreamed of making the ultimate sacrifice for the future empress, but he did not expect it under these circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared up in awe at the sight of Edelgard. The princess looked as regal as ever with even her upturned lip having a sense of grace to it. The shrunken mage saved the image in his mind, deciding he would take in the grand sight of the future empress into the afterlife with him. Now that he knew for sure how his life would end, he could only hope that the rest of Fodlan would crumble beneath her feet as he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadowy heel descended on him, dropping an unfathomable pressure atop him. His attempt to protect himself was null as he was obliterated instantly, becoming a stain on the immaculate boot of Edelgard von Hresvelg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess didn\u2019t even notice the suspicious  squelch beneath her sole. She hardly paid the ant a further thought as she spun on the ball of her foot and stepped back into her dorm room, anxiously waiting for Hubert to report back with the results for her plan to dispose of anyone that would step in her way. She would never notice the splotch of blood under her foot as she stepped on the carpet and unknowingly wiped it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea had a rather busy day ahead of her. Thankfully, the sugary plate of cookies gave her the energy she needed to get through the day. For some reason, she had a lot of appointments to make, and she had to get it done before dark so she could avoid any chance of running into ghosts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her appointments was sword training with Catherine. At first, she had no idea why she was tasked to study swordplay. But that only lasted briefly before she was awakened to the awesome power of the Levin Sword during a seminar, and now the young mage just had to have one. The only problem was that she needed to learn how to handle a sword in the first place. After badgering the swordmaster, Lysithea finally got a training session from her fellow Crest of Charon bearer. Though she seemed to recall that Shamir would be joining shortly after their training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda had also bugged her into a makeover session. The white haired mage had already let her know that she wasn\u2019t interested in makeup anymore, but she would at least drop by and say so. Though, she could just get Marianne to go in her stead. Maybe the two could do something about the ever present bags under the white mage\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill thinking about her schedule...</span></div></div>",

Sure enough she managed to knock herself and the unsuspecting student to the ground. A large crash sound could be heard before a stream of whispered curses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she regained her bearings, Lysithea noticed she had bumped into Caspar von Bergliez of the Black Eagle house. From the looks of things it seemed the blue haired boy was transporting some armor somewhere. Most likely the armory unless one of the knights had enlisted him to shine their fancy suits. Too bad her incompetence caused him to drop everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so sorry! I didn't even see you walking here!\" Lysithea frantically apologized. Caspar finally turned his attention to the violet eyed girl after finally calming down enough to listen. Her hand was outstretched to help him up and being the gentleman he was, he accepted her aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'm sorry too. I should really pay more attention.\" Caspar smiled. Truthfully that armor he was carrying was so damn bulky he was surprised he hadn't dropped it or bumped into someone else until now. \"Anyway. You look like you're in  a rush. Any reason why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea's eyes bulged. \"Oh that's right! I'm still busy today! Very, very, busy! Sorry, Caspar, I would help you clean up but I really have to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Caspar watched in confusion as the magic prodigy of the Golden Deer sped down the hall. It would've been nice to get some help scooping up this armor, but then again he knew what it was like to be in a rush and not able to stop for anything. \"Oh well. Might as get work with this armor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiece by piece, Caspar picked up the silver pieces of metal. While doing so he began to feel a bit woozy. He then noticed he was beginning to sweat. That was odd. This task was so minimal that he shouldn't be this tired already. Or if even at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as he went for another piece of the armor he felt his world spin. All the metal he had collected previously dropped from his hands and his whole world went dark. When he came to he saw the world around him had grown to ridiculous degrees. No. The world hadn't grown, he'd shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! This is impossible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he felt them. Multiple tremors closing in on his position. What was it?! He looked to his right and received his answer. The tremors were the aftermath of footsteps. His face turned pale however when the giant form suddenly stopped in front of him and noticed the armor all spread around. Compared to their boots he was little more than an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all this armor doing here?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was both amazed and afraid of the giantess in front of him, not only by the sight of the impossible, anyone unaware of his presence right now could be a real danger for his life. And to worse everything, it was Shamir, one of the survivors of the raid his father's send to her homeland. He shivers at what Punishment she will do to him taking advantage of this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was going to accept the risk, for now Caspar need her to notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamir was using her usual clothes, just this time without her jacket for some reason. She was still lost in her thoughts, so try to call her like this was useless. Caspar turn his gaze in front to the giant pair of boots, reaching to the knees of their wielder. He didn't have other choices, but to climb to the mercenary shoulder, it couldn't be hard right? Well she wasn't using her large pants either, he expected her skin don't be that hard to grab until reach the mini short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ughh. I better go to my room\" shamir shakes her head, remembering Catherine's words about take her time often, overworking herself would lead her training in bad direction. It was a bad habit of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO wait!!\" Caspar yelled sprinting toward the right boot, just barely climbing it in time and grabbing the armor edges to avoid fall at the movement \"Ha, my training never disappoints me\" he said proud of himself, continuing going up on the fabric and metal as the giantess was slowing her steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short haired giantess was heading to her room in the knights headquarters, everyone else was busy outside, so the route was clear for her luck. She didn't wanted to explain why she needed a bit rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the blue haired student reached the top of the boot \"Wooo, peace of cake!\" Caspar exclaimed, ready for round 2. He placed his hand on Shamir's leg, it felt so soft and warm, as easy to grab \"... I hope she doesn't notice me climbing her here...\" something inside him was telling him how bad was this idea, but he keeps his plan ongoing <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movements were making the leg shakes, becoming more hard to keep grabbing it, and he was just starting, just a slight inch of the entrance of the mercenary boots, she wasn't using socks, so fell there was meaning join her sweat feet until she reach her room, that was not a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut well, It was better than remain on the floor with his life in danger, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One of the choices also spoils Cyril's supports with Lysithea.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering from her accidental run-in with Caspar, Lysithea went about her busy day. After quickly stopping by Hilda's room to apologize for blowing off the makeover session and send her Marianne's way (giving the pinkette a better outlet for her creative energies and the bluette some much needed social interaction), Lysithea made her way to the training yard, where a grinning Catherine was waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, little sis!\" the knight greeted cheerfully. Lysithea smiled and blushed. When she and Catherine discovered how much they had in common- having both the same crest and secret pasts neither liked to talk about- Catherine joked that they were like sisters, and Lysithea admitted that she rather liked the idea. Catherine apparently decided to run with it, to the little mage's delight and occasional embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, Catherine,\" Lysithea nodded. \"Thank you for taking the time to train with me today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Catherine shrugged, handing Lysithea one of the practice swords that she was carrying. \"We knights are always willing to help students when we have time. Fair warning, though, we might need to cut things short if Lady Rhea summons me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine,\" Lysithea agreed. \"So where do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO STOLE OUR COOKIES?!\" Annette demanded. \"I'll KILL them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls of Blue Lion House had just returned to their common room after being told by a confused Professor Byleth that no, they hadn't been called for a meeting, only to discover that the cookies Mercedes had baked were now gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Annette, calm down,\" Ingrid held her hands out to try and calm the short, temperamental redhead. \"They're just cookies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Annette corrected with a growl. \"They were MERCIE'S cookies. Which makes them the best cookies in the world! This was going to be the highlight of my day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can always make more, Ann,\" Mercedes reminded her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Flayn agreed. \"And the next batch of cookies can have fish in them as well! That will make them extra delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flayn, we've been over this,\" Mercedes sighed tiredly. \"Fish and chocolate don't go well together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not with that attitude,\" Flayn countered. Mercedes remained silent, refusing to get drawn into the Fish Cookie argument again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it was the boys,\" Annette concluded. \"None of us have seen them all day. They probably stole the cookies, and are hiding somewhere in shame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems out of character for them,\" Ingrid noted. \"Felix doesn't even like sweets. And Dimitri, Dedue, and Ashe wouldn't eat someone else's food without permission. Or if they did, they'd at least stick around and apologize for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Sylvain?\" Annette countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'd have stayed to hit on us when we came back,\" Ingrid replied. None of the other girls could fault her logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who stole the cookies?!\" Annette demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the knights gave us that message that Professor Byleth was looking for us, correct?\" Flayn asked Mercedes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon, yes,\" Mercedes nodded as she remembered the knight. \"Oh! If that message wasn't from the Professor, then whoever told Jon to deliver it must have done so to trick us into leaving the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they could steal the cookies!\" Annette caught up to her friend's line of thought. \"Come on, girls! Let's track down that knight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we be worried about the boys?\" Ingrid pointed out. \"If they aren't gone because of the cookie thing, where are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wherever they are I'm sure they're fine,\" Annette dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea frowned as her stomach gurgled. Maybe eating a plate full of cookies just before training was a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay, Lysithea?\" Catherine asked, noticing that her trainee had stopped her exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Lysithea assured her. \"My stomach's just acting strangely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine frowned. \"I know you're a fan of sweets, Lysithea, but if you're going to be doing more physical activity like sword training, you need to have a more balanced diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know,\" Lysithea stammered, blushing as she avoided eye contact with the knight. \"I'm not a child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Catherine grinned brightly. \"Then I expect to see you with a great big plate of veggies at dinner tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea huffed and resumed practicing her sword strikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your form's still a little off,\" Catherine said as she approached her. \"Here, let me help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine walked up behind Lysithea, holding the smaller girl close as she corrected her arm placement and posture. Lysithea blushed, embarrassed by the somewhat intimate contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how important is form, anyway?\" Lysithea asked. \"If I'm using a Levin sword, won't I be keeping my enemies at a distance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's the plan,\" Catherine admitted. \"But anything can happen in battle. If an opponent manages to get close to you, you need to be able to dodge or block their strikes. A proper stance helps with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with Lysithea's form, Catherine readied her own practice sword. \"Now, I'm going to come at you. Focus on evasion and don't worry about counterattacking just yet. We'll get there soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Blue Lion girls hadn't had any luck finding Jon the knight. They did, however, find a pile of armor on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all this armor doing here?\" Ingrid wondered, hands on her hips as she frowned disapprovingly at the disorganized mess on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not Jon's, is it?\" Annette asked. \"Did our cookie thief get rid of him to tie up loose ends?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ann, perhaps we should stop at the dining hall and get you a snack,\" Mercedes offered. \"You get loopy when your blood sugar is low.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is strange for this armor to be on the floor,\" Flayn noted. \"Was someone supposed to be moving it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, unnoticed by the girls, Caspar was frantically waving for their attention from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of this,\" Ingrid decided, kneeling down to pick up the armor. \"The rest of you get Annette some food and find that knight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ingrid, wait! I'm down here! Oh, SHI-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaspar's profanity was cut short as Ingrid's knee came down on him, crushing him against the stone floor and obliterating him instantly. Unaware of the red stain on her black tights, Ingrid carried the armor off to the knights' quarters while her housemates went off in search of their quarry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea breathed heavily. As much as Catherine was clearly holding back, the knight still hit hard and fast, and Lysithea had a few bruises to remember her first training session by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Catherine said with a smile as she helped the young mage to her feet. \"Now that you've survived your first real training session, I've got a surprise for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her satchel, she pulled out a sword shaped like a lightning bolt that crackled with electric energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You brought a real Levin sword?!\" Lysithea's eyes widened as she grinned excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to be careful with it,\" Catherine warned her. \"The church doesn't have many of these lying around and they're a pain to repair. But you might as well see it in action to give you something to work towards. Here, watch me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing, Catherine swiped with the sword. A tiny bolt of lightning zapped a training dummy in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's usually more impressive than that, but my magic's not exactly anything to write home about,\" Catherine explained. \"Yours, on the other hand, might work wonders.\" She handed the sword to a reverent Lysithea. \"Go ahead. Swipe the sword towards the dummy just like I showed you, while channeling your magic through the sword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating, Lysithea did as she was told, letting the sword serve as a conduit for her crest-augmented magic as she swung it in the direction of the dummy. To her surprise and delight, a huge lightning bolt obliterated the dummy on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it! Did you see, Catherine, I...\" Lysithea trailed off as she realized her mentor was nowhere to be found. \"Catherine? Where'd you go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile on the ground, Catherine was busy getting her bearings as the world around her suddenly became much bigger. \"Lysithea!\" She called up to the mage that now towered over her. \"Down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Rhea summon her?\" Lysithea wondered, not hearing the tiny Catherine's cries for help as she looked around. \"I thought she'd at least say goodbye...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine yelped and rolled to the side, barely dodging as Lysithea's giant boot narrowly missed crushing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well,\" Lysithea sighed dejectedly, returning the sword to Catherine's satchel, which the knight apparently abandoned in her haste to leave. \"I have a lot more things to do today anyway.\" She had promised to start teaching Cyril how to read, after all. Hopefully, she'd have time to do that before her scheduled kitchen duty<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lysithea left the training grounds for her next task, unaware of the tiny knight that she was abandoning in the yard.</span></div></div>",

This place was her home away from after all. Though Lysithea figured that was probably for the best as the Blue Lions were the last people she wanted to see right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully she'd be able to help Cyril out before the library's regulars made themselves known. Walking towards the back she grinned happily as she spotted a familiar head of messy black hair. It was none other than Cyril, seated at a desk with a book of his choosing laid out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was good. That mean she wouldn't have to search high and low for any reading material. The library just had so many options, action, drama, fantasy, romance. Oh, how she loved romance. But today wasn't about her, it was about helping Cyril enjoy the wonders of pages between the hard cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cyril!\" she called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid boy looked up to spy the snow haired girl and waved her over. \"You made it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had time.\" the violet eyed girl nodded as she took a seat next to him. \"So what book did you choose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right...\" Lysithea blush in embarrassment. Cyril can't read. \"Well let's see. Oh! You chose a good one. \"The Tale of Two Kingdoms. I've read this one before. An epic story about the legendary kingdoms of Nohr and Hoshido. I should warn you this one is a bit complex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the more reason I need to learn.\" Cyril said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea smiled. \"Very well.\" She opened the book to chapter one. \"Prologue... Garron the Black King.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nAn undisclosed amount of time later.<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An so then began Princess Corrin's journey of conquest and fate.\" Cyril read off the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. You're a natural.\" Lysithea praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer looked away bashfully. \"No. You're just a good teacher... Professor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Professor? Me?\" Lysithea squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyril couldn't help but laugh at the mage's reaction. She was redder than a tomato. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-shut up.\" Lysithea said weakly as she nudged her \"student's\" shoulder. That only made him laugh more. She stood up and began to take her leave. \"Forget this. I still have kitchen duty today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! Hahahahahaha! I-I'm sorry.\" Cyril said between obnoxious laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea sighed. \"It's fine. I really do have kitchen duty today. I was just barely able to squeak this time in. Anyway, you keep practicing. Who knows, maybe you, me, and Annette could start a book club or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her peace said, the mage prodigy of the Golden Deer took her leave. With his teacher gone and his nerves calm, Cyril retuned to his. Just as he was about to start the next chapter he could feel his world begin to spin. At first he chalked it up to a lack of sleep, but it was all to clear something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it... Everything faded to black. When he came to he noticed he was no longer at his desk with his book in front of him. He was standing on some sort of wooden floor? He took a moment to look around and saw what had become of him. He'd shrunk! Just like his socks when he did laundry for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't seem physically possible!\" he shrieked. He had to find help. But at he same time how was he supposed to get down from this wooden platform which he now knew was his chair. The fall alone would kill him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the thought of a plan he heard an all too familiar voice humming a gentle tune off in the distance. He turned his head to the source and felt both equal parts fear and relief. Coming his way with books in hand was none other than Lady Rhea herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could help him, right?</span></div></div>",

It rare for her to take a break like this, and she intended to make the most of it. Where better to relax than in the library where it's nice and quiet with books a plenty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter humming for another minute or two, she finally spied a good seat. Thankfully it away from the few students that where also occupying this space. This meant she could read her books uninterrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way over to the open seat, she never even noticed the shrunken form of Cyril crying out for her attention. It would seem the size barrier between the two was just too great. Even so, the shrunken boy wouldn't give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Rhea, please notice me! I'm down here!\" He cried. Cyril had even resorted to jumping up and down while the unaware archbishop drew ever closer. Eventually she came to a complete stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Cyril felt a sense of relief believing the leader of the holy church had finally discovered him and then a sense of awe as he was able to at last take in her full size. Compared to her he was little more than a bug... Perhaps even less than that. He was nothing compared to the beautiful giant before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was only broken from his thoughts when a loud bang filled his ears. Looking u at his 'goddess' he saw that she had only put her books down on the desk, and yet the sound was like that of an explosion to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Someone left a book here.\" Lady Rhea noted as she picked up the stray hardcover. \"The Tale of Two Kingdoms. Whoever left this behind has great taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Archbishop shut the text and put it off to the side before turning around to take her seat. Down below, Cyril could only scream as the enormous backside of Lady Rhea descended upon. \"No! Please! Lady Rhea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the holy rear of the Archbishop connected with the seat, turning the once promising young man into an unnoticeable stain beneath her. Cyril's shrunken body never even stood a chance against the full weight of his Lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was comfortable enough, the archbishop took a moment to bask in the calm before reaching over to her books. She read through the titles of each until she landed on a red cover with golden letters. \"The Path of Radiance, hmm?\"</span></div></div>",

No matter what Edelgard had tried, the Kingdom forces had triumphed again and again, and now the prince, the professor and their companions were on their way to the swiftly-abandoned palace to depose her, the grand fortress now as cold and empty as the woman brooding in its seat of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard arose to her feet and slowly walked down the carpeted steps of her altar. With what few remaining subjects she once had long gone and abandoning her to her fate, the throne room was eerily still. As she reached the base of the steps, she advanced further forwards to the device seated in the middle of the space. It was her only remaining \u2018attendant\u2019 - a gift from a departed friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Hubert said, straightening his uniform as he readied himself to depart and face the incoming Kingdom forces. \u201cOur mutual friends and I have devised one more weapon. Unfortunately, it still needs a few hours to finish charging and I cannot delay from the front lines any longer. I ask that you confine it to your throne room as a last resort. And lest you worry, your Crest will shield you from its effects.\u201d A smirk, sly yet genuine, cracked on Hubert\u2019s face. \u201cNot that you\u2019ll need it, of course. I\u2019ll dispose of this Kingdom nuisance myself.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat remaining of Edelgard gave a sigh. Hubert was still protecting her, even now when all seemed lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vibration rocked the foundations of the palace itself. It was faint and distant, but a herald of what was to come. The Blue Lions. The professor. Dimitri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her blood-red gloves, the Emperor planted her hand atop the waist-high pillar in the centre of her throne room. The arcane device was coated in a cold black material, with lines ominously pulsating along its surface - pulses which heightened and brightened to Edelgard\u2019s touch. Slowly but surely, a high-pitched sound began to build within its confines, as its magical payload primed itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri\u2019s one good eye scanned around the regal surroundings of the imperial palace as the Blue Lions advanced through its halls, passing by its several studies, kitchens and galleries. This was the final front of this horrible war, the last defense of Edelgard and her crumbling empire. But if that was the case, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are the guards?\u201d Ashe stated aloud, voicing the concerns of his comrades. The group had an iron grasp on their weapons, ready to lunge out and strike down whatever the Empire had left to throw at them, and yet ever since they broke inside the palace, they hadn\u2019t seen another living soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis could be an ambush,\u201d Dedue reasoned, staying close to his majesty. Felix, following close behind, kept a firm hand on the hilt of his sword. He was eager to cross blades with the Emperor, so he had no intention of being delayed by any inferior Empire lapdogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining Blue Lions huddled together, protecting each other\u2019s flanks. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re all watching us through eyeholes in these paintings?\u201d Sylvain joked, nodding his head towards one of the numerous portraits on the walls. Ingrid retorted with a gentle yet swift nudge to the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri remained at the head of the pack, the unwavering spear of Areadbhar pointed straight ahead. \u201cIt would not be beneath Edelgard to try just about anything by this point. Everyone, stay on your guard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth, ever loyal and at their side, nodded in agreement. Edelgard had always been reluctant to surrender, even as a student. The only certainty they had now was that Edelgard would rather die than lose today. Alas, no amount of readiness could have prepared the Blue Lions as they neared the stairs leading to the highest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, professor?\u201d Ingrid said, pushing a lock of blonde hair away from her ear. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose... you hear that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth turned their head. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sounds like... a ringing noise? Perhaps a whistle, or...?\u201d Ingrid trailed off, the faint sound in her ears too difficult to place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I think I hear it too,\u201d Annette added, concentrating as hard as she could. Mercedes nodded as she heard the same distant yet tangible sound. Soon enough, all of the Blue Lions could feel the trickle of a high-pitched squeal tapping away at their eardrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshe readied their bow with shaking hands. \u201cWhat is this? Some sort of spell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth drew their sword, the shining relic of bone glowing in their hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but brace yourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri\u2019s hands began to falter. No matter their resolve and their endurance, the noise was beginning to ring and echo in their skull, as it was for everyone else. The prince shook their head, trying to evade whatever witchcraft was pursuing them, but it wouldn\u2019t leave. Their remaining eye struggled to remain open amidst the nausea and numbing sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes fell to the ground, already fainting from the unseen attack. \u201cMercie!\u201d Annette was at her friend\u2019s side in an instant, trying to determine the cause of whatever had struck her, before she too felt her stamina leave her and she slipped into unconsciousness. Felix\u2019s eyes darted around for an enemy to strike down, yet he found none before he fell as well. Even Dedue\u2019s legendary tenacity and stalwart armor didn\u2019t save them as the pulse reached them and forced them down too. Within seconds, the legendary fighting force of the Kingdom had been knocked out, all but its savior king still conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri fell to one knee, desperately trying to stay awake and vigilant, despite the pounding in his temples. They felt their heart sink as they saw Byleth on the floor as helpless as the rest. \u201cP-Professor! E-El... What have you...?\u201d Dimitri didn\u2019t finish his sentence before he joined Byleth on the cold stone floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Emperor removed her hand from the pedestal, barely fazed by the magical pulse thanks to her Crest. She examined her pale-skinned hand for a moment, before steeling herself and returning her red glove to its rightful place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard had no regrets for what was about to occur. She was merely disposing of some insects.</span></div></div>",

Of course not...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his biggest secret: He had seen the future, a alternative timeline in which many of his students died and traveled 5 years back in time to avoid it. The spirit Sothis, still in his head, taught him a spell fueled by her power that could make a limited number of human as strong as titans, strong enough to stop their terrible future. Byleth, incapable of forgetting his student's deaths, chose 8 of them hopping this power would protect them and gave it secretly, as no one of them would believe his story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched how the eight devoured the dishes and felt disappointed when he did not see any sign of change between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could remember the spell, but I don't remember the exact details of how it works.\" Sothis admitted in the shadows of Byleth's mind. \"Maybe it'd take some time, maybe years, before they get the divine strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher wondered, bitterly, if the approaching war would hit before their transformations. After saying farewell he spent a terrible night in his old new bedroom, the little sleep he got was filled with nightmares of the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day he was informed he couldn't delay more his decision regarding which house he would join. He met the head students of the houses and again was disappointed by the lack of visible changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to met you again, professor. I really enjoyed the dinner.\" The always polite blond prince was the first one in shaking hands with his new teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened: Pain... he could feel Dimitri's hand squeezing Byleth's tighter than he could bear. He heard bones creaking, but it wasn't his hand, that came from Dimitri's body who was slowly growing bigger while he kept in a trance with his eyes closed. As he was gained inches in height, his shoulders broadened, muscle mass was added in his bigger frame and feet grew 2 sizes, not enough to break his shoes but enough to feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt ended before anyone, not even Dimitri, could notice the abnormal growth spurt. The prince, who was 5cm (2\") taller than the teacher, had almost a head of advantage over him.His clothes looked snugger on him and it didn't cover all his wrists and ankles. Byleth couldn't be happier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good omen... a signal of what house I should choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, he turned into the head teacher of the Blue Lions, expecting to guide them as they grew into titanic saviors.<br>\r\nWhile they were leaving the garden, Claude's yawning attracted Byleth's attention. Feeling a bit uncomfortable, he was stretching his arms, and while he was doing it the rest of his body stretched slowly upwards until he was a hair under Dimitri's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Byleth remembered he had to keep an eye on the other houses...</span></div></div>",

We've just started!\"<br>\r\n\"No, we've been sparring for 2 hours... uff!\" The blond giant replied, panting and covered in sweat, whereas his tiny blue haired companion was perfectly fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Raphael was picking up his weapons, a strange feeling overcame the shorty. It was like his body had taken a jump, but his feet didn't left the floor. His perspective seemed a little off... like it was higher?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird... It must be fatigue. Raphael is right, I'm overdoing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe agreed to stop too and then the pair left the room together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... I really envy you, Raphael... You're huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChitchat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I'm big. Everyone knows that. What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not very big, but I've always wanted to be. That's why I train so much. I've grown a bit in the last five years, but I'm still not even close to you. I just don't know how to bulk up.\"<br>\r\n\"You're not so small.\" The friendly giant noted. His blue head, who previously was at the same height of his collar bone, was close to the other's square jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass time. Byleth was trying to teach his courses, but often he was interrupted by noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst it was Sylvain's knees suddently bumping against the bottom of the table. Fitting his legs under the table was becoming harder and harder as the class went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, teach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth didn't say a thing and continued, although kept an eye on him and the other male students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*riiiip*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshe's uniform teared from behind when he extended his arm to receive a pencil from Annette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former thief blushed a little, ashamed. A slight smile appeared in Byleth's face, disappearing when he resumed the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...mn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth eyes were drawn to a grumpy swordsman, whose face looked troubled and uncomfortable. Without interrupting his speech, the teacher kept watching Felix until he hit the table in a muscular spasm caused by an instantaneous growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth couldn't calculate his height while he was sitting, he seemed a good head taller and his muscles had increased enough to be noticed under his uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a few ripping sounds before the period ended with diminishing intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has the spell lost its effect? Are they reaching their maximum sizes?\" The inexpressive man grew worried. His students seemed stronger, but not with the legendarily strength Sothis described.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teacher, I have a question...\" Ashe approached to him. He hadn't changed much, maybe a bit taller and considerabily more muscular without reaching Felix's level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he froze halfway, with an expression similar as one who is going to sneeze. Then it happened.<br>\r\nAn explosive growth spurt make him rise 30cm (1') in addition to the 7cm (3\") he had gained in his seat. And the previously slim boy's muscles grew out of porpotion,ripping every seam in his clothes, which fell to the ground as shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only cloth that remained in his place was his underwear because he hold the damaged cloth with his huge hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis freckled skin turned fire red and escaped through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth heard screams and knew he had been seen by all the people outside the classroom. \"At this hour there are a lot of deer and eagles outside.\"<br>\r\nThe huge teen took refuge inside. The other students were surprisingly supportive and calming with him, despite some looked a bit unconfortable and others were peeping discreetly the almost nude boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault, it's the school's!\" Sylvain exclaimed, patting on his broad back.<br>\r\n\"...what?\" Byleth thought scared his secret had been found out.<br>\r\n\"...their uniforms are awful! They're ripping every time we breathe, and clearly they\u2019re not as 'custom sized' as they advertise.\" The redhead showed them his ankles, exposed after his legs grew longer than his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they really so oblivious?\" The avatar wondered.<br>\r\n\"The effects of the spell can't be easily appreciated by mortals, even the ones affected by them... most won't notice any change, and the ones who did will automatically accept it as normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSothis spoke to him from her realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answering your previous doubt, the growth isn't going to stop any time soon. They're going to get stronger... MUCH stronger... before the spell stops.\"<br>\r\n\"When will that happen? The stopping?\"<br>\r\n\"I... don't remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext day, in the canteen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now sit down and eat up! Eating's the best way to get bigger!\" Raphael was doing his best to help his friend to be as big as him, despite that wasn't a pressing matter after the previous day's growth spurt.<br>\r\n\"Let's do it! I'm gonna eat till I can't move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaspar did indeed  he ate and ate until the cookers refused to keep serving him. Raphael watched amazed how his piled dishes doubled his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, and I thought I was a big eater!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaspar ignored him as he felt the urgency of stretching his body... and his body did actually stretch taller during the stretching, his head rose slowly as his legs extended further under the table. *Pop* *Pop* The shoes bursted as his feet lengthened 12cm (5\").<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... just what I needed.\" Caspar felt amazing, and the ripped clothes felt less constrictive. \"Hey, Raphael, let's train a little more!\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was dragged by the growing teen, who was now a few centimeters shorter than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Byleth was coming from a reunion when he met a curious pair... Raphael, who looked like shit after being beaten up by Caspar, who was being helping him to walk to the infirmary, holding him as he apologized nonstop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, Raphael, I didn't want to hit him so hard!\" He said with a trembling, guilty voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue haired boy was A HEAD AND A QUARTER TALLER than the blond one, and as muscular if not more. The sensation of approaching growth had reduced after that huge growth spurt... although it could and would come back later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to check the other houses too.\" Byleth said to himself, as much surprised as satisfied by the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inexperienced teacher returned to his room and got another surprise... a pretty big boy was sleeping on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linhardt.\"<br>\r\n\"Zzz\"<br>\r\n\"Wake up...\"<br>\r\n\"...5 minutes more, mom... zzz.\"<br>\r\n\"Why aren't you in your bedroom?\"<br>\r\n\"...my bed is too small... yours is bigger... zz...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was privilege of the academy teachers. Byleth tried to move the mage, but he was heavier than he looked. He was taller too, as his feet were close to the end of Byleth big almost-double bed. He would never fit in a student's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Linhardt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Byleth had no more options than left him spend the night in his room. With the academy closed, he had little options: Sleeping with him or go to his empty room and risking be spotted by other students and have to answer very inconvenient questions... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His face is peaceful, like an angel... a huge lazy angel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, a smile was put on his face, although this time it lasted longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to take advantage of a student, right?\" Sothis' voice, always talking at the worst moment possible.<br>\r\n\"Of course not! I'm just going to share my bed to sleep and nothing more. Good night!\" He didn\u2019t want to continue that conversation\u2026 because although Byleth would never do something like that, there was so much history between those two: in the previous timeline, a sweet story with a bitter end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, after the graduation, that story can have a happier ending...\"</span></div></div>",

As usual, Linhardt felt asleep instantly. The teacher needed a little more time, but eventually shut his eyes too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, at least until the mage waked him up in the wee hours. Still sleeping, the young man was hugging him like he was a teddy bear, clinging his arms to his thorax, with the teacher's face was pressing his broad shoulders. Breathing was <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to free himself from his embrace, but despite being asleep the boy showed a strength beyond his own. Even worse, his efforts only made Linhardt to grab him tighter, and he was sleeping so deeply he couldn't wake him up, like always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can this get worse?\"<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound of cracking and rips. Soft moans. The student's body agitated and seemed like it was surrounding Byleth's more, sinking his face on his thick chest... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he... growing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis longer legs stuck out the bed, with his long feet and ankles exposed to the coldness of the night. He instinctively bent his legs to shelter them under the blankets, and so Byleth ended up not only surrounded by his arms, also by his thicker, longer legs. Too intimate for him to feel comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth stopped one minute after it started, but the boy had clearly gained enough muscle and size to look more like a brawler than a mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to escape, Byleth's only option was to wait to the sunrise resting in his toned arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cozier than I thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night ended and the combination of the alarm, the massive daylight and Byleth's screams were just enough to wake the sleepyhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe released the teacher and stretched his body, touching the high ceiling with his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... I've never slept so well like yesterday!

Tonight you have to use yours.\" Byleth said really seriously.<br>\r\n\"But my bed is too small!\"<br>\r\n\"Mine is becoming too small for you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student checked it out and noticed his feet hung at the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where I'm going to sleep now.\" He said extremely worried.<br>\r\n\"Can't you request a bigger one?\"<br>\r\n\"I've already tried that yesterday, but the school said I have to resign to use the one they assigned to me. My title of nobility doesn't give me any privilege here, apparently.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough chitchat. Byleth still have to get him out his room discretely. A student spending a night with a teacher was weird, and probably would get him fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, Linhardt's pajama was partly ripped and was too short to cover his newfound six pack... if anyone saw him poorly dressed like this in his company...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately there was no one around at this time of the morning, so he managed to send Linhardt to his room without being seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[The support Level between Byleth and Linhardt has increased]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Linhardt and the much bigger Caspar spent an hour training. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you're invincible today. I surrender.\" Linhardt admited after receiving so many blows, he could have endured more, but he was too lazy to that kind of heavy training Caspar had forced him to participate.<br>\r\n\"At least, I won! That's prove your theory was wrong!\" <br>\r\n\"What theory?\"<br>\r\n\"That thing about tall warriors having advantage over shorter guys.\"<br>\r\n\"Well...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his palm on the top of his head and moved it straightforward towards Caspar. The hand landed between his chest and his neck<br>\r\nCaspar hadn't really realiced how tall he was until that moment. If Linhardt was around 7 feet tall (213cm), Caspar was close to 8 feet tall (240cm) now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... right, I'm taller than you, and I beat you, so you were right... SO COOL! I LOVE BEING THE BIG GUY FOR ONCE!! AND THE STRONGEST!!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't let it go to your head... My father is taller than yours, I'm sure I'll surpass you soon.\" He said a bit irritated. He wasn't aware of his nocturnal growth yet.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'd love to see that.\" Caspar smirked, and rub the hair of his smaller friend like he was a little brother to bother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Byleth was working on an idea he had to fix Linhardt's bedroom problem, and avoid the previous night to repeat again.<br>\r\nThe academy was reluctant to spend money in what they consider students' whims, but he could use his position as a teacher and Lady Rhea's favourite to get the boy a bed as huge as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The school board have bought and installed you bed, Byleth... but I have to say a member of the church shouldn't take advantage of its money.\" Seteth, as grumpy as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth ran to his room and saw a beautiful, opulent, spacious bed took up almost half of the chamber. It was perfect for the lazy student, who wouldn't outgrow it for a time... and when he did, he probably also outgrew the room itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only remaining problem was how he would translate that bed into Linhardt's bedroom. The servants had bring its pieces to his place because he was the one who had ordered up, and then they assembled the pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was mounted, it didn't fit through the door and couldn\u2019t be dismantled it either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean... he's going to sleep in my bedroom from now on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, and Byleth was the official teddy bear of this growing teen.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Three Houses is the latest addition of the longstanding Fire Emblem series. The story chronicles the events between three conflicting nations stemming from an eventful year at a military academy. The game features a wide and colorful cast of characters that are fun enough to want to see in size changing scenarios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Guidelines:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Put some effort in. I'm grateful for any additions, but low quality/effort additions will be removed.<br>\r\n2. Mark your spoiler warnings at the top of the chapter. Use a chapter number or month or any identification of time/story route. <br>\r\n3. Keep the characters in character. That's kinda the whole point of this thing.<br>\r\n4. For lewd chapters, make sure the characters are at least 18. For the younger characters like Lysithea and Petra, reserve 18+ rated chapters featuring them for post timeskip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun friendos. Hopefully this interactive catches on like the Persona one. Also pray for me and my free time. I'm gonna try to support both equally, but I want to see this one grow at the moment.</td>",
