Being the little brother of a sixteen year-old sister with a high IQ and scientific mind is even harder work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy was always the subject of his sister, Brianna scientific experiments ever since he was six years old. At first, it was fun for Tommy, being doted in by Brianna and her scientific prototypes, like an artificially intelligent bed that helped him get the required hours of bed rest, or a bubble wand where it would allow the bubbles to come out any shape other than their typical spherical shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he grew older, however, Tommy noticed how annoying Brianna was with her constant babying towards him and how dangerous her experiments had become. Experiments, such as an invisibility cloaking device that turned Tommy and his clothes invisible and a tonic to help increase his mental capacity, ended up having embarrassing flukes. The cloaking device ended up shortening and Tommy was visible again, but the cloaking device also ended up turning his clothes permanently invisible. The tonic ended up turning his skin a variety of wavy rainbow colors with brightly colored polka dots. At that point, Tommy did all he could to avoid Brianna and protect himself behind his forty-three year-old mother, Kelly; his twenty-two year-old oldest sister, Lindsey, and his five year-old sister, Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Tommy\u2019s best trying to avoid his scientifically-obsessed sister, Brianna would always find a way to get him to become the subject of her experiments. Last time, she managed to slip a tonic in his orange juice designed to give him super speed. Around this time, Brianna had a different trick up her sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, after Tommy returned from school, he was tackled and crushed in Brianna\u2019s overly-doting bear hug. Tommy wriggled in her embrace, struggled to break away from the tight embrace, but that just made Brianna wanna hug him tighter. \u201cWelcome home, little brother! Did you learn anything new and exciting today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrianna! Let go of me!\u201d Tommy screamed s he tried to break free from his tormentor\u2019s grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoooo, I don\u2019t wanna let you go! I wanna give you my signature big sister hugs n\u2019 kisses!\u201d Brianna nuzzled her cheek against Tommy\u2019s and gave him a kiss on his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEwww, get off of me!\u201d Tommy said, breaking his arms free to push him away from his overly affectionate sister. He held up a boxing stance to signify he was ready to get physical with Brianna it he wanted, but Brianna ended up fawning over the way he looked and acted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, look at you. You\u2019re surrounded by girls who wanna kiss you and you end up pushing them away,\u201d Brianna cooed, wiling a year away. \u201cMy little brother is becoming a man already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave me alone, Brianna! I\u2019m not gonna let you experiment on me again!\u201d Tommy shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but testing my experiments is the best part of our relationship,\u201d Brianna whimpered. \u201cAnd speaking of, I have a new shrinking experiment that I\u2019ve been working on for my own personal project. It\u2019s worked on nonorganic items and organic food and bugs so far, but I want you to test it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why would I want to go through with that?\u201d Tommy demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause if you do, I\u2019ll give you most of the full credit for helping me at the science expo coming up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Tommy\u2019s answer?</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m sick and tired of you putting me through those dumb experiments! I hate how you made me look like a colorful eyesore when you made slipped that stupid chemical in my drink! I hate how I couldn\u2019t find my best set of clothes! Everyone laughed at me because of you! I don\u2019t wanna do your dumb experiments!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna looked like she was hurt from her beloved little brother\u2019s harsh jabs. \u201cYou really believe my experiments are dumb?\u201d she questioned Tommy, who noticed her brow furrowing angrily. \u201cHow dare you! My experiments aren\u2019t dumb! The only reason why I only experiment on you is because nobody else in this household wants to help me use my genius scientific mind to help the betterment of the human race! If you really believe my experiments are dumb and if you\u2019re gonna have a bad attitude about it, then I\u2019m done asking nicely!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna grabber Tommy\u2019s wrist tightly, who screamed in pain as her iron grip threatened to break his bones! \u201cOW! OW! OW! Let me go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna brought the boy to her face by yanking her arm down, drawing him closer. \u201cListen to me, you little twerp! I\u2019ve had it with your attitude towards me and my experiments! Since you\u2019re not willing to go along with my experiments, then I\u2019m just gonna have to force you to go along as punishment for being such a little grouch to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna then made for the basement door, dragging the wriggling boy behind her. She was too peeved to care how much force she was using in her grip and how much the tug was hurting Tommy. \u201cOw! Brianna, stop it! Please, I\u2019m sorry! Mommy! MOMMY! MOMMY, HELP! BRIANNA\u2019S HURTING ME!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were tears in Tommy\u2019s eyes as he was forcefully led downstairs into the basement where Brianna\u2019s laboratory was built. The lab was like any typical science lab, with sterilized floors, chemistry sets, and inventions that was years ahead of anyone else at Brianna\u2019s age. Past through all that was a special chamber where the testing for anything science-like happened, where Tommy was forced to endure those tests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna presses a couple of buttons to open the chamber as Tommy tried to pry her fingers off of his wrist. The angry scientific sister threw the boy into the chamber and quickly locked the door before he could escape. When Tommy recovered from his fall, he banged on the glass, begging to be let out as Brianna pressed another button. The central light of the chambers switched on, the electricity hummed and crackled, and the side lights began to glow brighter. Tommy screamed and tried to open the doors, slamming on the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrianna! Hey! Please, let me out! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Brianna, the girl who doted him with sisterly love and used him as a guinea pig for her experiments, didn\u2019t have any of it. She completely ignored him out of spite for his hate. The lights flashed brightly as a camera. Tommy\u2019s screams echoed as the flash sent a searing heat through his entire body. When the flash over, Tommy was enveloped in smoke as the machines died down. The doors opened, releasing the smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy emerged out of the smoke, coughing and wheezing, fanning away the fumes. He stepped outside of the chamber and fell flat on his face. When he looked up, wondering why the step was different over his throbbing face, Tommy screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened!? Why is everything so big!?\u201d Tommy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything didn\u2019t go big,\u201d Brianna\u2019s voice echoed above him. \u201cYou were just shrunk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tommy looked around and as the smoke cleared, he face-to-toe the biggest pair of Converse sneakers that he had ever seen. Tommy trailed the shoes upward and screamed as the giant figure of Brianna loomed over him like a goddess. She looked like a living brown-haired colossus with a Hime cut hairstyle and big square glasses. She wore black-and-white striped sweatpants that stretched high like the Gateway Arch and a t-shirt that was a enormous as a circus tent cover. If Tommy was normal sized, then Brianna would be about 80ft tall.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThere was more to this giantess too. She had a certain expression on her face that Tommy didn\u2019t make out until the smoke was blown away. Brianna had a(n) ________ expression.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She opened her pocket and looked in. \u201cShoot, I forgot my cleaning rag.

The central light of the chambers switched on, the electricity hummed and crackled, and the side lights began to glow brighter.

The now gigantic form of Brianna strode towards the chamber where he shrunk, her footsteps creating powerful quakes that grew even more dangerous as she approached. Tommy screamed and jumped away as his giant sister\u2019s Converse shoe crashed down where he stood, the giantess not even initially aware that she almost crushed him under her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!

I\u2019m down here! Your stupid chamber shrunk me!\u201d Tommy screamed as Brianna suddenly went and approached the chamber. \u201cBrianna, just stop and listen for me! I\u2019m on the floor, you stupid smarty pants, I\u2019m on the stupid floor!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Brianna still didn\u2019t hear him. Instead, she was fixated on the heat radiating from the recently deactivated chamber. \u201cThe test chamber is hot. There\u2019s steam coming from the floor...\u201d Brianna then gasped. \u201cOh no, I forgot to switch off the prototype shrinking system before I went to bed and Tommy must have switched it on by accident!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right, an accident!\u201d Tommy accused loudly. \u201cI bet you set me up so you could shrink me as part of your experiment! I hate you, Brianna, do you hear me!? I hate you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the tiny boy watched as Brianna went down on all fours, crouched over so she could get a close view of the floor and find Tommy at his size. \u201cTommy? Are you here? Please, Tommy, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve become an overbearing sister who tricked you into my experiments, but this isn\u2019t a trick this time. Please, come out, Tommy, I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy heard his giant sister\u2019s voice quiver with fear, but he didn\u2019t buy it. At different times, she usually acted innocent whenever she slipped him something experimental and humiliating. Even if she was acting genuinely worried, there was very little chance that she wouldn\u2019t subject him through torture at his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this internal debate...</span></div></div>",

For you, six-year-old Tony Sawyer, there is nothing better than seeing what your scientist neighbor has come up with now. You are a frequent visitor to Dr. Leonhardt\u2019s basement laboratory, where she shows off her latest inventions, and sometimes even gives you samples to use at home. This is what you are hoping for today as she holds the bottle before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u201d, she says triumphantly, \u201cis the world\u2019s most powerful shrinking formula. A few spoonfuls can render anyone a few inches tall. Not only that, but while shrunk, the drinker becomes incredibly durable. They can withstand enormous pressure that would kill them at regular size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes this mean\u201d, you ask, \u201cthat they can\u2019t feel pain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly\u201d, Dr. Leonhardt replies. \u201cThey won\u2019t die, but that doesn\u2019t mean things don\u2019t hurt. When I was testing this out the first time, a bowling ball fell on me. I wasn\u2019t permanently damaged, but the pain made me wish I was dead.\u201d She sees the gleam in your eyes, and knows what you\u2019re going to ask next. \u201cI\u2019ll let you have this bottle if you promise to be careful with it. And don\u2019t use it just yet. The antidote takes a long time to finish, and it won\u2019t be ready for a few days.\u201d She hands the bottle to you, and you excitedly thank her before hurrying home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk back to your house, you contemplate how you are going to use your new tonic. You are on the small side for your age, and this has become rather annoying, especially at home, given that your mom and your sister loom large over you. You always resented not being blessed with their height, as the size discrepancy has made for many awkward moments...like the typical greeting you are about to receive as you walk through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon setting foot in the hallway, a pink flash with curly red hair shoots out in front of you, and you are tackled by your eight-year-old sister Megan. The two of you rarely fight; in fact, Megan often tries to act like a second mom to you. You just get tired of the constant babying and urging you to play dolls with her. You squirm out of her grip, exasperated. If you wanted to be welcomed home this way every day, you\u2019d convince your mom to get you a dog. At least it wouldn\u2019t nearly strangle you so tight, and it would probably be more intelligent. You start on your way, but Megan\u2019s voice cuts through the air, and you brace for an even more uncomfortable receipt of affection:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMO-OM! TONY\u2019S HOME!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground rumbles slightly, and you look up to see your mother, Betty Ann, stampeding towards you with her arms outstretched. When not charging at you full-speed, your mother is ordinarily quite a pretty woman, with short brown hair, and deep blue eyes. Aside from being decidedly beautiful, *almost* everything about her was big. Big eyes, big lips, big hands, big feet, big bosom, big hips, big butt, big heart...and tiny brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s Mommy\u2019s little boy!\u201d she exclaims as she scoops you up and stuffs your face into her ample chest. \u201cHow was your day today, honey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mmmph! Grrrrgle!</i> was all you could manage as you struggle to escape. She finally pulls you out to give you a series of big, wet kisses before opening her arms and practically dropping you on the floor. You get to your feet, dizzy, dripping with sweat and gasping for breath. What your mom lacks in intelligence, she more than makes up for in affection. She loves spending time with you and your sister, and never hesitates to join Megan in playing with her dolls or you with your action figures (and sometimes you find her playing with them herself when she thinks nobody is watching). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trudge upstairs to your room, and set the vial of shrinking potion on your nightstand. You decide that you will make yourself the big one in the house for once. As much as you love your family, you\u2019ve had it with girly games and suffocating hugs. You decide to wait until Dr. Leonhardt can give you the antidote in case anything goes wrong. You want to shrink your family temporarily to be in charge for a while, but also want to make sure no real harm comes to them either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, while watching TV, you start to feel a slight unease. As time wears on, it grows worse and you gradually feel sicker, before you nearly collapse on the floor, your strength completely sapped. Your mother notices this, and comes over to you, a look of concern on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you poor baby,\u201d she says as she feels your forehead. \u201cYou must have caught the flu. It\u2019s straight into bed with you.\u201d Your mom carries you to your room where she tucks you into bed, then leaves to grab some medicine from the bathroom. A few minutes later, she comes back with a small blue bottle. \u201cHere,\u201d she says, \u201cThis will help you feel better.\u201d She gives you a few spoonfuls before placing the bottle on the nightstand. \u201cI\u2019ll give you more tomorrow. For now, try to get some sleep.\u201d She gives you a kiss on your cheek before turning out the light and leaving the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you wake up, still a little weak, but feeling much better. Your door opens, and your mother comes in, a warm, concerned smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, sweetie,\u201d she calls out. \u201cHow\u2019s my little angel feeling?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little better today, Mom,\u201d you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she declares. \u201cIt must have been a 24-hour bug. Still, you should probably have a bit more medicine just to be sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Megan comes bounding into your room. \u201cHey, little bro,\u201d she says, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a lot better today,\u201d your mom replies. \u201cMegan, honey, can you hand me the medicine bottle? It\u2019s over there on the nightstand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Mom.\u201d Megan reaches back and pulls a bottle off the nightstand behind her and hands it to your mom, before skipping back out of the room. Your mom pours the liquid into a spoon, which she sticks into your mouth. She gives you a few more spoonfuls before replacing the cap. \u201cThere now,\u201d she says. \u201cYou should be feeling much better now. I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes to check on you.\u201d She kisses your cheek before leaving to return the bottle to the medicine cabinet. You turn around and freeze in horror as your eyes rest on the label of the unused bottle sitting on the nightstand: COLD AND FLU MEDICINE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat means...the bottle Megan grabbed...the stuff your mom poured down your throat...that was.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceiling rapidly stretches upwards, and you turn around to see your now gigantic pillow. You see your action figures on a nearby shelf, and judge yourself to be about a head shorter. You must be about the size of one of Megan\u2019s doll children.

For you, six-year-old Tony Sawyer, there is nothing better than seeing what your scientist neighbor has come up with now. You are a frequent visitor to Dr. Leonhardt\u2019s basement laboratory, where she shows off her latest inventions, and sometimes even gives you samples to use at home. This is what you are hoping for today as she holds the bottle before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u201d, she says triumphantly, \u201cis the world\u2019s most powerful shrinking formula. A few spoonfuls can render anyone a few inches tall. Not only that, but while shrunk, the drinker becomes incredibly durable. They can withstand enormous pressure that would kill them at regular size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes this mean\u201d, you ask, \u201cthat they can\u2019t feel pain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly\u201d, Dr. Leonhardt replies. \u201cThey won\u2019t die, but that doesn\u2019t mean things don\u2019t hurt. When I was testing this out the first time, a bowling ball fell on me. I wasn\u2019t permanently damaged, but the pain made me wish I was dead.\u201d She sees the gleam in your eyes, and knows what you\u2019re going to ask next. \u201cI\u2019ll let you have this bottle if you promise to be careful with it. And don\u2019t use it just yet. The antidote takes a long time to finish, and it won\u2019t be ready for a few days.\u201d She hands the bottle to you, and you excitedly thank her before hurrying home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk back to your house, you contemplate how you are going to use your new tonic. You are on the small side for your age, and this has become rather annoying, especially at home, given that your mom and your sister loom large over you. You always resented not being blessed with their height, as the size discrepancy has made for many awkward moments...like the typical greeting you are about to receive as you walk through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon setting foot in the hallway, a pink flash with curly red hair shoots out in front of you, and you are tackled by your eight-year-old sister Megan. The two of you rarely fight; in fact, Megan often tries to act like a second mom to you. You just get tired of the constant babying and urging you to play dolls with her. You squirm out of her grip, exasperated. If you wanted to be welcomed home this way every day, you\u2019d convince your mom to get you a dog. At least it wouldn\u2019t nearly strangle you so tight, and it would probably be more intelligent. You start on your way, but Megan\u2019s voice cuts through the air, and you brace for an even more uncomfortable receipt of affection:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMO-OM! TONY\u2019S HOME!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground rumbles slightly, and you look up to see your mother, Betty Ann, stampeding towards you with her arms outstretched. When not charging at you full-speed, your mother is ordinarily quite a pretty woman, with short brown hair, and deep blue eyes. Aside from being decidedly beautiful, *almost* everything about her was big. Big eyes, big lips, big hands, big feet, big bosom, big hips, big butt, big heart...and tiny brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s Mommy\u2019s little boy!\u201d she exclaims as she scoops you up and stuffs your face into her ample chest. \u201cHow was your day today, honey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmmph! Grrrrgle! was all you could manage as you struggle to escape. She finally pulls you out to give you a series of big, wet kisses before opening her arms and practically dropping you on the floor. You get to your feet, dizzy, dripping with sweat and gasping for breath. What your mom lacks in intelligence, she more than makes up for in affection. She loves spending time with you and your sister, and never hesitates to join Megan in playing with her dolls or you with your action figures (and sometimes you find her playing with them herself when she thinks nobody is watching). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trudge upstairs to your room, and set the vial of shrinking potion on your nightstand. You decide that you will make yourself the big one in the house for once. As much as you love your family, you\u2019ve had it with girly games and suffocating hugs. You decide to wait until Dr. Leonhardt can give you the antidote in case anything goes wrong. You want to shrink your family temporarily to be in charge for a while, but also want to make sure no real harm comes to them either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, while watching TV, you start to feel a slight unease. As time wears on, it grows worse and you gradually feel sicker, before you nearly collapse on the floor, your strength completely sapped.

First of all, he is born at only 3 inches tall, a quarter of a foot, easy to be crush by anything if he wasn\u2019t careful. He was so fragile at this size that his single mother raised him at home by herself, and homeschooled him. Oliver loved his mother deep down, and so did she. To his mother, he was her bright hope and cared for ever until her death, and what a death it was sadly. She died in a car accident with him on her side when the vehicle slid off on ice when he was just six. It was his birthday also, and they were getting done seeing a movie. It was a great life for him, since she was able to sneak him everywhere she can go, and feed him so easily as he needed little because of his size, and while clothes and what not were a complication, the doctors worked with her to make sure he would be accounted for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she died, Oliver was taken to Social Services, and since he had no other family besides his mother, and his father was dead when he was born in another accident, they had no choice but to send him to an orphanage. However, the problem his that the boys would really treat him roughly given his tiny size, so it was decided he would be placed in a girls orphanage as they think the girls could be nice and care for him easily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orphanage name was the Sunshine Smile Orphanage for Girls, and it was a nice orphanage for its budget and what not. It had air conditioning, plenty of toys for the girls, good medical care, among other things. It was also good because Oliver is allowed to be placed there because of his conditions and how they have special care for the tiny boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie is who he meet on that day they brought him to her, and at first he was scared of seeing his new home at the orphanage, but the day he meet her, he knew he can trust her. She was a nice and compassionate person, but also fair to the girls who also watch over him as well. Oliver was depressed he lost Olivia, but he can at least trust Valerie and the other girls. It was over a year that he has made a home for himself, and he lives in a specially made doll house made by the orphanage staff which gives him everything he needs, and the house is watched by Valerie and at other time\u2019s the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts a good thing that Oliver gets along with the girls well, even though he always felt small for them, always being woken up by their movements, being treated like a toy on more than one occasion, among other things, but they know deep down they care for him. Over the year, some would leave the orphanage, being adopted by loving families, and while he is happy, he also loses a lot of friends, but some try to sneak him out, and that is where Valerie stops that from happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver always looks for the positives even during times of negative, and while its hard for him at times, he never gives up hope that one day he will be adopted, and even if not, he has Valerie and the other girls to keep him company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where do we start this cute little story?</span></div></div>",

Her D cup-sized breasts and her assets large enough to fit inside a large salad bowl jiggled with every click of her black heels. Her bulging belly stretched her lingerie to her buttons. Her great, pink lips parted as her mouth opened wide to let out a roaring yawn. She flipped her dark, pitch-black hair over her shoulder, the bangs cut across where her eyebrows should have been. It was a hell of a night, Angela figured, and she made plenty of money for a pole dance and a few lap dances. Those rolls of cash in her purse was evident enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela was a stripper who worked at the XXX Bombshells Strip Club in the back streets of the city. She had a reputation for living up to the strip club\u2019s name because she was an absolute bombshell of a woman for her age and figure. At the same time, she also had a reputation for being welcoming, motherly, and arousing. She was pretty much the great leader of the other girls in the club even though her manager was the one calling the shots. If there was one thing that any girl wanting to strip off their clothes and dance around the pole would want, it was to be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angela passed the bus stop, she heard the wailing of a baby. She stopped and tracked the noise where it came from, case in point, inside a little box. Angela carefully uncovered the box and gasped, seeing both the tiny baby Benny and the note that came with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou poor baby, come here,\u201d Angela cooed as she gently scooped up the box and cupped it to her breasts. She gently shushed the baby, rocking the box back and forth and bobbing in place to soothe little Benny\u2019s cries. \u201cThere there, it\u2019s okay, little one. There\u2019s no reason to be afraid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby eventually stopped crying. Benny opened up one eye, and the first thing he saw was a mature giantess looking down at him with a wide smile. The baby happily gurgled and giggled, reaching up towards the giantess. Angela responded by reaching down a giant finger, big enough for Benny to grasp both hands on the ridged edge of her finger alone. Feeling tired and fatigued after being left by his real mommy and being acquainted with his new mommy, Benny yawned and fell into a warm sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt melted Angela\u2019s heart to see the baby sleep so peacefully in the box carried in both her hands. \u201cPoor baby, he shouldn\u2019t even be here,\u201d Angela determined. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta get you out of here. Whoever put you here obviously hasn\u2019t realized we\u2019re next to a bad neighborhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand parting her enormous cleavage, Angela gently placed the box containing the tiny baby Benny in between her gentle breasts. After a few squeezes and adjustments, the box was safely contained in Angela\u2019s cleavage, holding it and the young occupant inside firmly. Then Angela strode right away to her apartment complex a few blocks down, her boobs rocking the baby to sleep with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

After setting her purse down, Angela reached in and gently plucked the box from between her breasts. Her movement thankfully hadn\u2019t woken up her new baby occupant. She couldn\u2019t help but swoon over Benny with how he looked with that slightest tuft it black hair on his hair, how cute he was sleeping in her palm, how innocent he was in a cruel and merciless world where he was left by what could have been a good mother, but was left to starve and die in the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou poor baby. I can\u2019t believe anyone would do that to you, to leave you out in the streets in the middle of the night to leave you to starve or catch your death of cold,\u201d Angela cooed the baby. After spending so much time using her sultry ASMR voice to patrons in the club, she figured her voice would soothe the baby to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, baby, because Mama Angie will take care of you,\u201d Angela vowed to Benny. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be a good mama to you than your real mama. I\u2019m gonna raise you into a fine little man, and I\u2019m gonna make sure no one hurts you. I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela gently brought Benny up to her enormous face and lowered her puckered lips. She gave the thumb-sized boy a quick, loving peck on his entire head. The baby stirred but didn\u2019t waken. Angela carries the boy to her bedroom and placed him on her nightstand. After freshening herself up for the evening, Angela gave one more kiss to her new tiny son and fell into a quick sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

When she entered the dressing room, five of her \u201cgirls\u201d -all young women who were younger than 35 that she personally taught and trained in stripping and dancing- were all getting ready for their graveyard shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong them was Tierra, a 32 year-old African American woman with chocolate skin, long, wavy black hair, an hourglass figure, and thick, jiggling boobs and glutes; Sofia, a 28 year-old Latina woman with a beautiful face, a slightly thick figure with C cup breasts; Emily, a 25 year-old cute redhead who lacked the curves of her fellow dancers but more than made up for in her flexibility and hypnotic dance moves; Julia, a beautiful and sexy 27 year-old brunette whose hair, boobs, and glutes were second to Tierra\u2019s; and Mary, a sexy 35 year-old blonde who was ditzy and sometimes oblivious, but not when it came to strip dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook who decided to show up an hour early,\u201d greeted Tierra, watching her mentor enter the room through the mirror while applying her mascara. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Mama? Has the rent been raised by a dollar?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I came in early to see if Meryl is here,\u201d Angela answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you\u2019re out of luck because Meryl just went out a minute ago,\u201d said Sofia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit,\u201d Angela cursed. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no other way around it. Girls, could you come around, please? I need to show you all something.\u201d The other five strippers gathered around Angela as she gently fished the little object from her cleavage. She held out the little box in the palm of her hand and showed the tiny baby inside, who yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaaaawwwwww!\u201d The strippers all exclaimed, their hearts melted by his cuteness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s so adorable!\u201d Emily observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis name is Benny. That\u2019s what it said on the note, anyway,\u201d Angela answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you get him from?\u201d Mary asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found him in that box lying in the street,\u201d Angela explained. \u201cThere was no one else to come to his rescue, so I took him home with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean he was abandoned?\u201d asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you poor thing,\u201d Sofia cooed sadly, gently rubbing his face with her finger. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry because your new Mama is gonna take care of you. And we\u2019ll help take of you too, isn\u2019t that right, girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other girls agreed on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if we can,\u201d a concerned Angela said. \u201cThis is why I have to take this up with Meryl and see if she is onboard with me taking care of Benny. This isn\u2019t exactly an appropriate environment for children like him, you know, and I can\u2019t ask anyone in my apartment to watch over him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what if one of us take care of him for you?\u201d Emily suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, or we can all pitch in and take turns bringing him to our own home,\u201d Mary pitched in her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if the strip club is no place to raise a tiny child like Benny, we can still find a way to raise him like our own,\u201d Tierra stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, girls, I appreciate you all trying to help, but...\u201d Angela looked down at the tiny boy resting in her palm, \u201c...he\u2019s already seen me as his Mama, and I promised to take care of him. If I don\u2019t do something to help him, then I don\u2019t know what to do next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door knocked, and in walked a woman older than Angela herself. She was a sexy 60 year-old GILF whose slightly complexion and slim figure had not been altered by time or medical science. Her short hair was pixie cut and parted towards the right side of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlaces, girls, this is gonna be a busy night,\u201d Meryl, the manager and owner of the strip coin said before finally noticing the newer arrival. \u201cOh, Angela, you\u2019re here early. Is there something I can help you with...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeryl\u2019s eyes widened at the sight of the tiny baby boy sleeping in the soft palms of her oldest employee. She couldn\u2019t help but gasp and cover her mouth in shock as she took a step back. \u201cWhat is that..?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeryl, you and I need to discuss something,\u201d Angela said with urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She would have fired her on the spot for breaking their important 18+ age rule had she not seen the desperation and worry in her eyes. Breathing out a short irritated breath, Angela regained her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Angela, I\u2019m listening,\u201d she said, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Angela proceeded to explain how she found Benny in a box lying in the street in the cold, how she was astounded by his tiny size, and how she felt her inner maternal instincts compelling her to care for him. Having no experience with raising kids and in need of desperate help to take care of Benny, Angela turned to her boss since she remembered that Meryl was currently a grandmother herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe GILF nodded her head, her lips drooping in a sympathetic frown. \u201cI understand. You did the right thing coming to me for help, Angela, but this is no place for a baby to be, you know that.\u201d Meryl held out her palm. \u201cCan I see him please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela nodded her head, and gently lifted the box over to her manager\u2019s awaiting palms. Meryl daintily raised her cupped palm to her face, supporting the hand carrying tiny Benny with her other hand, and smiled warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, little guy. You\u2019ve had an eventful past couple of days, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Meryl brought the tiny baby to her wrinkled pursed lips and gave the toddler a gentle kiss. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, little Benny, we\u2019ll make sure you\u2019ll grow up in a nice home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe GILF turned back to Angela with her decision made up...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She spits him up after she\u2019s done and he doesn\u2019t have a damn burn mark on him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds oddly specific,\u201d said Sofia. \u201cHave you ever done that to him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you, kidding me? Of course I haven\u2019t,\u201d Shanice snipped. \u201cI mean, would you want me coming to work with a boy in my boobs or my belly knowing full well that the boy has a single mother waiting for him at home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what I did was wrong and I know what I did goes against the company policy, but I didn\u2019t know who else to turn to,\u201d Angela said. \u201cI found this little baby left out in the cold and I couldn\u2019t leave him there, so I had to come to you because...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeryl\u2019s eyes widened in shock. \u201cWait, you said you found him out in the cold? Have you tried to warm him up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I tried wrapping him up in his blankets, feeding him hot milk, and snuggling him in my boobs, but the poor baby\u2019s like a little ice cube. He won\u2019t stop shivering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not good enough.\u201d With a sense of urgency, Meryl snatched Benny from Angela\u2019s palm and held the tiny crying baby in between two firm and gentle fingers over her face. The baby did indeed feel like a frozen little ice cube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing!?\u201d Angela practically screeched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the only way to warm up a minizora baby,\u201d Meryl said, turning to her other strippers. \u201cShanice, Sofia, hold her back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what are you...!?\u201d By the time Angela demanded food know what her boss was doing in a screaming tone, Meryl gently opened her mouth and gently lowered baby Benny onto her soft, moist tongue. Angela thrashed in the tight grip of her fellow strippers as Meryl drew the defenseless baby into her mouth and closed her lips. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare! Don\u2019t you eat that baby!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the pleas of her oldest employee in favor of the baby\u2019s safety and warmth, Meryl gently guided the crying, thrashing morsel on her tongue to the back of her throat. With but a simple, gentle gulp, she swallowed the tiny baby, much to the horror of her employees. Another swallow, and she traced the crying, wriggling bulk along her throat with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, little Benny. Just like the muscles of my esophagus hug you gently as you\u2019re squeezed down to my stomach,\u201d Meryl soothes the baby as she felt him slide deeper into her body. She placed her hand around her abdominal area as she felt the bulk land inside. \u201cThere you are, Benny. Now you warm up as long as you like.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou monster!\u201d Angela screamed, tears coming out her eyes. \u201cYou bitch! He was just a baby! How could you do that to him!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh! Listen!\u201d Meryl lifted her shirt and placed her fingers around the stomach area as the digestive organ began to grumble and groan, leaving only the slightest sound of her living morsel wailing in his new environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBenny is a minizora baby, so he\u2019s immune to all digestion,\u201d Meryl explained. \u201cThe thing you need to learn, girls, is that minizora babies have a biology that\u2019s completely different to ours. Any minizora baby born within a year must be incubated inside the stomach so they could warm up and become used to the stomach itself. Right now, Benny\u2019s chemical biology is also draining my stomach of any fluid or digestive juice so he can\u2019t drown. The sounds of my body\u2019s inner workings are putting him to sleep. The worst thing that can happen to him now is waking up in a dark and unfamiliar place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut... but how did you know all that?\u201d Angela asked, the only one who could address what the other strippers were thinking but couldn\u2019t due to their shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause my youngest son is a minizora, and I had to the same thing I did with what I did to Benny just now,\u201d Meryl said, gently stroking circles around her belly area. \u201cWhen a mother gives birth to a minizora, it is their duty or the duty of those the baby sees first to swallow them and incubate them for a month, letting them out twice a day so they can feed. I have a few grandchildren who are minizoras too, and I\u2019ve given my daughters and my daughter-in-law advice on how to handle them at a toddler age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pregnant silence hung above the group as Shanice and Sofia\u2019s grip on Angela loosened. \u201cWow, boss, I didn\u2019t realize you have grandchildren of your own,\u201d Emily said, \u201cespecially the tiny ones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I do, Emily, that\u2019s something you have to learn when you\u2019re pregnant and something to consider when you have the possibility of carrying a minizora baby inside you,\u201d Meryl said, turning to Angela and placing her hand on her shoulder. \u201cYou did the right thing coming to me about this, Angela, and I\u2019m sorry for scaring you. However, I can\u2019t in good conscience allow myself to spit Benny out because he needs time to incubate before he needs to be fed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do,\u201d Meryl said with an offer in mind. \u201cIf you agree to have me help you learn how to properly take care of a minizora baby, I\u2019ll allow him to stay with you. If you feel like Benny should be safer with me or someone else because you feel like this is complicated or if you\u2019re not comfortable with this, then I understand completely. You\u2019re the one who found him, Angie, so this is your call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela\u2019s mind weighed heavily on these options. On the one hand, Benny is only a baby and it seems he\u2019s imprinted her as his real mother. The only thing she had to do was learn how to raise the tiny baby who was being lulled to sleep inside her boss\u2019s stomach, and she was the only one who was qualified to do so. On the other hand, Angela lives in a less-than-happy neighborhood where muggings happen every so often and she\u2019s have to scrape on by with food because it cost extra to provide for the baby more than it did for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela placed her ear against Meryl\u2019s belly and listened as Benny\u2019s voice became calm and quiet, overtaken by the groaning sound of the GILF\u2019s stomach. She gently rubbed the smooth surface where lotion could only do so much for Meryl\u2019s appearance and feel. With her mind made up, Angela decided ...</span></div></div>",

Luke climbed aboard the plate and wept for the grief of separation from his parents and his home, and for the loneliness he felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, the paper plate drifted along in a creek where it got stuck in a rock. Luke climbed out of the plate and out of the creek, catching his breath in the tall green grass reaching up to his chin. Where he drifted to, Luke discovered, was the untrimmed backyard of a giant building that belonged to the giant human beans. The building was red, and it had a giant green metal box on the side. Much of the grass fields was destroyed, replaced by a hardened black soil. The giant metal monsters his parents described him were slumbering on that soil, waiting for the human beans to enter their empty bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luke drew closer to the green metal box, he grimaced at a very stinky smell. It was rancid, more rancid than giant deer droppings in the forest. Luke wondered why the human beans would leave a box with smells outside. At that moment, he heard the creaks of the spring-loaded backdoor opening, and Luke\u2019s instincts screamed at him to hide, and so he did under the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching the gaze of human beans was forbidden for borrowers. There was no telling who would be friendly and who would be hostile. As the human bean\u2019s footsteps grew louder and closer, Luke peeped out to see those feet, in those oddly shaped shoes his parents called sneakers, belonging to a stout tan woman almost the same age as his home village elder but much gigantic. She wore a cap on her head, which covered her dark hair, and a green apron stained with colorful but disgusting dots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carried black bags which posed stinky smells like in the giant metal box. Luke watched the giant female lift open the top of the box and throw the bags in, slamming the top down with a loud bang. Luke winced at the sound, almost like thunder, while the giant stomped away inside. Not able to see any other way inside the building, Luke risked his worth as a borrower and scurried quickly and silently behind the stout giantess. He kept at her heel as the door closed behind the both of them, and then hid in the shadows underneath a giant metal table and among the clutter underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a strange house that Luke crept into, full of wondrous but intimidating sights, and pleasant but also strong aromas. From the shadows, Luke witnessed the female human bean he tailed walk away through this giant room, past several other human beans.

The world is ruled by a giant goddess. They were many stories of the goddess herself, of how she got her immense power, but she is always a kind hearted and good natured person who used her powers for good to make the world a better place. How powerful she is? Well she is essentially a omnipotent like being that has lived millions of years and has never aged a single day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has powers beyond our wild imaginations, and some said that she created the oceans and the live beings, and how she moved the mountains, and how she can be at all places at once. You could think of her as a Mary Sue, but if she is a goddess we might as well consider her power as such. But with her powers she has ruled over Earth for many years, but everyone does say that she is big. You see, she can adjust her height at will, but she is always at 50ft at the smallest, but at most she can be miles big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile some don\u2019t like the goddess herself, most of everyone adores her and they all accept her as their goddess and ruler. Many cities would be made to honor the goddess, but what makes our boy special is that she is related to him. When he was just a baby, the goddess came over to the mother and smile to know that somehow he is related to her, and will hopefully be is loving guardian an angel in addition to her duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note in our story, they will be more than one giantess, and that they might be some kaiju like moments in the story, so be advised).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, let us see one of their visits together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n/<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax was sleeping in his bed in his room. He lives on a house on the edge of a forest that goes out to the ocean. Max was fast asleep just as suddenly there was a thud, and everything had a little bit of a jolt. Then the thud happened again, this time it was stronger. It woke him up this time. He was wearing his pajamas and a cool superhero T-shirt and then the ground rumbles again. He then smiled just as he heads outside of his house and notices the water rippling and shaking just as something arises out of it. It was none other than the goddess herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion, what does this goddess look like?</span></div></div>",

He is actually always been a buddy that has been studying to improve his life and takes his academics seriously, though he does have friends and plays with them in the orphanage. I mean he has a fine life with the orphanage with the facility and kids, but he also never felt he could quite fit in however.

Eric never questioned their love because he would never be here, but not to say for her absence from his life since he was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric\u2019s dad told him Athena had to leave because they were in love and conceived him, but the customs from where she came from were too demanding to the point where they would take legal action against him and his newborn son. So Athena reluctantly had to leave her beloved and her son behind to return home, leaving him to raise little Eric on his own. It was a tough road, but he did by with a paying job that ensured his son\u2019s future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grew up to resemble his father when he was younger, with a short head of black hair, but he inherited his mother\u2019s silver eyes and wisdom which got him through school. He was also a wiz at playing strategy games like Checkers and Risk. He was surrounded by good friends and he stuck by them no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day after school, everything drastically changed when Eric was getting out of school when he noticed a shadow fall over him and his school. He stood in frozen terror as a rally of giant armored feminine figures, around fifty feet in size, descended over him and his school, surrounding the entire building, and entrapping the other panicked students and faculty with their imposing sizes and their intimidating eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the armored giantesses landed, another giantess taller and older than the others by twenty feet, descended, but this one was robed with a maternal air around her. Her large eyes fell onto the frightened Eric and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, so you must be the boy,\u201d the giantess said. \u201cYou definitely have your mother\u2019s bearing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou know my mommy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. How can I not see my sister\u2019s flesh and blood within you?\u201d The giantess crouched to a squat and cupped her hand on both sides of the boy. \u201cNow come, we must leave. There is too much to do in such a short time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what are you...!?\u201d Before Eric could finish, the giantess swept her cupped hand underneath his body and lifted him up, curling her fingers around him so he couldn\u2019t jump or fall off. \u201cWait! What are you doing!? Where are you taking me!? Let me go!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will explain everything on the way, child, but we cannot linger much longer,\u201d the giantess hurriedly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I don\u2019t wanna go with you, I wanna see my daddy!\u201d Eric cried, thrashing, struggling to escape the giantess\u2019s clutches and run back home. \u201cPlease, stop, I don\u2019t wanna go with you! Please stop it! Stop it!! Didn\u2019t you hear me!?!? I said <b>STOP IT!!!! LET ME OFF RIGHT NOW!!!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, his entire tone of voice rang out like a dark echo and the giantess froze in her spot. She among the other giantesses stiffened hope like they were suddenly afraid, and it showed on the expression on their faces. Suddenly, the captor giantess turned and gently lowered the boy back to the ground, releasing her grip and slightly elevating them to let the boy back onto the green grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she, plus all the giantesses did something that shocked him and everyone witnessing these events: they went down on one knee and bowed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish, my young king.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else, the staff and the students all gasped when they addressed him as their king. Even Eric couldn\u2019t believe what was happening to him.

Their skin was made of an array of smooth blue-indigo-violet scales, but the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet was as soft as any Earthling flesh. Their hair had a certain coloration, with three different colors from their roots to the edge of those strands, making them appear they were wearing an aurora borealis veil on their heads. The irises of their eyes shone a similar spectrum with their hair, but sparkling like the stars in the night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach soldier wore armor that was reminiscent of the mythical Amazons, but in a cyberpunk style. Their outer armor, which included their helms and breastplates, their gauntlets and tassets, and greaves were white and composed of an invincible adamant metal, embedded with glowing orbs which powered their protection against explosions and most laser blasts. Underneath, their dark padded armor was thick enough to repel any physical attack or bullets. Each soldier carried a trident made of a gold-like material with a more metallic sheen, equipped at the base of each prong with a smaller red glowing orb inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess that nearly kidnapped him was a sky blue giantess who stood taller than all the other soldiers by twenty feet, whose hair was an aurora of yellow, lime green, and shamrock green. A pure white bar levitated over her shoulders, draping her body and her arms with a light blue mantle which reached to her feet, clad in transparent open toed wedge shoes. Her pinkie toe alone was a head taller than the average adult height. A gleaming golden hem decorated the end of her sleeves, around her collar, and around the bottom of her robe. Distinct white markings decorated the sides of the robe around the body and sleeves, and the front of her robe had a certain pattern to it no one else would understand except for the giantess and her royal family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir technology surpassed any of that of Earths technology by a landslide. Their spacecraft was anything beyond the stereotypical flying saucer. In fact, the only spacecraft the giantesses arrived in resembled a top like the one in Inception. This was only scratching the surface of what the M\u2019Zahnian race was capable of.</span></div></div>",

These girls were massive in height and scale, and there is even more to them as well. These girls often wear just swimsuits or bra-panties combo, and they also have powers as well. Some breath fire, some have laser eyes, but a few things are common, is that they all can breath underwater, roar like monsters, and are immune to any weapon man can throw at them.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Somewhere along the cloudy areas of the Pacific Ocean, a small ship sailing the waters sunk on account of a malfunction. The only survivors was a group of several young boys who drifted on a life raft, the oldest being 15 years old and the youngest being 9 years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 15 year-old, Jason, took charge of the small group of grieving boys who were supposed to celebrate his younger brother Matt\u2019s 11 year birthday party. The other boys who drifted with the brothers were friends and neighbors, Alex (age 10), Joey (age 10), Eric (age 11), and Jude (age 9). Jason rowed the raft away, not looking back at the smoking sinking wreck of their ship, but hearing the boys\u2019 cries from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuit crying, you twerps! We have to keep moving and find help soon!\u201d Jason shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut big bro! Mom and dad...!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget it, Matt, they\u2019re gone!\u201d Jason interrupted Matt, \u201cbut they left me in charge of you boys, and I\u2019m not gonna leave you guys until we find help or find land where we can make camp!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis... this isn\u2019t what was supposed to happen...\u201d Matt sobbed, tears coming out of his eyes. \u201cWe were supposed to be fishing... having a party on the boat... and having, but it\u2019s all ruined! I\u2019ll never see mommy and daddy again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Matt crying over his loss, the entire boat sans Jason began to cry. Jason growler as the glamour of boys grew louder, irritating him to his core. \u201cENOUGH!!!\u201d Jason screamed, silencing the boys. \u201cLook, we\u2019ll have all the time in the world to cry about what happened, but first we have to get out of this ocean. It\u2019s too dangerous for us to be here, and there\u2019s a limited supply of food and water stored on this raft. If we don\u2019t pitch in and row now, we\u2019re gonna die on this raft.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and the boys were frightened by Jason\u2019s authority, but given the situation, they all agreed to follow under Jason\u2019s leadership. The boys each took a paddle and began to row across the ocean. Through Jason\u2019s direction, they worked their arms to their limits while paddling up north, thanks to the compass Jason had on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours passed as the boys rowed through the Atlantic. Joey felt his stomach rumble and ache, and he clutched his belly. \u201cJason? I\u2019m hungry...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t eat now,\u201d Jason replied. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough food for you guys to last a few days at sea. We need to eat as little as possible and keep rowing until we find help or find land.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook! Over there!\u201d Jude said, pointing at an island off the port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn island, in this part of the ocean? I don\u2019t remember that in the world maps, but I\u2019m not risking the boys\u2019 safety out here,\u201d Jason said to himself. \u201cAlright you twerps, turn this boat to the direction of that island! We\u2019ll be camping there for as long as it takes for us to get help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and the boys turned the boat and sailed straight to the island, making it after twenty minutes of paddling until the current carried them to the sandy shore. Jason pulled the raft to shore and got a better look at the island. It was massive, full of tropical fauna as far as the eye could see. There was also a mountain range forming a massive bowl on the other side of the island. Jason heard the sounds <br>\r\nof birds squawking and flapping through the air, indicating that there was wildlife inhabiting the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, since we made it to the island, we should start making camp,\u201d Jason directed, pointing at Eric and Jude. \u201cYou two, search the island for any firewood, but don\u2019t go wandering off too far. We don\u2019t know what this island has to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for you two,\u201d Jason pointed at Alex and Joey, \u201chelp me unload the cargo. There are tarps, blankets, food, and water in storage. We can use them to set up a sleeping tent and a place for us to sleep. Matt, come and help...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned to point at Matt, but he stopped and observed his crestfallen brother sitting underneath the trees, silent and devoid of life. He hadn\u2019t said a word since the ship sank, and it didn\u2019t take long to realize what bothered him. So Jason dropped the authoritative attitude and became the brother Matt needed. Jason went over and sat down with Matt, holding him close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair, I realize that,\u201d Jason said to Matt. \u201cThis was supposed to be a good day for year. All our planning, all our preparation to celebrate the greatest day of your year, and it\u2019s all sunk now. We just lost our parents, and now we\u2019re all that\u2019s left of them. But I am gonna look after you and the others, for better or for worse. I\u2019m not gonna let anything bad happen to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt felt the floodgates burst open as he cried into Jason\u2019s shoulder. The older brother quickly held the younger boy to him and squeezed him tight, feeling the tragedy as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a shrill boyish scream rang out through the shores. Everyone stopped and turned as Eric and Jude ran out of the forest with pure terror in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, we have to move now!\u201d Eric screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa! What\u2019s going on!?\u201d Jason said as he stopped the two boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something here and it\u2019s huge!\u201d Jude hollered. \u201cWe have to go now before it gets us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s here!? What\u2019s...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the whole island seemed to tremble. Suddenly, to the shock and horror of everyone else, rising from the trees was nothing they had every seen before: a little girl the same age as Jude but bigger than the trees themselves. She stretched and yawned, scaring the birds away with her bellowing yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a nap. I\u2019m tired...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl had the appearance of a normal girl, but something was off about her, aside from her towering size. On her back, around her breasts, and around the waistline down, she was covered in rough scales. Her dinosaur spines jutted from her back all the way to her tail. She also had short green hair to match her eyes and her scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant lizard-like girl breathed through her nose, then caught a whiff of something different. Something off. She followed the scent to the beach where she came into eye contact with the boys on the beach. A wide grin spread as the young giantess exclaimed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This got all the boys absolutely horrified and have them standing right in fear, just as she got closer with her face. \u201cNow now little ones, there is no need to be scared of us. You can trust....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRUN FOR IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d Jason yelled out at the very top of his lungs. He was the only one who while in fear to gain back their courage quickly as he saw an opening between the girl\u2019s monstrous legs. This suddenly got to all the boys, and they all came sprinting right through the girl\u2019s legs, just as she swoops down with her hands to grab them, but she misses. The boys then run right more into the forest, hoping to lose the girl. \u201cOh, now this is just getting fun now, I always like a good chase.\u201d She smirked just as she turns around and then she starts stomping through the forest, shaking the ground with each and every foot stomp, in the hopes of catching up with the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe better lose her, and fast.\u201d Matt exclaimed in horror just as he is running as fast as he can. Jude was also trying to keep up, but then he steps on a log and trips, falling down and hurting himself. \u201cOuch!!!\u201d But he recovers quickly, and Jason said. \u201cYou okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am fine, thanks, but we better keep moving.\u201d He replied and the boys keep moving right into the forest area. However, their situation is about to get even worse for the boys as suddenly the giant lizard girl then smiled and gave out a vicious monster like roar that rattled the trees and everything in the area. Then suddenly, a few more roars are then heard, all sounding girlish but still monstrous, and there was even more movement in the area now. The boys were now really panicking now. \u201cOH great, this is even worse now! More of them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t want to know my friend, we better find a hiding space, and fast.\u201d Jason yelled just as the boys keep running, and then they see a tunnel down in the distance, a cave in the wall as a part of a mountain in the area. \u201cThere, I think we can lose them in that cave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, a dark cave? You know I am afraid of the dark, not like bedroom dark or stuff like that, like literal unknown darkness.\u201d Eric panicked, as he remembers he is scared of the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell its either that or we get caught. Luckily I have a flashlight with a full battery.\u201d Joey explained, as they all head for the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill they make it to the cave in time?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another weekend in the Loud House, only on this particular spring day, it was a very busy weekend. The entire Loud family was doing their annual spring cleaning where the family members were given a raffle to see which of the chores each Loud family member given. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Loud sisters and the parents all did their part with the downstairs, a certain white-haired boy was too busy hauling boxes filled with bulky materials to the open attic door. He grunted as he carried the two-ton box over to the door and dropped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew, that\u2019s another box down, twenty-seven more to go,\u201d Lincoln sighed, wiping the sweat from his head before turning to face the audience. \u201cWhen you live in a big family like I do, getting a chore to do during spring cleaning is like getting a box of chocolates: You\u2019ll never know if you\u2019re gonna get one that\u2019ll leave a bad taste in your mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln cringed and felt nauseous. \u201cBleeuugh, coconut,\u201d he said with a shudder. \u201cCase in point, I was given the chore to bring down all of the boxes downstairs so I can clean them, polish them, and sell them in our upcoming yard sale... which believe me, it\u2019s not easy as it looks given how my sisters love to cling to the past and not let it go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln went over and picked up another box, this one heavier than the others. \u201cNow if I could just get this downstairs... WHOA!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy lifting the box, the shifted weight inside caused Lincoln to fall backwards and crash into small tower of stacked boxes, all of the boxes and everything inside to come crashing down all at once. One particular box, labeled \u201cLISA\u2019S EXPERIMENTS\u201d spilled its contents over, knocking out some of Lisa\u2019s old defunct experiments. One of the contents was a beaker filled with green liquid which crashed into the floor. Another content in particular was a futuristic-looking remote that fell on the floor, conveniently aimed at Lincoln. When all the other experiments fell on it, the combined weight activated the remote, shooting a green laser from the antennae before it was completely snuffed by the crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln cringed and cowered in a fetal position as everything crashed around him. When he opened one eye, he saw he was still alive but laying in a green puddle. \u201cHuh? What happened to me? Am I still alive?\u201d Lincoln patted his body, then his face, then shone a big smile of relief. \u201cI\u2019m alive! That\u2019s a relief. For a second there, I thought Lynn\u2019s giant bowling ball was gonna crush me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lincoln froze on the spot; something was terribly wrong. \u201cWait... a giant bowling ball?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his nose up to see a familiar bowling ball looming over him. The severe cracks around the finger holes where Lynn threw a particularly hard throw during a bowling tournament where she earned first prize because the judges wanted her out before she could cause anymore damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut wait... that\u2019s impossible... that\u2019s Lynn\u2019s bowling ball and I don\u2019t remember it being so huge! It couldn\u2019t have grown in size unless...\u201d At a horrible realization, Lincoln looked around and saw everything was huge. The ceiling looked as high as the sky, the floor looked like it was in an extreme close-up view with high definition, and everything else stood over him as tall as the house itself, even taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve shrunk!? How is this possible!?\u201d A staticky flicker got Lincoln\u2019s attention. He turned and saw a familiar remote crushed underneath the pile of old knickknacks and junk, smoking as the circuits died out. \u201cOf course, Lisa\u2019s shrinking remote! She put this experiment away because it couldn\u2019t work, but now it shrunk me and now I can\u2019t get back to normal size! And then that means that wet spot I felt earlier was...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln took a good look at the green puddle seeping from the cracks of the shattered beaker. \u201cLisa\u2019s chemicals! Oh no! I got doused with her discarded chemicals!\u201d Lincoln hurriedly three off his clothing until he was in his underwear and inspected his body. \u201cHow do I look!? Is my skin different!? Do I have some wings or a tentacle sprouting out!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLincoln, what was that noise!?\u201d The tiny white-haired boy stopped as soon as he heard a familiar female voice coming up from the base of the attic steps. \u201cYou\u2019d better not be screwing around up there \u2018cause you\u2019re gonna be in big trouble if you don\u2019t get your chores done!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the attic steps creak and felt the footfalls as the giantess climbed up into the attic. \u201cWhoa...\u201d is all that the tiny boy could mutter as he was met with the gigantic looming figure of...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Steven tries one or the other without realizing that the shrinking permanently keeps him reduced to size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorn Tiny: Somehow, Steven is born tiny due to complications of birth.

If anyone thought that Alexandrite, Sugilite, Obsidian, or the Diamonds were big enough, then you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. 2.): the Gem Fusions are natural Gem giants who don\u2019t need to be formed by fusing their base gems.

Truth of the matter was, he didn\u2019t have a home anymore. He lost it and his dad, Greg when a sudden rainstorm swept both away in a mudslide. Saddened and alone by his tragic loss, Steven had no choice but to rely on his taught skills and the kindness of the woodland critters to find him a new, suitable home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks had passed while Steven continued to search for a home in the forest, but had no avail.

He kept to the bushes and remained hidden from sight, but he peeked his head out to observe the world beyond the trees.

Not too far from the edge of a water was a cliff, and on that cliff was a sculpture of a giant among giants with flowing curly hair and eight arms. Built inside of that cliff along with the statue was a  simple beach house with a set of wooden stairs leading up to the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house seemed big enough to fit three people. Steven didn\u2019t know if there was anyone living there, but with any luck, the homeowners wouldn\u2019t be there, and even if there was, Steven\u2019s learnt borrower skills would come in handy. Under the cover of a seashell, Steven scuttled across the sand towards the bottom step of the stairs. From the shape of the structure, it looked like climbing up was his best option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could make a move, the front screen door swung open, and out walked a young giant female human overlooking the beach. She raised her arms up and stretched. \u201cWhat a beautiful day!\u201d the giant female observed happily. \u201cMakes me wanna go swimming... with my clothes on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant mounted over the railing, giggling as she landed in the sand on her bare feet and made a break for the seawater. She was slightly plump and shorter then most humans her age with thick thighs, arms, and breasts which all jiggled with her steps. Her skin was caramel and her long hair, covering up her left eye, was dyed amethyst, but the roots were black. The clothes she wore was a loose fuschia shirt with a black bra strap exposed, light purple jeans with the leggings torn off above the knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the giggling plump giant made for the ocean, Steven, hiding behind the stairs, looked up at the sound of the screen door opening again. \u201cAmethyst, don\u2019t you dare jump in that ocean! I just got your clothes cleaned for you yesterday!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrill voice belonged to another giant human woman, who strode down the stairs in pink ballet flats and knee-high orange socks. Her skin was as bright as a pearl and was as skinny as a walking stick insect. She had short strawberry blonde hair and a pointy nose, accompanied by a motherly scowl towards the rebellious plump girl. What she wore consisted of a pink skirt with short orange leggings, and a white crock tied at the waist by a bright pink ribbon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other giant who accompanied her was a dark-skinned woman with a curious air around her. She seemed so soft-spoke behind her thick lips. Her eyes seemed nonexistent behind the pair of sunglasses she wore, which fit well with her box-shaped afro. She wore a velvet red jacket with a magenta interior, and a midriff shirt that was split between pink and purple, showing off her abdominals. A pair of dark jeans covered her extremely thick thighs, and a pair of flat shoes with raspberry toe areas and bright pink heels covered her dark feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, come on, P, where\u2019s your sense of adventure!?\u201d the giant named Amethyst asked as she backed to the edge of the shore. \u201cYou have any idea what it feels like to have your soaked shirt cling to your body. If you wanna join me, then you might be the center of Rose\u2019s attention if you know what I mean!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat... that\u2019s not it at all!\u201d The giant named P replied, sporting a shade of red. \u201cDo you have any idea how sticky and briny it feels to wear a shirt soaked in saltwater!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, of course I do! Why do you think I wanna swim in my clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I...!\u201d P grumbled in frustration and turned to the darker giant. \u201cGarnet, a little help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant human named Garnet adjusted her sunglasses and walked up to the stout giant. \u201cAmethyst, trying to clean off saltwater from your clothing is an arduous process. It takes a lot of time, a lot of soap, a lot of water, and a lot of energy to wash your clothes as many times as it takes to clean the salt off. If you wade one toe into that water in those clothes, then the utility bills needed to clean your clothing will run up and you won\u2019t have any money to spend on Cookie Cats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst felt herself grumble in defeat. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll go put on a stupid swimsuit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven sucked behind the stairs as the giant human walked over him on the steps, giving him a view of her dirty plump soles as they were escalated up the stairs. The tiny borrower decided now was as good as any time to climb up the stairs while the other two humans engaged in a stressful conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis rebellious side of her is getting ridiculous. I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s like this,\u201d P vented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPearl, this is a common phase in teenagers that they go through adolescence. You know this as well as I do,\u201d Garnet told the human, Pearl, adjusting her sunglasses. \u201cAmethyst\u2019s case requires love and patience with her. She\u2019s been a lot since before Rose took her in... before we all took her in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, and I have tried, Garnet,\u201d Pearl answered, \u201cbut every time I try to give her the benefit of the doubt, she looks at me like I\u2019m king of stranger! I brought this up time and time again to Rose, and every time, she says the same thing that you\u2019re saying: love and patience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all the more reason why we should keep practicing it,\u201d Garnet replies. \u201cRose saw something in her the same way she saw something in us. We mustn\u2019t take Amethyst for granted. There are rules to set, but we have to show her there\u2019s a better way for all this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven wasn\u2019t paying much attention as he climbed up the railing of the stairs with ease. So far, none of them has ever seen the figure of a tiny boy crawling up the steps like it was nothing. This was good because a borrower being spotted meant the possible end for a borrower itself. Steven climbed up two sets of stairs, the first set leading to the second set, and the second set leading up to the porch. The young borrower managed to make it to the last step of the stairs when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...the screen door swung open, and the grumbling, grumpy form of the human named Amethyst stood at the doorway. She was apparently changed out of her clothes and into a black swimsuit covering her thighs and her thick breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just changed into my swimsuit, Pearl. I hope you\u2019re happy,\u201d the crabbed Amethyst called out as she took her first few steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow of Amethyst\u2019s giant form enveloped Steven\u2019s tiny form. He was unable to move in time, only having that much time to nearly scream as Amethyst\u2019s pudgy barefoot squashed him against the porch, flattening him against her sole. \u201cHuh? What the...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight against Steven\u2019s body was lifted along with the plump foot from the wooden floor. He moaned breathlessly as the barefoot was overturned, positioned so that he was laying on his back against the plush skin of the human\u2019s barefoot. The human herself went wide-eyed as she observed the little creature she accidentally stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, is that...?\u201d Steven turned to the voice and gasped as the excited human reached down and gently plucked him off of her foot. She held the young borrower in cupped hands and observed Steven taking one good look at her gigantic face and immediately curled up in a fetal position. \u201cNo way! Unreal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmethyst, what\u2019s going on up there?\u201d Pearl called out to Amethyst as she and Garnet noticed her picking something off of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Amethyst grew a Cheshire Cat grin, which made Steven cower further into the pillowy palm flesh. \u201cOh man, I gotta show you to Garnet and Pearl. They\u2019re gonna flip so much, their heads are gonna spin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Steven could protest, the giant human clamped her fist tightly, trapping the poor tiny boy in a claustrophobic cage of pudgy and warm flesh. He screamed as he was rocked by the motion of Amethyst running down the stairs while pumping her fists. Then he was overturned and imprisoned with both cupped hands and held close to the human\u2019s chest. \u201cHey Garnet! Pearl! Look at what I found on the stairs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl scoffed. \u201cPlease, Amethyst, if it\u2019s another one of your big tricks, then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst opened her hand, revealing the tiny borrower who clinched at the light. He was then engaged in a surprising staring contest between him, and the humans Pearl and Garnet. Steven squealed, which made Pearl squeal and Garnet gasp. \u201cOh no! This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen! You weren\u2019t supposed to see me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmethyst, what on Earth is that thing!?\u201d Pearl demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. He looks like a kid to me. I kinda found him climbing on the porch when I accidentally stepped on him,\u201d Amethyst answered. \u201cCan we keep him!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? No!\u201d Pearl screeched. \u201cAmethyst, this is a child we\u2019re talking about! He\u2019s a human being, not a house pet! Besides, just look at him! He Looks like he just hiked through an entire forest by his lonesome! You don\u2019t know what disease he might have!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, duh! That\u2019s why I wanna keep him!\u201d Pearl shook her head at Amethyst\u2019s insistence. \u201cAw, c\u2019mon, Pearl, I promise I\u2019ll look after him. I\u2019ll feed him, I\u2019ll bathe him, I\u2019ll keep an eye on him, I\u2019ll even do all that mamby-pamby cleaning stuff you do around the house!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is not mamby-pamby, Amethyst,\u201d Pearl grumbled, \u201cand what you\u2019re talking about is keeping a little boy the size of your finger as a pet! This boy has his own free will, and now you\u2019re scaring him just by saying you wanna keep him in a cage!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere else are we gonna put him, P!? He\u2019s so small, he could crawl inside the walls and escape!\u201d Amethyst barked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, but the fact is that this boy is frightened because you stepped on him and you\u2019re willing to keep him in captivity!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s scared because you\u2019re being so bossy and loud!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl gasped in exasperation. \u201cBossy and loud!? Maybe he\u2019s scared because you\u2019re obnoxious and unruly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough, bit of you! You\u2019re both scaring him!\u201d Garnet shouted, immediately silencing the two bickering women. She squatted down so she was face-to-face with the frightened tiny boy. Steven could see his reflection through her glasses. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019re not going to hurt you. My name is Garnet. This is Pearl, and the one holding you is Amethyst.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Sup?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a name?\u201d Garnet asked the boy, quivering in Amethyst\u2019s palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s S-S-S-Steven,\u201d the borrower stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where did you come from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-The forest,\u201d Steven stammered nervously. \u201cI-I-I had to move because a mudslide washed away my house during the last rainfall, along with my dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, that\u2019s terrible,\u201d Pearl gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, man, that\u2019s rough,\u201d Amethyst said with as much sympathy as she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been trying to find a place to live since then?\u201d Garnet asked the tiny boy, who nodded with a whimper. She took a close look at the backpack he wore, a little rag tied with a single button the size of his belly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Steven. It must be hard trying to find a new home, being a borrower in your case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA borrower? You know what he is, Garnet?\u201d Pearl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do. I read books about his species,\u201d Garnet said. \u201cThey are tiny people who scurry about the walls and collect scraps little scraps and trinkets to survive. There have been times where some have been captured from their families and were hardly ever seen again. That\u2019s why they hide from plain sight. I thought they were just fiction, but I never thought I could meet one in person.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do, Garnet?\u201d Pearl asked the black woman. \u201cWe can\u2019t take him in without everyone not knowing about his existence. I can see Ruby, Sapphire, and Rose being fine with taking him in, but our extended families can\u2019t know about him! If they found out about Steven, they might hurt him or take him away to be shown off in a cage like a captive animal! He\u2019s a tiny human being!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we can\u2019t,\u201d Garnet agreed with Pearl\u2019s sentiment, \u201cbut we can\u2019t let him wander off into the wilderness alone. He\u2019s a child. He lost his father and he needs someone to love him, someone to help raise him and lift him up through his hardships. If any of our sisters ever find out he exists, we\u2019ll find a way around it, but leaving him out where the elements can turn against him is a far worse fate than he deserves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, Garnet...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteven will be staying with us,\u201d Garnet firmly stated. \u201cHe\u2019s a lost soul like we were until Rose took us in. We owe it to help him just like we helped each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one thing Garnet was known for, it was knowing how to drive the point home. No one could ever go against Garnet\u2019s logic, no matter how much they try to find their way around it. She\u2019s always been a good judge of character and accepting, which is why she was a favorite among the other \u201csisters\u201d Rose took in. At this point...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m coming!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lovesick fool Syrus Truesdale paddled across the lake in a rowboat he borrowed, headed straight for the Obelisk Blue Girl\u2019s Dormitory. Having received a fake love letter as part of a ploy by the devious Dr. Crowler by mistake, Syrus rowed his way to the girl\u2019s dorm at night, completely under the influence of the love bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the dorm, he hadn\u2019t counted on Dr. Crowler hiding in the bushes near the front gate, waiting and watching for the Slifer Slacker, Jaden Yuki, to take the bait. \u201cThis will be perfect, thanks to that faux love letter I wrote!\u201d he said, waiting by the front doors where he destroyed the lock of the front gate. \u201cJaden will show up looking for Alexis, but all he\u2019ll find is trouble instead. Once he arrives, the dormitory\u2019s newest security system will change his life in a big way because he\u2019ll be reduced to the size of a bug! Then, once he is shrunken and found by the girls, they\u2019ll have to keep him as a pet and keep him out of my hair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrowler cackled, but as soon as he saw a bit of red approaching, he quickly shut up and ducked back into the bushes. \u201cCome, Jaden, right into my trap like the Slifer sap you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he saw that bit of red was attached to an excitable head of blue hair. \u201cAlexis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not Jaden! It\u2019s that stammering Field Spell nitwit!\u201d Crowler practically screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompelled by his foolish love, Syrus opened the gate, swinging into an infrared laser positioned at the entrance. All of a sudden, a couple of pylons shot up from the ground and emitted a strange green light, engulfing the unfortunate Syrus in its glow. Then, as quickly as the light faded, Syrus found himself facing a new entirely gigantic world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? W-what happened to me!? Why am I so small!?\u201d Syrus panicked, Crowler watching the pitiful display with grit teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlast it! That nitwit completely ruined my trap!\u201d the antagonistic vice-chancellor growled. \u201cNo matter, with him gone, I can have one less Slifer slacker giving me trouble. I\u2019ll just have to find another way to get rid of Jaden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver there! I saw the green light by the front gate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA boy tried to get in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cacophony of female voices arose from the distance as they stampede towards the entrance. Crowler\u2019s pencil-like body stiffened at the noise. \u201cOh good gracious! I\u2019ve got to get out of here!\u201d he said, hopping out of the bushes and diving into the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor little Syrus, meanwhile, was too scared as he was entirely surrounded by giant pairs of feet, either bare or in slippers, all of whom belonging to the suddenly giant girls who looked down at him with all different flavors of fiery anger. Two of the girls in particular, Jasmine and Mindy, stepped up to the tiny boy, the former snatching him up in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey, let me go, please!\u201d Syrus begged while being tightly restrained in the giantess\u2019s hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot until you tell us why you\u2019re here,\u201d Jasmine said, \u201cand it better be good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she end up doing after he told her?</span></div></div>",

After pulling out the Master Sword, Young Link was sealed away for seven years, during which time Ganondorf ruled the world.

He honed his physical skills into dodging traps, practiced his moves on the training dummies, and learned to wield his nagitana weapon to uniquely set himself apart from his mother and sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiv was midway during his training through the morning sun\u2019s ascension into the sky when he felt the tremors of giant feet approaching him. He turned to face a pair of feet with two dark toes strapped in sandals. He looked up to see Sheeva, queen of the Shokan, protector of Sindel Kahn, looming over him, her four arms off to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrince Shiv, your mother requests you grant an audience with her,\u201d Sheeva said, squatting down and holding her palm out for the tiny prince to climb on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing Shiv loved about Sheeva was how she carried him around the castle, cupped in two clammy palms while the other two palms acted like a guardrail so he wouldn\u2019t fall off. The queen of the Shokan carried the tiny heir to Outworld into the throne room where his mother sat high on the throne while his sister and her protector stood off to the side. Sheeva held out the tiny prince to the Kahn, who knelt in respect for the woman who conceived him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wished to see me, mother?\u201d Shiv inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has come to my attention, son, that you have been sneaking out into the training grounds by your lonesome in order to hone your skills,\u201d Sindel said with an air of regality. \u201cWhile it is commendable that you are practicing for kombat, it is ill-advised that you should leave yourself open where our enemies will attack you on the spot. That is why the time has come for you to be assigned a bodyguard, one who will protect you from any attempt on your life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut mother, you and Kitana and your protectors have shielded me from attacks before,\u201d Shiv retorted. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t they be the ones to protect me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause we will all not always be around to protect you should anything happen,\u201d Sindel answered. She carefully scooped Shiv out of Sheeva\u2019s hands and held him to her face. \u201cYou are an heir to the throne of Outworld. One day, my son, you will take the throne, and you must have someone to protect you and guard you with their lives. That is why I have arranged for someone from one of the other realms with exceptional skills to live with us and keep watch over you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to the throne room was opened, and through it came the female Kombatant of his mother\u2019s choice.

Overwatch vs. Talon. Winston and Tracer vs. Widowmaker and Reaper over Doomfist\u2019s powerful gauntlet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered his Brian ordered his tiny brother to stay hidden as he set him up on the stand obscured by the broken glass. Then Brian went out and helped the two famous Overwatch agents beat the Talon agents by using their own arm-shaped payload against them. When Widowmaker and Reaper retreated, Timmy remembered how Tracer told the two boys, \u201cYou know, the world could use more heroes.\u201d That was the greatest day of the boys\u2019 lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot more than six months later passed by since then that the boys never stopped thinking about that day. Unfortunately, tragedy struck when Talon struck the shopping mall Timmy and his family went shopping at. Talon soldiers devastated the mall and everyone in it, except for a handful of survivors kidnapped to be used for Moira\u2019s experiments, Timmy included. Timmy was the youngest victim taken by Talon, which intrigued Moira to the point where she focused most of her attention on experimenting on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such experiment was forcing Timmy into a chamber where a radioactive veil swept over him, shrinking him to tiny size, the size of a thumb. Afterwards, they subjected him to many tests and discovered the chamber granted Timmy high physical durability and immunity to stomach acids. Upon this discovery, Timmy was often tested on by Moira, tortured by Widowmaker, and teased by Sombra for two straight months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after the second month passed, salvation came for the traumatized shrunken boy when the female members of Overwatch took the Talon base by surprise, resulting in the rescue of three-quarters of the prisoners still alive. Tracer, who led the charge, found the tiny boy locked away in Moira\u2019s office, huddled in his little energized cage. Tracer spent most of her time comforting the grieving boy in the aftermath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, it was decided by Mercy and Tracer that the latter would adopt the tiny Timmy as her own little brother and be allowed to live with her and her lesbian partner, Emily. In addition, Timmy had to attend weekly psychiatric sessions with Mercy to help him with his psychological trauma from witnessing his family\u2019s demise and being kept prisoner by Talon. Every day of the week, Timmy would be educated by the brilliant minds of Mei, D.Va, and Efi Oladele (with whom he falls in love with) to make up for the months of formal education lost in captivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonths after becoming a part of Tracer\u2019s family and psychiatric sessions with Mercy, Timmy decided the only way for him to become brave was to train and become a member of Overwatch. Through training from various female members, and with the help of Hammond the mechanical genius hamster, Timmy is recruited into Overwatch as its youngest member to join. With the help of his new family, Timmy, the bite-sized boy is determined to avenge his old one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat part of Timmy\u2019s life are we focusing on?</span></div></div>",

One day, Jack and his mother had very little money for food, so the mother said, \u201cJack, take Old Bessie to the market and sell her for profit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack took the family\u2019s cow, Old Bessie to the marketplace when he happened to come upon a strange man who offered him magical beans in exchange for Old Bessie. So Jack traded the cow for the beans and merrily skipped home. When Jack told his mother and showed her the magical beans, the mother smacked the beans from his hand, struck him, and chastised him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou foolish boy! You stupid foolish boy! We would never fill our bellies on one bean, let alone three! You have been a shameful disgrace since you were growing in my belly! That is why your father left us in from financial ruin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was so heartbroken that he had sequestered himself in his room for the rest of the day. During that night, the magical beans began to sprout and quickly grew into a giant beanstalk tall enough to stretch into the sky, into the heavens above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Jack and his mother were amazed by the sight of the giant beanstalk sprouting from their very own backyard. The beans alone were the size of a horse wagon. At the mother\u2019s urge, she said to Jack, \u201cWell? What are you waiting for, you fool!? Climb up to the top of the beanstalk and collect all the beans!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack obeyed his mother and began to climb up the beanstalk, plucking every bean along the way and letting them fall to the ground. As he climbed higher, he climbed up into the clouds. Jack climbed higher and higher until he emerged from the surface of the clouds and was astounded to see a giant garden with vegetables the size of his house! Carrots, cabbages, radishes, cucumbers, tomatoes, and so much were laid out in a field bigger than his own village!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond this garden was a castle as big as a small mountain. The doors alone were bigger than the church steeple. The curious Jack hiked through the garden and at the foot of the door, he pounded it hard with all his might. Not so long afterwards, the door opened and out stepped a giant woman the exact size of the steeple. She was a potbellied giantess who wore large rags similar to what his mother wore. Her dirtied feet were strapped in leather sandals, her toes wiggling in place. Her auburn hair was curled and tucked under a rag wrapped around her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d the giantess called out to what she perceived as no one. \u201cWho dares knock on my door and disappears while I prepare supper!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby giantess hadn\u2019t known that standing at her toes was an astounded little boy named Jack who was small enough to be eaten by her in one bite. The giantess then set her sights at the ground, and Jack\u2019s blue eyes met her brown eyes. The giantess was...</span></div></div>",

Jack was caught in the giantess\u2019s pillowy palm and struggled to move as he was lifted up into the air and up to her face. He got a better look at the giantess\u2019s round, freckled face, her giant brown eyes brightened up in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, it is! A little boy stumbled upon my home!\u201d the giantess said marvelously, holding Jack to close proximity to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe size of the giantess\u2019s mouth frightened poor little Jack. The maw was like a cave deep under the sea, dark and wet where hardly any light shone inside its deeper darkness. Her tongue was like a giant pink serpent waiting for its next victim to devour, and the incisor teeth were the size of an executioner\u2019s axe. Worse was the abyssal throat which led down to the boiling cauldron of the giantess\u2019s stomach where her food boiled and burned alive into nothingness in her digestive stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me, miss giant!\u201d Jack begged, cowering in the flesh of her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess let out a hearty chuckle. \u201cWorry not, my tiny friend, for I do not desire the taste of human flesh, not even to children such as yourself! I am Helga Fostrajotunn, a kindly giant from a faraway land of giants of myth! Who are you and what brings such a young one to my home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Jack, a poor and hungry boy from the land below the clouds,\u201d Jack introduces himself. \u201cI was given magical beans from a strange man for my family\u2019s cow and for that, my mother punished me. The magic beans grew into the beanstalk that reaches here. My mother tasked me with climbing the stalk to pick the beans when I climbed through the clouds and beheld your garden and your castle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoor and hungry? You poor little one, you look like nothing but skin and bones!\u201d Helga gasped. \u201cCome inside. I will treat you to breakfast, but be warned, for my lover desires the taste of the flesh of tiny young ones like yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Helga took Jack to her kitchen and treated him to a feast as she promised. A crumb of bread, a slice of cheese, a slice of meat, and a thimble full of milk. As Jack\u2019s belly was filled from the feast, a brutish feminine voice rang out through the castle. \u201cWife! Where is my breakfast!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! It is my wife, Marsha Laejotunn! She is a fierce giant warrior who devours anything she deems edible, including you!\u201d Helga quickly scooped up the frightful Jack and scurried around the kitchen. \u201cI must find a place for you to hide. No tiny person has ever returned from the inside of my wife\u2019s belly! If you are eaten, you will never be seen again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWife! Answer me!\u201d Marsha\u2019s voice boomed. \u201cIs my breakfast ready!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the doorway came a giantess, her body adorned with a build of muscles. Her long black hair hung from her head to her shoulders like a curtain of night. Her eyes were reddened from the excessive consumption of ale. She wore plated armor on her breasts and around her waist, Paul drone on her shoulders, heavy leather open-toes boots on her feet, and leather wristbands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the other giantess entering the kitchen made Helga panic. In that panic, Helga hid the distressed tiny boy...</span></div></div>",

The inside of her mouth smelled like rotting milk and stale saliva as Jack struggled against the giantess\u2019s tongue and her bottom jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWife! Where is my breakfast!?\u201d the brutish giantess Marsha demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is on the table, love, where it belongs!\u201d Helga answered, keeping Jack hidden under her tongue while her jaw moved. \u201cYou have indulged in too much consumption of ale that it has clouded your vision of the food I have carefully prepared for you this morning! Oh, woe is me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarsha couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cHa! Woe is you, indeed! My squadron has failed to access the world of the humans below for food and conquest and you suffer my drinking! I have yet to taste the sweet flavor of human flesh again, even the boy humans whose taste is fresher than the men!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShame on you, my love! You would eat the children of the humans to satisfy your greedy, gluttonous belly, and satiate your own lust!\u201d Helga scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me not of my taste in human child, wife!\u201d Marsha remarked. \u201cYou would coddle them as if a mother, but you only doom them to become fodder for me and my squadron!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarsha sat down at her table and began to gather a portion of each food onto her plate. She began to scarf down the breakfast, noisily chewing her food before she swallowed. Helga shuddered in fear for the poor young souls lost inside her wife\u2019s belly. \u201cIt is the way of the giants to consume humans who are smaller than them, and it is only right for the giantess to swallow the human children as an act of mercy against being ravaged by the male giants!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga was taken aback by this statement. \u201cMarsha, my love, you wound me! The children of giants are no different from the children of humans! They are the future of their own kind, and to swallow the children means there is no future! My love, if only you had more of a taste for me as you do or the human children, then our love would be different!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga turned her back to her brutish wife and began to cry from betrayal. Marsha, sending her wife\u2019s hurt, approached her and gently held her close, Helga\u2019s head reaching her chin. \u201cHelga, my dear wife, please forgive my impertinence, but I dare not oppose to the nature of the giants I was brought up on. As much as I love the taste of tiny humans on my tongue, the taste your lips is the taste I desire above all else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Marsha wipes away Helga\u2019s tears and brought the flustered giantess\u2019s lips to hers. The kiss started with the simple meeting of their lips, and then went deeper as Marsha\u2019s tongue probed the inside of Helga\u2019s mouth. Inside, poor little Jack, who had heard the entire conversation, was scooped up by another unforgiving tongue from underneath the one which pinned him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarsha and Helga\u2019s tongues wrestled each other, and in the deep feeling of their passion, they didn\u2019t feel the tiny form of Jack on their tongues. While the giantesses\u2019 tongues rolled around and probed deep inside Helga\u2019s maw, Jack was rolled over, under, and around their tongues, scraped against Helga\u2019s teeth, and slathered in stinky saliva. It was during this particularly deep kiss that...</span></div></div>",

He recognized their spears, their swords, and their glorious shields. Timmy\u2019s mommy told him bedtime stories about the legends of the Greek Amazons, their home island on Themyscira, and their queen, Hippolyta. He was elated to hear that the island was the home of their princess, Diana, the world-renowned superheroine, Wonder Woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy always wanted to visit Themyscira and meet the Amazons himself, but the island/country of Themyscira had a strict rule about men setting foot on the island. This rule also stemmed down to little boys, too. Personally, he had every right to be frightened about this than he was now. First of all, the Amazons were strict and absolute. They followed their duty down to a T. Anyone with an XY chromosome (except for a few exceptions) would either be captured, kept prisoner, or be brought back to the World of Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other reason is that Timmy was so small, the giantesses didn\u2019t even see him on the ground. The lead soldier, a black woman unknowingly marched towards Timmy\u2019s position, trailed by a few others. Her sandaled foot raised in the air to take another step, right on top of Timmy. The boy screamed as he rolled away before the sandaled foot fell on that spot, watching the deep foot-shaped impression pressed into the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Timmy looked back and did the same thing with the oncoming giant feet, rolling away and yelping while avoiding from being flattened under the soles of the giant Amazonian warriors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a waste of our time,\u201d addressed the redheaded giantess, Artemis of the Bana-Mighdall. \u201cWhoever the man Menalippe spoke of to our queen would not dare wish to remain on the island without invoking the Amazon\u2019s wrath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leading armored black woman and turned to the impatient Amazon. \u201cBe still your tongue and your impatience, Artemis,\u201d General Phillipus ordered firmly. \u201cMenalippe has never led us astray with her clairvoyance. She spoke of a son of Man\u2019s World would wash upon the shores of Themiscyra, so our orders are to find this son and report him to the queen without prejudice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis scoffed. \u201cFine. So if this son of Man\u2019s World is here, then where has he ended up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps he has wandered off into the forest?\u201d Phillipus guessed. \u201cAny son from Man\u2019s World would be curious... or foolish enough to enter the forest without knowing what creatures lurk within the trees.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he did, then we would see fresh tracks leading into the woods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Amazons debated the skepticism of the predictions of their fellow Amazonian oracle, unbeknownst to them at their feet, Timmy watched and listened to it all. He didn\u2019t understand what an oracle was, or why they were looking for him. Maybe it was because he washed up on shore. As he was an eight year-old boy, Timmy first figured that him being there meant he would be subjected to the Amazons\u2019 harsh treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his size, the Amazons wouldn\u2019t even try to treat him badly! Maybe they\u2019d squish him underneath their feet, swallow him hole, or do whatever torturous methods ran through his thoughts. At that point, Timmy knew what he had to do. </span></div></div>",

So the boy reached the sandal-clad foot of one of Themyscira\u2019s most formidable warriors. Her sole emanated a certain fruity, coconut-y scent. She must take special care of her feet while in the shower, Timmy figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis timing couldn\u2019t be any more impeccable because as soon as he reached Artemis\u2019s left foot, Philippus up above ordered her troops to move. Timmy barely had time to hold on tight when Artemis\u2019s left foot rose up and fell in a march. Each rise and fall was as scary as the last. It was like holding on the side of a roller coaster: a dangerous, adrenaline-pumping experience which made Timmy scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one certain turn to the right, Artemis unknowingly flung the one-inch boy with her foot. The fling sent Timmy at a maximum height of nearly ten stories, which was like up to the knees Amazons. Timmy screamed the whole way as he flew a great distance into nowhere.

Timmy yelped when he saw and immediately jumped out of the way of a blonde Amazons\u2019 sandaled foot. The foot landed just as the tiny eight year-old landed headfirst in a small pile of sand. He managed to shake his way out of the sand, but for a split second, he completely forgot to take into account the giantess whose sandal he hitched onto was literally a step behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Timmy heard one of her footsteps from behind him, he and the pile of sand was suddenly scooped up by a flat, leathery surface. Timmy felt like he was on a slide for just a split surface just before he felt a soft but immense amount of pressure on his back, wedging him between two giant feminine digits. With it, Timmy was held tight between two of Artemis\u2019s goes and forcibly, unknowingly, and unwillingly carried along for the rough ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent of that fruity and coconut-y was stronger here. The power of Artemis\u2019s toes clenched the boy between the big toe and the index toe. Timmy screamed as he was subjected to an intensely scary front row seat to the rise and fall of Artemis\u2019s foot without anything else to safely strap himself in. The toes loosened slightly with every rise and then they clenched tightly with every fall. The impact knocked Timmy around a little, enough to disorient him and give him a dizzying headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Timmy wasn\u2019t the only one who felt he was knocking around with each footfall. Not long after her debate with Phillipus, Artemis was only several steps into the March when she felt something irritating her left foot. With each step, she felt something in between two of her clenching toes and opted to do something about it. She decided to wriggle her toes, manipulate her digits to push away the tiny obstruction between her foot and her sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to her, she made a one-inch young boy suffer through it all. The tiny eight year old screamed as suddenly, midway throughout the walk from hell, the giantess wriggled her toes on top of him. The two toes that trapped him smothered Timmy\u2019s tiny body underneath the powerful digits. The five titanic toes squished him against the sandal\u2019s flat. With each little wriggle, Timmy ended up getting squishing him further and further down and deeper underneath the soft and scented sole. Out of desperation, the crying tiny boy beat against the skin of the foot and hit right into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis suddenly grunted at the sharp pain underneath her foot. Perhaps she accidentally picked up a biting ant in her sandal? She wriggled the ball of her foot and pressed it harder against the obstruction in her sandal. It was really wriggling underneath her foot. It felt rather nice, if Artemis was being honest with herself, but it was getting in the way of her march. She stopped her march to loosen up her foot from her sandal and tapped the toe section to force the little bug out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSending her discomfort, Philippus halted her company and turned to the high-ranking red-haired Amazon foolishly staying behind just to adjust her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere had better be a reason for you to be falling out of rank, Artemis,\u201d the general addressed her, to which Artemis replied...</span></div></div>",

I need to check it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fierce and suspicious Artemis lifted her foot up and held it sideways. By squeezing the leather sandal, Artemis was able to create an opening between the flat and the underside of her foot so the little bug that bit her would roll out and into her open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy, on the other hand, recently experienced neck-breaking vertigo when Artemis tapped her toe section, trying to force him out from under her foot. Thanks to the soft yet firm hold of Artemis\u2019s foot skin, the tiny eight year-old was kept from being thrown out into the sand and possibly stomped on by the giantess. In the midst of being battered, bruised, and disoriented by the ignorant giantess\u2019s feet, Timmy felt the urge to puke from the intense dizziness. Even that didn\u2019t stop him from feeling everything rise up and turn on its side. All of a sudden, the squeezing pressure between her foot and the sandal suddenly gaped open as Timmy felt himself sliding backwards then rolling from underneath the ball, the overbearing toes, and then into the soft, calloused hand of the giantess who unknowingly tormented him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy coughed and sputtered as the palm he crouched on was lifted to the level of the stern green eyes of the fierce Amazonian warrior. As soon as the tiny boy looked into those giant, seemingly hostile eyes, the boy screamed and curled in a fetal position, turning away from Artemis\u2019s gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me!\u201d Timmy cried as the other gigantic Amazonian soldiers marched up to him and Artemis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArtemis, what is that in your hand?\u201d Philippus demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently, I found the fabled son of Man\u2019s World, but he is nothing more now than a bug that found its way into my shoe,\u201d Artemis answered, holding the scared one-inch boy out to Philippus and the other Amazons to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is an unusual development,\u201d the blonde Amazon, Persephone said. \u201cAll children shouldn\u2019t be so small, they\u2019d have to fit inside an Amazon\u2019s shoe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he truly is the son of Man\u2019s World, then we must report him to the queen at once,\u201d Philippus reminded her troops about the mission. She then extended her palm to the red-haired Amazon. \u201cArtemis, please give him to me so we can ensure him safe escort. Being trapped under your foot seems to have scared him to death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis didn\u2019t hesitate to answer. \u201cAs you wish,\u201d she said, dumping the suddenly surprised boy into Philippus\u2019s awaiting hand, \u201cbut only because I don\u2019t want him biting any part of my body again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy tumbled around the darker giantess\u2019s palm, barely having any time to get up as she gently curled her fingers and trapped him in her fist. \u201cForgive me, child, but the queen has ordered us to take you to her personally,\u201d Philippus said, reaching for a small drawstring sack on her belt, \u201cand this is the only way for me to safely escort you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilippus moves the boy between her fingers, pinched his shirt between three of her fingers and her thumb, and dangled him over the opening of the sack. Timmy screamed and wriggled in the grip as the giant chocolate digits held him over the yawning abyss of the sack\u2019s opening; he was terrified of the dark. The screams got louder as Philippus powered him down into the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOOOO!!! Please don\u2019t put in there! I\u2019ll be good, I promise, just don\u2019t put me in there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Philippus didn\u2019t listen. She gently inserted the tiny screaming boy into the sack, and by loosening her fingers, she felt the boy fall to the bottom. She then drew the drawstring close and tight, leaving the opening slightly ajar to let in air for her bite-sized prisoner. With a simple command, Philippus and her troops marched for the queen\u2019s palace in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the sack on Philippus\u2019s thigh, Timmy was once again subjected to motions of a giantess\u2019s march. It wasn\u2019t as bad as getting trapped underneath Artemis\u2019s scented feet in her sandal, but he was still getting motion sickness from this experience. What\u2019s worse is that now that he was discovered, he\u2019d be taken to the queen. She would probably keep him for a slave or a toy for torment! She\u2019d lock him in a cage somewhere dark and damp with very little light to reach him. At the very least, she\u2019d send him back to Man\u2019s World with nothing and no one to look after him. Whatever the queen decided, it would change his very life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case was...</span></div></div>",

As best as he could, he curled up in the bottom of the savor and felt the motions of Philippus\u2019s thigh rock him gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen at last, after his giant captor finally stopped did Timmy feel a primal fear lodge in his throat.

Then he felt the hand lift him out of the confines of the sack, turn him over onto her palm, and felt the fingers loosen and spread out, revealing him to the outside world... to the regal, brunette giantess staring down at him from the throne with a bewildered look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is indeed unexpected,\u201d Hippolyta concurred. \u201cI would never expect a child from Man\u2019s World to be small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was like this when we found him, highness,\u201d Philippus reported. \u201cHe was like this battered and terrified after he endured much torment when he slipped inside of Artemis\u2019s shoe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilippus turned her gaze to Artemis, who stood at attention and bowed her head. \u201cI beg your forgiveness, your highness. I nearly mistook him for a bug under my foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no need to apologize for what you have done, Artemis. I, too, would not have known this child from a bug if it had slipped into my shoe,\u201d Hippolyta said as she descended from her throne, turning to the tiny eight year-old shuddering in the palm of her general. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now for the matter at hand, so to speak,\u201d Hippolyta addressed, approaching the fearful boy. You are a lost child, are you not? You are lost and terrified because the cruel hand of fate has shrunken you, hasn\u2019t it? There is no reason for you to fear because I promise no harm may come to youwhile  under my charge. Do you understand, child?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy nodded, whimpering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now then, can you please tell me your name?\u201d Hippolyta asked as though she was addressing her daughter when she was the boy\u2019s age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Timmy, your majesty. T-Timmy Walker,\u201d the bite-sized boy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Timmy Walker. I am Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons and ruler of Themyscira,\u201d the queen introduced herself.  Hippolyta held her hand out, and Philippus gently ramped her hand to nudge Timmy to walk onto the awaiting palm. \u201cCan you tell me where you are from and how you came to be this way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy sniffled and stifled the urge to cry. \u201cI-I\u2019m from Florida, your majesty. I-I was flying with my family over the ocean to Italy when... when... when a scary storm hit the plane! I don\u2019t know what happened, but I shrunk to this size and I was sucked out of the plane! I fell into the water and I tried to swim but I was so tired, I couldn\u2019t swim anymore! Then I woke up on the beach all alone and... and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy couldn\u2019t hold back the urge to cry as he buried his face in his hands. \u201cThey\u2019re gone! They\u2019re gone and I can never see them again! I\u2019ll never see my big brothers again! I\u2019ll never see my daddy again! I\u2019ll never see my mommy again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Timmy wept in the queen\u2019s hand, keeling over letting tears flow from his eyes, Hippolyta couldn\u2019t help but feel pity for the poor boy. With her other hand, she gently stroked Timmy\u2019s back like a lost bird trapped in the rain and in need of shelter. \u201cI am sorry, little one. This is a fate you did not deserve to suffer from. I can never imagine the pain of your loss and the terror of being so small compared to the rest of the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy sniffled and choked. \u201cI miss them so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour majesty,\u201d Philippus spoke up. \u201cI do not wish to sound insensitive, but what are we supposed to do with the boy? You know as well as anyone else that our sacred law dictates that no man may set foot onto the shores of Themyscira, and despite being a child, he is nonetheless the son of man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta had taken this to consideration when Menalippe, the oracle, foresaw Timmy\u2019s arrival. However, since she discovered that Timmy is shrunken and devastated in the palm of her hand, things have changed in the snap of the finger. After careful consideration, Hippolyta gave a deep sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have made my decision...\u201d she stated...</span></div></div>",

They, and the tiny boy in her palm turned to her with collected shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut your highness, you cannot possibly mean this!\u201d Philippus immediately protested. \u201cThis is a direct violation of Aphrodite\u2019s Law! If you allow the son of man to walk on the same ground as the Amazons, then you will bring the wrath of the gods down upon us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but any man who dares sets foot on this island is to be confined and imprisoned immediately under the watchful eye of the Amazons,\u201d Hippolyta explained, holding out Timmy sitting in her cupped palms. \u201cThis child may be a son of man, but he poses no threat for his age and size. Therefore, with no one else to watch over him, we Amazons must perform our duties to nurture and encourage the growth of our children, whether they grow up to be a man or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut your majesty...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is enough, Philippus,\u201d Hippolyta interjected, raising her hand. \u201cI have made my decision. I will be in my chambers to accommodate this child personally teach him the ways of our people. You have served me well in bringing the boy here to me, though under abnormal circumstances. You may return to your duties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, your majesty,\u201d Philippus said, bowing her head. She and her fellow Amazonian soldiers marched out of the throne room, Artemis being the last one to stay behind and give Timmy a sideways glare. Timmy sucked behind the queen\u2019s monolithic fingers, but he was immediately comforted by another set of giant fingers resting on top of his back. With it, Artemis turned and marched out of the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s scary,\u201d Timmy said meekly, making a Hippolyta chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is natural that she is intimidating. After all, she\u2019s the fiercest warrior among us now,\u201d she said, gently stroking her new charge\u2019s back as she walked back to her chambers. \u201cNow, Timmy, I want you to understand that as long as you are here, you are to become my personal servant and pet bound to me by law. I cannot guarantee that the tasks before you will be easy, but you must prove you are worthy of being under my charge to my sisters. Otherwise, by law, you will be forced off the island by way of the sea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very thought of drifting back in that dangerous, turbulent sea made Timmy\u2019s blood freeze. \u201cNo! I\u2019ll be good, your majesty! I\u2019ll do my best to do whatever you want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good,\u201d Hippolyta acknowledged as she entered her chambers, \u201cbecause your basic training is about to begin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta settled into her bed, a small table standing next to it with a bowl full of fruit, mostly grapes. \u201cNow then, Timmy, for your first task...\u201d she said, guiding the little boy in her hands...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNow then, Timmy, for your first task,\u201d she said, guiding the little boy in her hands to the floor, \u201cI want you to massage my feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta lowered the boy with cupped hands to the floor, tilting them to prompt Timmy to hop off and stand before the foot of the queen. To Timmy, the queen\u2019s imposing size made her look like a goddess, like the one he\u2019s seen statues of on the way. Like them, she stood tall like a monolith, dressed in a long, fuchsia-colored toga. Slipping from that elegant toga was a pair of giant, beautifully-maintained feet clad in leather sandals. She gently lowered them before her new young charge, but to Timmy, he could feel the tremor as she daintily slapped them on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy felt a certain overwhelming fear as he was presented his first task of massaging the queen\u2019s feet. The toes alone were just as big as him, almost a little bigger, but they were still threatening. He couldn\u2019t erase the traumatic moment when he was kicked around and crushed under Artemis\u2019s feet from his mind. Just being next to a giant foot gave him certain pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand your reluctance to carry out the task, little one,\u201d Hippolyta said, \u201cbut please know you will be seeing this a lot during your stay here at Themyscira. This is part of your training as my personal servant, so you must learn to face your fears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut... but I\u2019m scared of going inside your sandal,\u201d Timmy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere. Allow me to make it easier for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta lifted one leg up, unstrapped her sandal, and set it back down to the floor bare. She then proceeded to the same thing with the other foot. With both feet bare and touching the cool textile floor, Hippolyta lifted both feet up by the heel, scrunching her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere. This should make things easier to perform your tasks,\u201d the Queen of the Amazons said, setting her feet fully flat to the floor, \u201cbut remember this, little one: someday, you will have to unstrap my sandals yourself, but it will only happen if you are willing to continue your training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ll try my hardest, your majesty,\u201d Timmy answered nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I expect from you, my young charge,\u201d acknowledged Hippolyta, \u201cand speaking of expectations, I am still waiting for that massage I ordered a little while ago.\u201d Hippolyta slid her feet forwards towards Timmy, her toes slightly wriggling with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Timmy bent down and started to rub his hands on Hippolyta\u2019s giant toes, starting with the big toe. The giantess\u2019s digits wriggled at the ticklish sensation, making the tiny boy recoil a bit. Nevertheless, he had a moral obligation to fulfill his first duty and he had to do it. Bending gown into a squat, Timmy pressed his hands into the skin of the toe and gently squeezed into the soft, smooth flesh. He worked his squeezing grip around the smooth skin of the foot like he was kneading dough for bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, for this particular knead, Timmy wasn\u2019t making bread, though Hippolyta\u2019s feet smelled similar to bread. Gently, he maneuvered his massage around the perimeter of the big toe, not missing a single inch of skin to thoroughly massage it before he moved it lower to the underside of the giantess\u2019s digit. Sensing this, Hippolyta lifted up her toes, which allowed Timmy to easily reach the underside of her foot. The skin was softer and malleable than the rest of the foot. Timmy figured that this was where he was given a chance to show his skill as someone who watched his father give his mother a foot massage after a stressful day of work. He pressed his hands hard into the supple skin and squeezed hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Hippolyta three her head back and sighed in blissful content. She didn\u2019t want to admit it, but despite the boy\u2019s tiny size and young age, his massages felt like Elysium. While the sensations tickled a little, she could feel her muscles in her feet relax around the areas she didn\u2019t realize where slightly stiff until Timmy worked his way around them. In her mind, she made the right choice in taking in the tiny boy as her own personal servant, technically confined to her by law, and encouraging him to fulfill his duties to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hippolyta enjoyed the feeling of her tiny charge work his way in between her toes, then eventually moving on to rubbing slow circles on the ball of her foot...</span></div></div>",

She already loved this kid and his innocence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can only imagine! The feet of my best warrior is more frightening than the warrior herself!\u201d she chuckled, suddenly finding herself clearing her throat and regaining her composure. \u201cBut to all seriousness, child, I can\u2019t imagine how terrible it must have been when you were trapped in her shoe. Since you have faced your fear of giant feet, perhaps you can share what it was like under Artemis \u2018s feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny bite-sized boy swallowed a lump, nervous from even thinking about that traumatic experience. Eventually, he found his voice and the words that came out. \u201cIt was tight... and it was very ouchie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it was tight and painful. Please, do go on,\u201d Hippolyta insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe giant lady\u2019s foot squashed me against her sandal,\u201d Timmy continued. \u201cI couldn\u2019t move, I couldn\u2019t even breathe, and it felt like I was riding a really scary and really bumpy ride at the fair. I got dizzy and I felt like I was gonna throw up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, child, I\u2019m deeply sorry for your suffering,\u201d Hippolyta gave her sincerest condolence. \u201cNo child should have to suffer like this, especially on my own island. You are indeed brave if you went through such a horrible experience and live to tell the tale of your own plight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy looked away, downcast. \u201cI know...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no reason to fret over this now,\u201d the giant queen assured the tiny boy at her feet. \u201cYou are in safe, capable hands now. I won\u2019t let anyone willingly take advantage of your size so long as I watch over you the same way I watched over my daughter, Diana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-Thank you, your majesty,\u201d Timmy said, getting back to rubbing the ball of Hippolyta\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am curious, though, seeing as how you don\u2019t appear to be physically hurt,\u201d Hippolyta astutely observed from her throne, \u201cyou were suffering under the feet of Artemis, and I know for a fact that Artemis has the most powerful footsteps in Themyscira, yet when I look at you, I see no bruises nor bleeding. Tell me, what was Artemis\u2019s feet like to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy\u2019s face suddenly went beet red and turned his head away from embarrassment. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Timmy, you can tell me anything that\u2019s on your mind,\u201d his giantess guardian said. \u201cI won\u2019t be offended if you tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inch-high boy felt like he could sweat bullets from his forehead. As embarrassing as it was to think about it, his mom always told him to be honest with his feelings, no matter how much he didn\u2019t want to say it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... when I was stuck in the scary lady\u2019s shoe, her feet was... was... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">soft.\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was it that you said?\u201d Hippolyta asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said it was... soft...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoft? Ahhh, so Artemis keeps her feet soft, I see,\u201d the giantess said, sporting a playful grin as she bent forwards and supported her chin on her palms, listening intently. \u201cPlease, tell me more about her feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy\u2019s face went so red, he was practically steaming. \u201cThey were soft and... and they smelled like... fruit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta raised an eyebrow. \u201cFruit, you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes. Fruit and... and coconut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the giant queen turned her eyes to the side, noting the tiny boy\u2019s astute sense of smell and the type of lotion Artemis rubs on her feet, \u201cand what does my feet smell like to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy stopped for a moment, collecting the sweet scent emanating from the giant foot flesh smothered with a certain lotion that almost smelled like the flavor of yogurt his mom bought from the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt smells like... vanilla.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see...\u201d Hippolyta felt her tiny adopted son reach her heel, reaching every nook and cranny her foot had to offer. \u201cI believe you\u2019ve rubbed every spot on this foot, little one,\u201d she said, slapping her foot down and raising the other up by her heel. \u201cIt\u2019s time you started on this foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy immediately went to work with the other foot, starting with the toes, gently and thoroughly rubbing his tiny hands between the giant digits, during which time...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNow then, Timmy, for your first task,\u201d Hippolyta said, guiding the little boy in her hands onto the nightstand, \u201cI want you to feed me the fruit in that bowl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta lowered the boy with cupped hands to the nightstand, tilting them to prompt Timmy to hop off and land on the surface of the small stand level to Hippolyta\u2019s chest. The tiny boy watched as Hippolyta bent towards to be at eye level with her new charge, getting a better look at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Hippolyta, the tiny boy was so young, innocent, and adorable, but so helpless at his size. One more wrong step and he would become a stain on the bottom of an Amazon\u2019s shoe. To Timmy, Hippolyta was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, admittedly even more beautiful than his mom. She had the face of a caring mother about her and a lovely voice that could only be viewed as both motherly and commanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis task is quite simple,\u201d Hippolyta explained. \u201cYou will bring forward a grape for me to eat only one at a time, but be sure to not drop them anywhere except for my mouth. Given your size, I do not wish for you to strain yourself bringing two or more grapes for me. When you have finished feeding me the last grape and not drop one on the ground, you will have succeeded in your task, understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, your highness,\u201d Timmy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Hippolyta slumped down in her bed in her fullest graceful splendor, her head inclined on the bed\u2019s soft pillows. She placed her hands on her breasts, closed her eyes, and opened her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy took a quick moment to observe the titanic Amazonian queen lying down in her bed, the way she folded her hands over her breasts, the posture she chose... he couldn\u2019t exactly describe the beauty behind it all. She looked like a true goddess, standing as tall as the stairs of said goddesses that Timmy noticed the statues of in the palace on the way. A goddess in need of an insignificant bug to serve on hand and foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell? I am waiting, my young charge,\u201d Hippolyta said, snapping him out of his daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh..! S-Sorry!\u201d Timmy squeaked as he ran to the fruit bowl, picking out a grape, holding with both hands like a giant beach ball, and returning to the edge of the nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy grabbed the grape so he could toss it into Hippolyta\u2019s mouth. As he approached the edge, however, he found himself pausing before a curious, yet dangerous sight. He ended up staring directly into the open maw of Queen Hippolyta herself. The inside of her open mouth looked like a deep, fleshy pit, framed by her lips, her ivory teeth, and her wriggling tongue lined with moist, spongy texture. Timmy looked deeper inside the giantess\u2019s maw and saw the back of her throat, the gateway to her esophagus, a dark squelching tunnel that led to the inside of her stomach, marked overhead by her bobbing uvula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy felt a shiver run through his body; he was old enough to know what happened when food was eaten and ends up in his stomach. Remembering his task, Timmy tossed down the first grape onto Hippolyta\u2019s tongue. The instant the grape hit her taste buds, Hippolyta quickly sealed her lips shut, bringing the grape to her molars and compressing it with a crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy watched with fascination as the giantess\u2019s jaws made quick work of the grape. He could hear every juicy crunch with each motion of her jaws, and her deep, nasally breathing to accompany the music of her mastication. After a few seconds, the giantess swallowed, her neck bobbing inward to send the crushed remains of the grape down to her stomach while her mouth opened for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next several grapes, Timmy repeated this routine, sending the fruit into Hippolyta\u2019s mouth to be chewed, swallowed, and digested without ever dropping one by accident. With a few more grapes left in the bunch, Timmy plucked another one to feed the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens then?</span></div></div>",

He carried it over to the edge of the nightstand and looked over to aim the grape into the giantess\u2019s yawning maw. In that moment, Hippolyta breathed a deep sigh, sending hot breath in the boy\u2019s face that would eventually prove to be a major mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breath not only make Timmy grimace, but because the nightstand was made of smooth, polished marble, any hot breath would turn into moisture. The edge of the nightstand was moistened, making Timmy\u2019s footing unstable. He slipped on the edge, and he went screaming into the dark, fleshy pit, hurtling past the gaping lips, through two rows of white ivory teeth, and over the gargantuan tongue. His fall abruptly stopped when he was lodged into Queen Hippolyta\u2019s esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Hippolyta\u2019s windpipe was clogged up like a cork in a bottle. She threw herself into a sitting position as she choked and gagged on the wriggling tiny boy in the back of her throat. The gagging was so loud, it echoed out of the chambers and immediately drew attention from her guard. Philippus and her troop stormed into the chamber, watching with fright as their queen grasped her throat, turning blue in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour highness!\u201d Philippus exclaimed as she ran to the queen\u2019s side. \u201cQuick! Someone get her some water!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone instantly ran to fetch a jug of water and a glass for the choking queen. Philippus quickly went from behind and grabbed Hippolyta around the abdomen. She quickly constricted her arms in spurts to dislodge the obstruction suffocating her from the inside. Hippolyta\u2019s face was starting to turn purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, my queen! We\u2019ll get whatever\u2019s choking you out!\u201d Philippus tried to assure the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny boy stuck inside the back Hippolyta\u2019s throat wasn\u2019t faring much better. His legs were stuck inside the epiglottis where the flap separated the esophagus from the lungs. Hippolyta\u2019s vocal chords were so close in proximity, her constant coughing and gagging seemed like explosions in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jaws continuously jolted along with bright flickers of light pouring in from the opening of the mouth. The tongue was too moist and slippery for Timmy to grab ahold to pull himself up. His panicking overwhelmed him as he tried to claw out of the throat, but that only made it worse. The more he wriggled, the deeper he was pushed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, your majesty, don\u2019t eat me!\u201d Timmy begged for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt tiny bursts of air pushing him from deep inside the throat, pushing a little further up the tongue. Someone was giving her the Heimlich maneuver. They were trying to force him out of her windpipe. Timmy whimpered as he reached for the back of the tongue and tried to pull himself out of the epiglottis. Then after a few squeezes and a few pushes of the Heimlich...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The more times Hippolyta was given the Heimlich maneuver, the more times it took for Timmy to be dislodged from the giantess\u2019s windpipe. It was working because Hippolyta was beginning to breathe inward again, though less than outward. Her faithful general of her armies kept pushing on her lungs to rescue the boy from an unfortunate digestive fate. After this was over, Hippolyta knew that this was an unfortunate circumstance, but nonetheless, she had to administer her punishment to the boy because this counted as an automatic failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few pushes from Philippus, Timmy was pushed out of the epiglottis and launched onto the back of the tongue. Timmy laid flat on the rear bumps along the edge of Hippolyta\u2019s tongue, crying at the horrific trauma he endured. He got himself up to crawl over the tongue and out the mouth when his head his something moist from up above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the world inside of Hippolyta\u2019s mouth and throat as her gag reflex kicked in. Timmy\u2019s entire world jolted around him as the tongue suddenly bucked him to the back of the throat and a sudden booming gag blasted behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Hippolyta began to choke once more, frightening her guard. The tiny boy hit his head on his uvula, triggering her reflex which caused her tongue to buck the obstruction back into her throat. She held her hands to her throat to slow Timmy\u2019s accidental descent down her esophagus. No matter how much she tried, Hippolyta couldn\u2019t resist her reflex as they threatened to pull him down into her digestive tract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy queen!? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re choking again!?\u201d Philippus assumed, turning to Persephone. \u201cQuick, give her the water now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d the blonde Amazon acknowledged, quickly bringing a glass of water over to Hippolyta. \u201cQuickly, my queen, you must drink or you will choke to death!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone took Hippolyta\u2019s chin and quickly poured the water into her mouth. The water relaxed the constricting throat muscles, allowing it entry into her throat. With so much regret, Hippolyta could no longer resist the drink flowing down her throat, and so she swallowed. Hippolyta grimaced as her esophagus squeezed the water and the wriggling bulk inside, feeling him descend to plop into her stomach. Hippolyta quickly jumped on her feet and breathed normally, holding her belly with a shocked face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour highness, are you alright?\u201d Philippus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. No, I\u2019m not,\u201d Hippolyta answered, her shock never leaving her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis felt something was off. She looked around the room with her signature stern stare. \u201cWait. Something is not right. Where is the boy, your majesty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I swallowed him,\u201d Hippolyta answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the guards\u2019 faces dropped in the same state of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou what!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Timmy had lived one of the worst experiences of his newly tiny life. He was so close to being coughed out of Hippolyta\u2019s throat when he accidentally caused her to choke again. The tongue sent him over the edge of her throat and his entire body was stuck inside. He felt the gentle, protective hands of the giantess trying to hold him from being swallowed down until he was struck in the face by a torrent of water, enabling him to be sent deep inside her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a painful five seconds down the esophagus, Timmy was squeezed into the stomach, filled up with water, acid, and a single tiny boy. After splashing in that hot, shallow pool at the bottom of the fleshy cavern, the size of the inside of a minivan, Timmy began to panic. He quickly swam up to the stomach walls, screamed, and began to beat his fists against the malleable wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, your majesty, let me out!\u201d Timmy screamed. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be digested!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta felt the tiny beats in her stomach. She covered her belly with her hands while the other Amazon guards huddled around her to get a good listen. They could faintly hear the tiny screams of the boy coming from inside her belly. It sounded muffled, but it confirmed without a doubt that it was his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s true,\u201d Artemis said. \u201cYou swallowed the son of man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could this happen?\u201d Persephone asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe fell into my mouth while feeding me grapes as part of his own test,\u201d Hippolyta explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen he has failed the test,\u201d Artemis finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would seem so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo keep him there,\u201d the redhead suggested. \u201cHe should not have failed at such an easy task, and yet, there he resides in the belly of our queen. Surely this is a mercy for arriving at these shores as small as a bug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I would rather have the boy alive and unspoiled than to suffer a fate worse than death,\u201d Philippus argued with the fierce Amazon. \u201cThe boy may be the son of man, but he is still a child. You would personally forsake the life of a young one for nutrition in our queen\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he can endure torture at our feet, what\u2019s makes you think he can\u2019t endure torture in our own bellies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Hippolyta said, turning her attention to the crying minuscule boy in her stomach. \u201cTimmy, it is I, Hippolyta. Are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Timmy yelled from inside the Hippolyta\u2019s stomach. \u201cYou just swallowed me, and it was so tight, I couldn\u2019t breath. Now I\u2019m stuck in your tummy and I can\u2019t climb out. It\u2019s dark and it\u2019s gross and it\u2019s stinky and it\u2019s wet and... and... I want my mommy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTimmy? Timmy, listen to my voice. Focus on my voice,\u201d Hippolyta said calmly. \u201cI need you to calm down. Panicking will only lead to disaster. I want you speak to me as calmly as you can. Are you hurt? Do you feel at least the slightest burn anywhere in your body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy sniffled. \u201cN-No. I\u2019m... I\u2019m just scared! Please, your majesty, I\u2019m sorry for falling into your mouth! I\u2019m sorry I almost choked you to death! Please let me out! I don\u2019t wanna die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour majesty, please, you must allow the boy to take his punishment in your belly,\u201d Artemis insisted. \u201cHe has set foot on the shores of Themyscira, failed at a simple task of serving you, and nearly killed you by lodging himself in your throat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he is only a child,\u201d Philippus countered. \u201cChildren his age make mistakes, but we would never want a child to die. Though he has failed in a simple task, your highness, allow us to give him the appropriate punishment that does not involve digestion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta stopped and thought this dilemma through. The boy in her stomach had indeed breached Themyscira, but he was a lonely survivor of a fatal plane crash the size of a bug. Even if he did fail to carry out her test to the end, she would not want him to suffer a grim fate inside her body... but then again, he survived Artemis\u2019s toes and doesn\u2019t feel pain of digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have made my decision,\u201d Hippolyta said, turning to her stomach and rubbing it gently in circles. \u201cTimmy, I have made up my decision...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Nooooo!\u201d Timmy furiously pounded against the stomach walls, trying to get his giantess captor nauseatingly suck. Unfortunately, to Hippolyta, the tiny boy\u2019s punches were ticklish at best, and she placed her hand on her belly in response. \u201cPlease, your majesty, let me out of here! I don\u2019t wanna stay in your tummy! I don\u2019t wanna die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, child, but rest assured that you will not die by my own stomach,\u201d Hippolyta said, patting her belly gently. \u201cWhatever force has shrunken you has left you with high endurance, meaning if you survived under Artemis\u2019s foot, you will survive inside my belly. Trust me, child, you are safer with me in there than out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna stay in here! It\u2019s dark... and stinky... and wet... and-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will do well to take the queen\u2019s punishment, boy. This is what you deserve for nearly choking her to death,\u201d Artemis scolded the young tiny captive, making him jump from stern tone, which Hippolyta felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Artemis,\u201d she rebuked the red-haired warrior, feeling the tiny boy shiver inside her body. \u201cAlthough I cannot condone how she spoke to you, Timmy, there is some wisdom in her words. Even though it was an accident that you nearly choked me, you nevertheless failed your training and you are now facing the consequences for your actions. Think of your time in my stomach as a gentle reminder of those actions. With each failure in your training, your time inside my body will be extended, or I will administer a more appropriate punishment. As Philippus said, you are young, so use your time in my stomach wisely to reflect on your mistakes and how you can better avoid the consequences.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I... I...\u201d Timmy felt all Hope slip away as he slipped against Hippolyta\u2019s stomach wall into a slump, feeling a new wave of tears leak from his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t mean for you to choke because of me! I promise I\u2019ll do better! I promise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you will, Timmy. I believe you.\u201d Hippolyta rubbed her belly in circles, gently massaging the inch-high boy slumping against the inside walls of her stomach. \u201cIn the meantime, you\u2019ll have to remain inside my stomach until tomorrow morning. If you need anything, just tap on the walls or holler.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Will I have to stay in here during supper time?\u201d Timmy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d the giant queen of the Amazons ruefully answered. \u201cThis is part of the punishment. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be sure to take special care to provide you food so it does not appear physically repulsive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d Timmy shuffled in his slump so he was laying against the stomach walls like he would in a bathtub, filled with digestive acids that didn\u2019t sting or tingle his body, previously masticated food, and whatever else the giantess consumed. He felt the stomach jostle as Hippolyta rose up from her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will be taking my horse out for a stroll. I will be back soon,\u201d Hippolyta addressed her guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the entire stomach jiggled and swayed with the rhythm of her footsteps, with Timmy being swished from left to right and back. It was difficult for the tiny eight year-old boy to lie down in the same position when Hippolyta continued to walk outside. This was Timmy\u2019s new life now: servant or slave to the queen of the Amazons who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to step on him like a bug or swallow him whole as part of her punishment. The entire stomach he was caged in was so dirty, moist, and rancid, Timmy felt like he could throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how much he wanted it, Timmy couldn\u2019t get out of here until the next morning.</span></div></div>",

They, and the tiny boy in her palm turned to her with collected shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut your highness, you cannot possibly mean this!\u201d Philippus immediately protested. \u201cThis is a direct violation of Aphrodite\u2019s Law! If you allow the son of man to walk on the same ground as the Amazons, then you will bring the wrath of the gods down upon us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but any man who dares sets foot on this island is to be confined and imprisoned immediately under the watchful eye of the Amazons,\u201d Hippolyta explained, holding out Timmy sitting in her cupped palms. \u201cThis child may be a son of man, but he poses no threat for his age and size. Therefore, with no one else to watch over him, we Amazons must perform our duties to nurture and encourage the growth of our children, whether they grow up to be a man or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut your majesty...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is enough, Philippus,\u201d Hippolyta interjected, raising her hand. \u201cI have made my decision. One of us will have to watch over him, protect him, and raise him as if he was our own. To do that, he will require the same unconditional love and support we provided for my daughter in her youth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... excuse me,\u201d Timmy meeped out, \u201cbut you\u2019re a mommy, right? Can\u2019t you take care of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt the Queen while she\u2019s talking, boy,\u201d Artemis grumbled, making the boy retreat behind the giant queen\u2019s fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Artemis,\u201d Hippolyta said, raising her other hand up and turning to the boy in her hand. \u201cAs for your question, little one, I regret to inform you that my duties as Queen of the Amazons won\u2019t leave me time to accommodate you. Therefore, I am leaving you in the capable hands of someone on this island who I can trust with your proper upbringing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut... but I don\u2019t know anyone on this island,\u201d a reluctant and scared Timmy said, curling up against the curved and soft wall of Hippolyta\u2019s fingers. \u201cWho\u2019s going to take care of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta then went into deep contemplation about who was suitable for Timmy\u2019s guardianship. So far, Timmy had displayed courage and strength for surviving being crushed under Artemis\u2019s foot, so he\u2019d be looked after by her own guards. Then again, the boy was grieving for his mother, and Menalippe had displayed maternal affection for Diana when she was younger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe, because of his magically-enhanced durability, he would be better off with the chief healer Epione because she could study his physique and determine what exactly caused him to shrink and size and gain the stamina of Hercules. Then again, the blacksmith Io could teach him about physical labor because Hippolyta had heard of men being able to forge metals for construction and other useful features as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind finally made up, Hippolyta leaves Timmy with...</span></div></div>",
