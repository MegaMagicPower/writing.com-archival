She has a bunch of opened mail on the table in front of her. She looks at you with a frustrated look. Something's wrong. You begin to feel uncomfortable. She breaks the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did we decide about your progress at school?\" she interrogated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze there in dread. A while back your mother had threatened that if your grades didn't improve she would punish you over the summer. You tried hard but you're just not cut out for school work. You had been placed into a grade higher than you should have at the insistence of your mother despite not having the intelligence or aptitude to succeed. You'd always found it impossibly hard to get good grades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\", you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother carefully stood up. She was wearing a black tank top and white short-shorts. She had white mule slippers on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember what I said I would do if your grades didn't improve?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain silent. Hoping that she will just lightly scold you and then you can be on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DO YOU!?\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yes...\", you stammered, \"you said you'd punish me over the summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right dear\", she replied suddenly cheerful. \"I intend to keep that promise, so just stay right there as I shrink you okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, please don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush dear\", she cooed, \"it's for your own good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother began to rise into the air as you shrink. Your underwear becomes loose and falls to the ground. She slowly shuffles towards you as you get smaller and smaller. Chest high, then waist high, then knee high, finally stopping at about 6 inches tall and staring straight ahead at your mother's ankles as they flowed out of her slippers. You slowly crane your head up and she is smiling down at you as she brushes her hair behind her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to stumble backwards in horror as she slowly bends down to grab you. Tripping over your huge underwear and falling on your back in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please no!\", you plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop begging \", you mom scolds you as she wraps her fingers around your waist, \"it makes you sound pathetic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay limp in your mother's huge fist as it sways to and fro beside her hips while she walks. What's going to happen next you ponder fearfully?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You continue to lay limp in her fist as you dread to find out what will happened next. She continues through the doors and out onto the patio towards a lounge chair. The chair has a large towel draped over it and a big bag is positioned down beside it. Your mother dumps you onto the middle of the lounge chair and then proceeds to remove her tank top. You stare up at her as she places her top into the bag and then wiggles out of her shorts revealing a bright yellow bikini underneath. Somehow your mother as retained her youthful looks and body. She slips out of her slippers and picks up the shorts to deposit into the bag as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe adjusts her bikini and then looks down at you with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest you move that way\", she commands as she points to the end of the lounge chair, \"unless you want me to sit on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take off running as your mother's impressively huge form begins to lower onto the chair. You feel the ground beneath you shift and shake as it absorbs her weight. Suddenly a massive thud occurs behind you, as though a huge boulder smashed into the ground. You are fling a few feet into the air and land on your nose. You turn your head to look back to see your mother's left foot now come slamming down onto the chair behind you and next to her right foot which had cause the first earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dear\", she says with mock sympathy, \"almost crushed you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches into her bag to extract a pair of sunglasses and sunscreen lotion. She places the glasses on her face and begins shaking the bottle of sunscreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up!\", she commands. You do as you are told and are now facing directly at her feet. Her toes, painted with white nail polish wiggle slightly as she shuffles to get comfortable. You can see her face over her knees as she smirks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\", she commands as she opens the bottle of sunscreen, \"I want to take advantage of this beautiful day and you're going to make sure I'm comfortable. First thing you can do is rub sunscreen on my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp as she squirts a large drop of sunscreen on top of each foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can begin by rubbing sunscreen on my feet first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked about as your mother squirted some sunscreen on her arms and began rubbing it in. The lounge was quite low to the ground. You could easily jump off and make a run for it. Maybe run inside and hide somewhere, see if you can get help from your sisters. Or you could run and hid in the flowerbeds and try get some help from your neighbors. Your thoughts were interrupted by your mother snapping her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chop! Chop!\" she hisses, \"better start rubbing my feet or I'll make you do something worse.\"</span></div></div>",

Please don't eat me\", you beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pleas fall on deaf ears as your mother extends her arm out drifting you further from her face while she places her phone in front of it. She taps on the screen and then holds it up against her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" you scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" she snaps back as you can hear the ringing from the cellphone's speaker. Eventually someone answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Rachel\", your mom beams into the phone, \"will you do me a huge favour and bring me the bottle of syrup from the kitchen please...I'm outside...Please dear, I'm too comfortable to move...thanks doll, love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother hangs up the phone and leans over to deposit it back into her bag. She then brings her son closer to her and cradles him on her chest just above her bikini top as she lies back down and relaxes. You can hear her heart beating through her chest and you rise and fall with her breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...\", you whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dear\", she responds in kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't eat me. I promise I won't do that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't beg dear. It's very unattractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the sound of flip flops approach and you lift your head to see your sister approach carrying a bottle of syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go mom\", she says as she dangles it in front of Martha's face. \"OH MY GOD!\" she then shrieks as she spots her tiny brother cradled against Martha's chest. \"He's soo small. What did he do this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha grabbed the bottle of syrup. \"Thanks honey\", she sang. \"Oh you know\", she giggles, \"he didn't improve at school so now he gets to sunbathe with mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel burst out laughing. \"What a loser\", she chuckled. \"Can I play with him afterwards please! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course honey\", Martha promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Rachel exclaimed as she skipped back inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sense of relief that perhaps you weren't going to be eaten was short lived as Martha flicked the cap of the syrup bottle open and lifted her son off of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said I was going to sunbathe with you and play with Rachel afterwards\", you burst out, hoping that your Mother will realize the promises she just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to sunbathe with me dear\", she replied as she turned the syrup bottle upside down an started to shake the syrup downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only thing is\", she continued as the giant bottle moved over your head. \"You won't have to worry about being sunburnt cause you'll be inside my tummy\", she chuckled. A huge sticky drop of syrup landed on your head and quickly surrounded your whole head. You flung your hands about to keep your eyes and nose clear so you could see and breathe. Another huge drop landed on your head and ran down your body coating your chest and legs. Some dripped off your legs and fell onto your mother's chest below as you flailed your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha righted the bottle of syrup and flicked the cap closed. She dropped it into her bag and watched as her son continued to wipe syrup away from his eyes and nose. Four children was too much. It would be a relief to finally get rid of one. Without saying a word she opened her mouth and brought her son up to her extended tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look on in fear as you are lifted towards your mother's mouth. Her jaw opens to reveal her large white teeth. She extends her tongue and you are placed face down on top of it. The heavy weight of the syrup sticks you down onto the wet, spongy surface and you struggle to move. You feel your body rise with the tongue and light diminishes as you are brought inside your mother's maw. You lift your head and look back as you see a huge index finger covered with syrup follow you into the cave behind you. Lips close around the finger, blocking out the light. You are slammed into the roof of the mouth and pinned there as saliva rushes past you, extracting some of the syrup from your body. You very loudly hear your mother moan in pleasure. You are released from the roof and fall back down as light enters the mouth. You look back to see the index finger extract and disappear below the teeth only to be replaced by a thumb also covered with syrup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hovers past the teeth and once again the light is cut out as Martha closes her lips around her thumb and sucks on it and her delicious son inside her mouth. She moans as she tastes the sweetness of the syrup and swallows some of it. She extracts her thumb with an audible pop. She smiled wickedly as she then bounces her son inside her mouth briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose track of what's up and down as you are flung about your mother's wet mouth; You hit yourself against her teeth. You brush past her gums. You kick against the inside of her cheeks and then suddenly you are hammered up against the roof of he mouth and held there briefly before the sticky floor below you suddenly drops and you feel yourself enter into a smooth tube head first. Your arms are squeezed against your body and despite your kicking legs you begin to fall. A loud, sickening gulp confirms that you have left your mother's mouth and are sliding down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha sighs contently as she feels her son descend down her neck. She looks down at her flat tummy and notices small drops of syrup on her breasts and upper chest. She scoops them up with her finger and sucks the delicious fluid off of it. She moans again at the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob plummets into a pitch black chasm. It's incredibly hot and humid. It smells strongly like coffee and it's difficult to breathe. There is thick, sticky liquid all around him that irritates his skin. He can hear his mother's loud heartbeat coming from above him. He then hears her moan loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tasted delicious dear\" Martha says to her tummy and then pats it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear your mother speak. It sounds like it's coming from speakers all around. It's muffled but you can understand clearly. You hear some loud patting against the walls of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM! PLEASE!\" you shout, \"Please let me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" Martha exclaims, \"I can hear you dear.\" Her son's voice is faint but it's clearly coming from inside her. She softly rubs her tummy and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, you don't remember that you were once inside me before. Now you're back. Where you belong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to die in here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush now dear. This is happening, accept it. Now be quiet, mommy wants to relax and sunbathe. It's such a lovely day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to shout but your mother doesn't respond. The floor below you shuffles and twists. You lose your balance and fall flat on your face. Stomach acid covers your face and stings your eyes. You wince in pain. You continue to cry out for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha shakes her head in disgust as she continues to hear her son beg from inside her. She stops applying sunscreen to her arms and leans down to reach her phone and ear buds in her bag. She feels her son tumble in her stomach and smirks. Clutching the phone and buds in her hand she leans back, placed the buds in her ear and connects them to the phone. She opens the Spotify app and plays some Ed Sheeran. Finally, she can relax as her son's cries are drowned out by the music. She returns to applying sunscreen on her body as she hums along to the music. She then lies back down on the lounge chair enjoying the heat of the sun on her body and calmly drifts off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to scream inside your mother's stomach. Her only reply is melodic humming. Minutes later you are out of breath and breathing start to gets very difficult. You start to feel extremely tired and can't help but lie down on the hot, wet surface. Your eyelids become heavy and you drift off to sleep. The rhythmic beating of your mother's heart drifts you off to sleep reassuringly. You never wake up again.</span></div></div>",

No one seemed to be around, although you were sure they would show up soon enough.  Taking a seat on the far side of the couch, you stretched out and clicked the television on with the remote.  Flipping around yielded no immediate results, so you left on a nature documentary and zoned out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must have still been pretty tired, because before you knew it you'd dozed off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---sometime later---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to a sudden heavy pressure, and the dank, sweaty smell of sneakers.  That could only mean one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh $&amp;%*\" You thought. \"I left myself unguarded.  Stupid stupid stupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flailed for a second, but found that the normal resistance of the situation wasn't there.  You opened your eyes to daylight and your sister Rachel pressing her worn sneaker into your face.  She pulled it away and grinned a devilish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smell good, squirt?\"  She said, tossing her shoe by the door with her other one.  \"It's hot as hell out today, and I figured you'd like a sample.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez Rachel, don't scare me like that,\" You said, \"I'd thought someone had-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know exactly what you thought, little brother.  Just wanted to see how much you'd panic.\"  She snickered and pulled your legs off the couch, sitting on the opposite side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyed her suspiciously, but went back to watching TV.  After a while, she glanced over at you and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is pretty boring.\" She said, apparently disinterested in the flora and fauna of New Guinea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but nothing else is on.\"  You sighed lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" She started, getting up and kneeling by the TV, \"If you're bored too, let's make it exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over and saw that she was setting up the old N64.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's play Mario Kart.  Same rules as usual?\" She asked, giving you a competitive look that made you feel queasy.  The 'usual rules' were simple.  If you won, she would take care of your chores for a weekend.  If she won, she would get to shrink you and do whatever she wanted.  Whatever she wanted, of course, normally involved you, her shoe, and an endless mashing of sweaty toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand if you're too scared...\" She goaded, \"You already smelled my shoe.  It <i>is</i> pretty rank.\"  She laughed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig decision time.  If you accept, you'd have to be pretty lucky to win and escape another humiliating day.  If you don't, she'll probably find another way to bring 'excitement' to the day, and if you're unbelievably lucky it won't be way worse than just gracefully losing at Mario Kart.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Fine, let's do it.\" You sighed, figuring the past of least resistance was probably the best.  And who knows, maybe you'd get a free weekend out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit, little brother!  Now c'mon, sit down.\" Rachel grinned at you and patted the seat on the floor next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down and grabbed your favorite controller, while Rachel grabbed hers.  At the character select screen, your sister immediately navigated to Toad.  You weighed your options.  Normally you'd be Luigi, but maybe today you could outgrow your Player-2 status.  Maybe today you could, for once, outdo your sister.  Maybe today you could be your own hero.  Pumped with adrenaline, you chose Mario.  You sat waiting for your sister to choose a stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to get crushed?\" She teased, knowing the double entendre wouldn't be lost on you.  But you didn't even listen to her.  You were already hyper-focused on the screen.  You knew already you would win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were also dead wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe race was over faster than you could comprehend it.  Toad's shrill voice carried through the room: \"I'm the best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear that, loser?\" Rachel swung around to look you in the eyes.  She pointed her thumb at her chest.  \"<i>I'm</i> the best.  And what do you think you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, um, what?\" You instinctively began backing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You</i> are nothing but a bug.  Ready to pay up?\"  She stood up and towered over your seated form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, wait a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too baa~aad!\" She sang the words.  Your vision began to swim and stir as the unknown shrinking process began.  The room suddenly stretched up and around, like looking through a fish-eye lens.  Your sister, though psychologically a colossus before, was suddenly a real one.  You closed your eyes during the final moments, and when you opened them again it was complete.  You were barely an inch tall, lying on your back in the carpet fibers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sisters looming form took two steps forward, so that her feet partially surrounded you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my little bug brother.\" She cruelly smirked down at you.  \"Ready for the usual torture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter if you were ready or not.  She lifted her sweaty foot and slowly lowered it on you.  The smell immediately consumed you, even as much as you tried to breath through your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it smell?  Worse than my shoe?\"  She laughed and wiggled her toes over your tiny face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh, yes.\" You squeaked, but you knew she would never hear you at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly pressed down, and then lifted her foot so that you were stuck fast on her tacky soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeew, you're stuck to my gross feet.  I don't know if they've been sweaty enough to pick you up like this before.\"  She said, scrunching her foot, but was unable to quite unstick you.  They had been sweaty enough to pick you up before, you thought, but you supposed the memory was more emotionally charged for you than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, I guess if you like my feet enough to cling to them like this, you'll <i>love</i> my shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately began to struggle, managing to pry yourself free.  Your sister's raunchy feet were one thing, but those shoes were torture on the completely different scale.  You flopped to the ground weakly and looked up at your sister.  She rested her foot on the ground again, put her hands on her hips, and bent over slightly to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe you don't want to do that?  Hmm, what to do, what to do...maybe I'll just have you lick them clean instead...\"  She smirked.  She had you beaten no matter what she chose.  Rachel lifted her heel, ready to pin you again, but suddenly someone walked into the room.  You turned over to see the smaller feet of your younger sister pad into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'cha doin Rachel?\" Olivia asked, leaning on the doorway of the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Playing with our little brother.\" Rachel pointed you out on the floor.  \"I was thinking about sticking him in my shoes for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, your old sneakers?  That's gotta stink for him.\"  Olivia giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course.\" Rachel shrugged, as if the point was plainer than day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I know, why don't we go play some basketball?  Then it'll be real torture for the twerp.\"  Olivia said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReal torture?  You were incredulous at the thought.  Was the rest was just pretend torture?  You looked up at your twin sister, who was deep in thought.  She looked down at you and grinned.  </span></div></div>",

Sure!\" Olivia said looking down at you, \"I don't think stepping on him will be classified as cool tho.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll seeeee~\" Rachel sang the words and lowered her foot on you. The smell, no matter how many times you have smelled it, you can never get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Rachel stomped down, knocking all the wind out of you, forcing all of the fresh air out and the smell of your sister's feet in, Rachel twisted her foot a bit and applied more pressure and said. \"Wait I have to make sure of something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sat down and lifted her legs to let Olivia see it and just as you thought, you were stuck again at the ball of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omg, eewww.\" Olivia laughed and smiled. \"I never knew our little brother loves your feet, Rachel. I'm a bit jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, I do love him dearly, and he loves my feet back dearly.\" Rachel said smiling. \"Maybe if you use him 24/7, he'll start loving you too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way of escaping this, fate has probably written this on the internet, something that can never disappear. You thought to yourself as you try your best to free yourself and not to accidentally breath through you nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liv, can you get my shoes?\" Rachel said and placed her leg down, applying a bit more pressure so you can't escape this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia raised an eyebrow and smiled, \"no socks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No socks.\" Rachel smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia turns back and went to get her shoes from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo socks?! The combination of sweaty feet and old stinky shoes minus socks equals to living hell on Earth, this is the proof that hell exist, you sisters feet and shoes together with no soc- Your thoughts were interrupted with another hell coming, \"Can I use him as an insole in our second match?\" Olivia said as she came back with Rachel's shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel grinned. \"I don't see why not, hmmm....I wonder what our little brother smell like with both of our feet smell combined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell I suppose, you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia placed both of Rachel's shoes down. \"hmmm....probably like roses\" Olivia giggles. \"Let's try it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel giggles. \"After our foot massage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel lifter her feet into the air. \"Get all those fresh air, little brother, you'll need it\" Rachel laughs and wears both of her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was as you remembered, really bad, like some sort of sweaty cheese. These shoes were with her probably for years now, sometimes it amazes you how they're not yet broken or worn out, but if you look inside her shoes, you can very well see clear footprints in her insoles which is the proof of how old and how many times she has worn them. The air was knocked right out of you as the weight of your sister all goes to her feet as she stands up. Your clothes were all soaked up by Rachel's sweaty insoles and by her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh too bad, all that fresh air is out of your lungs now~\" Rachel teased as she wiggled her toes, \"Hmm...you feel nice, little brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia turns her back to the door and starts to walk outside. Rachel followed her, you feel everything heat up and the sweat on your twin's foot starts to get a bit sweaty already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna go for a jog, first?\" Rachel suggested. \"My \"new insole\" feels so nice, I just wanna keep mashing it with my foot while feeling its softness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlvia turned around and said.</span></div></div>",

Slowly you pulled a pillow to your chest, holding each side in palms which were quickly becoming sweaty.  You really had no choice, you'd have to throw it at Olivia.  She was too young and too unpredictable for your liking.  Not to mention, you did have a fondness for your twin sister, even if it was seeing her superior face from between her gross toes.  At the very least it was better than Olivia, and especially better than Chelsea or your Mother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you say Stockholm Syndrome?  Good, I knew you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia and Rachel were neck and neck, speeding through the poorly aging backgrounds.  You had one last moment of possible repentance, but it was too late for that.  The finish line was quickly approaching, and both of your sisters needed all sensory faculties to avoid the shells bouncing between the track walls.  You reeled back, pillow gripped by the corner, and swiftly spun it towards your younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOF!  Olivia reeled to the side for a moment, not expecting your soft assault.  In one moment, a turtle shell crippled her on screen chances and Rachel snaked past the finish line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\" Olivia snapped her head around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, jeez, sorry, -\" Your spine turned to jelly after seeing the rage in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Hell....\" She got up to her full height, which was ironically close to a head below yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, see-\" You slid off the couch and practically got on your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that?!  What is wrong with you?!  Do you really want to be tortured that badly?!\" Olivia's arms flailed wildly as she approached you.  You were actually shaking at the sight of your little sister angry.  If you weren't about to have a panic attack, you'd be really, really embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's hand reached out and grabbed Olivia's shoulder.  \"Hey now, you can't torture him.  I won, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not fair!  He threw a freakin pillow at my head!  Rematch!\" Olivia was now turning that anger on your twin, who was admittedly not the most gracious winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All's fair in love and kart, kiddo.  He's mine for the day.  If you want to make something of it, we'll just have to get mom involved.\"  Rachel smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh, fine, whatever, take him.  I can't stand to look at him anyway.\" Olivia parked herself on the couch and craned her neck away from you.  Seems like she'd still stick around to watch you get shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, wait, Rachel, please, can't I do something else for you?  Shine your shoes?  Clean your room?  Any chores?  All the chores?\"  You knew this was going nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Fraid not squirt, there's only one thing I want from you...\" She slinked towards you like a cat, her feet grazing the carpet you were about to be lost in, \"Is for you to shrink down and sniff my sweaty feet.  Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad.  See ya!\" She sang, flicking you on the nose, and setting off the cascade of processes which caused your vision to swim, your bones to scream, and your entire brain to light aflame in anxiety anew.  As your body got smaller you crouched onto your knees and put your hands on the carpet, which was now rapidly rising up to meet you... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNauseous from the transformation you shook your head and blinked the tears out of your eyes.  As your vision cleared you saw Rachel's toes excitedly wiggling in front of you, ready to reach out and smother you underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy oh boy, I love seeing you like that.  Nothing like a fresh bug-brother to torture.\"  Rachel said, as you stretched your neck, trying to see her distant face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could do anything though, Olivia suddenly sprang from the couch, slipping around Rachel, lifting up her dirty sock and smashing it heavily down onto your body before you could move or even before she could savor the moment.  Your entire body sang in pain, limbs displaced far from where they would normally be.  Her foot, however, lifted quickly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you get you jerk!  You had better hope I don't get a hold of you!\"  Olivia yelled before storming off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was as flabbergasted as you, swiveling her head back and forth from your exiting little sister and your crushed body.  She quickly gained her bearings and knelt down to get a better look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, she really didn't hold back.\"  Rachel ran her soft index finger over your body, which was in an absurd amount of pain.  \"Why did you do that anyway?  Did you really want to be under my feet so badly?\"  She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid there and asked yourself the very same question.  Did you really prefer being underneath Rachel?  Or did you just need to exert any amount of control over the situation?  Maybe if you didn't eke out that tiny bit of power, you'd really go insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever, you're not too beat up anyway.\"  Rachel said standing, apparently not noticing, or not caring about, how severe that stomp was.  \"At least, not too beat up to breath out of your nose, right?  I told you, I want you sniffing.  Now.\"  With that she sat on the couch and placed her sweaty toes directly over your body.  You breathed the sweet stink of her feet and wondered if you'd made anything resembling the right choice.</span></div></div>",

I can't believe you <i>wanted</i> me to do this.\"  Rachel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want you to!\" You gasped, knowing she couldn't hear you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you had to do was ask, little bro.  You know I'd happily squish you any day.\"  She said, lifting her foot off of you and leaning forward to look at your bruised body.  \"You don't seem like you're really trying though.  What's the matter, your ribs busted from your <i>little</i> sisters attack?  You poor, poor thing.  Here, let me help you get a nice, big whiff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face retreated as she shifted her weight and placed her the ball of her foot directly on your body and slowly added pressure, burying you under a literal ton of slick, stinky flesh.  You breathed in belabored, halting breaths until her soft sole's skin took up literally all of the space in the air around you.  Your lungs screamed for what felt like an hour before she lifted her foot and pulled it back, forcing your head directly beneath her toes just as you instinctively filled your lungs with air, causing you to take a full chest's breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha, yeah, that's more like it!\"  Your sister laughed, replacing the ball of her foot on your body to start the process over again.  \"I love a footstool that provides entertainment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe repeated the process several times, each one adding second after painful second in the aromatic vacuum beneath your sadistic sister.  Every time she shoved her toes in your oxygen deprived face, her taunts seemed to get further and further away.  For every time you could make out Rachel say something like \"How's it feel to be toejam?\"  and \"Smell good down there, little guy?\" the rest sounded like you were underwater.  And in a way, you actually were drowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she had become bored of her game of suffocation sickness, you were on the verge of blacking out.  Her monstrous feet lifted onto their heels and slowly rubbed back and forth against each other metronomically, like twin monoliths, hypnotizing and terrifying, as your cruel sister above decided on her next move.</span></div></div>",

After all, you can't expect me to walk around in this heat with sweaty toes, can you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked that unending smirk, the same one she would when she had you in a bind.  She <i>always</i> made it difficult like this.  She gave you the facade of a choice just to drill in how absolutely powerless you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled and grasped and pushed your muscles to their breaking point, crawling millimeter by desperate millimeter, but it was no use.  Between Olivia's brutal stomp and Rachel's cruel games, you were absolutely devoid of the strength to even get out of your sisters shadow.  And you didn't even need that to be a metaphor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone is a very helpful volunteer~\" Your sister sang, knowing full well she had gotten you again.  She snagged your body from the floor and walked to her sneakers, dropping you into the well worn monsters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the sole like dead weight, rolling over to see your gigantic sister towering over you.  Her bare toes gripped at the back of the shoe, and she looked you directly in the eyes as her expression moved to something between pity and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, you are so the worthless runt in this family.  Almost makes me feel bad.\"  She said, quickly adding as her face returned to normal: \"Pfft, almost.  You know you deserve it for being such a little bitch.  Everyone knows it, or, well, at least they should.  In fact...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her foot away from the shoe, she reached into her pocket and pulled out her phone.  She knelt down and held the phone's camera lens up to the mouth of her sneaker, taking a quick picture and blinding you with the flash temporarily.  As your vision cleared, you could see she was typing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now your 'little' predicament is on twitter, see?\"  She turned the phone towards you, and you could see that she had tweeted the picture of your broken body in her shoe with the caption: \"My little bro, right where he deserves to be.\"  Worst of all, it was gathering favorites and retweets at what seemed like an alarming rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at the phone before putting back into her pocket and rising to her full, titanic height, laughing the whole time. \"I'm so glad to get the word out on how absolutely pathetic you are.  It'll save me time later.\"  You couldn't believe she had actually just done that.  Before you could fully process the embarrassment or any real implications, her toes began to grip again at the back of her shoe again.  \"Now, ready to lick these stanky toes?  Because it's time to go...\"</span></div></div>",

Her toes hit the dirty sole curled, and pushed forward, flicking open once they touched your prone body, shooting you to the toe of the shoe with a painful strike.  You watched helplessly as the remaining light disappeared in the wake of her advancing foot, which overtook you and immediately began mashing you between it's sweaty digits.  You could hear the laces of the shoe being tied, and then double knotted, as Rachel happily hummed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So here's the deal, bug.  You're going to lick all the sweat from my toes while I walk.  And if you don't do a good job, I'm going to get <i>seriously</i> mean.\" She said, as the internal temperature of the shoe began to increase rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously mean?  Was crushing the life out of you and publicly embarrassing you just lightheartedly mean?  How could it get worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't test me either, squirt.  I'm already pretty bored.  If you don't do well by me, well, let's just say I'll have to make things a<i> lot</i> more exciting.\"  Rachel's threatening voice got a little deeper, before popping back up to its normal timbre. \"There, all laced up and ready to go.  Start licking, kiddo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel stood up, her weight shifting to her toes as she balanced, crushing the breath out of your lungs.  After inhaling deeply to steel yourself (although the ratio of oxygen to her musky smell was slowly shifting away from anything breathable), you stuck out your tongue and pressed it to the grimy flesh around you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, is that the best you can do?  I'm not psychic, but your future isn't looking great.\"  Her big toe moved to rest on the next, before painfully flicking down to hit you in the face.  You stopped licking for a moment, dazed, just as Rachel began walking.  You tried redoubling your efforts, but after getting hit right in the head, followed by the waxing and waning of Rachel's weight on your body, it was getting very difficult.  You licked as hard as you could, hoping to god that this wouldn't end as poorly as you imagined it.  You heard the front door opening as Rachel stepped out into a hot, summer day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour must has passed before Rachel returned home.  The temperature in the shoe was now like an oven.  You were completely coated in a mixture of her sweat and whatever dirt had been pulled up from the sole of her shoe from her heavy footfalls.  Your body was wedged somewhere between her toes, although you were unsure of where you had been moved in the dark.  Worst of all, your jaw and tongue had gone numb from your 'responsibility.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's see...\" Rachel said, prying off her sneakers, flipping yours over and depositing you on the rug.  The foot with which you were less acquainted with came to rest on your body quickly, but you still took greedy lungfuls of air, glad to be out of the hot, airless prison you had just inhabited.  Her other foot rose to rest on her knee and she flipped it toward her to inspect your work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, you really worked hard didn't you?\"  She said, peering at you from between her toes, giving you a brief glimmer of hope.  \"It's such a shame you didn't even make a dent.  God, how much you do have to suck to try so hard at something so simple, and do this poorly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're just totally hopeless, you little dork.  And now...\"  Her big toe once again rose to rest on its neighbor before, THWACK, flicking you directly on the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let me just warn you...\"  Her toe flicked you again.  THWACK. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're definitely not going to like it....\"  And again.  THWACK.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I certainly will.\"  And again... THWACK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lost consciousness after the fourth strike, although lord only knows how much damage your cruel sister had done before she realized.  You came to much later, not immediately recognizing your surroundings.  You were in...</span></div></div>",

You could hear your sister humming happily but couldn't see her yet.  You were laying on a surface with some small amount of give, like a soft mattress or a hammock.  What the hell was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your vision cleared you were able to recognize the bathroom sink looming next to you.  You snapped your head left and right, to find that you were surrounded by the large rim of the toilet seat, seemingly suspended in air.  You flipped over, almost terrified you would go full looney tunes and fall once you looked, but you were floating above the water on a thin film of cellophane gently trapped between the plastic seat and the porcelain bowl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're awake, perfect!\" the chipper Rachel said, peeking over the edge of the sink, brush in hand.  She had apparently been washing up and fixing her hair waiting for you.  \"Good timing too, I was afraid someone else would have to use the bathroom before we got to play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sidled to the toilet and leaned over you, \"Like my handiwork, squirt?  It was a light bulb moment, inspired by you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what...\" You had a feeling about where this was going, but it was more than you could articulate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be that dense, right?  I'm going to use you as my toilet.  Duh.\"  Something about how casual she was about this struck you as terrifying.  \"But now it's even better, because you'll get the full brunt of it, aaaaand I can give you a little challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ch-ch-chalenge?\" You stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a ch-ch-challenge.\" She mocked.  \"See, this is how it's going to work.  I'm going to go to the bathroom, and if you can dig your way out afterwards, you get to survive.  Buuut!  If you don't, all I have to do is lift up the seat and you and my business fall in and get flushed.  Get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.  Dig?  No.  No, she couldn't mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's mouth pulled into a raptorial grin.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"That's right bro.  I've got to take a nuclear shit right now, and you're sitting in the middle of Hiroshima.\"  Rachel's hands were already working to unbutton her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Rachel...\" You started to beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even try the puppy dog routine, bug.  You've been nothing but boring today, but now I get to have a bit of excitement.\" She laughed as both of her butt cheeks popped free of the waistband of her shorts.  They dropped to the floor and Rachel turned around, pulling down her panties as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to be buried alive?\" She asked, her panties falling to her ankles and her butt spreading over the bowl like bad weather.  Her anus hovered almost directly above you and began to contract, forcing the first bit of feces to come to the surface, \"Cause here it coooomes~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOW<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened so fast that it took you by surprise.  Rachel pushed out enough shit, in one second, to bury your tiny self completely.  Your lungs instinctively stopped breathing as your arms and legs thrashed through the soft pile, all the while Rachel continued to add to it.  Although panic electrified your movements, you felt you were making little progress towards the top of what very well may become your burial mound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt no more weight added and could hear Rachel's muffled laughing far away.  She had apparently finished, but you didn't have much time before you'd have to breath again, otherwise you'd <i>really</i> be finished.</span></div></div>",

Your face lands directly in front of the sock, and your nose pokes a single strand from it.<br>\r\nGetting up out of fear again, the toes above you scrunch and flex, waiting.<br>\r\nAll you can really do is let yourself fall against the foot- but what a horrible experience that is!<br>\r\nIt feels like you are leaning on quicksand- the folds of the sock hugging you, as they are malleable from the sweat. The foot itself is the stinkiest thing you've ever dared smelt- even worse than Olivia's after HER endless runs. You can't even push yourself from the meaty sole- you just lie against it.<br>\r\nJeff is amused, \"does he just lean on it?\"<br>\r\nRachel is kind of embarrassed, \"tiny bro!

Or else I'll throw you into the sock itself!\"<br>\r\nYou start to think- very much frightened .<br>\r\nYou do notice, under the heel, a hole, maybe big enough to fit through in the sock.

Want to take a turn making his life hell?\"  Rachel said, prying her other sneaker off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, absolutely.  Bring him to the couch, I'll grab drinks.\" You heard Kelly walk off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly light invaded your senses as Rachel's other foot broke free.  Gravity suddenly inverted and you were thrown over the spongy sole and directly into your sister's waiting hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear that, twerp?  Your reputation precedes you.\" Rachel gave your body a painful squeeze as she walked over to the couch and dumped you on the floor.  You looked at the ceiling, dazed, before Rachel's foot swung into view and her toe gave you a painful bop on the head, \"And best behavior now, do whatever Kelly says.  Otherwise I'll tape you to the bottom of my sneaker for the walk back, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly bounced back into the room, handed Rachel a glass of something you couldn't identify, and sat down on the couch, immediately turning her attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, look how small he is!  He's like a little bug-person!\" Kelly chirped.  She was a truly beautiful girl, with a short, black geometric cut, pale skin, and big green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, just a bug.  He totally doesn't count as a person anymore.  Maybe a bug-slave, if you really insist.\"  Rachel laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the sound of that.\"  Kelly purred.  She slipped off her black loafers and peeled away her thin, fashionable socks.  \"These shoes make my feet sweat like hell, but they're too cute to pass up.  Here bug-slave, lick in between these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's foot lowered just in front of you, toes spread wide.  You rallied your strength and pulled yourself over to her toes, sticking out your tongue and began to lick a complete stranger's sweat away.  What the hell was happening in your life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, that's the stuff.\"  Kelly wiggled her toes, causing a small piece of dark lint from her sock to come free and fall just in front of you.  You moved to kick it out of your way, but suddenly Kelly spoke, \"Eat that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at her, barely able to see her mischevious eyes over her knees, and then over to Rachel, whose face you had a better angle at.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me, do what the lady says.\"  Rachel rolled her eyes, as if it was that easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah bitch, eat my toe lint.\" Kelly spat, at which you immediately began choking down the sweaty fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Kelly, you're a natural at this.\" Rachel said, crossing her leg and sipping on her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my last girlfriend, you remember Enid right?  She was really into being controlled in bed, so she got me into BDSM, and I got a serious thrill from being a domme.\"  Kelly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's awesome.  What about your current girlfriend?  Shannon?  She into being on the bottom?\" Rachel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, she's more of a dominant girl too.  We're not totally sure how to handle it.\" Kelly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while the girls were chatting, you had finished eating Kelly's gross lint and continued to lick the sweat from her toes.  At the last statement though, you saw Rachel's eyes snap over to you.  Oh god Rachel please, not with strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you could always borrow my brother.  Not only could he be a little bitch for both of you, you wouldn't even have to be careful about how you treated him.  After all, he's just a bug-slave, not a real person.\"  Rachel smirked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Rachel?  You'd let me?\" Kelly's toes unconsciously curled over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!  What are friends for?  Speaking of which, sharing is caring, pass the runt over.\" Rachel snickered, as Kelly kicked you over to Rachel's feet, one of which immediately pinned you underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick my heels, bug.  No breaks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls made you serve their feet for a while as they chatted about boys and girls they found attractive and about interesting things to try in the bedroom.<br>\r\nAfterwards...</span></div></div>",

Her sole smelled like rubber and soil and it was already pressing your face hard enough to bruise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, you're going to walk all the way home like that?

Go on runt, apologize to Kelly for your behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel extended her sneaker towards Kelly, who quirked her head to catch your face pressed hard against the rubber sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, Kelly.\" You sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for what, buggy?\"  Kelly's tongue flashed over her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry f-f-for not eating your lint.\"  You couldn't believe you were actually demeaning yourself like this, \"It was v-very mean of m-m-me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was mean of you.

I promise I'll be <i>suuuuper</i> careful.  Or, well, as careful as I can be...\" Rachel smirked as her hands worked the sneaker around her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make sure he makes it to dinner.\"  Kelly said, giving Rachel a knowing prod to the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiiine.\"  Rachel theatrically sighed.  She placed her heel on the ground, not yet allowing the toe of her shoe, and therefore you, to touch it yet.  \"Every journey begins with one step, huh bug?\"  Rachel paused for a moment.  \"Ew, that made me sound too much like Chelsea.  I've gotta stop hanging out with her so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rachel rose to her full height.  The carpet rose up to meet you quickly, but you weren't buried completely.  It seemed Rachel was putting more weight to the outer side of her foot, giving you some reprieve, although still piling on pressure that you wouldn't normally experience trapped under her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">That hurt, buggy?  If you think that's bad, wait until we get to the sidewalk.</font>\"  Rachel laughed, the sound muffled by your position.  She gave Kelly a hug, said her quick goodbyes, and walked to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each drop, shift, and lift of her leg, despite Rachel's attempts at taking ginger steps, you were nearly completely flattened on the concrete walkway, the sharkskin texture of cheaply paved quick-dry digging into your skin, adding scrapes and cuts to your already bruised and broken body.  High above, practically in another world, Rachel hummed happily to herself, poking away on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you wouldn't believe how many people are asking to borrow you.\"  She said, never quite breaking her stride.  \"Had I known there would have been this much demand, I'd have outed you sooner.  I can charge a rental fee and not even have to take a part-time job!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed with each step, now partially with embarrassment and the knowledge that Rachel probably wasn't kidding.  In all likelihood, you were going to end up under every foot at school.  Unless your mom stepped in, hopefully not literally, it seemed like this summer (and hopefully only this summer) was going to be a long, painful ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm going to treat you like such a workhorse though, I should at least make sure you don't...hm...get put out to pasture early.  Wait, do horses go out to pasture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No.'  You thought to yourself, 'They get made into paste.'  Which was what you were going to be if Rachel put more weight on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since I'm so good, <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">(at protecting my investment)</font> how about a niiiice drink of water.\" You could hear the sadistic joy dripping from those words and immediately pulled your head as far as you could from Rachel's sole and twisted your neck to see your sister's hanging foot slowly lowering towards a puddle at the edge of an intersection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, drink up, buggy.  You have until the light changes.\"  Rachel laughed, and dipped her shoe into the shallow water just as you took a deep, sudden breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe murky, disgusting city water swirled around you as it settled from the sudden introduction of a sneaker.  The whoosh of the water completely dominated your senses at first, but it suddenly became very, very quiet.  You counted in your head slowly.  '1...2....3............45....46....'  Your lungs were already screaming.  How long did walk signs usually last?  Oh god, what if you really drowned.  Taped to your smug sister's sneaker, taken out by muddy water.  '55....56...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a breaching whale, Rachel's sneaker pulled from the water in a misty spray.  Your greedy lungs pulled in as much air as they could, over and over, before Rachel began walking again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?  I'm not totally without sympathy.\"  Rachel said, although your heavy breathing made it difficult to hear.  \"Stick with me and you can have all the water you want, hahahaha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hooome!\"  Rachel called as she stepped into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's just about ready!

Besides, here he is, he must be really starving now! We did a great workout, didn't we my lovely little brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can reply with a witty comment, your mother looks at you with an evil grin, she then shouts, \"Girls! Dinner Time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother looks at Rachel, \"put your brother on the table and restrain him. We have to make sure he only eats healthy food!\" Before you can protest Rachel puts you on the table and she grabs some fiber out of a drawer and very accurately ties it around your body, completely restraining your arms and legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou  look around the table and you see your other sisters taking their seats, meanwhile, your mother grabs another plate and places it on the table. Then she places you on the plate. Meanwhile, she puts food on your sisters' plates but leaves yours empty. \"Girls, enjoy your meal! Make sure to feed your brother a little bit.\" While you lie on the plate you see your mother take a bite, she smashes and smushes it around in her mouth and keeps her eyes locked with yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half a minute of chewing all your sisters are looking at your mother in awe. She then bends closer to you and spits her food out right next to you. You see the food is entirely drenched in spit and drool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat boy.\" Before you can even consider eating it, Rachel gently pushes your head into the pile of food. Then your mother slowly drops another big blob of spit on it. \"Savor it boy. Oh, girls, be sure to share some of your food with your lovely brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're eating the food mixed with your mother's spit you see Chelsea's face closing in and she just drools above your food and leaves several blobs of spit on it, \"enjoy my holy saliva, brother. Maybe it will purify you, who knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while you have finished the bite of food that your mother dropped onto the plate (which is actually similar to the size of a full meal when taking your size into account).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see Liv's shadow above you and a lot of spit coming down on the plate. From a small distance you see Rachel and Chelsea adding to the pile. Make a small puddle of spit, mixed of all your sister's salive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on bro, we know you'll looooove it!\" Says Rachel with a teasing voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No please! Please, the food mother gave me was enou-...\" Before you can finish your pledge for mercy, rachel mercilessly pushes you into the pale, and holds a finger on the back of your head while your face descends into the pile of spit. You start gobbling it down as fast as you can, no matter how thick it might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear your sister's laughing behind you but you do your best to just swallow it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiv then takes a bit more fiber and ties you to the plate, facing down into the plate's surface. She then places the plate in front of her. \"I'll have to do some chores soon, so it's okay if I feed him for a bit okay?\" Liv says with an oddly innocent voice. \"Fine...\" you hear Rachel and Chelsea say grumpily in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it starts, spit after spit flows onto the plate and seeps right in front of your face forcing you to swallow it as fast as you can. Liz keeps the barrage of spit going and there is almost a constant flow of her saliva slowly gathering in front of your face. You hastily lick it up every single time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 20 minutes of being tortures by Liz she got bored and turned you around in your restraints, now your the back of your head is resting on the pillow. Your mother then shoves the plate towards herself. \"My turn Liv.\" Olivia doesn't seem to protest, \"Oh, I was a little bored anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother then spits directly onto your face and with her long index finger she keeps rubbing it across your small face. \"Lick boy, until I say you're done.\" You obediently lick your mother's finger and all of her spit that might reach your mouth. Now and then Chelsea comes in to drool on your face as well and your mother keeps rubbing it into your face and making you lick her finger clean. While this torture is going on for about 30 minutes, the girls chat about their day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your mother pulls her finger back. \"Brother has had plenty of food now, girls. Maybe one of you wants to take him with you for some practice so he can get rid of the added weight from this meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll your sisters look at you with cruel smiles. Your Mother then says, \"It's Liv's turn to help me with the dishes. So, who do you wanna go with, Chelsea or Rachel?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your older sister Chelsea walked in, tossing a thick book on the couch and plopping down directly next to Rachel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a long, exasperated sigh, stretched her legs out and crossed her feet at the ankles, which were clad in patterned stockings and casual, black ballet flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey, what's up Chel'?\" Rachel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing for me, Rachel.  The world is boring.  This house is boring.  Even my work has started to bore me.  It's like it's all conspiring against me.\"  Chelsea leaned her head back to stare at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel rolled her eyes, all too used to Chelsea's theatrics.  Even you would have put your hand on your head in annoyance if your sister's dank sole wasn't trapping it underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a drama queen.\"  Rachel quipped,  \"Maybe if you're bored it just means you're boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.  Perhaps it was too much to assume you'd understand the deeper issues of the mind confronting time.  Such a shame though, you have so much intellectual potential.\"  Chelsea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?  I'm just going to take that as a compliment and move on.\"  Rachel's toes squeezed around you as she became more and more uncomfortable with this bizarre conversation, causing your body to become somewhat attached to the tacky digits.  She lifted her foot on her heel and played with you by softly mashing your already hurt body rhythmically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike some members of our family, you really do have a mind to be admired.\" Chelsea kept on, as if she didn't even hear Rachel's attempt to change the topic, \"<i>Some</i> people in this household wouldn't hold a candle to our, how you might say, <i>malin comme un singe</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus, she was talking in French now.  Chelsea was in full pompous self-importance mode, although Rachel seemed like she was starting to enjoy the compliments.  Unless she was thinking something else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, some people, huh?  How 'bout this people?\" She snickered, pulling her foot onto her knee and pointing at you, giving Chelsea a good look at your battered form stuck fast between her sweaty toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so that's why I haven't seen our little misfit brother yet today.  He's being given his proper treatment by his big sister.\"  Chelsea knew full well you were older than Rachel, if only by a minute, but would never actually say you were bigger than anyone.  Not that she was technically wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hate...you...\"  You mouthed, exhausted from what had become a tortuous summer morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, you can come up with something more cutting than that, can't you?\" She patronized, \"A moment of  <i>l'esprit d'escalier</i> for our little insect?

Your body was seriously starting to take damage now.  Even if your family stopped torturing you at that moment and allowed you to return to normal size, you'd probably have to rest for a week before getting your full mobility back.  But you knew how this worked all too well.  If you couldn't somehow escape, they'd continue pounding you into the ground until you had no choice but to be their toy for weeks, or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  He's mine to screw with today, Chelsea!  You can't just come in here and take him.\" Rachel protested, something for which you weren't sure to be grateful about or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, don't be upset.  He insulted me, and I deserve some recompense.  I would appreciate your help in punishing him, though.\" Chelsea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiiiiine.\" Your sister half whined, although she honestly didn't seem too upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the thumping pounds of your sisters' footfalls as they approached you.  You opened your weary eyes to see Chelsea standing directly over you, your sister behind your head, sweaty toes wiggling in anticipation and again filling your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, Rachel, do you know what the word contrition means?\" Chelsea asked, never taking her eyes off of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, to be guilty, right?\" Rachel didn't seem to know where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a...simple way of putting it.  But the deeper meaning is to be <i>crushed</i> by guilt.\" Chelsea lifted and dropped her foot directly next to your body on the word 'crushed.'  You couldn't help but look over and see your own injured body in the reflection of her shiny ballet flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, the literal translation from the latin means to be <i>ground to pieces</i>.\"  Chelsea lifted her heel and twisted her foot back and forth, as if she were putting out a cigarette.  \"Seems like your big sister has already hurt you plenty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia too.\"  Rachel quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So <i>both</i> of your <i>big</i> sisters have weakened your body.  And now it's my turn.  What do you think, you inconsequential little shit, do you think I can make you so contrite you really do come apart into pieces?\"  Chelsea's face had become much darker since this entire thing had started, and it was honestly scaring you.  You flipped your eyes over to Rachel, but for once she seemed entertained by Chelsea's histrionics.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see if we can make that happen.\" With no other warning, Chelsea lifted her shoe and pushed the hard leather sole directly onto your body.  The pressure was light at first, but slowly became heavier and heavier until you could feel your body flattening.  She then twisted her sole to the side, causing your body, particularly your limbs, to pull in that direction, before returning to position and twisting in the other way.  She continued this, only now more smoothly and without pausing, until it really did feel like your body was about to come apart.  Your hips ached and your shoulders screamed.  You were about to be quartered under your sisters unforgiving shoe unless something changed...</span></div></div>",

After all, it is in the purview of the spirit to express its will on matter.  Killing is simply transforming a stubborn piece of matter because it has...\" She paused, choosing her words carefully, \"...failed to amuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh great, you were about to be torn to bits because you hadn't been entertaining enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's great and all, but it's my turn with the runt.  I think you've had your spirit-matter-revenge or whatever you're talking about.\"  Rachel spoke as Chelsea's foot suddenly receded.  You could see that Rachel was gently pushing Chelsea away.  \"Why don't you go write up that thought though?  It'll probably go well in your dissertation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're coming between a snake and her meal, Rachel.  That's not very smart.\"  Chelsea said, glancing at you before returning her gaze to your sister, \"But fine.  Have your fun, I can wait.\"  With that she grabbed her book from the couch and huffed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHallelujah, Rachel was the goddamn messiah.  You would have fist-pumped, but it probably would have broken your arm.  Rachel rolled her eyes at Chelsea's exit and knelt down to inspect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you look like shit.\" She said, gingerly pinching your body and placing it into her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th..thank you...\" You sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever, if you weren't around, who would I torture?\" She sat down on the couch and placed you on the end table beside her.  \"Seriously though, you're pretty beat up.  If I'm going to play with you again, you're gonna have to heal up a bit.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, really?  Was this happening?  Was Rachel, Rachel the Ruler, your ultimate oppressor, actually giving you a break?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact...\" She smirked her trademark smirk \"...I think you might need some bandages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there went that moment of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel opened the drawer to the end table and pulled out a roll of masking tape.  She carefully pulled a piece free, and tore it into thin strips.  Gently holding your body and straightening your limbs (an act which was almost unbearable thanks to your heavy bruising) she wrapped the strips around your body, starting at your feet and spiraling up to meet your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zhere, zhe procedure is fineeshed.  Zhe patient shood have a vull day of bed-rest.\" Rachel was channeling her inner mad doctor, as she tore one last small strip from the roll of tape.  \"And he zhould not speak eyether!\" She unceremoniously pressed the tape over your lips and chin.  The transformation was now complete, you were a speechless mummy, somehow even more helpless then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright squirt, let's just relax for a bit.\"  Rachel returned to her normal voice.  She picked up your immobile body and placed it on the end of the couch.  \"I hope you don't mind keeping my feet company though, you really never finished sniffing them before.  Not that you have much of a choice.\"  She moved to the opposite side of the couch and stretched her legs out, giggling as her gigantic feet came to rest directly next to you.  Of course.  What was her obsession with you and her feet, anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the TV click on and took deep breaths of your sister's sweaty feet, unable to do anything else but that.  You stared at Rachel's colossal soles looming above you, questioning how it was possible that this moment, mute, bound, and humiliated at the dirty feet of your twin sister, was actually the most relaxing part of the day so far.  You closed your eyes and cursed internally at whatever you had done in a past life to lead you to this one.</span></div></div>",

Each press is unbearable and feels like an eternity. Your body is becoming seriously weak and soon you can hear your body creak.<br>\r\nYour sister's jolt just slightly after the first bone pops. A dark and devious grin creeps across Chelsea's face \"Not much longer little brother.

If it makes you feel any better, you can squish what's left of him, though there really isn't much of that.\" She lifted her foot to reveal you bloody remains on the sole. They were barely recognizable, a stronger resemblance to paste than brother.<br>\r\nRachel's face grew pouty as her chance to squish her brother was lost. \"Mom's gonna be pissed you know.\" She shot back.<br>\r\n\"At what,\" Chelsea questioned. \"All I did was get rid of our bug problem. She's was probably gonna do it soon herself anyways.\"<br>\r\n\"True,\" Rachel smirked. \"But she probably wouldn't have done it on the living room carpet.\" She pointed to the bloody remains staining into the carpet.<br>\r\nChelsea hadn't thought of that, finally being outwitted by her younger sibling. \"Oooooh shit...\" </span></div></div>",

Despite all the bad treatment they give to you, there is a thing that you admitted inside of yourself: it was an admiring view. Somehow, their titanic body moving makes you feel almost mesmerized. When their booming steps became distant, you begin to force yourself to stand up. Some limbs are aching due the torture of stomping and footstool treatment. Your skin are impregnated by Chelsea and Rachel`s feet smell, which made you cringe your nose for a few seconds. \u201cEw... So stinky!\u201d You mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you checked yourself to keep on moving, you hear your mom`s voice again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiv! where are you? Dinner is served.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooming steps were growing again, and you realized that it was your young sister Liv on the way. No soon you realized that, and her colossal body came into your view, in a quick pace, almost running. Your eyes grew wide and you dropped your mouth with the sight if our 13 years old giant sister coming right over you! Her booming steps were almost deafening, and soon you realize that her grey socked feet were coming right at the top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiv\u2026\u201d But it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cotton fibers were dirt, with some old sweat from the past days. Specs of dirt were clearly visible at your sight as it landed over you with no time to escape. A squishy, but muffled sound could be heard if another tiny person was close enough to not be stomped too. You were caught right at the bottom of her pad section, as it squished your body with mega tons. Your body sank softly in the sock surface. The pressure made your mind go nuts as your body felt an incredible jolt of pain. Your face was buried in a moist and stinky surface, wet by the foot sweat of Liv for all the morning. Quickly stuck to her giant sole, your only thought become just an instinct: survive. The smothering and the brutal stomping didn`t give you time for think. The time between one step and other was too short to try something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiv arrived at the dinner room, taking a seat and starting her meal. Her feet were landed on the wooden floor, not squishing you anymore, but firmly enough to not give you any chance to escape. Trying to ignore the pain, you squirm a lot to get yourself free, but with no result: you are completely buried on her socky stinky sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This isn't good at all.\"  She had barely looked at the paper, but you supposed your guilty face told her more than she needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down next to you on the couch, turning slightly towards you.  \"You know this sort of performance isn't acceptable.\"  Her almost comforting tone bled an aura of false sincerity.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..I know mom...\" You turned your head, already anxious about the way she was looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you suppose we should do about it?\"  She edged closer, ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..I don't know...\" You knew what was coming.

In one smooth motion, you mother shoved you off the couch, and by the time you hit the floor, you were already bug sized.

And where's the squirt?\" Rachel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your brother is at your feet.\" Your mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh perfect!\" Rachel said, spotting you easily, \"I was looking for a footstool\"  She lifted her foot, ready to bury you under her nasty foot flesh, but your mother interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, dear.  This is what we need to talk about.\"  Your mom said, and Rachel's foot pulled away. \"You see, your brother has brought home poor grades.  Again.  But since he doesn't seem to learn from his mistakes, even with our continuous punishments, I'm beginning to think he never will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well duuuh,\" Olivia sneered, \"He's as dumb as a bug.  How could he possibly learn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point, dear.\"  Your mother smiled at your younger sister, who turned her head to stick her tongue out at you.  You sighed heavily.  Where was your mother going with this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's exactly what I was thinking.\" Your mother continued,  \"If your brother can't figure out how to act like an adult, even with our help, maybe it's time to stop treating him like an adult, like a member of this family, or even like a person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, what are you getting at?  Are we throwing him out?  Because I can think of a better use for him than that.\"  Chelsea said, eyeing your form and quirking her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite, Chelsea.  This is your brothers final punishment.  After this family meeting, we will no longer treat him as anything more than an insect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" You called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This means we will not talk to him, or interact with him in anyway other than how we would deal with any other bug.\"  She knelt down and picked up your body.  Your sisters rose from their seats and looked down at you in your mom's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?  You mean I won't have to hold back stomping on him?\" Rachel asked, to which your mother nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is fantastic.\" Chelsea said, flashing her tongue across her teeth, \"He'd better hope I don't come across him with the vacuum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly the kind of response I was hoping for.\" Your mother laughed deeply, looking down at you again.  \"After we finish this conversation, consider your humanity revoked.  You're no longer my son.\"  She paused for a moment, \"How long do you think you'll last, hm?  Will you end up squished under our shoes?  Or maybe we'll find you crawling on the table and mash you into a napkin before throwing you out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or flushing him, if he's in the bathroom, right?\" Olivia said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, 'Liv.\" Your mother patted Olivia's head with her free hand, \"Or maybe you'll get smashed into our toes, and end up washed down the drain when we shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or he'll fall off of our toes in our shoes, and be stuck under our feet until he's dead.\" Rachel snickered.  \"Face it, bug.  You're not going to survive long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would bet on that.  But that's it for now.  No more talking, no more family, no more being human.  I hope for your sake you don't run into us again.\" Your mother said, giving you one last kiss.  She then dropped you unceremoniously on to the floor.  \"Let's give him at least an hour to get used to his new status, hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid on the floor dazed, watching your family file out of the room into different parts of the house.  What the hell had just happened?  How had you gone from human to insect, permanently, in less than half a day?  They were absolutely serious about it too.

All the windows had a screen that was shut, so getting out of them was not an option either. That leaves the question of where to hide. With less than an hour to hide, you would have to move fast to make it to a safe hiding spot. Your bedroom was upstairs, which would take more than an hour to reach at this size. In fact, the only possible rooms were the living room where you are now, the kitchen, the dining room, one of the bathrooms, or your mother's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You can hear some laughter from your soon-to-be hunters coming from what you believe to be the kitchen. Perhaps they are too caught up in the conversation to see you enter, if you go there. That is the best location for food and water after all. The dining room may have some small crumbs to eat. while the bathroom may have some water on the ground. However, both rooms lack the other vital good, so that would mean having to move around more at night in order to survive... survive, how crazy this all became because of a lousy stinking report card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Fifty minutes left before all buggies get what's coming to them!\" Liv was more than happen to yell that as loud as she could, but it just made you realize just how little time you have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Fifty minutes and still in the same spot where your mother dropped you, and still without an idea of where you will go and try to hide. You think about your mother's room and how big it was, plenty of nice spaces to hide. Sure it means traveling at night, but at least being spotted would be hard. The final option is this living room, where you already can see some crumbs left from past movies. Surely on the table there will be some condensation from cups that you could get when others were asleep, and at the very least, there were plenty of hiding spots that were off the floor, just in case Chelsea goes through with her threat of vacuuming...<br>\r\n     Working out all the possibilities, you came to the conclusion that....</span></div></div>",

Under there is too small for for the vacuum to reach, which has lead to a great amount of dust bunnies. Insects in the past had the same idea though, you have seen a few crawl out of or into that space, and some may still be there, waiting for their next meal. The thought turns you pale, a cold sweat starting to build as the desperation peaks. Before you knew the torture would end without any major problems, but this was now life and death.

In the mean time though, those happy thoughts would have to wait. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n     Looking around, you find one more potential spot to hide... the couch.  How many coins have gone missing inside that couch, surely hiding at the seems will allow for some comfort at least. If you dig down deep enough, then no one would be able to see you. You worried about being crushed into the cushion but remembered when an ant found its way onto the cushions a couple years ago. It survived just fine... until your sister, Rachel got a hold of it and crushed it under her foot playfully while having you watch in your shrunken demeanor besides it. As long as you don't try to come out for any reason though, you should be safe from the same fate. These seem like the best option for you.

Out of the two options you see as the best possibility to survive, one was more to your liking. </span></div></div>",

As you approach the towering piece of furniture, you can clearly see under it. At full size, it would appear to be a little dusty, with some dust bunnies, but at an inch, the perspective is filled with jagged terrain. The dust in the low sections seems up to your ankles, while the dust bunnies create bumps that are twice your size tall while appearing to be ten feet long. You figure that is not all bad, as they would give you something to hide under or behind to not be spotted.  You cannot see any movement, and can only assume that if there was anything, you would be able to see a piece of it, or a web to a spider, if there was one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As  you venture into the dimly-lit area, your senses explode. The stagnant, dank air of an area untouched besides for the occasional breeze lingers. The smell of decay from old skin particles and hair only exasperating the unruly stench. The air is heavy, causing you to have to breath harder and faster than outside. Sounds of the now moving dust particles lingers around you, as do the once hard-to-hear settling of the wood and electronics above you. Your body soon tenses up, you can feel very tiny mites crawling on you momentarily before finding already dead skin to fester on. You know it will take time to get used to that sensation, but it is still better than being crushed onto a foot or flushed down the toilet between the sheets of crumpled toilet paper. It also makes you realize that at this size, even a simple dust mite may become your own pray to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As you make your way to the far end of the cabinet, you can see one spider web to a small orb weaver that was currently in the middle of it. The corner it was in was clearly his, and not one you would venture into any time soon. The other corner seemed vacant, but you figured staying near the center of the underside of this cabinet would be best. Shifting dust away at first, you realize that this dust would make for a much more comfortable, albeit creepy at first, place to rest. Taking the rest of the time your former family gave you to get adjusted, you slowly but meticulously craft a bed out of hair and lint, then build a small but inconspicuous mound of dust ahead of you, in order to block out the wavering eyes of individuals looking to end your pathetic existence. You felt it a little redundant considering the other dust bunnies ahead of you, but you take no chances. Before you have a chance to realize how tired you were from all the stress, you pass out on your newly made bed, with nothing but dread still on your mind.    </span></div></div>",

You had no idea what time it was, or even what day it was, but you did know you had found a way to survive enough to rest.  You pulled yourself up from your dust bed and looked down at it, reminiscing fondly over the memory of waking up in your own bed, your person bed.  That was probably never going to happen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey brotheeeeeer~\" You heard Rachel sing.  Your heart nearly burst out of your chest as you snapped your attention to the dim light fading from the far end of the cabinet, but there was no one there.  You strained your eyes, and saw Rachel's bare feet in the middle of the living room, one foot on tip-toe, her heel bouncing expectantly.  \"Where aaaaare yoooou~\" She continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed out heavily, relieved you'd remained unspotted for the time being.  Tentatively you moved closer to your new home's entrance, trying to keep an eye on your murderous sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I wonder if you're even in here.  I mean, you couldn't have gotten much further than here without being noticed.\" She said, pacing the floor, probably looking for you in the spaces between furniture.  \"But if you are, you really should just come out and submit to being squished under my feet.  After all, what are you going to do, live like a bug for the rest of your life?  Live in fear waiting for the day you'll be discovered?  Eating the crumbs of your former family to live?  What kind of life is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't really thought too much into your own future, at this point.  If your mother was serious about this, and it certainly seemed like she was, what were the rest of your days going to be like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems kind of silly to me.  So I'll tell you what, come out right now and lay down at my feet, and you won't have to worry about anything anymore.  Just let your big sister deal with everything.\"  Rachel's voice was somewhere between predatory and protective, but the weirdest part was, she was starting to make sense.  Maybe life at this size wasn't worth living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll only take a second.  Just one step, really, and then it'll all be over...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words echoed in your head.  'All over.'  You were tired, beaten, and honestly ready to give up.  Do you give in and let your sister end it underneath her feet?</span></div></div>",

There was no point in living this sort of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're here, little brother, or should I say little ex-brother,\" Rachel giggled, \"the offer stands for the next minute.  After that, well, who knows what'll happen to you?  I bet it won't be pretty though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs pushed you towards the light, which blinded you as you stepped past the threshold of your safe haven.  You felt like a wind-up toy soldier, being pushed by forces beyond you, marching forward to certain death.  Your eyes developed a cast of early tears as you wondered if that's all you ever really were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there you are!\" Rachel grinned her awful, predatory grin, \"I see you've come around to my way of thinking.\"  She didn't take a single step towards you to narrow the gap.  She wanted you to make the full journey.  \"Can't say I blame you.  After all, now you get to die with at least a little dignity beneath your beautiful sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther and further your clockwork legs carried you, until you were standing right at the base of your tower of a sister.  You looked up at her, barely able to make out her face from the blue haze that always interrupts viewing at a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" She questioned, eagerly wiggling her toes, \"Go ahead.  Lay down at my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really wanted the full thing, didn't she?  She really wanted to obliterate any self-worth you had left before she obliterated you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands gripped tightly, as if every vestige of self-preservation you had left were rallying all at once.  But it was too little too late.  You hands relaxed, and as they did, so did your entire body.  The overwhelming force of gravity pulled your figure into a tiny heap on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go.\" She cooed, bending down and using her index finger to straighten out your askew limbs, \"Any last requests?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked her directly in her huge, terrifying eyes.  \"To live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sister laughed.  You almost wanted to laugh too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid not, little brother.  You've already decided to die.  Can't take that back now, right?\" Your sister raised herself up to her full, monstrous height, \"And besides, this is something I really want.  You wouldn't want to take that away from me, would you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, are you ready to get flattened under these pretty feet?\"  She lifted her bare sole and wiggled her toes over you.  The sweaty, stuffy scent that had tortured your entire life invaded your nostrils yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even move, didn't twitch, as her titanic foot gingerly lowered on to you.  Her mass came on as slowly as she could hold it back, but it was still like a freight train at your size.  You could hear your sister, your awful, tyrannical, somehow perfect sister moan as she felt your body begin to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right where you belong, as always...completely powerless...about to collapse...\" Her voice came out as a throaty sigh, \"And I haven't really used any of my weight...but for the first time I can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye buggy...\" The words basically dripped from her mouth as she shifted her weight again.  And suddenly it was over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world went black as your body gave way under the incomprehensible panorama of Rachel.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     You are quickly awoken from your slumber by the booming steps of some of your former-family coming through the hallway into the living room you are currently hiding in. You hear one bunch of steps head towards the couch, another towards a wall for some reason, and a final set heading to the opposite side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"The finder of a bug gets to determine what happens to it, right?\" Rachel was very eager to find you, the sibling rivalry always being highest between you two, not that you ever stood a chance of being favored more than her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That is correct,\" Chelsea says in a matter-of-fact tone. \"You just need to call out when you find one so the others can at least see what you choose to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Listening intently and trying to peak out the small crack for at least some hint at the individuals precise locations, all you could see what small, dainty feet belonging to your little sister, Liv make go onto the couch. A click is heard from the far wall, followed by a booming roar that no doubt belonged to the vacuum. For a quick second, you wonder how she will be able to tell if she caught you or not besides for looking into the clear case afterward, after it was too late. You shudder at the thought and try to focus on where the other individual has gone. Judging by wear the voices were, you could make out the vacuum wielding giantess was Chelsea, why Rachel was at the opposite wall, maybe looking at the windows or the cracks. You could not tell what she was up to, nor did you want to peak your head out to find out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You two have fun looking hard, I will wait for him to come out to me. hahaha <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/music1.png\" alt=\"*Music1*\" title=\"Music1\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> \" Olivia being the cruel tactician that she was already probably enjoying this more than anyone else, thinking this nothing more than a harmless game that she will win the lazy way instead of the hard way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Above you, the TV got louder as Olivia set it on her favorite channel and turned up the sound to make up for the loud vacuum. The sound echoes loudly throughout the wooden structure high above you, echoing as it bounces around the hollow space you rest until the sounds of the TV, echoes and rumbles, and vacuum marry together to form a cacophony of chaos and udder despair for you. The vacuum has slowly been finding its way closer to the stand, as Rachel has been moving about. Her feet appear in your view as she bends down to check under the couch. Her toned legs and strong arms come into view, followed by part of her head. \"Liv, get your feet off me, I am not your foot stool!\" As if it was another day, Liv has started her antics again, this time at Rachel's expense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Rachel shifts and starts to crawl on her feet towards your location! You can barely see above the lint, and know you will not be easily spotted, and have no sense to try to hide, your sister's amazing cleavage is dangling in your limited view. While athletic, Rachel still supported beautiful C cups that she was not afraid to shove in your tiny form before, often times coming close to crushing you between then. Soon though, the beautiful bosom disappears, replaced by Rachel's menacing face as she peers your way. You gulp lightly as she looks in, studying the area intently. \"Eww, this needs to be cleaned, like now! I call dibs if the vacuum can't reach. Be riiight back hehe,\" Rachel gets up quickly, kicking dust towards your home and letting her semi-salty feet smell reach your nose, already polluted by the stench around you. As much as you hate to admit it, even know you can feel your member stiff from all of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Your concentration is quickly shifted as you hear the vacuum come closer before stopping. Chelsea's finely-manicured toes come into play, with a small scent of lavender wafting by. You feel a rumble above as a large roar or the shifting cabinet. It only moves a couple feet in your perspective, which is more like a third of an inch tops before your sister quits trying. \"Chels, get your flat ass out of the way, I can't see the TV!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You can feel the stare your former bigger sister must be giving your younger, but now gigantic sister. Soon the vacuum comes back on and tries to get through the entrance. The dirt close to the entrance flies forward into the gaping maw of the machine. A few of the hairs on your structure move forward as well, as do many of the tiny mites that were around. After a long minute, the vacuum stops and a different rumble is heard. You recognize the callused toes of Rachel, which soon go out of range as the rest of her large body appears. In her hand is a long duster, which fits like a pipe cleaner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The puffy, course material starts off in the back corner, where the spider currently resides. Within a moment, it was brought down on the tiny insect, which is quickly obliterated as the sweeper moves on the ground, grinding the spider below it. There is a terrible sound of scraping and grinding as a hidden coin and dust get scrapped forward. You pale as the menacing wall sullied-white approaches fast. Within seconds, you are knocked into it, and are pulled along with the rest of the dust bunnies. Light fills your eyes more as you are welcomed to the sight of your two biggest sisters looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Rachel sits on her legs looking down as Chelsea just puts her hands on her knees, her large breasts hanging down loosely in her baggy shirt. You can see Rachel's underwear clearly, her large cheeks pressed against her toned legs with already a tiny spots of wetness appearing from her crotch-covering panties. \"OMG, is that it,\" Rachel says excitedly as her right pointer finger pokes into you, uncovering you from the rest of the dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"It is! I found the bug!\" Rachel jumps up quickly celebrating by dancing crazily as your little sister now approaches fast. \"I get to choose what happens to him, and seeing as he is loves this gross dust so much, I would hate to separate him from the rest of the pile. Gimme the vacuum Chels.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n     Chelsea, looking a little disappointed, hands over the vacuum before starting to walk away. As she leaves the room you can hear her call out to your mother. \"The pathetic bug was found, it is being taken care of already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Your twin-sister's panties are now extremely moist, and slightly behind Rachel, you can see Olivia starting to reach into her own panties, getting off equally as much from your terrified look. Rachel makes haste in removing the base attachment and points the large hose at all the dust, including you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Bye bye bug, have fun in your new home.\"  The vacuum is turned on quickly, without mercy. The dust behind you is the first to go up the long tube into the bag-less chamber of the vacuum. The past dust twirling around with speeds that would make an F5 jealous. You did not stand a chance as your former-sister deliberately points it to you as she waves bye from above, her moist panties sticking to her opening, causing a large camel toe. It is one of the final sights you see before being ripped off the ground into the waiting vacuum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Your life ended within moments, the g-force knocking you unconscious and then killing you quickly. You are left to fester there for a week before the vacuum is needed again. Your skeletal remains were never discovered by the police before you were dumped with the dust into the trash and collected by the trash-men that Thursday.</i> </span></div></div>",

The material was aged slightly, so many micro folds emerged that would allow you to climb them. Thinking back to gym classes you remember the technique of hold with hands, but climb with your legs. While the advice helps, climbing something that is this large still will be a large task. As sweat starts to build, your hands become wet and slippery, your body heavier, and every muscle screaming, begging for a break they will not get until you are finished climbing. See a small fold that leads from the side of the couch to the front, you carefully slide your way to the front side of the couch, where the cushions will be easier to get to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, after about five more minutes of climbing, you reach the first wedge between the couch side and the cushion. Hoisting yourself up you want to celebrate the success, but with time expiring fast, know you need to get into position more first. Stumbling in the tight crevice, you find the corner of the couch then move on towards the back of the middle of the middle cushion. Hands and toes have gone into the middle of the sides before, and you just have a gut feeling that being in the middle cushion should have the least likely outcome of being found. The TV was centered on the middle, so those who were sitting while watching would not have their hands there, and while laying down, they would either be facing frontwards or not forcing their hands in the sides to much, at least, not that you ever saw.  You started to hear rumbling from outside as you finally approach your destination. The crevice was large enough to rest comfortably, with space to dig in, if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucky for you, your face and hair blended in to the large structure pretty well, so you did not fret to have your head peak out for now. It allowed you two see three of the blood-thirsty queens of the house storm in. Chelsea came in  first with the vacuum in hand. She was focused on the wall facing your right, getting ready to plug in the vacuum. You feel relieved that you did not hide low, otherwise you were certain you would end up in that killer machine. Behind her, Rachel came in and started approaching the opposite wall, looking around on top of structures quickly before making her way to the left wall to check the perimeter. \"The finder of a bug gets to determine what happens to it, right?\" Rachel was very eager to find you, the sibling rivalry always being highest between you two, not that you ever stood a chance of being favored more than her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That is correct,\" Chelsea says in a matter-of-fact tone. \"You just need to call out when you find one so the others can at least see what you choose to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Coming behind Rachel was Olivia, who walked nonchalantly towards the couch. As she turned around, you had about five seconds to see the new scenery. Rachel's defined but slightly dainty butt was highlighted in her tight, black yoga pants. Above, a trace of her lower back was visible as her tank top did not fully cover her back, exposing about an inch at normal height. Her long hair was fastened in the typical braid that she kept it in. With seconds her colossal form impacted the same cushion you were hiding behind, causing an increase in pressure from the displaced surface. The pressure was not to great to prevent you from moving, it felt as if someone was lying on top of you, which was not too far from the truth you think to yourself. Her left cheek comes closer to you as the pressure increases slightly, the pressure now similar to a strong bear hug. A slight foul smell that reminded you what you were near was whiffed away by her the scintillating aroma of her herbal body wash as it danced into your nostrils. As quickly as this jerky movement happened, her body was straightened and the pressure was decreased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The TV got louder as Olivia set it on her favorite channel and turned up the sound to make up for the loud vacuum. The sound echoing loudly throughout the room, battling the television for control of the auditory sense. The vacuum seemingly careening around the floor scooping up all debris in its wake. You can just make out the light foot-falls of Rachel's steps, coming close to the couch. Once again the pressure changes, this time lessening as Liv's back falls closer to you and her posterior makes its way towards the front of the couch. \"Liv, get your feet off me, I am not your foot stool!\" As if it was another day, Liv has started her antics again, this time at Rachel's expense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Olivia, complying to the command, scoots further back into the couch than previous. To your dismay, her rear end was now as far back on the couch as it could go, her left cheek practically sealing the way out from your specific location inside the crevice. You know that if you wanted to, you could scoot out just a few feet at your perspective and glance at the young fiend's butt easily. Her body heat emanated off her, the strong familiar smell of herbal soap now actively being mixed with a touch of foul smelling air coming from her as well. Occasionally she shifted for whatever reason, but for the most part she stayed in that location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eww, this needs to be cleaned, like now! I call dibs if the vacuum can't reach. Be riiight back hehe,\" Rachel's joy in the hunt makes you cringe as you start to slowly lower yourself, the sight ahead of you being mostly black and not too pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hear the vacuum go towards the TV, and soon her the cabinet shuffle slightly, surely from Chelsea trying to move it. \"Chels, get your flat ass out of the way,\" Olivia booms above you, saying her command with a mixture of annoyance and humor, \"I can't see the TV!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a short period of time, you hear Rachel call out in disappointment, \"aww, there was no buggy down there, I thought for sure he would be with the dust where he belongs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Too bad, but now that you made the mess on the floor, you can clean it up,\" Chelsea says sternly. \"I don't even know if he is still in here, if you want to still look for him, he is all yours.\" Soon a large amount of wind enters your gap as the boney-behind of your biggest former-sister plops down to the right of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You smile, knowing you have made the right decision to go on the couch instead of the cabinet. For now, this spot seemed great, it was providing the protection you wanted so much. Soon a third large body made its way onto the couch, \"wherever that bug went, I will find him, hmph!\" It was Rachel, who conceding to defeat decide to watch TV too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You start to drift to sleep from all the fatigue. You can faintly hear your former-mother's voice followed by a small conversation masked in the solemn tone of defeat. Before you could sleep for long though, a truly retched smell explodes into your hiding spot waking you up as you do your best to not fall into a coughing fit. The smell of sulfur fills your nose and mouth, your eyes watering as if you were hit by tear gas. The shrieks from Rachel and Chelsea cry out blocking out the sound from the TV, only to be outdone by the roaring laughter of Liv. </span></div></div>",

The good news is that you were able to breath fresher air again, but the bad news is that you were soon enclosed in the small giantess's hand. \"Ahahaha, the pervy little bug was behind my ass the whole time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bringing you up to her face your view is filled predominately with her wide lips and slightly stained teeth. A little above you can see her nose, including a few chunks or boogers she did not clean out, captured by her wiry hairs. Her pale blue eyes are barely visible unless you crane your neck about as much as possible, but you did not need to see them to know where they were looking as her grip on your lower body stays true. \"I feel bad for you two,\" Olivia says between giggles, \"you make yourselves pooped looking for him and all I did is poop and he comes crawling to me. Maybe it is what he likes, maybe this little bug wanted to thank me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You are still unable to move as she brings you back behind her. With her index finger, she plucks her yoga pants and panties back, revealing her giant crack. Turning her hand, you hang upside down over the crevice before being inserted into the middle of the two mounds, small hairs rubbing you as the moist, foul smell blankets you. From below you, there is a hint of a slightly sweeter smell, one you have the first-hand experience of knowing is vaginal juices that must have starting to flow from. There is no light, but you and Olivia both know you are by her anus, and before you could squirm away, removes her hand and snaps the pants. \"You are so gross, ugh.\" Rachel's muffled voice expressed her discontent towards your situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rachel; is right, you don't know where that, <i>bug</i> has been. Get him out of your pants now.\" Your former mother spoke with authority that you hope has reached Liv's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry mom, but finders keepers. I will take my chances with him, and shut up, Rachel, you are just jealous you did not find him. Be a good girl and you can be next!\" Olivia's pride getting to her head, this compares to how she acts during Christmas or her birthday, and for the good reason that she has finally got the present she always wanted- you as nothing but a disposable play thing. The think fabric in back of you barges towards you and then retreats. The process happens thrice within a few seconds as her digits poke and prod at you to show your family where you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few seconds of being trapped in there, you hear a slimy slurp followed by feeling a putrid heat wash over you more intense then previous. The smell of waste smothers you, causing you to choke as you try to breathe. The orifice closes after half a second, to open again after a few more moments. Gagging again, you wonder how long your former-sister will make you suffer like this. Your answer comes to you quickly, when the orifice opens once more time, and releases a torment of methane at you. You barely stay conscious as the oxygen is robbed from your lungs. You hear your sister nearly dying of laughter as her large hand pulls you out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your sight returns to find you under your sisters nose as she sniffs your demoralized body. You know the smell will be unpleasant as you are coated by sprinkles of of rectal discharge that came out with her fart, as well as a thin layer of sweat for between her cheeks. \"Aww, the smell of victory.\" Olivia's lips spread apart revealing her monstrous mouth as she begins laughing again. \"You guys have to try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It is rude to pass up an offer I suppose,\" Chelsea attempts to say calmly, slight stuttering giving her true excitement away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aww no fair, \"Rachel moans sadly, \"I wish I had as much gas as you Liv, can I get a rain check?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If he is alive still sure. Mommy, want about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If still alive, your hopes of any chance of a peaceful end vanquishes, as it seems her intent is going to be ultimately to destroy you. For now you are nothing but a living butt plus, but in cruel irony you are not even good at that as you could still smell the remnants of the previous fart in the air. You really were good for nothing besides making your former-family happy at the cost of your comfort. \"Sure hun, but don't expect me to put him inside my panties, now I do know where it has been. Just place him on my chair.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"OK mommy, you first, then Chelsea.\" Liv throws you unceremoniously onto the soft-cushioned chair that your mother favored. Your mother's plump bubble butt bends down, carefully aligning you with her crack. Before she fully sits, she lowers her jeans to reveal her pink, silky underwear. Without mercy, she sits on top of you, placing your head just north of her anus. Quickly, a loud bust of wind comes flying out, pummeling you with a sensation worse then Liv's gas did. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Getting up while chuckling, you see Chelsea already eagerly bending down, going to sit right onto you,  her  Jeans still covering her flatter butt. As with the others the gas comes out, blinding you in tears, deafening you temporarily from the pressure, and making your taste and smell sync to that of rotten eggs. You try to stay awake, but your head feels light, the world spinning. You black out, accepting whatever is next to happen.</span></div></div>",

You recall that you did not dream while you were asleep, the amount of energy required for something so basic was more than you had. A few yards away from you, there appears to be crumbs of bread, and close to it, a few drops of water which would be enough to quench your debilitating thirst. The amount of light you have sis very limited, almost navy blue in color compared to the black that you would expect at night. Crawling slowly, you make it to the warm water, a blessing none-the-less. Grabbing a handful of loose water that was separated from the rest, you wash your hands trying to remove any crust left on your from the past days affair. You find another pile and do the same for your face. Moving to the larger droplets, you grab a handful and drink it down slowly, feeling the water refreshing your dry mouth. Your lips, cooling down from the strong burn dehydration left them with. You cough after the first handful, for it has been almost a day since your last drink, your body did not know how to adjust to such a sudden change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You manage to hold down two more handfuls before you get the strength to crawl over to the crumbs. Stale or not, the crumbs were a much needed source to kill the hunger pangs that now echoed from within. Your throat, still combating the dehydration, takes longer to move the small pieces of food down. Learning from the water incident, you take your time between bites, and start to chew more before attempting to swallow. There is no rush after all, you had no place to go from what you could tell. Taking in more food, your eyes are adjusted to your surroundings a bit more, as more light slowly seeps its way into the large room ahead of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you feel more refreshed you head back to the water pile and break off a small part by literally pushing it away. A new, smaller glob of water waits for you as you go to it and start to wash the rest of your nude body off. The water being warm made this process more relaxing then it otherwise would be, and actualy made you glad that it was so. Small globs of brown water sprinkle off your body. The stench from the tiny particles wakes up again, promoting your gag reflex to start up slightly. The small particles of excrement that washed over you from the flatulence does make its way off you, and allows you to feel a little more satisfied with your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You start by looking at your container, it was a glass jar, possibly a pickle jar, that was tall enough to ensure your lack of escape. Above, saran wrap clung above, large holes poked in to allow you to breath. It appeared to be held onto the jar with a rubber band, which was stretched taught to deny the saran any movement. A shine was evident on a small portion of the jar facing the window side of the room, the sun finally filling the void with its gift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A large, high pitch noise echoes, chased by a more thunderous noise- the sound of a large one sleeping. Gazing outside your container, the ruffled hair of your captive, the youngest one in the house, caresses her pillow and her delicate cheek as her face attempts to bury away from the impending light with only partial success. Her nose aligned properly to remove most of her mouth from your view, but the little you can see, was opened ajar, allowing a bit of moisture to glimmer off the small reflection from the light hitting the glass. Her ribs slowly dances to the same tune as her breath, rising and falling in sync with the noise. Her right hand sneaked out of the blanket to find solace around her favorite stuff cat, placed near her bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Behind you, your captive's smart phone lay quietly on the table, silently waiting for its next use. A cup half-filled with water stands tall next to the phone, waiting for the nimble hands of your former sister. Chuckling grimly to yourself, even now things are half-full but the amount of hope you really have left for a happy ending would take up as much room as the crumbs in this jar if put into a material perspective. The walls pink during the day, mask themselves as a dark-purple color. Further away, her pile of clothes creates a small mountain that is cut off by the desk ledge in front of you. The door is shut, with her desk chair wedged in front of the handle to deny intruders easy access. Olivia did this when torturing you to prevent any interference, but this time it may be to also help you out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everything looks as it did yesterday, minus the jar you are in. From a human's perspective, nothing has happened. The innocent room shows no sign of the depraved acts that befallen you just a day earlier. Seeing no reason to stay up, you lay back down and let this all sink in again. While hard, the steady ground made you actually feel at ease, the walls allowing you a type of comfort that a prisoner may feel compared to being out in the wild. It does not take you long to fall asleep again, but you doubt you will dream, that is something bug's don't get to have after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Clunk clunk clunk</i> Your world explodes around you, forcing you to get from zero to one hundred in less than a second. Your heart pounding you eyes are veiled by the bright light which takes a few seconds to be removed, finally allowing the intended view to be visible. Your sisters large index finger retreating from the jar, leaving small, almost unnoticeable chips of red fingernail paint behind. \"Good morning buggy, hope you slept well, you have a busy day ahead of you.\" Olivia's sincere smile  further removing any solace you had from your sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your sister was only wearing a large t-shit she used while sleeping, and from how far she was bent down, allowed you a view of her b-cup cleavage. Her hair was still messy, and her pores were more evident than usual from the lack of makeup. Quickly she sat up in bed, he eyes glued to you still with a crocodilian smile plastered firmly to her face. \"You are lucky I found you, the others could not wait to kill you, but I knew better than that. You may be stupid to us great humans,\" Olivia says while pointing pridefully to herself, \"but I know you are still smarter than the average bug. Don't get me wrong, I will kill you if I see you misbehaving too much, but you can live to be a nice old age if you do what I say... and,\" she begins to say sinisterly, \"if I don't get bored of you. Now then it is shower time,\" Olivia begins to say while removing the elastic band from the jar. Her left hand lays parallel to the jar, as her right smoothly slides to a side, and begins to turn your home sideways. Sliding quickly with the crumbs and water chasing you, you end up in the middle of her left palm, which starts to form a large bowl from her cupping her hand. \"Let us waste no time, today I will let you get off easy by being carried, but don't make any mistake, I will sometimes have you earn your day, maybe by clinging onto a hair on my head, or a hair near my pussy, or by other more, fun, ways.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She quickly exits her room, two towels in her right hand, and makes her way to the empty bathroom. Without hesitation, she places the towels on the sink, and uses both hands to remove the shirt. Your world shift greatly, throwing you about and making you feel almost weightless. Before you could get adjusted a large pressure once again throws you as much as it could upwards, before you crash down a few inches into the bottom of Olivia's hand. Her hand tilts and you stumble down onto the shower floor. A large explosion nearly deafens you as the water turns on from the bath, which quickly starts to flood towards you. Looking forward at the water, you pray your sister is not taking a bath, as you did not know if you could survive the current that will form long enough for your sister to enter to tub and give you land to stay on. Your fears quickly subside as she reaches in again and changes it to the shower setting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking towards the shower entrance, you see the goddess standing tall, testing the water. Her nipples were erect, making her perky breasts all the more pleasant to look at. Looking higher, you can see she was watching you, probably watching you the whole time, and without a doubt, knew you just were staring at her chest. Gulping, you hope that she will have mercy on you for that, but she still says nothing. Drops fall hard onto you, keeping you down, unable to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hoping that she forgives you for that, you can only watch as her large left leg slinks into the shower, going over your head and to the left side. You look up and see her vaginal lips slightly parted and moist already. Further back, hiding under her medium-sized buttocks, her anus which you were intimately introduced to yesterday spreads slightly from her legs being so wide opened. Fine, blonde hairs are just visible around both areas, hairs that you will eventually have to hold onto for your life. AS her other leg comes in and pincers you from the right, you gulp again as your fate is once again up to her.</span></div></div>",

Getting enough courage, you walk out from underneath her slightly, allowing a few droplets to splash next to you, but not directly on you, causing a sort of shower for yourself. Looking up, you can see Olivia's stunning body. A small patch of trimmed public hair lays above her crotch which is still opened a little, moisture from the bath and her own body layering the outsides a bit. Above, her flat tummy goes in and out with each breath, but also flexes as she washes herself slowly. Her breasts are jiggling as she moves her body to wash her arms. Her smile has yet to leave her face as she looks onto you. \"Look out below buggy, I forgot to go potty before hand.\" Olivia's laugh, audible over the maddening sounds of mini explosions form droplets hitting the ground as well as the constant sound of the water leaving the pipe, chills you even in this warm shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Without any more of a warning, a steady blast of yellow comes out of her first a little head of you, then directly on top of you before moving backwards. Your eyes sting from the urine getting directly in them. The strong acid scent causes you to cough and wheeze. The new river of pee pushes you towards the drain, where the clean water and urine blend togetehr before finding their way down the pipe. As the main torrent ends, your owner's gigantic body lurches down. Her hands, keep her hair so the side as she bends down and aims her secondary releases at you. The first, and largest one misses, hitting just south of you. Scooting forward like a duck, Olivia aims again and hits you dead on with the second blast of urine, knocking you down again and causing you to open your mouth as the wind is knocked out of you. Both urine and shower water alike make their way into your mouth and you gulp it down as if instinct. The good news is, the other two tiny releases missed, but it was enough for your sister to still laugh her ass off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ahaha, I usually pee in the shower, but now I will make sure to <i>always</i> do so. You can play dodge the pee every day now. Hope you like the taste, because I like the game. Watching you suffer through that makes me so,\" panting, Olivia brings her pointer and middle finger of her right hand to her mouth and sucks on them before bringing them lower, \"so hot. Unf, just seeing that makes me horny. Come here bug and help finish what you started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unable to deny you want to, you slowly move forward as your Olivia's cheeks firmly hit the ground causing a pool of water start to slowly form near her now very wet womanhood. Her left hand drags you quickly towards her snatch, her hand shoving you into it forcing you to squirm next to it. The vaginal fluids are watered down, but still smell and taste largely of your sister and her pheromones. licking and squirming, above you the fingers slurp and squelch as they plunge just below her clit. The hand behind you vanishes, looking up you can just barely make it out, grasping at her right breast, all the while water falling on you both. After just a couple minutes, your sister lets out a soft mound as she jerks around, her legs stirring about as she releases a small squirt of fluid. You were used as a toy like this for her before, but never once did she squirt. The level of sexual intoxication for her reached a new point, a point you know will be ventured upon numerous times, but as your rock hard member proved, was to your enjoyment too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Panting heavily, and flushed in her face and nether region, your sister gets off the ground and picks you up, bringing you right next to her lips. Her tongue lurched out of its cave, licking your entire body with ease. Her morning breath was not pleasant, but the feeling her her grime coming off you, and the almost-therapeutic feel of her taste buds coursing over you, was truly magnificent. \"That was amazing bug, keep that up and you will live a long, LONG time <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/music1.png\" alt=\"*Music1*\" title=\"Music1\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taking some more body lotion, Olivia covers you and her hands in a lathery mess as she washes her groin more, with you along the trip to taste more of what you helped create. This was brief, but long enough to know that she wanted to go again, but for some reason did not. \"Liv, hurry up in there,\" Rachel's voice beckoned from outside the hall, \"others need some hot water too you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"OK, just,\" Olivia beings to reply, her face now returning to the normal pale color,  \"just give me a little bit.\" Play time is over, thanks to your former twin sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Liv places you on the toilet lid which was now covering the watery hole below. She bends down as lets a small fart loose over you. \"That is to make you remember where you belong bug, you are still nothing but a bug, even if you do make me all hot, remember that. Her voice was quiet, and while the words were heavy, her voice was soft, almost calming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your new mistress put her hair up in one towel, which wrapping the other around her, not before giving you another view of her bare pussy and cheeks. She scooped you up and wedged you between her mounds carefully making sure you could not fall. \"all yours sis, enjoy!\" Liv did not want to clue Rachel in to what just happened for whatever reason, leaving both of you to chuckle a bit as Liv makes her way to her room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Liv placed you back into the jar as she got changed and put on her makeup. She paid no attention to you as she got ready, keeping her attention on applying makeup correctly. Only after she was done looking as gorgeous as ever did she make her way back to you. Liv was a simple one with routine, now that she was done getting ready, it was breakfast time. Cereal or toast with eggs, which would be done while watching whatever crap was on TV. As you fall into Liv's sweet smelling hand, you wonder what she had in store for you. \"I see you are eager there, let's start out with a relatively easy game... survive.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was quite far away and given your size it would definitely take awhile. You hugged the bottoms of the trim in the hopes that anyone coming by wouldn't notice you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour or so, you heard lots of noises coming from outside, and you knew your sisters were back. Carefully but quickly, you snuck forward and tried your best to hide as you saw your sisters come inside with a male guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized him, it was someone from your school. Your eyes grew wide as your sister's blasted him with the same powers your mother had!! You had no idea they had the power too!

You had an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could get up to her dresser, then you might be able to unlock her phone and call someone.

Fear filled your mind as you were not sure how she would react if she found you like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour worst fears were true though! Your mother turned on her bedside lamp nearby and let out a yawn. Looking at the clock, it was only about 10 pm so your mother hadn't been sleeping for very long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as she got out of her bed, no emotion on her face at all. She was wearing a pair of black panties and a black bra. You had never seen her this way and given the fact that she was so incredibly large, you were frightened!

Trust me, it will be fun for me too.\" she said with a smile, bending over and give you a generous view of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but stare even though you knew that you shouldn't.

She was too close for you to run away from and there was nowhere you could really go. Maybe playing her game could somehow get you out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, we'll play a game I call ball squishers. I'm going to give you a nice foot massage, though I suppose my feet are the size of a planet compared to you. I'm going to get harder and harder on your tiny body, but I won't squish you if you can drain that little cock of all of your cum underneath me. Can you do that sweetie? Can you drain all of your cum for me?\" she said very gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her with pure horror and fear. You couldn't believe she was going to do something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could respond further, your mother's massive foot came down on you, knocking you onto the carpet. You screamed as her foot collided with you, though it was actually quite gentle. She hadn't lied, she was rubbing you very sensually. Feelings of tension started to fill your loins as she continued to rub up and down against your tiny body and cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, sweetie. Drain your load for mommy. Get rid of all that bad energy.\" she said as she looked down at you with a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your mind start to go crazy justifying what was happening.  It's not that she's a bad person, it's just something she's grown into. No moral conundrums here, she's your mom after all, and does what is best for you. That means making you feel helpless and embarrassed beyond your loins. Making you feel like the tiny little man that you are. You just needed to give in, and give her what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you got? I thought we were having fun.\" you heard from up above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel yourself getting closer and closer to cumming over your mother's giant barefoot. The feeling on your body was so nice. Suddenly though the pressure starting to get more intense. You remember that this is what she said that she would do. <br>\r\nFrantically, you reached down towards your cock to start pleasuring yourself in an attempt to cum sooner but her foot 'massage' was getting too rough for you to reach down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better hurry little one, or you'll just be a tiny little iddy biddy boy even quicker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to panic a bit, she wasn't kidding about you not being able to move your body when she said it. It was as if someone was holding you down although you could still writhe and kick your legs about. You tried to rub yourself against the carpet, but that did nothing for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help.\" Your mother says in the sweetest tone while putting down her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the pressure intensify as she put more and more of her weight on your teeny tiny body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mommy!! P-please stop!!\" you begged but you were far too tiny for her to hear you. You knew your only chance was to cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so frightened as her fleshy foot mangled your body back and forth against the carpet. The weight was getting worse and worse. You rotated your body in a way that your cock was facing directly below your mother's massive sole. Pivoting yourself upward, you started to hump away at the big foot. It was your only chance of survival. As your mom continued to slowly crush your tiny body, you hoped that you would be able to get off before she was done with you. You thought back to her big swaying breasts above and felt your little member strengthen up once more. You pushed your cock up and down between the little folds of her foot (though to you, they were quite big). As you did this, your mother giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww... Has my little creamy worm finally going to put that little pecker of his to good use?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a slight sting around the base of your tiny cock as your mother had mashed it through your foot's covering. Blood streamed in a trickle down to your sore cock. You continued to try to get yourself off upon your mother's big smothering sole while she continued her slow, sadistic torture towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cock was hurting so bad and tears rolled down your face. Your whole body was aching but you had to keep going. Pushing up and down, over and over again, you edged yourself closer and closer to orgasm. Pushing through the pain, the sorrow, you had to keep going if you wanted to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh. . \" you moaned as you ignored the blood coming out of your body from your wounds. You were so close. Your mother would stop if you just finished. Just a little bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pain became more than you could bare, you finally felt your small balls release their tension. With a mixture of pain and relief, you finished on the outside your mom's sole. With each spurt getting bigger, you just hoped this would be enough to put an end to it all and cause her to finish off what she started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your body spasmed under her foot, her whole foot quickly clenched around your entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha. . M-mommy. . stop!!\" you cried as the foot continued it's assault on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had promised!! She had promised!! The weight was so intense, it was more than you could bear. You screamed as her foot came down on you harder and harder, your bones breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, sweetie. You did it!! Now I don't have to squish you. But guess what, honey? Mommy's big feet still want too. You don't want to disappoint them, do you!!\" she said laughing mercilessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo!!\" you cried, feeling totally and utterly defeated. The pain was so intense. Your arms and legs were totally pulverized as you watched your mother lift her foot above you with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye bye, my little prick of a son!!\" she said as her foot came down hard as an anvil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAAM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour entire body exploded in a pool of blood and guts. There was nothing left of you but a stain under your mother's foot. If you could somehow hear, you'd have heard a haughty laugh of contentment at your demise. It was over, you were dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing left of you but a miserable stain underneath your mom's bare foot.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not wanting to risk being caught here and crushed within the first couple hours of being denounced a bug, you decide to go to one of the other four rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Every progressive step out of the room leads to the voices of the four giantesses to become slightly louder. There was no doubt they were in the kitchen, which meant that you had to only hope your mother was being honest about giving you at least the hour to run away. in order to get to the bathroom or your mother's room, you had to travel through the kitchen. The hall and the dining room were the only places between the living room and the kitchen, making the task of finding a different hide out all the more hard. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n     As you went by the entrance to the dining room, it was much easier to hear what the four were talking about, and without surprise it was you. \"... it is why we may not want to kill the bugs ourselves, let nature take its course,\" Chelsea was lecturing again. \"If the other insects decide to kill them or if they get killed on accident, well then that is just what God wanted. We should not kill ourselves <i>intentionally</i>, for that is against most religious doctrines, unless they show themselves guilty of the word of the Lord. Besides, the bugs may be... useful, in other ways. Religious figures have a long history of having servants or making examples out of some to prevent others from doing such heinous acts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It is not clear whether the others are actually listening, nor if Chelsea is defending your life or finding new ways to kill you that would allow her to stay pure under God's eyes. What is clear is that you still rather not be found. The dining room before you is large, with a china cabinet at one end, a grandfather clock on the left wall, seats to fit eight, and a medium-sized trash bin to throw away scraps that can't go in the disposal. Around it you could already see crumbs of stale bread and other little bits of food. There were not a lot of great hiding places save the grandfather cloth and the backside of the trash to hide at for tonight, but if he could get through the waking hours, he could find more places to hide at nighttime. Potentially, even on the table. The biggest problem came form knowing that if found here, there is no doubt that at least Liv and Rachel would consider you part of their meal. They have each thrown you in their mouths before, sucking on you until both you and the torturer release in ecstasy, but now will be different, there will be no coming out. <br>\r\n      \"OK Chels,\" you hear your mother finally say exasperated from the long-winded lecture, \"but none of this matters for another thirty minutes. All bugs are safe until then, but there is no reason we can't talk about how we like to watch them suffer until then right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Staying here did have little to offer from protection, still, it seemed better than going in plain sight of these cruel individuals, even if it meant hiding next to a smelly trash. You were just promised a half hour worth of time to explore then, and surely the other places had better hiding spots...</span></div></div>",

Then he'll probably be food for some bird.  Or he'll get sucked up into the lawnmower.  Come to think of it, mowing the lawn was his job.  Who's going to take over?\"  Your mother asked, with awkward silence following.  \"Hm, no volunteers, huh?  Well, maybe we could get a gardener with the money we'll save on having to care for your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean ex-brother.\"  Chelsea laughed.  \"You know what would be funny?  If we found him and shrunk him even more.  We could make him the size of dust and strand him on the carpet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, now there's an idea.  He'd be lost in there forever!\"  Rachel piped up,  \"Running around a forest of carpet, just waiting for the day one of us accidentally snuffs him out under our shoes.  I bet he'll even welcome it at that point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I might do?\"  Your mother mused, \"I think if I find him I'm just going to slowly squeeze him between my thumb and my finger until he pops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really couldn't believe some of the sadistic fantasies your family was coming up with.  There was no doubt about it, you needed to get out of the house.  The outside world wasn't promising, but an ignorant world seemed like a better chance than a knowing family out to crush your head.  For the moment though, none of that mattered, because you'd finally reached your destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tucked yourself into the corner made by the bin and the wall and began to scrounge for crumbs.  You found mostly bits of bread crust, and greedily bit into the tough pieces.  Eating your fill, you pushed yourself further into the shadows to hide and wait for your family to disband.  Once they were gone, you'd be able to get a move on...</span></div></div>",

They had spent a lot of time in the kitchen chatting and eating, and even when dinner had finished, at least one family member was in or around the kitchen at any given time.  By the time you had an opportunity to move, it was already nightfall and you were forced to move by the faintest glimmers of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but steadily you made your way towards the front door, your ears exaggerating every faint creak of the house as one of the giant sadists who had plotted your demise.  You mind, like a broken record, replayed every fantasy they'd discussed at dinner, ad nauseum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How awesome would it be if he got crushed under my combat boots.\" Rachel's voice echoed in your brain, \"I bet he'd be caught in the treads for days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really should wear heels sometimes Rachel,\" your mother had piped in, \"They're much more feminine than sneakers and boots.  Not to mention, they flatten bugs much more easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Mom, they're not my style, but you're really selling me on the idea.' Rachel had joked, to which everyone shared a laugh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to push away the feeling building steadily in your gut, but it was no use.  Every hair on you body stood on end as the raw anxiety of impending disaster hung around you like a lost specter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the dreary internal soundtrack, however, you finally made it close to your destination.

What would have once taken you five steps took you probably 1500, but the looming archway that held your freedom (or at least freedom from this ruthless house) came closer and closer regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have come even closer, granting you what you wanted most, but in your rush you didn't see the obstacle until it was too late.  Your lead foot stuck fast in something unseen, causing your body to spin out like a windmill.  Your hip lunged and your body twisted until you'd ended up flat on your back, unable to move due to some sticky substance.  Had they laid a bug trap for you?  You moved your head as far as possible, taking in was you could see of your current predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScotch tape.  Not even the good kind, the cheap kind that never stayed on right.  A rogue piece of cheap, dollar store tape had sealed your demise, barely ten long strides from the door.  Of all things in the random, unforgiving universe, this piece of tape spelled the final disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cried.  You cried and you screamed and you cursed and you tried to thrash and rip your way away from the tape, but the glue held firm to your body.  It was no use.  Having used all of your energy, you laid still and stared at the ceiling, wondering if there was anyone in the world that was as completely fucked as you were at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, as the sunlight broke into the windows, you heard the familiar clip-clop of your mother's work heels moving towards the door.  She emerged from the living room in work attire, her purse already over her shoulder and her keys already in hand.  She maneuvered towards you, and you could see her eyes darting around the floor.  No chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser she came, until her eyes locked on to you.  She slowed her pace, allowing her heels to click on the hardwood loudly, and flipped her long hair behind her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, do we have bugs in the house?\" She said, trying and failing to hide her predatory eyes, \"Well, that's just no going to stand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shiny toes of her black pumps settled just in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am running late for work.  I can't spend any time playing with insects now, can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was it.  No fanfare, no celebration, no teasing or gloating or continued torture.  Your mother simply raised her shoe and lowered its hard black sole onto your body, crushing you into paste without thought or care, as if you were never her son, and as if you really were just a pest to be extinguished.</span></div></div>",

It seemed she had never went to bed in the first place, probably staying up all night.  You had to lay low, it was your only chance of survival.  You moved away from under the sofa and a bit more towards the chair knob.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne time, Chelsea once reenacted the Carthaginian infant sacrifices with bugs. .while making you be the \"high priest\" when you were shrunken down!  As \"high priest\" you had to eat from the carcasses of those dead bugs.  It was pretty terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you realized you had to get back into the action.  Looking back up from your hiding place you saw that Chelsea was. . . gone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere had she. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWooosh!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you felt yourself moving upward in an incredibly fast motion!  Your tiny body was being picked up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there you are!!\" Chelsea said, bringing you up to her gigantic face.  \"Looks like I'm the one who found you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Chelsea's freckled face.  She had some bags under her eyes, you probably did too.  When you were hiding earlier you didn't exactly sleep very well.  Or at all, really.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in terror as your sister opened her gigantic mouth wide, sticking you inside of it. Her hot warm breath washed over you as you felt yourself start to get compressed gently. Mashing you between her lips, she started to suck on you like a mint.  You screamed because she was sucking so hard it was hurting your teeny tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSQUIRCH! SQUELCH! SQUIRCH!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped sucking quite that hard and started to suck you softly, gently.  It actually felt nice on your body which made you feel uncomfortable given that it was your sister and you didn't know when she would suck harder again.  You just wanted her to finish you already but it seemed she had some torment in mind first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the kitchen, the giantess opened up the fridge, pulling out a cheese stick and some juice.  As she did this she started humming a tune from one of the shows she liked to watch but you couldn't make it out cause the vibrations of noise was hurting your ears,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring your plight, your sister poured herself a glass of juice and with the cheese stick and the juice in hand, made her way back to her room.  She continued her sucking of your body but she was once again gentle.  Maybe she didn't mean to suck on you so harshly earlier.  The sounds of her feet falling into the ground combined with her gentle sucking was actually quite relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquirch! Sqelch! Squirch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquirch! Sqelch! Squirch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquirch! Sqelch! Squirch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomping and rhythmic stomping of her feet started to make you feel tired.  You hadn't slept at all lately. . you pushed against her lips as the sucked on you, both trying to make yourself uncomfortable and also trying to stay awake.  You were worried that if you feel asleep, you'd wake up inside of Chelsea's stomach! Or worse. . . </span></div></div>",

Struggling inside of Chelsea's mouth, you can feel her tongue and mouth start to move you around a bit.  She once again started to suck on you in a very rough way. . repeatedly putting tons of pressure on your tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was rough as you felt your skin start to pull all over, it was like getting an indian burn on your whole body as she sucked super hard on you.  You couldn't even breathe due to how hard she sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped for a second, stealthily opening her bedroom door as you gasped for air and relief at the same time.  A thought crossed your mind, maybe you could jump from here. . jump and plummet yourself down to the ground.  You wouldn't live but you'd be out of this horror show.  Those thoughts went away as you saw Chelsea sit down, now sucking on you again but once again in a gentle ton as she sat in front of a tiny replica of. . . oh no. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Aztec Pyramid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw past her bed, bookshelf, and other arrangements that she had a small replica of an Aztec Pyramid on her desk.  You remember her buying that awhile back at an antique shop, but the fact that she had it there and finished. . . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react further, you felt a hard sucking as you were thrust deep into Chelsea's mouth.  This was it. . she was going to swallow you now!!  You were terrified as everything went dark as you were pulled back away from the light and further down onto her tongue.  Her spit culminated in the whole area, it was very hard to breathe and you were totally soaked.  Closing your eyes you hoped that you would pass out before you hit her stomach at least. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoosh!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Chelsea spit you out really fast, you opened your eyes to see her open hand cupped and ready for you as you. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nlanded. . onto her hand, a little bruised but no worse for the wear.  You turned and looked at your sister, freckled and with her hair a bit disheveled.  Placing you on top of the pyramid, you noticed a small alter on the top. . small enough for you to fit on top of!!  As you worriedly noticed this, Chelsea had placed her juice next to the pyramid and opened up her cheese stick and started to gently chew on it while she looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-chelsea. . L-listen. . \" you started to say as loud as you could.  \"J-just cause you are supposed to t-treat me this way. . y-you don't have to. . \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were desperate to get her not to hurt you but it seemed your response fell on deaf ears, whether she didn't hear you or ignored you. . you weren't sure.  She just stared at you blankly as she took another bite of her cheese stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChomp, munch, munch, munch.  Chomp, munch, munch, munch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the devastation that her mouth was doing to that little bit of food frightened you.  You realized that could have been you a little while ago. Still covered with her spit, you used your hands to rub your body in a vain attempt to get some of it off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one final bite, Chelsea finished eating her cheese stick, reaching for her orange juice that she had gotten earlier.  Juice and cheese was a strange combination that you didn't fully get, but it definitely was a \"Chelsea\" thing.  As she started to chug down the juice, you started looking around.  Maybe there was some way you could get out of this mess, jump and hide somewhere to get away from her.  At your size, it was quite a number of stairs to get down from this thing. . more than enough time for her to just grab you again.  Still, it might be your only chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath and sighed contentedly from the fulfillment her little snack had been. . and returned her attention to her little bug instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know why the Aztec's believed in human sacrifice?\" she said, her huge hand coming into view as it gently rubbed your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why they believed killing so many people was, believe it or not, actually a good thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing you towards the alter, you started to scream at her, tears filling your eyes as you were wildly looking for some way out of this mess.  You pushed, prodded, begged, and pleaded as you were slowly pushed towards that alter on top of the pyramid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, the Gods, they gave the Aztec's everything.  Good crops, fertility, success, everything.  Everything was owed to them.  so what a way to give back. . a way to give back to the gods. . then to give them. . everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to push against her, yelling at her at the top of your lungs. Suddenly you felt excruciating pain as her finger started to mash you against the surface of the pyramid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to stop fighting me right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't yell it, didn't scream it, just spoke in a general casual voice but you stopped.  Stopped moving, screaming, fighting and she stopped pushing so much pressure on you from her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that kind of funny? You know, in a way, I am your God.  So, you owe me everything.  All of you, every last bit of you.  You owe it all to me.  When I saw you in the living room, I could have just crushed you.  Smashed you, eaten you.  Ripped you limb from limb.  I didn't though, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing very hard, you felt such a powerful wave of anxiety.  What was going on with this?  On the one hand, she was right that she hadn't killed you. . immediately.  But that didn't mean that she still wouldn't do it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger came off of you and Chelsea looked down at you more intently.  She was still tired but she had a devious mile to her as her hazel eyes pierced into your soul.  She did feel like a Goddess right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on that alter and bow down to me. Do it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, you started shaking.  Staring up at her, you realized you had a big decision to make.</span></div></div>",

It was a grueling time as you listened to all sorts of terrible ways to torture you.  You had almost given up on ever leaving this spot, until you heard a loud buzzing sound coming from your mother's cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel jumped up gleefully and shouted loudly in the room so you could hear too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time's up!! I guess it is time to go bug hunting!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of women got up off of the couch and began to scour about the room.

If I find him first, I promise to call all of you so you can watch me squish him!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dear, that is not why I called you back!! Can you clean up the kitchen?!? The floor is getting a bit dirty with all those food particles from before!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia's face turned into one of disgust and annoyance.  She put her arms down angered and crossed them afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but mom. . . you all are going to find him first!!! I want to get rid of the litle bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha shook her head and pointed towards the dining room area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, it'll be alright!! If we find him first, I'll come and get you too! Besides, maybe he is in the kitchen!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, mom!!! He wouldn't be that stupid to hide in there!! There is no way he could escape from there!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha walked over, her other daughters already off in search of a little bug and handed Olivia a broom.  She smiled as Olivia finally had come around to cleaning up in the kitchen. But, she also agreed with Olivia, it was unlikely that he had gone into the kitchen.  Though, given how dumb he was who knew? Maybe Olivia would find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha went towards the front door, she thought that he might have tried to leave the house. Even if he did, it was unlikely that he would get very far.  She would find him and end him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you listened and watched the events unfold, you realized that you had made a terrible mistake.  On the one hand, you had at least gotten in some food.  Now though, you were trapped as Olivia had begun to sweep up the floor into a big pile.  As she did this, she began humming an annoying tune.  Some kind of. . . song she had heard or something.  It was annoying and so incredibly loud in your ears due to your smal size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWham!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe broom slamed down besides where you were as Olivia pushed the contents of the floor closer to the center of the room.  She was doing this so absentmindedly that you doubted that she even was paying attention to what she was doing!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe broom crashed right behind you! You turned around to see her giant body looming above you, the simple song still going as you were swept towards a giant (to you) pile of dust and food!!  You screamed as your body slammed into it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Olivia had retrieved the dustpan, happy to have the work done quickly.  It might not have been the best job she had ever done, but now she could get back to looking for the little lost bug.  She pulled the pile into the dustpan and brought it over towards the trash can.</span></div></div>",

As she moved, she rocked the trash you were in back and forth, over and over again.  The piles of dust and sot saturated your naked body, turning your skin totally black.  This could actually come in handy as it would be harder for your murderous family to try and kill you.  Your body went up and down continuously as Olivia's unknown torture of you continued.  Olivia was hoping on every speck left in the kitchen, in the hopes that one of them would crunch underneath her massive feet.  It was like a dance to her, a dance that might bring about your death!!  She never was that great of a dancer, although she was also only 14.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to do something and fast, time was running out.  As soon as Olivia brought you towards the trash container, you would be in big trouble.  Pounds upon pounds of trash would crush your body, a horrible fate.  You couldn't let that happen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel spotted Olivia's goofiness from the living room.  She stopped the bug hunt momentarily to go see what she was up too.  You heard her booming footsteps as she slowly made her way into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOlivia, what are you doing in there?  You are acting like a child!! Don't you remember that we are on a mission here?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia turned and smiled.  She was having a good time and had actually sort of forgotten about the bug she wanted to squish.  You watched as she still held you; her face changing from happy to serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick burst, Olivia bolted from the front part of the kitchen towards the trash bag!! She was moving at such a rapid pace that you were having trouble from flying into the air.  Luckily or unluckily, the trash on the dustpan was doing a good job of keeping you in place.  With one little twist, Olivia thrust the dirt and sot and poured you into the open bag!!  You screamed as you flew deep down. . falling farther and farther into the horribly smelling container.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhap!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed on an old banana peal that broke your fall.  The other trash was also coming down.  Diving down into the garbage, you made your way towards the bottom, til you could see out the white trash bag.  Up above, in the land of giants, Olivia had sealed the bag and was starting to take it outside.  This might be your chance to escape.  Your family would never be able to find you now!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIP!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a terrible sound and knew immediately what it was.  The bag was tearing at the corner!  If it tore before Olivia got you off at the curb, you would fall out with a ton of other garbage!!  It wouldn't be good, not one bit!!</span></div></div>",

The trash wasn't the most terrible thing about what was going on right now.  The worst part was the humming.  Olivia's loud obnoxious humming as your tiny anxious body tensed up in fear.  You looked at the hole as a little drops of food and trash slightly fell out of the bottom of the bag.  It wouldn't be long now, hopefully Olivia would make it to the can outside before it happened.  The ripping increased as the trash got closer and closer to pouring out like a waterfall.  You were terrified at what would happen if you fell.  All the garbage in the bag would most likely crush you or worse. . . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were afraid, you didn't want to die, not like this.  Not like a piece of garbage.  Suddenly the bag stopped, your world shifted as you were flung backwards into an old banana peal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liv, when you finish up with that trash, you are more than welcome to help us look for the bug, okay?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaay!! Ok, I'll hurry up and take it outside!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia did a quick twirl then jumped up and down in excitement as she approached the front door.  You got up off of the banana peal and looked at the hole again.  This was it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRip!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was elsewhere when the bag actually tore.  Part of you tried to imagine that this was all a dream, not real.  You heard a loud yelp sound emitting from your sister's mouth as all the tons of trash poured into the front hallway in front of the door.  Your mother leaped out of the way to avoid getting all the trash all over herself.  It was a big mess.  You flung out slowly, moving down like a conveyor belt.  Olivia tried to use her hands to stop the spill, but that only put pressure on the other sides, causing the trash to fall out faster.  You rolling with it.  You were now totally covered with trash, with no way to escape.  The only thing that kept you from getting crushed was the banana peal from earlier.  It shielded you and propped up the other trash on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liv!! What did you do!!\" your massive mother said frustrated at the horrible mess littering the floor.  She paced quickly to the kitchen, struggling to pull out the broom your sister had left there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour other sisters stormed into the room too, curious at the ruckus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Olivia!! You always have to be spoiled, don't you?!? That isn't going to get you many heavenly rewards!!\" Chelsea said matter of factly, her loud voice booming in the front hallway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off, Chelsea!! You know I didn't do it on purpose!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia!!\" your mother interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't leave all that on the floor!!  You think just one bug is bad, wait til we get a bunch of them!! And those bugs are way more capable than our current guest, they can bite!! And Chelsea, you want to comment, then you get to help!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, but mom. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't there a verse about honoring your parents in there?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. . . okay!! Move over, Olivia!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid silently, listening to a ruffling of replacement bags and the three women gathering around the trash.  You heard some footsteps walking away too, which you assumed was Rachel, still looking for you.  You laid silently and wondered what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Your enormous sister Chelsea towered overhead, looking grossed out from picking up the trash particles with her hands.  Some of the pieces of the particles got stuck, which resulted in her shaking her hands and raining down piece of the trash on top of you.  You carefully placed it above you, in an attempt to conceal yourself from these terrifying women.  You didn't want them to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea, stop making those faces!! You don't hear Olivia complaining about this!! I am picking it up with my hands too!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, mom, I know. . . its just so. . . unclean!!\"  Chelsea complained \"and just . ..  icky!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as we finish, we can get back to hunting for the little bug!!\"  your mother nonchalantly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to come up with a plan here.  At this rate, in a few minutes, these towering giants would find you and crush you into non-existence!!  There had to be some way to escape from them, you just were not sure how.  The loud thunderous roar of trash being lifted from the ground and put into the bags was terrifying to hear.  Still, maybe there was a way you could escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant's hand collided right into you!!  You tried to look up, but your head was slammed onto the rough linoleum.  Trying to right yourself, you struggled under the weight of the mighty fingers as they dragged themselves upwards and towards the trash bag.  You looked up at the giant face who held you.  Chelsea!!  She looked at you casually, not realizing that you were right in her hand.  If you made any sudden motion, you might give away your position.  If you can get into the bag she had, you could get outside and by the curb.  From there, you'd just need to make your way to someone else's house for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeek!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea screamed, launching the trash she was holding upward and back into the other trash.  You landed on an empty pizza box and slipped through the cracks inside.  It was actually a decent hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liv, fu. . ehh. . shoot.  You almost made me swear, Olivia!!  That wasn't funny!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia and your mom laughed as your sister had spooked Chelsea by tickling her bare feet with feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is kind of your fault, Chelsea!!  Why would you come into this pile with no shoes, anyway.\" Olivia mocked, still chuckling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to get my nice shoes dirty in all of this mess!! Besides, I am only cleaning it because of you, anyway!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop fighting, you two!! We are almost done, now!!  Let's just wrap it up!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother picked up the pizza box and quickly moved it towards the bag.  You flew out of it and landed on some of the remaining soot that Olivia was picking up.  Picking your head up, you started at Olivia's magnificent body as it loomed above you.  She had been pushing the dirt together with her feet.  She had also, at Chelsea's request, removed her shoes and was using her bare feet to push it all together.  Looking over, you noticed some small crevices to the side of the wall.  With your body soaked with the soot, maybe you could make it over without them noticing.</span></div></div>",

If these three giantess' found you. . . you were finished!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining trash had been pooled into one final area.  Three smaller filled bags were sitting behind three giantess'.  You blinked as you saw Olivia tying her bag up and carefully taking it towards the door behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful with that, honey!! We don't want another spill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I will be careful, Mom!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sass your mother, Liv!!  I can have you punished in other ways for back talking!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea let out a little giggle but stifled her laughter when her mother looked at her disapprovingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the giants quarreled, you started to slowly move out of the final trash pile.  With your mom's view on Olivia and the latter focused on the trash, it would give you the opportunity you needed to get out of there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost had a heart attack when Chelsea's giant bare foot crashed into the remaining pile of garbage.  It spun out a few more pieces throughout the room. . including you!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Chelsea, now look!!  You got those trash pieces all over!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. . I was just. . trying to compress it all for ease of disposal.  I'm not the one who made this mess. .  \" Chelsea said solemnly as she eyed Olivia.  Olivia stuck her tongue out at her older sister as she opened the door and headed for the trash can to finally get rid of all this.  Your mother had handed Olivia the second trash bag, meaning once Chelsea put the final trash together, they would be done and back to hunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze as you found yourself dangerously close to your mother's enormous feet.  She was always careful of her surroundings and what was happening to her.  If anyone would notice you running, it would be her.  Maybe it would have been better to let Olivia grab you instead of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha reached down and picked up three of the five final pieces of soot covered residue from the ground.  They stuck to her hand easily, so she just poked them with her fingers.  Moving over to the fourth piece, she poked it and lifted her hand to the air. . .only for it to stay stuck on the ground?  Trying again, she poked it a second time, still very lightly.  That is when she heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA teeny tiny cough emitting from your body.  The poke had been tiny for her, but knocked out your air the second time.  The giantess mother knew immediately who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was you!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes grew wide with realization.  You were in trouble now!!</span></div></div>",

What a way to try and survive!  Hiding in the trash as it was about to be taken outside.  It was a bit clever for a bug.  Sure, you were useless to her, but you had at least provided an excellent little challenge of finding you.  Carefully reaching down, she positioned two of her fingers besides you and gently lifted you high into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoosh!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rose in front of your mom's face as she smiled a bit bigger this time.  Your heart sank.  This was it. . .she was about to destroy you with one final pinch between her fingers.  Only. . . she didn't.  What was she waiting for?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, she brought you towards her blouse and. . deposited you safely in her pocket.  What was this?  She was hiding you. . .from your other siblings?  Why the help?  More than likely, she had some other kind of devious torture planned before she disposed of you.  You didn't even want to think about that, as you struggled in the pocket.  It was very large inside and behind you, you felt your mother's breast push upwards against you.  It was very soft and actually comfortable.  The only other residents with you inside of the pocket was some lint . . possibly from the dryer or something.  You were pretty far down and it would be quite the climb to move upwards.  Maybe if you used the lint, then you could at least move up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the women finished cleaning up the entire floor, it was finally spotless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work, girls!!  You see what obedience brings.  Excellent results!!\"  She shook her hand back and forth, wiping a little of the dust away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I go looking for the bug, now!!\" Oliva said super excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, honey!!  You girls can keep looking without me, though.  I'm a little tired and want to take a nap later.  Don't even wake me, if you find the bug!!  Just take care of it. . okay!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls smiled, laughed, and nodded their heads.  Chelsea began whispering something to Olivia.  While Martha couldn't exactly make it out, she got the jist of it.  They were planning on keeping you alive, but torturing you for awhile first before killing you, instead of just killing you like she had wanted them to do.  Martha got a big smile on her face.  That was so like her daughters.  Thinking outside of the box instead of limiting their potential.  It made her really proud.  Although, she had planned to actually torture you while she was in her room, then dispose of you. . maybe she could 'hide' you in a place where her daughters could do it instead.  Sort of a reward for being so good.  She thought it over a bit before deciding. . . </span></div></div>",

On the one hand, her kids had been good. .  but they had also argued and fought amongst each other when she asked them to clean up the mess that Olivia had made.  Although. . . it probably wasn't even her.  It was probably this little bug, stupidly trying to get out too early.  Perhaps, she had given the bug too much credit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he did make for an amusing distraction, that is all he was good for. . .a distraction.  Giving her daughters him to play with could get them too used to things like that.  How would they get into a good job or find a good husband if they were focused on torture.  Besides, she had planned to teach them all how to shrink people. . just like she had learned from her own mother, too.  It was just the way her family would be.  A true matriarchal society at its best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile on her face, she had made up her mind.  She would deal with the little one, herself.  Besides, she had brought him into this world, it was only fitting that she take him out.  She carefully opened the door to her bedroom, gave her searching children a wave, and entered into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you, you had been tumbling back and forth in your mother's breast pocket the entire time.  It was strange and frustrating to be smacked by the cloth and feeling the weight of her breasts mashing at you, over and over!!  You needed to get away from her, she was far too crazy for you to be able to reason with.  Yet know that she had found you, you were not sure you could.  You heard a door shut, your mother must have been in her bedroom, right now!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing the door, Martha found herself getting a bit excited.  There was something special about delivering a punishment, but whenever she had to deliver a 'fatal' punishment, it was always really great.  She remembered the first time it happened too.  She was 16 and her brother had gotten really terrible grades.  He had to completely repeat a grade.  Her own mother was furious, and as usually she shrank him down.  He pleaded and begged as she tortured him in all sorts of gruesome ways.  She only wish her mother had let her see.  Finally, she took him out and called for Martha to come to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, mom?\" She remembered so vividly asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother produced her own brother and told her that he was no longer apart of this family.  She handed him to her and told her that she knew what to do.  She remembers seeing him look up into her eyes, so small and helpless.  He was pleading, on his knees, hoping that she would spare him.  He looked really bruised, there were cuts on his body that looked like fingernails.  Also a big gash on his forehead that he was struggling to keep the blood from coming down.  He was worthless.  Her mother was so proud when she balled him into a fist and watched as his body exploded into blood and guts into her hand.  She didn't even bother to wipe it off. . in fact she liked looking at it.  She even licked some of his remains.  They tasted great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such fond memories\", Martha thought as she reached into her breast pocket and pulled out her own little son.  You fell down onto your knees and looked up at her with great fear and anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at you.</span></div></div>",

There was no good intent written on her face, and only a 'just' expression that she had.  You needed to find a way to get far far away from her, as she would brutalize you!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered one time, you had gotten in so much trouble at school, they they wanted you to clean up all the bathrooms in the school.  It was. . well, kinda your fault, as you did set the pipes to overload.  You didn't even know how they had found out, you had done a good job of covering your tracks.  You knew that your mother would be furious, and since she could shrink you. . that would be how she would punish you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she actually did, surprised you.  She told you to get into her car and together, the two of you marched to the school and to the principal.  Martha argued and argued with the principal, showing him that he had no evidence that it had been you, that he was using you as a scapegoat, and it was probably the faulty plumbing in the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never seen a man look so broken as the principal that day.  You got off, scot free.  As you both drove back together, you started to thank your mother before she cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no!! I know it was you!!  I just couldn't have you spending all that time at the school.  How else am I going to punish you for what you did!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed as your mother shrank you as she drove back home.  There, you endured one of the worst punishments in your life.  She taped you to the toilet paper roll and left you there.  Your entire family used you as toilet paper for the whole weekend.  The only water and food you got was from the feces and toilet water that you had been rubbed against.  Never had you felt so incredibly low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she snapped out of her trance.

Did I give you permission to do this?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tensed up, fear filling up your bones.  This was worse than when she actually did things.

She still wasn't certain if she would let you live, but the enjoyment that she got from torturing you was pure bliss.  The self righteousness, the knowledge that she was right and there was no one or thing that could challenge her or tell her otherwise was fantastic.  She had already won, she had always won.  This was it, though.  This was how she would totally break you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I want. . is for you to give me a simple footrub!!\" She said with a little smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat on your face, you knew this was a trick.  There had to be something more devious she wanted.  Some kind of. . messed up game she would play.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking you up and off of the table, she went over to her bed.  There, she laid down, her ass hanging upwards in the air, her feet curled so it would be easier for you to crawl on.

You weren't sure where she was going with this.  After sometime, you finally made it to the back part of her pants.  Slowly and carefully, you made your way on your mom's ass.  It was actually kind of hard.  You never realized how much in shape that she was in.  Moving a little more faster, not wanting to get caught up there, you made your way down her legs and towards her giant open feet.  She had already kicked off her shoes off the bed and her feet were waiting for you.  Waiting for that 'simple footrub' as she called it.  As you made your way onto the feet, the smell was really strong.  It covered every bit of breath that you had.  You coughed as you heard the giantess booming from her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rub it well!! If I don't feel you rubbing. . I'm just going to squish you!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to rub, but then. . another idea popped into your head.  What if you just . .. ran.  You were so small, you didn't think she could so easily get to you, right?  Just run off and try and live as a little tiny person.  It might be your only hope for survival.</span></div></div>",

You take a deep breath and venture out trying to block out the conversation as much as possible, but it is hard to ignore it all. By the time you were nearly in the kitchen, your heart sank at the new topic. \"So what are we going to do with the bug's bedroom now?\" Olivia's voice now clear as day, with more than a touch of eagerness to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Her room was originally an office room, so it was a little smaller than yours with no closet for all her clothes. On more than one occasion while being tortured by her in her room, you could see that she had piles of clean clothes, and were well acquainted with the fact she had a growing pile of dirty clothes. You were truly nothing to her now, she did not even try to fake any sympathy before, but now it hit you harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sorry Liv dear,\" your mother said with a little sympathy in her voice,\" but we need to wait at least a few months before we do anything. When the police come to investigate, we have to make it look like he ran away on his own accord. When the news and police die down enough we can make it look like we just started to move on, and then we will decide what to do.\" You mother could not help but sound cheerful, and even though you could not see it, you could tell there was a smirk on her face. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n     Your mother, the one who denounced you as even human, already had a plan with what to do next. You feel your heart beat race, as your chest tightens up until it feels empty. Still, you made your decision to move, and you have to continue. As you step into the vast kitchen you can see the four of them sitting at the smaller table with room for four, six if you cram. They were sitting relaxed, Rachel and your mother both sitting cross legged as they did when they were enjoying themselves. past them was the island where the family kept the pans and where the sink was. On the side facing the outside wall, there was the dishwasher and other cabinets where plates, silverware, and the like were located. The dishwasher had a small panel on the bottom that did not quit reach the floor, which would allow you one place to hide for the most part. The cabinets were almost always shut, but they too jutted off the floor, leaving a quarter inch wide, eight of an inch deep, gap between the floor and the rest of the cabinet frame. You could potentially hide under there with the only chance of being crushed if they saw you and got lucky with aiming a thin magazine or similarly thick and \"heavy\" object into the crevice. Your mind starts to wonder, as you recall that in one of those same cabinets, pesticides and other chemicals were located too, and you could only hope you did not have to experience what they would do to your diminutive form now that you were nothing but a pest in the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The refrigerator was on the adjoining wall, and that would be a great place to hide. There was ample room underneath, scraps always end up underneath, and with a little luck, it should be moist enough to drink from the underbelly of the gargantuan structure. It may be loud underneath, but the noise would be worth it for those luxuries. As with other structures, you do fear some insects are underneath. The house was far from dirty, unfortunately for you, but as with any structure, insects can and do get in from time to time, and what a perfect place for them to call home too. You can only tell by going there though, so now it was time to head over to see which of these locations would work best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As you start to cross the open floor, you pray that they pay no mind to you. \"Ew,\" Olivia says loudly as to get the attention from everyone, \"it is the giant bug!\" As your luck that day has it, your wish is not granted as you look up to see everyone eying you. You once again turn pale as you try to make a run for it faster than ever. Your fate depends on whether or not your full hour is granted, or if they decide to end it here and now. </span></div></div>",

The flakes of small dust gets pushed towards you as the smell from her feet wafts forward. No longer can you see any facial features below her eyes, as her breasts interfere. With her final step, she purposely lifts her foot a little higher and brings it down slowly, until she has it lined up directly in front of you.

Of course, if it wants to die, it could always stay in place.\" Your mother has given you a small blessing to go run, and not wanting to refuse the offering, you bolt forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aww to bad sweeties, looks like it wants to run away.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>{indent]You quickly make way towards your mother's door, hoping for some luck there to hide. While the door was shut, luck would have it that the gap between the bottom of the door and the floor was large enough for your insignificant girth to squeeze through. With no more than ten minutes left, you have to scramble to find a good spot to hide. Under furniture is once again an option, as is behind her laundry hamper. She did laundry just a couple days ago, so the odds of her doing more was slim. It would also be the safest from insects. Hiding between the wall and hamper would hide you well enough, without any waiting bug to snatch you as there may be under one of your tormentor's dressers or bed. If she does decide to do laundry it may be game over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Glancing towards her closet, it was evident that that would be of no use.  It was shut tight, and even if not, the chance of something living in there already far outweighed even under the dresser. That would be a one way ticket to death. Shuddering, it becomes real easy to see how everything can lead to death, and a new found appreciation for bugs develops. However, now is not the time to worry about that. Five minutes left, and you are still standing practically in the middle of the door way. Her room is so tidy that finding a good spot is that much harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The ticking of the clock in her room is spelling your doom unless you hide. The dresser is no good, it is too small and too easy to see all the nooks and crannies underneath if one of the giantesses used a flashlight. Under the bed though, even thoroughly looking would be hard with a flashlight. There could be insects still but with such a short amount of time left, you don't really stand a chance now anyways, under the bed you could at least stand some chance of getting out alive. So your choices quickly become clear. Hide behind the hamper, or hide under the bed.</span></div></div>",

The sound of the clock is now only defeated by the sound of your heart beating, seemingly at twice the speed of the clock. The bed grows ever larger as you advance. From your perspective, there is a fine layer of dust underneath, with only traces of destroyed cobwebs far in the horizon between the wall and her bed's legs. Underneath was mostly empty, with only a few odds and ends things. Most noticeably, your mother's spare blankets were kept in a plastic container underneath the middle of her bed. Some weights were by the foot of her bed, and her yoga mat was tucked behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Martha's top sheet hangs low, serving as a flowery curtain that minimizes the visible entrance to under her bed. The once fresh floral scent in her room was now failing to fully cover the dank smell emanating from underneath. While there was little dust, years of use have still laid to a smell being etched into the underside of the bed. A small draft from Martha's open window subtly moves the sheet while blowing the smell towards you. For you, the smell of salvation was welcome, as long as it was salvation for him. Within just a few steps of going under, large tremors and thunderous movements are heard from a great distance away. \"Times up, time to exterminate!\" Liv's booming yell was more than enough when paired with the sounds to drain all color from your skin, but also helped serve as motivation to run faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you go under the bed, the door opens wide and your oldest tormentor's feet come into view. Your mother kept her feet well groomed, keeping her nails paint fresh and unchipped. Her veins were more prominent now then in the past, but overall, they were still attractive, if you liked feet. For you, they were nothing but pain, and now they would mean death. You quickly find yourself next to the container now and try to squeeze yourself underneath the narrow curvature located near the bottom of the plastic container. You close your eyes and hope that she does not see you, if she looks at all. Her steps get closer and closer and you feel the need to look around. You hope to not see anything, and hope your mother does not see you either. </span></div></div>",

Your mother was already in her room, and it looked like she was looking for you. You saw her move towards the hamper, but did not see her bend down. You then saw her go to her closet. After standing for a minute there, she started to move off. Her steps were thunderous, and small debris, normally not visible to the naked eye would be pushed around. You hoped with all your might that she would not see you where you were. She seemed to be looking half-haphazardly, with little interest by the looks of it. It gave you enough time to catch your breath and to look around once again, this time with more attention to your current area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking down the narrow area where you were, towards the head of the bed, there was an object within the narrow gap created from the container. It was hard to make out its shape, but it seemed to be approaching. Within just a few seconds, the object grew in size, the shape more defined, and the threat more real. It was a creature with numerous legs, that was dark brown colored, nearly the same color as the floor. It was moving at a fast rate, a little faster than you could run yourself. All the color once again was drained as you knew that this was a house spider that saw you as its food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While your mother was not aware of where you were, this quarter inch monster knew exactly where you were, and was making a straight line towards you. Staying where you were was not an option, so you risk your chances and start running away. Unlucky for you, Martha's feet stop near the bed, as her arms and knees come down, allowing her large bosom to follow suit. The view of her mammaries was quickly overtaken but the most horrific sight yet. Her face came straight into view, with her eyes quickly focusing on the attention you and the spider are creating. Letting out a chuckle, you see her eyes widen and her mouth purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All she was doing was watching, watching as the spider slowly gained ground on you. You then realized Martha was not going to be your savior today. You really were nothing but a bug to her. How could she watch her own son be attacked by a giant spider was beyond you, but the rage you felt was almost as much as the despair you currently had with your situation. Either way, it was all over for you, this was the end, one way or another. </span></div></div>",

The smell of her perfume wafts towards you and overtakes the dank smell previous surrounding you. The smell is short lived, unlike the danger. The spider was closer yet, and shown no signs of tiring, unlike yourself. You were becoming more aware of the uneven ground caused from the cracks and stain on the wood. Tripping here and there, your progress was getting sloppier and sloppier as you got more tired. Panting you knew you did not have much longer before you could only make a stand. \"Girls come see something, amazing\" Martha calls out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What is it? Did you find the gross bug?!\" Liv seemed to be curious, probably because she did not want to stop looking if it was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not just me sweetie, so didn't a spider under my bed. It is chasing him now. Come watch before it is too late!\" Martha began to laugh a little in a most horrific manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It took no time for a cacophony of large steps to come towards you. Your mother was back in her spot, by the middle of the bed. Soon your youngest sister was next to her on the right, quickly finding where you were and cracking up with laughter. Rachel was next, getting down on the opposite side of Martha. Between running and watching the spider, you just made out Rachel lift her hand, most likely around your mother has Rachel's balance did not fault. You notice Liv shift in a similar manner and realize that they where embracing each other. They were also forming a wall around the area you were going to run to. Last to come in a slower pace was Chelsea, who took up a spot by the foot of the bed, next to Liv. All eyes were turn to you. Liv finished laughing and now was watching with a huge smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not one of the family members tried to help. They all were waiting for you to either fight back or to die. Their faces now making up the main view ahead of you, and the spider now close behind. You tried to run more, but you were running out of space to run. You looked back to see the spider now within ten meters away from you. You tried to run faster, but was foiled by a large, acrid gust of wind. Liv made one quick puff that sent you back right at the spider, which was hardly pushed back at all. \"Ahahaha! What a stupid bug. Should have been more careful you gross thing.\" Liv had no sympathy at all even at the end, to the point that she rushed to have you potentially die faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rachel and Olivia were both laughing hard as your mother and Chel watched on with total concentration. You tried to jump off and made a desperate attempt to fight back, but were quickly caught in its front legs, then bitten straight in the chest. It was only moments before your body was completely paralyzed. Unable to move, and unable to cry, all you could do is watch the spider wait for your insides to turn as your family peered on. \"How pathetic, we give this bug an hour and it dies right afterward,\" Rachel said between laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hope you at least make that spider happy bug, you barely did so for us, but who knows what you will bring to it.\" Your mother's final words to you were some of the last you heard. They hit just as deep as this venom did, and were far from the last things you would want to hear. The pain was excruciating and getting worse. It was not long before your vision blacked and your consciousness gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You were the last meal that spider had. Shortly after beginning to walk away from you, Chelsea snuffed out the life of the spider- an eye for an eye. Your hollow corpse was left there, no one cared enough for the bug that died to bury it. Your family would talk about it from time to time, but mostly just used the image to help get themselves off when horny. For them it was a great experience, for you it was nothing but the end.</i></span></div></div>",

The fright and salt from the sweat that stole its way into your mouth dried your tongue out. All the while, the spider has been coming closer and closer, paying no mind to the ever changing terrain caused by the aging wood and dust. For you, there are obstacles that cause you to stumble every now and then, allowing the spider to even quickly gain. All while this is happening, Martha watches on, seemingly without a care in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your former mother quietly watched until the spider was within ten yards at your size. At that point her breathing was a bit more rapid, and her cheeks were beginning to blush a little. In one foul swoop, she reached out, allowing her great hand to land directly on her pinky, with the rest of the hand standing like a large wall. The spider was crushed instantly underneath that colossal pinky, while you were soon brought forward by it and the rest of the large hand. When she got you out from under the bed, you thought she shown you mercy, and was going to save you, but no matter what you knew there was a price to this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Without much noise, she lobbed you by the edge of the middle of the bed. \"I saved you for now, you pathetic bug, now you must repay me,\" said Martha. \"You could not even go an hour without being in a lethal situation, dumb-ass <i>bug.</i> I thought even you would last longer than that, but seeing you at the mercy of that little spider that I killed so easily,\" Martha says while starting to show off the smeared insides of the once fierce monster that chased you. Closer and closer the digit came until it made contact with your body and knocked you onto your butt whilst sharing some of the remains with your body, causing you to shiver greatly out of disgust and trepidation. \"It goes to show how pathetic you are, even as the little gross insect you are,\" said Martha. \"That makes me just so, excited.\" Martha let her left hand go into her jeans and come back out with a layer of her vagina's love lubrication on it. Martha once again pokes you smearing on yet another disgusting layer of gunk, this time her juices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Martha laughs quietly. \"Girls you can stop looking, the bug is mine,\" said Martha loud enough for the other three to hear, which was responded with loud grunts of disapproval by Rachel and Liv. Martha turns around, filling your view with her jean-clad ass which bulged toward you enough to make it fill your vision predominately. Martha heads to the door while undoing her shirt and taking off her bra, allowing both to fall to the ground where they were taken off. As the door slams shut, Martha precedes to luck the door before turning around, her large breasts bouncing heavily with every move. As she turns around, she unceremoniously unzips her pants and pulls them, and her skimpy thong down. The thong stuck momentarily to her wet lips before pulling down revealing the gap already being created by her parted lips. Her finely trimmed pubic hair was lightly coated by the bottom, sticking closer to her body than the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now <i>bug</i> I expect you to please me. Make me orgasm or I will make sure I do. Your mother came close, allowing the new scent of pheromones fill your nostrils as she stood over your. You could barely see her eyes over her large breasts until she bent down to pick you up. As she grabbed you firmly, you felt every increase in g force as she waved her arm to adjust her position. When everything stopped, your stomach felt a little queasy and your head felt light. You found yourself next to one of your Mother's firm nipples. Her areola were larger than you though, seemingly taking up half the tip of her breasts. \"Stop staring and lick. Lick and squirm like your life depends on it,\" said Martha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You did what you were told without questioning it. You licked and lapped up the sweat, skin, and lint that was not noticeable at full size. All the while your ground was moving with every grab your former mother made around the breast. As you circled around, you saw the rest of her body, and you could see you were on the right mound. Her left hand was playing much rougher with her left breast than her right was before it started making its way down. You licked, jumped, thrust, and grabbed as violently as possible to make sure she felt you. All the while loud moans echoed from her giant mouth. Humid breath and spit came towards you as she bent slightly to watch your work. Even with her mouth open wide, her lips seemed to part a little bit, as if smiling. Her body flailed wildly from time to time as she began the throws of an orgasm. With a final large jerk up, Martha's breast threw you onto your mother's tummy, which was only beginning to show its age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Feeling proud for what you helped do, you look up at your panting captive. \"Who told you to stop you little bug. Your grades were horrible,\" said Martha, \"but you surely know women can and do have more than one orgasm in a row. Get back to work, or else.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I need help getting up there, your breasts are too large to climb.\" You had to yell as loud as you could so that you stood even a chance to be heard.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You want to talk back, are you that ungrateful that you won't find a way. Fine, be that way. You can join the spider then when I am through with your pathetic existence.\" Martha sounded serious, and though you tried to run away, you were quickly caught. You felt your body dwindle to just a quarter of an inch you guessed, probably the same size as the now dead spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your mother's body expanded greatly, now a single breast could take up all your sight if close enough, and could swallow you whole if she were to lift them up and slam them on you. Martha instead picked you up and put you in-between before starting to squeeze both her mounds together while moaning loudly. \"Oh god, yes. This is how it should be. Die pleasing m e you little bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The soft flesh could not crush you, it would form around you, but the pressure needed to crush your compact bones was too large for the soft mounds to get. You did not worry about being smothered as the pressure subsidized constantly before tightening again, allowing you to breath if timed right. It was just enough to make you realize you were under her control more than ever. You could hear her heartbeat racing quickly, and could actually feel it when her breasts were crushed together. <i>Thud, thud, thud, thud</i> nearly two thuds per second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly a giant finger came into your large shelter, plying you away. Large pressure was felt on your back now, as a wider digit crushed you from behind. Your insides were pressed tightly, your arms and legs refusing to listen to your desires to move, and stayed spread wide and towards your back. Martha brought you to her large open mouth and gave you a large lick. The taste receptors felt like sandpaper even with the thick coating of saliva she produced, which then stung the newly formed scratches. The scent of coffee covered you thanks to the saliva. Perhaps the only good thing that happened from all this was that the spider guts and crusty goo was now off thanks to her tongue cleaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Quickly you were brought down past her breasts, and was dragged on her stomach, over her large belly button, revealing the canyon it formed. You were passed into the pubic mound which  dried you much the same way the brushes at car washes dry off the passing vehicles. This dryness did not last long as you were soon pressed into your captives enlarged clitoris. An instant spike in sensation must have been the cause for Martha's large thrust upwards. \"Bye bye bug,\" was all Martha managed to say between loud and long moans of pleasure. The pressure increased exponentially as you were pressed against her large clit. Gagging on the tangy, sticky liquid that her vagina expelled while the pressure continued to increase made you wonder if you were going to drown to death, or get crushed to death. You accepted that this was the end and were just waiting to find out how. As far as deaths go you figured, it could have been better, this could have been the beautiful red-head who sat next to you in some of your classes, but dying from sex is far from the worst way. Your fear is short lived as the pressure caused you to soon black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Martha had crushed you against the clit as she began to squirt out her love juice from the most powerful orgasm she ever felt. After letting loose a large puddle, she regained control enough to see the crushed remains of you stuck to her finger. Popping it in her mouth and sucking on it, she savored the moment before swallowing you, allowing you to become part of her once again. What did not get absorbed was flushed away the next morning. Life went on minus one less bug in the family.</i></span></div></div>",

Running as fast as your feet can take you, it is not long before the white structure takes up your entire line of sight. The musky smell that emanates from the dirty clothes becomes more noticeable, but far from the least pleasant smell you have had the displeasure of knowing. Around the bin, the floor had micro abrasions caused by the bin's shifting every week. It becomes further evident at the cause when looking at the bottom of the plastic structure, which has countless wedges caused by scratches. There is a larger layer of dirt around the bin than anywhere else in the room that you can see. Craning your neck to look up, you can not see any clothes hanging out, which makes sense considering Martha's tendency for order. The basket itself had holes all around it to prevent dampness from collecting and causes a even more foul smell, so you were able to see where the pile was up to. Much to your relief, it was not even a quarter full, you had plenty of time before laundry would be done again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your running pays off as you make it to the goliath bin just in time as you quickly hear Liv's booming voice, albeit muffled and dulled by distance call out \"times up, time to exterminate!\" You turn pale at the thought of being found here, but try to hold it togetehr to find the optimum place to hide. The quakes started far away and were barely felt and were only audible by straining your hearing, but one set of the quake-producing feet was coming closer and closer. By this point in your life, you knew the way your former family walked, and you could tell that this was your mother walking towards you. Within just a few seconds, the door was pushed open and a great gust of wind pushed the debris by the door back into the air. Your hideout was set up so that you were near the middle of the basket against the wall, hidden in the dip of the bin. You were not able to see her as you were, but that meant she could not see you either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Judging by sound, you gathered that she did a quick survey of the room, making sure to check her closet, under the cabinet and dresser, and under her bed. At one point, the booms were tremendously loud, and her perfume and natural scent so strong, that you have no doubt she was checking by the bin. Looking through the tunnel the hamper made for you, you even saw at one point her hair come down followed by a glimpse at part of her left, beautiful, blue eye. Luckily for you, your hair blended in with the wood well enough that the poor view she did have would have never been enough to notice you. As she got up, the fruit scent of her shampoo charged in and tackled your olfactory sense, giving you a moment of tranquility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No little bug in my room girls,\" Martha said, \"I will let you three search more. Momma is tired from all the excitement, I think I will lay down for a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Martha went over and shut the door, locking it behind her. Large rustling came from her direction, followed by the thud of large articles crashing down to the ground. The distinct sound of clothes hitting the ground made you aware that your mother was undressing. Part of you wanted to check it out, while the socialized part was disgusted at the thought. As her jeans came off, the socialized part was quickly out-ruled by the savage side, which quickly took control and prompted you to crawl to the edge of your hideout which would not be discovered from her location by the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Martha was taking off her bra by the time you were able to see. Her breasts bounced out, celebrating their freedom as the bra made its way down to meet up with the other articles of clothing. Her nipples were swollen, which made you look down to see her thong-clad nether region. There was already a layer of liquid dampening the string covering Martha's swollen pussy. Keeping them on, the giantess turned around, giving you a view of her big buttocks, each fighting for more space in the middle. As she got into her bed, her breasts flopped upward as her ass-cheeks jiggled uncontrollably. Not bothering to even get under the covers, Martha started to paw at her nether region and breasts. Loud moans escaped from her mouth as she continued on rigorously, bouncing up and down as she climaxed. It was only when she did so that you were able to see more than the tip of her breasts and her right hand. Panting hard, she had enough energy to go through yet another orgasm before she stopped, bringing her wet hand up and, from what you could gather from sounds, sucked it clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You could not control your urges and were masturbating to what you were experiencing. Even if this giantess was your mother, having someone masturbate in front of you without them knowing was just too much. As she finished her second earth-shattering orgasm, you are unable to hold back your own mini flood, and spill your seed on the ground in large piles. Panting your self, you lost track of your surroundings until the thud of your mothers very wet panties brought you back to reality. \"Oops,\" Martha said, \"guess my aim is not as good when tired, I will deal with that when I wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Letting out a small giggle, the large scraping of blankets on the bed made you guess your mother was finally underneath them, and was actually going to bed. You were unable to see anything now, besides for the thong your mother was wearing, which fell against the wall by the hamper. Martha's juices were covering the part that you could see, with thick lines of it connecting the top and bottom  of the front section. A couple smell hairs were lodged into the front area's fabric, which were submerged under the juice. Crawling out only a little more allowed you to touch it and if wanting to, climb into it. You had time, but if caught, you knew death awaited. You had to think about it for a minute, which was fine, as your mother was only beginning to sleep and would not be up for some time anyways.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     All at once, the four get up and in an instant, have you surrounded. You only made it halfway to the island, and now your route forward was blocked by the large, softly smelling feet of your mother, who had her hands at her hips, her face from her nose down blocked by her bosom. To your right, the left foot of Chelsea blocks your path as she looks down at you with her hands crossed on her chest. On your left, Rachel is crouched down, giving you a perfect view of her panties under her skirt. Her hands are propped on either side of her legs to not only give balance, but to swipe at you if you decide to run towards her, you assume at least. Feeling a warm breeze scented with the combination of faded mint and pungent chocolate you could tell Olivia is laying on her belly, her face looking right at you. The hour was not over, but already you were being surrounded, how is this fair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well look here,\" you mother says with grave discontent, \"you really are pathetic. We were being nice giving this,\" Martha looks at you and snidely replies, \"bug, an hour to live, but it was too lazy to try and do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Martha puts her hands on her chest much the way Chelsea is now and bends over more, giving you a full view of her upset face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Does this mean we get to <i>kill it</i> now mom! If so I vote we crush him with our fists.\" Olivia eagerly says this while suddenly pounding her fast onto the ground right next to you, causing you to fall while a stream of urine, too small to be truly noticeable by them, runs down your pant-leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Why not just step on <i>it</i> like any other gross bug?\" Rachel asks. \"I mean, why does it get special treatment? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You can't stand this. You were barely able to muster the energy to face Rachel, who in turn paid you no mind as she was too busy addressing Liv. LLike a true bug, you could not even speak, you were too frightened to do so. Your whole life became nothing more than a little it, with no meaning more than a moments enjoyment between the family around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Remember, what I said early,\" Chelsea loudly voices while not changing her pose at all, \"we can't just kill this bug, why not just let it go outside. Killing purposely is wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You feel a bit of hope as the words, albeit callously spoken, rang out of your former big-sister's mouth. Perhaps you will be saved after all. You were thinking about trying to leave the house earlier, maybe this time something will work out. As you finish these thoughts, you hear a revolting, throat clearing hack from behind you, and feel your once little sister's phlegm cover your entire body. You can hardly move and it takes the rest of your energy to strip the gross mass from your face. The three oldest females all let out a sound of disgust in unison as the smallest chuckles loudly behind you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n     \"Well now there is a mess where the bug is, so if we clean it and he happens to be squished, then it is an accident, right?\" Olivia sounded proud, having thought she outsmarted her elder of seven years. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n     Chelsea must have knew an argument against it, this logic was faulty at best, but Chelsea only produced a small shrug while starting to look away, giving you a glimpse of the side of her well toned butt in her curve-hugging jeans. She did not want to save you that badly, so now nobody was left defending you. Rachel shifted loudly as she went to stand up, but before she could take more than a step to the island, your mother was already heading there to get something. Rachel made her way back but was now starting to lay down. While you heard a ripping sound from your mother's direction, you were too busy watching Rachel bend down then lay down, showing a little cleavage before laying fully flat, waving her hand at you while sticking out her tongue quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You hear the loud steps coming from Martha again, and feel the small puffs of wind from the air displaced by her foot. The same soft smell emanates from her naked feet as she starts to bend down. Your sky grows dark as a thick sheet of paper towels starts to block off your sight of your mother, and the rest of your former-family. Olivia is laughing heavily at this as Rachel smiles wide. You turn your head in time to barely see your mother's thick, strong legs disappear behind the curtain that was the paper towel. There was very little light left, the giant hand above the sheet becoming hard to make out as the towel hit the floor in front of you first. Within a moment your world was black as the rest of the towel falls down onto the mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nYour life was ended in that moment. Your family did not even bother looking at your crushed remains, mashed up with the translucent green mucus of Olivia, as you were thrown away unceremoniously into the garbage with the other filth. Your family went out that night to celebrate the new family. Within a few weeks everything was back to normal, save for an increase in boredom around the house. Police came and went, as did any interest in your case. Such is the life of a bug, when one dies, the world does not always shed a tear.</i><br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Still, your family had done a lot of cruel things to you over the years, but never had they gone this far.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey really meant it this time. . they were going to . . to try and kill you!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to get out of here. . and now.  Enough was enough.  You had to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you started to make your way towards the front door.  Your mother had made a mistake making you this small.  On the one hand, getting help from the outside world would be really challenging.  On the other hand, you could get out through the crack in the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEscape was at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell down, face onto the ground as you felt the earth shake as a mighty goddess smashed into the ground.  But. . but they promised. . . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling over on your back you looked up to see your giant sister, Chelsea looking at you ominously.  With a smile on her face, she scanned the floor . .. looking for. . ah!! Her eyes grew wide as she found you on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you gave up already, have you, little bug!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer massive foot fall again shook the ground and caused you to roll a bit.  Such strength from just a simple task such as. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footfall was louder and more ominous this time.  She was. . .was getting really really. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAMM!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo feet slammed in between you, two giant pairs of tennis shoes, the tight rubbery feet smelled terrible.  You covered your nose, the scent assaulting your airways.  Coughing, you looked up. . . seeing your sister in all of her enormous glory!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you. . . oogling at me from below like a little pervert!!  When I left. . I felt like. . I had to come back!! Like. . God made me on this world to destroy you!! \u201d Chelsea said, her face very serious.  She was explaining it to you as if you were a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, she stomped her large shoes beside you, knocking you back onto the ground.  Raising your hand upward at her, you look up at her shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-wait. . \u201c you stutter out, fear filling your heart and mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea loomed over you, like a mighty titaness.  She didn't smile or look angry now.  More like she was studying you. . . scheming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever read the bible, little bug!?! Well, I already know that you haven\u2019t. . but I have!! You see. . when I say destroy, I don\u2019t mean just kill.  I mean, I need to purge you from this world.  I need to make you not exist anymore!!\u201d Chelsea said very calmly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, she put her big tennis shoes over your body, carefully putting a very tiny amount of weight on you.  Putting your hands against the rubber, you pushed with all of your might, in a vain attempt to try and get her to stop this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cp-p-please. . \u201c you whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeuteronomy 17:12\u201d Chelsea continued, \u201cAnyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the Lord your God must be put to death. Such evil must be purged. . \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as the weight began to slowly increase on your body . . . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd. . I AM YOUR GODDESS!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChelsea!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother\u2019s voice tore through the air and broke your sister\u2019s concentration.  Behind her, your mother had her hands on her sides as she looked at your sister with annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard what I said earlier! The bug gets an hour and then all bets are off!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea turned, her large feet only seconds from crushing your miniscule body into oblivion.  You were relieved now that they were off of you.  Your body was bruised though, from the very small impact that the shoes had made on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut. . \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo buts. . now go do something else!! We should let him realize his place!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister moved a little ways away, still looking at you just like she had earlier.  Those eyes filled with religious retribution.  Meanwhile, you tried to stand up, but fell back down as your mother began to move close to you too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOM!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOM!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow her large feet had totally encapsulated your view, filling up all sight from the sky.  It was a true terror to behold.  Your mother looked at you, a large smile on her face.  You remembered that smile, she used to give it you whenever you were hurt.  She\u2019d put a bandaid on you as a kid or washed a cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat world seemed far away now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer giant slender fingers came into view and gently lifted you up off the ground. . only for a second.  With her other hand, she massaged your body a little, rubbing off the dirt and grime from your sister\u2019s sneaker.  Then, like a person places down a small pet, she placed you back on the ground on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at your mother\u2019s eyes and at her face.  Her smile turned into a full on grin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, Chelsea, he\u2019s going to realize that he is far too small to do much of anything!!  Then. . .while he wastes an hour trying futilely to survive. . .we\u2019ll crush him into nothing!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were really small, but at that moment you felt even smaller.  You collapsed onto the floor, staring upward at your mother who was still bending down and looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee. . .he already knows his place is to die beneath our feet!! C\u2019mon!! Let\u2019s go relax for an hour!!  He\u2019ll still be here to squish then!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, your mother and Chelsea walked away, their large booming feet rocking you back and forth on the floor.  You watched them walk into the hallway, and you laid there and wondered what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Your terrifying giant maniac sister almost cheated and came to kill you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to push that all aside for now.  Feeling your legs and body, you realized that you were a bit bruised, from both Chelsea and your mother\u2019s \u2018help\u2019.  At such an incredibly small size, even simple interactions with you were quite painful towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the psychological factors, you decided to instead focus on what needed to be done.  Which for you, was to escape out that front door!!  Taking a deep breath, you began making your way from the living room towards the front door.  It was quite a walk.  You realized that it probably would take about 25 minutes to even get over there!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill. . .it had to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you made your way over towards the door to escape, you started to rack your brain with someone else who could possibly help you.  If you got outside, there was two ways that you could go.  The right house next door was where your Aunt Kelly lived.  Your Aunt Kelly was a mean and cruel woman.  Unlike your mother, your aunt indulged heavily in food and alcohol.  She would get drunk all the time and would kind of feel bad about herself due to her heavier weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew of your condition though, and in fact, had used you before too.  The few times that you had been over at her house (or basically kidnapped) she took out her feelings of inadequacy to her sister on you. . . causing you all sorts of physical and emotional scars.  It was quite troubling.  The only difference was that she wouldn't kill you.  She wasn't as violent as your mother.  On the contrary, she even went against your mother about some things.  If you could get her to see you and tell her what happened, she might help you out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back, your mother had a weird childhood.  No one, not your siblings or mother, talked much about your grandmother.  She was one of the ones that had helped your mother and aunt gain her shrinking powers in the first place.  More than likely, it was her that was responsible for their way of life, too.  You felt worse for their brother though.  Kelly and Martha had totally tormented your uncle when he was a kid.  The sad truth was that he never made it to adulthood.  You only found out this from a rumor from Liv.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never knew exactly what he did to deserve such a terrible shrunken death, but whatever it was, must have been bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again. . .perhaps it was as simple as yours.  Just something that had been put on him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime had flown as you had thought of the past.  You were finally in front of the giant door.  Moving over towards the cracks at the door, you tried to wedge yourself inside and out. . . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door had been ultra insulated!!  Strong rubber was all the way on the bottom part of that big door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking. . you had to decide what to do next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had come so far only to be rejected due to this. . . blockade.  There had to be.  . an area of weakness.  About 35 minutes had passed, more than half of your time.  If you didn't hurry, your giant executors would come and squish  you into nothing.  Feeling it carefully with your hands, you search for some kind of weakness.  If one of these rubber blockades could be pulled apart, or at the very least, stretched. . you might be able to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking your way up, you climbed up on the top of the rubber insulation, searching for a weakness.  Your weight could possibly be used to press downward onto the insulation, causing it to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I had to see it for myself!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned, shocked to hear another giant so early.  This \u2018hour\u2019 that they had given you was turning less and less into no time.  Reeling your head upward, you saw your giant sister, Rachel staring down at you.  With one hand on her hip, she leaned gently in your direction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChelsea said that you decided to just stay out in the open, but I couldn't believe it!! I thought. . .surely a little bug is smart enough to at least try and hide!! But no. . .we get the stupid bug!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel took a step into the front hallway towards the open door, knocking you down and onto the rubber.  Even without any shoes, Rachel\u2019s foot falls were enough to really have an impact on you up close.  You suspected your size had something to do with that too.  You bounced upward and back onto the rubber strip.  The crash hurt your head and body, but it also hurt something else.  Your fall made a hole in the insulation!!  Thank you, Rachel!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react, you fell backwards a bit more from another terrifying stomp.  Looking upward, you saw the giant face of your terrifying twin sister staring down upon you.  She cocked her head to one side, a large grin plastered on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you think you are going, buggy!?! You think that you can get outside and get help!! Ha!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel began to pace around you in a circle, her large bare feet ominously getting just slightly closer with each step.   Racing a mile a minute, your heart was beating so fast that you had to put your hand on your head.  Your blood pressure wasn't probably doing so good either with all of these close encounters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are far too small and stupid to be able to do anything out there, buggy boy!!  No, you\u2019d just get eaten or stepped on outside too!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. . your place is here, with your family!! In fact, you need to feed my hungry bare foot!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing careful not to accidentally crush you, Rachel brought her enormous left food super close to your minuscule body.  You could smell the sweat and funk coming from her giant foot.  It was horrifying.  Her toe pushed itself right at you too!!  Reacting instinctively, you reached out and hugged it with your hands and body, to prevent it from knocking you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!!! See!!! You two were made for each other!! It\u2019s love at first step!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel lifted her foot slightly in the air, bringing your little body with it.  Moving slowly to the left and right, she gave you a little \u2018foot ride\u2019 as you felt more and more dizzy just from the little movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be glad that your hour isn't up yet!! If I were Liv or Chelsea, they would have totally crushed you by now!!  I, on the other hand, believe in giving a person. . .or bug, a chance!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hard wham, Rachel launched you off of her foot and towards the wall.  Again, you hit the rubber insulation in a different spot.  It was good that you did, because a kick like that would have normally killed or totally immobilized you.  The rubber took most of the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t go dying too early, you little freak!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoom<br>\r\n<br>\r\nboom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched, on the floor, as Rachel walked away.  It was actually a good thing that it wasn't Liv pestering you.  You might need your mom\u2019s intervention to survive something like that.  Although, that wasn't entirely too good either.  Wiping off your forehead, you get yourself back up and start to look at that front door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking your body for serious injuries (just considerably more bruises) you make your way towards the now open insulation space.  Carefully you slide yourself down. . moving underneath the giant crack of the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it!!  You were finally free!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes grew wide as soon as you stepped out from underneath the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother door!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could you not have thought about this.  The entry door in front of the front door!!  It also had another insulator below!!  You had wasted so much time!! Your mother had been right.  45 minutes had passed, leaving you with a measly 15 minutes left!!  And out here, you would be a sitting duck.  Now what!?!?</span></div></div>",

You needed . . a new plan, a new. . hiding place.  Yeah, nothing too fancy just . . just something that was. . safe and stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving back under the door and towards your frightful house, you looked up at the crack you had crawled through.  Moving upward, you realized it would be a bit more difficult to actually go up through this hole in the insulator than it had to go down it.  Fudging around with it, you finally got up an through. . although you had now killed even more time!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much time did you have left? 7 minutes? Less?  And you were not even remotely close to anywhere to hide.  The front hallway towards the open door was spotless. . not even a bench or anything around to hide under.  It had taken you almost twenty minutes just to walk through all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere just wasn't any time left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking for a second, you could try hiding under the door. . only Rachel had saw that you had gone there.  That would be one of the first places they\u2019d look.  You\u2019d be stomped for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your mind, you could even see how it would be done.  It would be like it had been when you got caught about a year ago.  You remembered it was when you had snuck out to go see a party.  You snuck back in at around 3 in the morning, thinking yourself quite clever.  Only, your mother had been waiting for you when you got back!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoung man, where were you. . out so late!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, you saw your mother staring at you, her eyes filled with daggers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI. . uhh. . I w-w.was. . \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, your mother looked at you ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat isn't good enough, young man!! You know what I have to do to you, know. . . \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling totally helpless then, you threw yourself at your mother\u2019s feet, looking up at her with your arms outstretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no!! P-please. . d-don\u2019t do it to me!! N-not again!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a simple gesture, she began to shrink you, you felt your body getting smaller and smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take that tone with me, mister!! You're going to be my foot slave for an entire month!!  And after that. . your sisters will each get you for another month after that!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you dwindled away, you tried to think of an excuse, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-what about. . m-my education? Who will. . how will. . I learn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother only laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat could you learn as someone as useless as you are, anyway? Besides. . you haven\u2019t heard about homeschooling??  You\u2019ll be schooled quite well when we are done with you!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been such a nightmare.  Almost a year. . . tortured underneath their feet.  All this. . just to end it instantly.  You couldn't let it happen.  You had to. . to think of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the front door, you thought about returning there.  Maybe, Rachel wouldn't think to look for you there.  Besides, she had said it would be impossible for you to get underneath.  All you had to do was wait until someone went to get mail and open the entry door. . then escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you could always just try and make a rush for the living room.  Maybe you could sneak past your family as they searched around for you.  It would be far riskier, but hiding underneath the front door could prove almost immediately deadly.  You had about five minutes left. . you had to hurry!!!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew that you had focused your efforts there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was worse was that Chelsea and your mom also knew you were in that general area!!  Anywhere was a safe bet for disaster!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you had to leave this place, and do it as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting into a good run, not too strong and not too slow either, you made your way down the side of the wall, by where the wall finish was.  Your plan was simple, while walking around this thing, you might find some hole or area to hide in.  It was risky, considering any one of your family members could find you. . but it was your only hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBZZZTTTT!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud noisy bell went off in the distance, followed by a shrill of a young girl that you recognized.

BOOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOM!!  BOOM!!!  BOOOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMultiple sets of giant feet began to storm in this general direction.  It seemed the rumor wheel had been turning on the area that you were located at.  You watched carefully as Liv, Rachel, and Chelsea burst into view.  They had made a mad bolt over here too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No running, girls!! It's not like he can get away, anyway!!\" your heard your mother shout as she casually stepped into view, a soft smile on her face.  This was it, no playing around now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing hard, you moved yourself down the line. . carefully keeping yourself from being seen.  Looking upward, you saw that Rachel rushed for the door, looking carefully at the insulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was actually trying to get through the door!!\" Rachel said happily as she looked down on the ground carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel backed up, her hands on her face with awe when she noticed the hole that she had inadvertently helped you make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!! He found a hole!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea and Liv followed through, their eyes focused on the door and not you as there large bodies filled up the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think. . he got away?!?\" Liv spouted, sounding a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea smiled an arrogant smile and shook her head hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!! It's totally unlikely!! Even if he somehow did get his way through, he would probably only get stuck in between the entry door and the main one!! He is far too stupid to think this whole thing through!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped loudly as you saw them examining that area so closely.  If you had stayed there. . you would have been totally crushed by now!!  Moving quickly, you kept going forward towards the living area.  Your mother was still over there though.  If you rushed for it now, she might see you.  On the other hand, staying here and waiting for that might be a death sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat was pouring all over you as you tried to decide what to do now!!</span></div></div>",

Heck, even Liv had opened the door and was actually looking around the patio area to see if you had gotten out there.  Your other sisters stayed back though, far less optimistic at your success getting to that place.  They were right. . but you did not have to like it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big problem was that they would be here at your location, very very soon.  There really wasn't a lot you could do about it either.  It was bound to happen. . so your only hope was to get out of there and find some other kind of shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing in deeply, you started to make a mad dash out of the safety of your corner. . and towards the living room area.  Your plan was to get under a couch, wait things out til they got tired of looking. . then go back to the front door to try and escape.  You\u2019d probably have to get some food and a little water before you left. . but since Liv could be a messy eater at dinner, you were confident you could get a little bit of her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking straight ahead, the blue couches underpad was directly in front of you.  Escape was only a few feet. . . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAAAM!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as your body flew backwards as you were shaken from your general location and thrown back a little ways.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down, you knew who it was. . but you didn't want to believe that this was happening.  You didn't want to believe that you were trapped. . and had no where to go!!  Trembling, you brought your face up to see your giant mother Martha. . staring down upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everything you had done to try and escape, you had been caught!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother didn\u2019t say anything though.  She didn't comment or make any kind of derogatory remarks over how you had been so quickly found by her.  Instead, she chose to let actions speak louder than her words.  You were still on the hard linoleum and you were know pulling yourself backwards, slowly trying to inch your way away from the giant bare foot that had slammed right in front of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAAAM!!!!!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha\u2019s other foot slammed forward, now giving you a nice view of your mother\u2019s body looking down at you.  Your heart was beating so fast.  Not like this. . please, not like this!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha was quiet as she lifted her giant barefoot high into the air and slowly hovered it above your tiny insignificant body.  Silently, she began to lower it. Tears in your eyes, you watched the giant foot of the woman who had raised you coming down upon your small form.  You had seen this before, you had been underneath her foot before. . but never like this.  Never like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that you noticed, was the impact of her giant sole first hitting your body and sending shivers of terror down your spine.  Martha was very careful not to put a lot of pressure on you, yet.  She wanted you to feel and know exactly what it was that she was doing to you.  She didn't respond as you beat at her foot in a vain attempt to get her to stop doing this.  You barely felt her move, as she carefully held you in place with her mountainous plains of destruction.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nThere was no response from your mother, as she started to increase the weight of her foot, as you were reduced to an insignificant wreck of a human being as you sobbed, cried, and cursed. . beating the foot with your hands and legs.  You felt your body start to bruise and bleed as you hit at her. . hoping and pleading that maybe she would take some mercy on you!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess had no reaction as she felt small cracks under her foot, as your body began to buckle and shake from the overwhelming pressure of her sole. . slowly crushing the life out of her own son!!  Martha started to shiver a little bit, her mind getting very excited about the action that she was taking. . delivering the final justice to her terrible offspring.  She licked her lips a little, eyeing you closely in anticipation of what she was about to do.  If she was quiet, she could hear your screams of terror, feel the pain that she was doing to you psychologically and soon. . physically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than your loud noises emitting from you, your mom didn't say anything as her foot put all of her weight on you, exploding your body and internal organs. . staining both the floor and the bottom of your mom\u2019s sole.  As she felt the impact of your body exploding, your mother let off a soft moan as she felt you expire underneath her.  She closed her eyes and gently moved her feet back and forth, spreading your remains around her foot and all over the floor.  Moving her foot to the side, she looked down at the blood and guts that was once her son as they dripped down onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha cocked her head to the side, and a soft smile appeared on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I stepped on a bug, girls!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s going to realize that he is far too small to do much of anything!!  Then. . .while he wastes an hour trying futilely to survive. . .we\u2019ll crush him into nothing!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be so easy.  Just give them what they wanted.  Entertainment in the form of torturing and crippling you.  This had been how it was your entire life.  You were a plaything, a toy, an object to take out their wanton aggression.  There was no other way.  You remember when you were right beneath your sister Chelsea's feet, pleading and begging to be allowed to live.  The hopelessness and the sadness of being defeated as you heard her voice echoing through your head:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeuteronomy 17:12\u201d Chelsea continued, \u201cAnyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the Lord your God must be put to death. Such evil must be purged. . \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you were evil. . maybe your existence was for their pleasure.  You had never been very good at school, never really had that many friends, never gone out with a girl, and ,in fact, you'd never been too great at much of anything.  It was your lot in life.  Your family would taunt you, abuse you, rape your body with their feet and arms, destroy the essence of who you were by making you less than human.  It would be tiresome and bad but. . after all of that. . .it would be over.  You could finally rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you just laid here, you would in essence, let them win.  You would let them have dominion over you.  You knew that after you were crushed the only time they would mention you would be when they thought of how weak and helpless you were.  Here you were, trying to escape, trying to flee the situation.  Trying to find a way outside where you would struggle and eventually die by the elements, birds, or some lucky break would take your existence away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it.  Now, you would do what they didn't expect.  You would fight them!!  Already plans started to come into play on how you would do it.  You remember watching home alone and seeing the boy set all those traps for the robbers.  If you could do that. . but against your own family. . you could escape.  Not just temporarily escape, you would finally be free of them forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big problem was simple though. . how were you going to do this?  What kind of traps could you set that would be both good enough for your giant family members to fall for and painful enough to incapacitate them.  At this point, you knew that you would have to use lethal force.  They were trying to kill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back up and off of the floor, you looked around in the living room.  This room just didn't seem like a very good place to do anything.  Besides, there was not a lot of things you could do to influence the giants here.  Thinking carefully, your first idea is to use the bathroom.  If you could dump something electrical into water, you might be able to shock them. . but. . how would you even do that at such a tiny size?  It just didn't add up.  If this was going to work, you would need to go somewhere with more open space.</span></div></div>",

You wouldn't be defeated now.  You had this!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you dementedly made plans, you were unaware that you were being watched from behind.  Chelsea had come back, carefully watching you from afar.  She turned her head to make sure that her mother didn't see her peeping too.  She knew that she had said to let you have this time to herself, but she knew what she really was getting at.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf there is anyone who curses his father or his mother, he shall surely be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother, his bloodguiltiness is upon him.\u201d She whispered to herself.  One of her favorites.  Leviticus 20:9.  She knew that is what she meant when she talked about killing the silly tiny bug.  Yet, something was different about him.  With no hope or no escape, surely he would try and do something out of the ordinary.  She wasn't sure what, but she'd get to the bottom of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea practically jumped when she turned to see that Rachel was now looking right at her.  Giving Rachel dagger eyes, Rachel smirked and gave her a soft grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh. . I get it.  We are sneaking, huh? I can do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea ignored Rachel and kept watching the little bug make his way into the kitchen.  What was he expecting to do in there?  There was no way out. . unless. . he was planning to get out through the garage.  The outdoor area might be big enough for him to slip through . . .although he would definitely be eaten by bugs.  A fitting end, a bug eaten by the bugs. . but. . . wasn't it her duty to deliver the execution herself?  Or at least. . one of the family members should.  She had too, afterall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh. . Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea turned to see that Rachel was now wearing . . one of her hats.  She reached up and grabbed it from off of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me that, you clown.  Why must I deal with such ramblings!  Can't you see that I am trying to administer justice, here?  Why are we even here, if not to solve the mysteries of the universe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked at her and rolled her eyes.  Chelsea could be so high and mighty.  It was aggravating, but kind of funny to see her rationalize everything to her perspective.  Not that she disagreed with her that the bug should be punished but. . where was the fun in a quick or 'righteous' death?  Why couldn't the little bug have a long. . fear filled one instead.  Already her mind went to some. . dark places on that aspect.  She put her finger to her lip as Chelsea resumed her spying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. . oh now look what you have done, Rachel.  Where is he? Where is the bug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel turned around, looking back into the kitchen.  She couldn't see the bug anywhere.  Where had he gone??  Usually he tried to hide all the time, but in very obvious places.  It was unlike him too. . . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLANG!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sisters turned their attention over to one of the counters that was lower to the ground.  They looked at each other with a quick smile.  There he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chelsea. . you think. . you think we should go. . get a closer look? I mean. . we would have to be quiet. . we wouldn't want mom to see us cheating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea turned and with a smile quoted from Matthew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not throw your pearls before swine, or they will trample them under their feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel made an angry face and put her hands on her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea, are you calling me a pig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea laughed as she pointed towards the kitchen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Rachel, I'm saying that maybe. . you should trample something under your feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sisters creeped forward, looking for their tiny bug brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think you are implying I am a pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea just smiled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________________________________________-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose simple giants. . they thought they were so smart.

Waiting and watching, you saw your two sisters storm into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh little buggy!!\" Rachel said cheerfully, in the hopes of terrorizing you, you suspected.

He must have gotten stuck and was moving around and about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, hiding below them as they went in the wrong direction.  Even at your miniscule size, you knew that shelf was always making noise.  There was a mouse or something living below that shelf, occasionally popping up for food now and again.  Part of you wanted to not attack just yet, in case the mouse did appear and scare your sisters, but if you waited til then. . they might see you instead.  You watched and waited, planning in your head the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the spot that the noise came from, you prepared to initiate your attack.  You needed to time it just right.  One simple mistake and the whole thing would be ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shouted at your sisters with much fury as you released the rubber band holding the small pin from its makeshift holding station.  All you had to do was get one of them in the eye, and they\u2019d be so focused on rushing to the hospital that they\u2019d leave you alone . . . giving you plenty of time to escape from their clutches.  Or, if you were feeling bold enough. . maybe set up more traps for their return.  It was bold, but what choice did you have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing the rubber band holding the pin, you watched the metallic item soar through the air, going right at Rachel\u2019s big face.  Your eyes soar with it as you see your attack in action.  Rachel turns toward the noise and sees the pin coming right at her.  Her expression doesn't change as the pin harmlessly falls to the ground, not even getting close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah!! Did the little bug. .  \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea nodded in agreement, pointing at the cupboard that you had been in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no, no, no!!  You launched it to early.  This. . this wasn\u2019t how. . no!!  Suddenly all the feelings of inadequacy and doubt filled your mind like a flood of water.   Rushing towards the back of the cupboard, you look for some kind of can or cans to climb, but they were all too high up.  It had taken you so long getting all the way up here.  Going anywhere else would be almost impossible!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOMM!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind, you heard the tremendous stomping of your two giant sisters!!  They were. .. they were going to get you for sure.  And. . and you didn't think they were going to wait the hour either.  Looking furiously, you tried to find some sort of escape.  Anything!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, little bug warrior!! Not so tough now, are you?!\u201d Rachel said into your cupboard, calmly peeking her face down behind you.  Turning around, you watched as your two big sisters stared at you intently.  You ran towards the back to an empty hole leading to the shelf below you when your Rachel's giant hand came crashing inside, just barely missing you.  Instead of going back in, she knocked a can into the hole, blocking any way down there!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to the sides, you went for another gap.  If they caught you, you would be done for!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's giant hand came slamming down in front of you, creating a wall of flesh that blocked your escape.  You looked up at it in wonder, shocked at how fast she was!!  The whole hand started to close, very slowly.  You screamed, getting up and moving back.  You knew that she could close her hand faster than that, the only reason she didn't was to toy with you instead!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole shelf you were on shock as Chelsea shook it with her hand, a smile briefly appearing on her face before returning to a neutral expression.  Moviing up her other hand towards you, Chelsea brought the pin you had launched at Rachel and slammed it into the ground in front of you!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you dropped something, little one!! Should I. . return it to you?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth fell and your feet rushed around. . looking for some kind of escape.  There. . there had to be something.  Some way out.  It couldn\u2019t. . it couldn\u2019t end, like this.  Looking around, you were totally surrounded.  There was just. . no where else to go!!  You looked up at your enormous sisters, waiting to see what they would do next. . . <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pulling you out carefully and quickly, you watch the cupboard disappear as you are whisked out.  Watching carefully, you see Chelsea smiling at you as Rachel brings you over towards the open kitchen counter.  What a disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that you should have this one, Rachel.\" Chelsea said with a knowing smile.  You knew too that whatever Rachel was planning wouldn't be pretty.  Not one bit!!  Picking you up a bit higher, Rachel placed you onto the counter and brought two seats toward it.  One for her and one for Chelsea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart was racing a mile a minute.  The end was nigh. . or worse, you\u2019d live but in terrible pain.  This was a bad idea, you should have just tried to run away.  You should have never let Chelsea and your mom goad you the way that you did.  Now, you\u2019d need a miracle to get out of this one!!  Looking from afar, you watched Chelsea silently hold the pin towards you. . but still quite a ways away.  She smiled as she looked casually at the small metallic device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really found a tiny pin, didn't you little bug?  You know. . these are used for sewing right?  That is why they are so tiny, so they can get into those . . .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke, she brought the tiny needle closer and closer to you.  The needle was indeed small, which was how you were able to use it the way you did anyway.  She moved it up and down, up and down, gently hovering it closer and closer to you..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c. . little places!!\u201d Chelsea said as she pushed the needle and gently touched your crotch area.  You screamed, which caused your sisters to giggle with delight as the metal just barely touched your body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. . no. . please!!\u201d You whimpered, hoping they were not going to do what you thought they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. . are you afraid of me?  Do you think that. .  I\u2019m going to do something bad to you?  I\u2019m hurt!\u201d Chelsea said with a fake look of sadness.  You were breathing kind of quickly and you turned to look at Rachel.  She didn\u2019t have any kind of expression at all, which kind of scared you more.  What was she thinking in that head of hers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the metal move itself up and towards your head, slowly rubbing the top part of your skull as you grasped towards it, afraid that Chelsea would push down too hard and smash you into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm. . it is funny.  Just moments ago you were so confident.  What were you planning to do to Rachel?  Were you . . were you planning on hurting her?  Even if you were successful in this. . travesty, do you really think that we weren\u2019t going to squish you anyway?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pin started to come down a little bit harder.  You were just screaming and crying the pain not too bad, but still highly affecting your psyche.  Suddenly, the pin pressure was taken off as Chelsea brought it up and into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww. . you sure got scared now, didn't you?  I told you that I wouldn't hurt you.  It is not my place.  Besides, you know what the good book says.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea placed the pin down and besides herself as she looked at you sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you do wrong, be afraid, for He does not bear the sword in vain.  For He is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God\u2019s wrath on the wrongdoer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched helplessly as Chelsea put the pin gently onto Rachel\u2019s soft hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRachel is the avenger, not me.  I\u2019ll let her take care of the rest.\u201d She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiled back, happy that they were both on the same page here.  The giantess avenger moved the needle up and down, far away from you as she looked at it twirl.  \"Now. . let me return this pin to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two doing, playing with that bug??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel and Chelsea turn towards the hallway to see Olivia and Martha staring them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mom, Olivia. . well. . we can explain.\" Rachel started, a little nervous at being caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea, again?  Didn't I tell you to give him an hour?  Why did you come back here again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea looked surprised for a second then regained her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I got what you were saying but you didn't see what this little pest tried to do to Rachel!!  He tried to throw this pin that he got at Rachel's face!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that true, Rachel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel shook her head yes, smiling down at your tiny fearful body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if that is the case. . \"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Would anyone be interested?\"  She began filling the kettle and getting the stove ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please.\"  Chelsea said, \"Earl Grey if we have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have hot chocolate?\" Olivia asked, stepping closer to see you over your sisters' shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, nah, I'll go grab coffee after I finish up here...\" Rachel smirked, turning her attention back to you, \"What's your opinion, bug?  How should I return your needle?  Maybe I'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's steady hand moved the needle closer to you, closer, closer, closer to your head until the fine point hovered just mere microns from your left eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...just relieve you of your sight.  After all, it'd be pretty great to watch you wander around blind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god Rachel, please, don't!\"  You cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, naaah, I want you to see what we do to you next.\"  Rachel moved the needle away slightly, moving it around to different parts of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about his ears?  Give him a piercing!\"  Olivia giggled, tugging on her own silver studs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?  You want a piercing like your big sisters', shrimp?\"  Rachel guided the needle closer to your head again, \"Naah, that's just too easy on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about his nethers?  He's a little old for it, but I've always wanted to hear a castrato in real life.  Those old recordings are just...ugh, so poorly kept.\" Chelsea wistfully looked off, lost in some daydream of 1902.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh, no, I don't want to touch his dick with a 9 foot pole, never mind a 9 millimeter needle.\" Rachel sneered, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew.\" Olivia stuck her tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be crude.\"  Your mother said, peering over from the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, how about this though, I'll still take something important from you.  You're a lefty, right?\" Rachel's lips tightened into a sadistic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel, please!  I'm begging you!\"  You yelled, although your voice was easily drowned out in the sound of the stove fire and water coming to a boil.  You looked towards your mother, and your other sisters, pleadingly, but no one seemed moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe needle's point came down gently on your left shoulder, the tip not yet drawing blood.  Rachel's other hand moved to your torso; her extended index finger pushed down on your chest to prevent you from squirming.  \"Ready, squirt?  After this you won't be able to use your arm anymore.  Want to do something with it before it's gone?\"  Rachel's tongue flicked over her teeth as her fingers gripped the needle with dexterity unmatched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel, no!\"  You screamed, now completely, and justifiably, terrified.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't think so!  Here it comes!\"  Rachel's eyes and grin widened like that of an uncaged beast as the slightest movement of her arm muscles plunged the needle into your awaiting joint.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour scream coincided perfectly with the squeal of the tea kettle.  You could no longer feel your left arm, but the blood that leaked from the wound, now with the needle removed, hardly felt warm to your body, a body which was quickly going into shock.  Your vision darkened and swam, and you were barely able to perceive Rachel sticking the backside of the needle into the still burning stove top.  Her hand quickly moved the now red-hot needle to your wound, a burning pain which released enough adrenaline to stop your body from shutting down completely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there, all nice and cauterized.  Now you won't bleed out on us.\"  Rachel smirked, \"Wouldn't want our favorite plaything to go bye-bye so quickly, right?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour laid on the table, soaking in your blood, sobbing uncontrollably and trying to move your dead arm to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're quite finished dear,\"  your mother started, apparently completely nonplussed by the brutalization of her once-upon-a-time son, \"Perhaps we can figure out what to do with this insect now that he's been given his dues?\"</span></div></div>",

You\u2019d start up the car in the garage and gas them.

Below that, was a pair of jean shorts, hugging her smooth bottom tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in awe as she gently turned and bent down, looking at you with a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing, my little bug brother?!?\u201d She said, as if asking a small child why he had drawn on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at her, stunned and angry.  Your first instinct was to shout at her with anger, but you stopped yourself. . your fear freezing you in place.  Your gargantuan sister looked at you with a soft knowing smile and cocked her head to one side in a teasing fashion.  She rubbed her hand through her soft messy hair as she looked down at you with a domineering grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you trying to run and hide in the kitchen?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending down, your physically fit sister reached down and gently grabbed you.  You tried to dodge her hand as the fingers enveloped all sight, but she was far too fast. . and you were far too small to put up much of a fight.  Casually, she walked over to the counter and put you down.  You were know eye level towards where her belly button was at.  Piercing your head up to eye her, you saw her giggle softly, her supply breasts shaking a bit at her motions.  Moving her hand up towards her chin, she gently rubbed her lips as she eyed you like a piece of meat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-liv. . . s-stop t-this. . \u201c you said fearfully, \u201cI-I s-still have. . s-some more time left!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia put her hand up to her ear, a goofy grin replacing her domineering smile from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?!? I can\u2019t quite make you out, little buggy!! You should really speak up!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she brought up her phone which had the time written on the front cover of her iPhone.  You were right!!  You still had. . . 15 minutes?  That would not have been enough time to do anything in the garage.  What were you thinking!!  That plan was far too complicated for someone of your size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-liv!! I-I w-want to . . to h-have all of-f my. . t-time!!\u201d  You shouted at her as she put her phone beside your little body, using it as a form of measurement.  After seeing how small you were, she moved the phone around and pointed it at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ca-Chink!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of light hit you as you saw that she took a picture of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, see?! If you had a little more self-confidence, a girl might actually like you!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned the phone around and showed you the picture she took.  Other than the fact that you looked annoyed, she took the picture in a way that if you showed it to someone else, they might think that it was just an average normal picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Liv let the phone fall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WHAM!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt slammed down beside you, almost crushing you!!  You were knocked over, just barely avoiding getting destroyed by her phone.  She was deadly serious about getting rid of you!!  You needed to do something and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-liv. . L-listen. . I. . I can help you!! I can. . I can do things for you. . chores!! Whatever you want!!\u201d You pleaded, fear filling your mind and body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiv put her hands together and looked at you, her smile fading into a more serious expression.  She looked down at you gently, a look that a scientist would make towards an experiment or something.  It was quite intimidating to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are such a tiny little bug!!  Did you know . . .that. .  a lot of bigger bugs could probably eat you up!?!  They\u2019d just bring you up to their mouth and. . . chomp!!  Is that what you want, little guy?!?

You cringed, your whole body tensing up in fear.  You knew what she was after and what she was thinking.  You looked up at her, your eyes swelling up with some tears as you waved at her, trying to get her to stop this madness!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t even acknowledge your attempts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall of her hand started to move towards you, as you rushed to flee from her torturous endeavor moving quickly across the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bam!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed into you, her wall of hands rolling you over like a snowball through the snow.  As you somersaulted over, you could hear Liv\u2019s laughter as she continued to torture you mercilessly.  With one final push, Liv slammed you over and towards her other open palm.  You fell onto it, coughing and gagging from pain.  It was like your sister had beaten you up and provided a \u2018bed\u2019 for you to rest on as you laid on her wide open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is always amazing to see how beaten up you get over the littlest things!!  It is so pathetic looking at you, but it is also in a way. . empowering!!  Whenever I feel sad or disappointed about something, I just think about how much of a loser you are!!  That always cheers me up!!\u201d Liv says soft and calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push yourself up on her palm and look up at her with disgust.  Time was running out!  You had to escape Olivia before your other family members showed up too.  Even though you would definitely try and get your family to realize that Liv had cheated, you knew that she might just lie about it or something.  She got her way more often than you, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you still lying on her palm, she brought her huge iPhone over towards you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ca-Chink!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of light soared around your battered body as Liv took another picture of you lying on the palm of her hand.

You knew that it would only be a matter of time before she took you out.  At this rate, she was draining you of all of your energy and will to even escape.  As you stared at her frightfully, she let out a terrifying laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stupid little thing. . you look a bit scared!!!  Don\u2019t be afraid. . I\u2019m not going to kill you. . .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her iPhone down back towards you again and reactivated the screen.  7 minutes left til your hour was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still have some time left, remember?!?  I\u2019m just going to. . tease you a little bit!!  I think that. . our relationship is good enough. . that I can tease you!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her phone down, she brought her gargantuan hand down towards you and started to gently fondle your little body.  It was done in such a soft sensual way, almost like a full body massage.  With her one hand as a bed and her other hand fondling you, you felt such a great feeling of arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was weird. . it felt so nice. . you started to feel a little excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like that, little buggy?!? I bet that no one has ever touched you like that before!!  Are you lonely?!?! Do you want someone to. . stick that tiny dick into?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat statement caused a surge of humiliation and sexual guilt at the fact that you were enjoying her finger rub.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached up weakly and tried to push her soft sensual finger away as she continued to molest your tiny body.  As she brought her finger down a bit lower, she gently rubbed your growing erection which caused you to moan in pain and pleasure at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww. . how cute. . the little bug is getting excited!! What would you even do with me, little bug?!? You\u2019d drown if you went in there!!\u201d Liv said vulgarly as she gestured down towards her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed at her with your weaker and weaker body as you felt yourself giving in to the intense pleasure that you were receiving.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were. . were getting close.  If . . if she kept doing this. . you were going to. . to. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to buck your hips against Liv\u2019s finger as you were seconds away from losing your load onto it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiv looked down at you sensually as she could feel you were close with your new action.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly. . the soft sensual finger started to get rougher and rougher right as you were about to go.  The pressure from her finger mashed down on you as the weight in her finger began to compress on you.  It was horrible!!  Your whole body was in pain as she started to crush you underneath her finger!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no, not like this!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-please. . \u201c you muttered as she began to mash away at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the pressure stopped as Liv\u2019s finger moved herself away.  The giant\u2019s face came down and looked at you, as she brought her phone over to you again.  4 minutes left. . she had almost gotten you off in 3 minutes!!  You felt so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeakly, you tried to get up and move off of her palm, but fell down face forward into her hand again.  Looking up, you saw Liv stifling a giggle.  Grabbing the phone again, she brought it down and close to you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ca-Chink!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you waited for the phone, your little sister let out a soft aww.  Without saying another word, she turned the phone towards you again.  You somehow looked even worse.  Your whole body had been mashed up and your clothes were totally ripped up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwwww, did a mean bully beat you up, my little bug brother?!? Do you need a little kiss to feel better?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, your sister moved the hand you were lying on backwards, dumping you down and onto the table.  You were surprised as you were expecting her to bring you up to her face and. . your thoughts were dropped as you saw your giant sister bending over towards you, her wet lips pursed as they. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>SLAMMMOOOCH!!!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed herself down on you, her weight almost crushing you completely.  The only thing saving you was that her lips were very soft and they compressed under your body\u2019s touch.   You screamed though, taking in a lot of your sister\u2019s spit as she gave you a long crushing kiss that mashed you hard and into the table.  Moving herself up just a little, you looked up and saw only her lips before you.  Everything else was too big for you to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww. . did you like that?!? Wait, what?!?! What was that?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not even know how to respond.  You hadn\u2019t said anything?!? What was she getting at?!? You watched as her enormous ear came into view.  You were far too weak to say anything, as you struggled just to take air in your weak form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? But I am your sister!!\u201d She said, the mock conversation between you and her continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell. . I guess since you are going to go anyway. . I could do that!!  But you can\u2019t tell anyone that I French kissed you!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and stood at full height, rubbing you again like she had gently before.  With a soft whisper, she said one final thing as she brought her head down towards you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be our little secret!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched with horror as her enormous lips came down on you a second time!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>SLAMMMOOOCH!!!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Again, the lips came down again, only now her lips opened up and her tongue started to mash you back and forth between her two lip folds as gallons of spit poured about and around you.  There was no air, so you struggled to find anything to breathe as you felt yourself being drowned by this enormous \u2018french kiss\u2019.  She accidentally pushed you inside of her giant mouth and you finally were able to take in a breath of her \u2018air\u2019.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow inside of her mouth, she started to vigorously mash you against her cheeks and lower mouth.  Your body was in so much pain and you needed real air really badly.  She needed to stop this at once. . you didn\u2019t know how much more of this your body would be able to take!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Whomp!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself suddenly being spit out and onto the counter as your sister, Liv brought herself back up again.  She looked at you and smiled.  Again, she brought her phone down towards you and took another picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ca-Chink!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so tired that when she tried to show you the picture, your head stayed down the whole time.  You didn\u2019t even want to look at how bad you had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look too good!! You\u2019ve only gotten to first base and already you\u2019re spent?!?! How are you supposed to get the girl off too?!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lied there exhausted, you heard a loud set of sounds coming over.  Before you could even turn to look. . you already knew what it was.  As if she could read your thoughts, she showed you the time with a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour time was up!!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t stomp it out!!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom on the counter, you turned your body to look at the giants.  Your mom was wearing a soft but powerful looking full onesie.  It had came down a little way above her knees to give her a nice skirt looking appearance.  Above it was a decorative belt to complete the ensemble.  As she moved forward to begin the search, she moved away some of her long, blonde hair from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, mom!! That was the corniest joke I have ever heard!!\u201d Rachel said as she walked beside your mother.  She was wearing a school sweatshirt with a pair of blue short shorts.  Her hair was a bit of a mess and it looked like she had been sleeping for the last hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSin that if fully grown brings death! James 1:15!!\u201d Chelsea said matter of factly, her hand wagging in the air with superiority.  With a quick motion she rubbed her red hair as she moved her hand down her modest yet elegant blue dress.  It fit nicely, but not too nicely to show off to much of anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour family all stopped when they saw Liv in the kitchen, with you on the counter in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry everyone, I already found him!!  He didn\u2019t even hide!!  He was right out in the open in the kitchen!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at her with daggers filling your eyes.  You knew that she would lie. . and now she was trying to get your families permission to murder you!!  This was bullshit!!  You sat up to try and tell your family, but you were far too weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?!?\u201d your mother Martha said, her arms crossed against her body.  \u201cYou just. . found him.  That fast?!?  Why is he so beaten up, then?!? It looks like he has been tortured!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Liv could respond, Rachel moved a bit closer to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, look at the little bug!! He looks totally fucked up!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLanguage!!\u201d Martha corrected as Rachel put her hand over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean. . he looks. . totally . . messed up!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha shook her head in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked at you with a shocked look on her face.  She had been in agreement about getting rid of you but. . like this.  She wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to go this far now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. . maybe. . maybe we should just. . let this be his punishment!!  Instead of . . you know. . \u201c Rachel said softly.  You could tell she felt bad about this whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeuteronomy 7:2, Make no treaty with them, and show them no mercy!!\u201d Chelsea said smugly again.  \u201cI think we need to finish what must be done!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo. . right as the time ran out. . you came over here. . and found him. . and did all of this to him.  This fast?!?\u201d Martha said, her eyes slightly peeved at the realization of what Olivia had really don.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell. . I accidentally stepped on him when I came over here!! I was. . a bit eager!\u201d Liv said, trying to bullshit her way out of this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProverbs 12:22, Lying lips are abomination to the lord: but they that deal truly are his delight!  Liv shouldn\u2019t get him after this!!  Let me finish what God has demanded!!\u201d Chelsea said with righteous fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at your mom pleadingly, as she looked you right into the eyes.  She uncrossed her arms as she got closer to you, gently bringing her face down towards you.  You looked at her and awaited her verdict.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t think even if I gave him another hour that he\u2019d be able to move at this rate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother brought herself back up as she continued talking to the giants about your fate.<br>\r\n\u201cCould we. . could we just. . give him some time to recover then. . .  try this again?!?\u201d Rachel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she was \u2018helping\u2019 but even with that said doing this all a second time just seemed like worse torture.  You weakly tried to move away from all of this, but were still in too much pain from your attack by Liv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me have him, mom!! The righteous will be rewarded with prosperity, Proverbs 13:21!\u201d Chelsea requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. . . you sister really did a number on him!! And I know how each of you would deal with him!!  You\u2019d drag it out and torture him even more!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked away, a bit of blushing on her part, as she realized that even though she had defended you. . that is probably what she would do too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed, honey!! It is only natural to want to put a bug in its place!!  Well, here is what we are going to do!!  I\u2019m going to take him to my bedroom and get rid of him myself. . quickly. . not drag it out forever like you three would!! Then, Liv. . you are going to have to do some extra chores around the house!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut. . mom!! That isn\u2019t what he wants!! He told me what he wanted!! He wants me to eat him!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sisters and you looked at her shocked.  Everyone was silent for a second, before your mom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, that is. . that is just. . he would be . . well. . actually. . hmm. . . \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see the bells turning in your mom\u2019s head.  She was thinking about something. . hopefully something that would let you survive this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat. . that could work!  You\u2019ve definitely had him at your feet for awhile and you\u2019ve messed him up really good, so he probably will taste really bad!!  Okay, for your punishment, Liv, you have to eat your brother!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiv clapped her hand excitedly as she reached down to finish you off.  You screamed, realizing you were about to be a show for your family to watch.  As you were lifted in the air, the other girls started to complain to your mom next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now, this seems totally fair.  Besides, after everything Liv has done to that bug. . would you put that in your mouth?!? In fact, if any of you want to take Liv\u2019s punishment instead. . you can. . but you have to keep him in your mouth for a minute, swirl him around, then swallow him!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel and Chelsea looked away.  Your mother smiled satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, okay. . Liv, go ahead!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour whole body was twitching in fear.  This was it. . your sister was about to eat you!!  You watched as those giant lips came up again that had mashed and harmed you from earlier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye bye, little buggy!!\u201d Liv said as she started to lower you into her enormous cavern of a mouth!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed intensely, your mind wracked with fear!!  She was doing it!!  You felt your tiny body hit her tongue as she started to roll you back and forth like she had done before.  Only this time. . you knew you would never leave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. . only a minute left before you\u2019d die!!  She pushed and moved you all over, up towards the walls of her mouth, on the roof of her mouth, under her tongue!!  It was horrifying.  Not only that, but her spit was having an effect on your body.  Your clothes were now gone. . you were totally naked in your sister\u2019s mouth!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something changed.  Instead of her going all rough like before, her tongue got really gentle as you were pushed in the middle of it on the top of her giant warm tongue.  She started to reverberate it, slowly massaging you like she had done with her finger.  Again, you felt yourself get really relaxed and this time you didn\u2019t try to fight it.  Turning over, you started to hump against her big shaking tongue as it gave you a full body massage!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaaaahhh!\u201d You yelled in both terror and pleasure as you felt yourself cum all over her tongue.  Liv smiled a bit as she tasted the difference, realizing that she had gotten you off inside of her mouth. . and in only a minute at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. . go ahead honey!! You can swallow it now!!\u201d your mom said in a neutral tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiv nodded and pushed you back towards the edge of her throat.  It was dark, but Liv opened her mouth a little and as the light shown on the back of her throat you watched and screamed as you were thrown in the back of her throat!!  Falling down, you felt yourself sliding down her esophagus as all light went away!!  The walls of her esophagus pushed against you, thrusting you down into her waiting stomach.  Luckily for you, you passed out before hitting her stomach acids, your body melting away inside of Liv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all was said and done, your family went and picked up some food from a restaurant.  As punishment, Liv didn't get anything. . but she was satisfied already with the meal that she had gotten earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are we going to punish now?!\u201d Rachel said, a bit disappointed that she had no one else to torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, honey!!\u201d Martha said with a smile, \u201cThat neighbor boy has been getting into all kinds of mischief!!  He needs the hands of a woman to show him the errors of his ways!!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You couldn't see her face beyond her now titanic feet, but you could imagine her smirking face as she calculated a way to maximize your humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have put her fingers to her mouth, because what came next was the loudest whistle you'd ever heard.  It was followed by her booming voice saying \"Girls!  Come downstairs!  Mommy has a surprise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god, she's getting your sisters involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flurry of noise as Rachel and Olivia raced down the stairs.  You rolled over and peeked around your mothers heel to see their legs walk into the room.  Rachel's dirty socked toes landed not an inch from your head, and you immediately became immersed in their pungent odor.  From a small gap between the prodigious peds of your mother and sister you saw your oldest sister, Chelsea, walk into the room, her face obscured by whatever book she was absorbed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the surprise, mom?\"  Olivia asked, quite obviously excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what's going on?\"  Rachel asked as well, tapping her foot, an action which scared you into stiffness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\" Your mother retracted her feet and looked down. \"Your brother has done poorly in school again, so now he gets to be a little bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, you call that a surprise?  Even I could have told you that loser would screw up again.\"  Rachel laughed, \"So, where is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right down at your foot, dear.\" Your mother pointed you out, and four sets of eyes were suddenly upon you.  Even Chelsea looked away from her reading, a sudden hunger now in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel tapped you with her toe, no feat to her, but an action which left you a bit bruised.  \"Smell good, squirt?\"  She laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So so so, how are we gonna punish him this time?\"  Olivia nudged your mom.  \"Can I do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, maybe not.  I decided to make it more fun this time around.\"  Your mother started.  Your sisters were all ears.  \"Your itty-bitty brother is going to have some time to hide.  Then, whoever finds him first gets to keep him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, sounds fun.  I betcha I'll find him.\"  Rachel gave a quick competitive glance to your family before turning her eyes on you.  \"And then it'll be squish time.\"  She lifted her foot quickly, ready to stomp you out.  You screamed and scrambled away as quickly as you could.  Rachel laughed and set her foot down gently next to the other one.  \"Not yet, little brother.  But later.  Count on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fufufu, I can't wait to have my own little devotee.  I have so much to teach our little toy.\"  Chelsea laughed her distinctive laugh and pushed a lock of fire-red hair out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait Momma, how long do we get to keep him for?\" Olivia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well, grades that bad deserve some special punishment.  How about for a month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A month?!\"  Olivia cried out with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?!\"  You yelled, knowing that no one could hear you anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Your brother needs to learn the value of education.  Even if it was his last year in high school, he can't go to college with that attitude.  Whoever finds him gets to keep him for a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, hear that, bug?  You're going to get to smell my stinky toes for an entire month.\"  Rachel grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if he's under mine.\"  Olivia protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea just smiled to herself, giving you a devious look that shook you deeply.  What did she have planned?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, let's give your brother time to hide.\"  Your mother got up to walk towards the kitchen, quickly and deliberately stepping directly on your tiny form.  It was so unexpected and the shadow fell so fast, you didn't even have time to protect yourself.  You stuck flat to the ground, a dull pain oozing up from your chest.  The rest of the girls filed out of the room, back to whatever they were doing, taunting and teasing each other about who would get you and what they would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears were ringing after your mothers sudden stomp, but you could make out Olivia and Rachel debating how to really make you suffer.  Chelsea was unusually quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat yourself up and began to inspect your body.  \"Ugh, probably bruised my ribs.  That's gonna make it hard to move around.  Now where the hell should I hide?  Maybe I can at least get a few days of rest.\"  You said to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well you were scared to death but you had to out think them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time the signal was given to begin the hunt.  Your could hear your sister's immediately start to look for you.  You could see feet from under your hiding spot and you jump up and cling to the base of the couch trying to press your body flat against it.  Luckily she passes you by without checking under the couch.  You're breathing sounded loud to your ears though realistically it was almost impossible to hear you with you being so tiny.  Still the pounding of your heart made you jump with each foot fall anywhere near the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel said, \"Come on out bug.  I'm going to make you sleep in my sock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia replied, \"Oooh what a good idea, I'll have to try that.  Though maybe I'll put him in gym sneakers.

He will worship me like a God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suspected your sister's were giving Chelsea some strange looks but they stopped talking and started to search for you in earnest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill someone find you?  </span></div></div>",

She can be moody, and the stresses of her young life often get to her. This frustration is, unfortunately, channeled towards you, as you are one of the few things she has power over at her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOR<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel (18) Your twin, a few seconds younger, although she continually calls you 'little brother'. She is athletic, charismatic and strong-headed, with short, dirty blonde hair and brown eyes. She loves teasing you and getting under your skin, which often leads to an outburst from you, and then sanctioned punishment from your mother. In the spirit of sibling rivaly, she will also often challenge you to bets or games, though when she wins it always means torture for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Option </b>2 : <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea (21) Your oldest sister. She dyes her hair red, though it is naturally brown. She has freckles, hazel eyes, and a devious smile. She is a Religious Studies major at a local university, a subject with which she is deeply, perhaps even eccentrically, familiar. She often breaks into a lecture or monologue without thinking about it, and often uses her knowledge as a rationalization for the incredibly cruel acts she commits towards you.</span></div></div>",

Report cards came so you know what that means, you're mine for the whole weekend. And they came just intime because I have the perfect job for you.\" She brought you up to her room and began writing a note for your mom. \"Well I'm just gonna leave the note on the counter with the report cards for mom so she knows where we will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need to gain some popularity in school and track practice is this week. I was going to try out, but my insole is too worn out from my foot stench, she says happily wriggling her toes. So that's where you come in. You are going to be my insole for track practice, then me and the girls are going to have a sleepover as well. But we won't be going home so you will still be with me. And since Jenny's mom hates when people where shoes in the house I'll have to think of a place to put you while I'm there. Probably just in my panties or something just to spice things up. Well it's time to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs her shoes from the closet, you can already smell them from here. She places the first shoe on and is about to put on the second. \"I'm not going to wear socks because they will soak up the sweat instead of you, and I hate sweaty socks.\" She then places you face down in her shoe. Then taste and smell hit you like a truck. She then slides her greasy foot into the shoe, resting her toes right on your head to play with. She then packs her bag for the sleepover and begins to jog to track practice. Each step crushing you with her full weight and forcing you deeper into her sweaty, soaked shoe material.

The large racket behind you stops- all the girls are staring. They all know how bad these green-socked feet can get- and they all grin evilly, waiting for you.<br>\r\nYou fall to your knees, the horrid foot stench hits you like a speeding bus- and instantly weakens your muscles. The toes are scrunching the carpet and letting go- only freeing more foot odor at you. The air feels wet.<br>\r\nNow on your hands and knees, you are literally right in front of the disgusting monstrosities before you. They are much larger than any feet you've seen, even on adults, somehow. The toes move furiously, almost inviting.<br>\r\nAbove, you can see the girl's face, looking down with a devilish smile. She says one thing, \"get in, or else.\"<br>\r\nYou look back down, and you can see her toes raised high, and the crevice between her toes is exposed. She wants you to crawl underneath them!<br>\r\nYou know you must, anything else would be worse... but, you just feel unable to- like something will prevent you from sealing your stinky fate.</span></div></div>",

She immediately clasped her toes around you, encasing you in a rancid stink trap. Her nasty socks were old, ratty, and full of holes, one of the holes right above your head, which was plastered under her big and second toes, your nose trapped between them, letting you sniff the worse part of her rancid, reeking feet. The girl pushed her foot forward, shoving your body through the hole and into her sock before lifting her foot and tilting it forward, trapping you once again at her toes, your nose trapped between them. \"Sniff.\" commanded the girl. You took in a deep breath as she started wiggling her toes, wafting her horrendous stenchup your nose. \"Keep sniffing!\" commanded the girl before looking up. \"My feet are more sweaty and stink the most, I say I keep him.\" said the girl to the group. She looked over to your sister. \"if that's cool with you?\". \"cool\" replied your sister. The girl smiled. You were stuck there, taking breath after breath between her rancid toes, taking in her reeking stench as her toes continued to wiggle her toes, making the stench worse. \"This is no good\" said the girl as you sniffed her stinky toes. \"With all of these holes there's to much air, he can't truly suffer my stinky wrath.

Already you just barely could stay conscious and now she was going to put on her shoes too? Distraught you stopped sniffing for just a few seconds before the toes clasped around you powerfully, mashing you into their underside and crushing the breath out of your tortured lungs. \"Keep sniffing, do not stop until I tell you to\" Lea said matter of factly with the accompanying giggles from the other girls. You took quick shallow sniffs of her stink, not able to fully inflate your lungs in her crushing embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go\" you heard your sister Olivia say. Lea thanked her and took the cleats and tape. You felt her moving, putting the first of the shoes on and then your world spun around. You couldn't see anything other than the darkness underneath her toes, but you felt her pointing them downwards and into the shoe. Your world went black and Leas toes scrunched tightly as she proceeded to put the cleat on. Not able to breath at all, you felt entombed in the stinky flesh. Lea finally put her heel on and unclasped her toes, but they were still scrunched quite tight in the confines of the shoe. She then tied the laces on and to add to your misery, taped around the opening of the shoe to not let any of the stink out and any of the air in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was hell. You could barely inflate your chest at all to breath and the only \"air\" you were getting was a stinky mixture of stenches only getting more and more potent. The temperature was quickly rising and the oxygen in the shoe was getting more and more scarce. You hyperventilated and squirmed in total agony yet still somehow you kept sniffing the best you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels good on my toes, keep sniffing stink-pet\" said Lea.

The environment in the shoe became even worse, the heat skyrocketed and her foot started sweating. Gallons of stinky sweat pooled around you, getting into your eyes, your nose, burning your throat. You desperately gulped any kind of \"air\" you could, opening and closing your mouth wide in a fish-like motion. But you weren't getting any! You choked on the sweaty liquid dripping from Leas toes, and any \"air\" you got was becoming so hot and humid that it was virtually devoid of oxygen at this point. You were getting baked alive in Leas foot sweat!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body spasmed with all the strength it had left. \"Come on, die already, jeez!\" shouted Lea and you could barely hear the girls laughing in the distance. This was it! You knew you were going to die here beneath this cruel girl! You got still for a second and then twitched a couple more times. Then stopped. \"Finally! Now marinate in there stink-scum while we have fun!\" said Lea and somehow put even more weight on the cleat you were in. Darkness overtook you. You had no more thoughts, your brain slowly shutting down as your heart fluttered and then died.</span></div></div>",

Dodge the foot was one of Rachel's favorite twisted games, probably because it wasn't really even a game at all. It was basically just her toying with you for as long as she felt like. You pretty much, as the game was titled, had to dodge her foot as she tried to stomp you. The worst part about this \"game\" was there was absolutely no way for you to win as it pretty much just went on until Rachel felt like she was done. It was impossible for you to win. In fact, you weren't even sure how you could win considering there wasn't even a victory condition for you. It was just dodge the foot under you couldn't anymore. Rachel grinned wickedly down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Rachel, not dodge the foot! Please just let me go!\" You cried up as she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on twerp, I know how much you love this game!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last time you had been forced to play this game with Rachel, she had made you run until you collapsed from exhaustion before she stomped you. She then had tossed you into her running shoe and went for a 5 mile run with you suffering under her massive foot. Not only had you had to endure being repeatedly stomped as she ran, you then had to lick her feet clean and clean all the toejam out from between her toes before she trapped you in her running shoe with her sweaty socks for the night. You trembled as you thought of all this as she grinned down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since it's no fun just to play the game, we need to spice it up a little bit, how about a friendly wager?\" She smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah a friendly wager, nothing friendly about it you thought. \"Sure Rachel.\" You said. You didn't really have a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you win, I'll do your chores for, oh I don't know, a month.\" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could say she'd give you a million dollars, it didn't matter you had no way of beating her. \"If I win, oh how about,\" you saw her look at up at the ceiling as if she was in deep thought while she tapped her chin. God, you hated how she loved to mentally torture and terrorize you. Suddenly she looked back down at you and grinned, \"Oh I know! If I win, you're my new footstool!\" She said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared up at your towering twin sister, terrified of what awaited you. You thought about just not even running but taking away her fun would only lead to a punishment that would be much much worse than being her footstool, not that there was much worse when it came to Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we begin little bro, let me take off my sneakers. It's a hot one today and my feet are all stuffy in these shoes.\" She said as she moved her foot and placed her toe against the heel of her opposite sneaker. She was wearing white converse low cut sneakers, the kind pretty much every girl her age wore and just like every girl who wore them in warm weather, she was sockless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's tan feet with her pedicured nails painted a nice pink were soon free, having pried off her raunchy sneakers. You could smell her massive sweaty feet, a strong cheesy musky odor emanating from them making you gag. Her feet were reddened from all the walking she had been doing and you cringed as you thought about how sweaty and tacky her massive soles were. She wiggled her monstrous tan toes causing her strong sweaty smell between her toes to wash over you and make you gag once again. You looked up at her and saw her put her hands on her hips in a dominant pose. \"Reaaaaaady, Seeeeeettttt, Go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately turned and took off running. You heard Rachel's girlish giggles as you ran as hard as you could. You were suddenly cast in a shadow and looked up to see her massive reddened sole above you, sweaty and tacky from being in her sneaker. You screamed as it passed over head before BOOM it came slamming down directly in front of you, inches in your scale from you, knocking you off your feet as the floor shook. The sweaty cheesy odor hit you like a hammer. \"Oh! So close!\" Rachel chirped. \"I'm gonna get you bug!\" She sang as you began to run in a different direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't get far before, BOOM! Her massive tan foot slammed down in front of you. She laughed once again as you turned and ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter which way you ran, you always found your path blocked by the one of the massive sweaty feet of your giantess twin sister. Rachel giggled and stomped, loud booms ringing out every time she slammed her huge foot down shaking the floor. The whole time she was taunting and teasing you as she ran you ragged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were beginning to tire and we're moving slower and slower. Rachel's grin was getting bigger and bigger as each time you got up slower and moved slower out of the way of her feet. \"What's wrong bug? Tired? You better find a second wind or you're gonna be a little loser! Well, more of loser than you already are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she almost stomped you, knocking you off your feet, you lay still gasping for breath. \"What's wrong now? Don't tell me I tired you out already? It's been like, 5 minutes! You need to hit the gym more fatass.\" She taunted. \"So I guess you're giving up?\" She smirked and slowly began to raise her massive foot up over you. You saw her wiggle her monstrous toes as she held her foot over you, her sole sweaty and reddened and the strong cheesy sweaty wafting down to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot fell like a hammer, crushing and smothering you under her soft, hot sweaty flesh, the smell of her cheesy sweaty feet all around you. She shifted more of her weight to the foot you were under, her hot, sweaty flesh engulfing you as crushing pressure threatened to pop you beneath her mighty foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's tacky sole peeled off you leaving you covered in her foot sweat and gasping and gagging. She grinned down at you as you desperately gasped for breath.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Your family can shrink you.  It is a simple, but devistating fact.  Whether for punishment, or for sadistic pleasure, your mother and sisters can cause you to dwindle to approximately an inch, and are quite keen on tortuing you at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Cast-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia (14) Your younger sister, called Liv by most.  She has long brown hair, usually in a braid, and blue eyes.  She is a bit of a mess at the moment, strugling through puberty and about to start her first year of high school.  She can be moody, and the stresses of her young life often get to her.  This frustration is, unfortunately, channeled towards you, as you are one of the few things she has power over at her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel (18) Your twin, a few seconds younger, although she continually calls you 'little brother'.  She is athletic, charismatic and strong-headed, with short, dirty blonde hair and brown eyes.  She loves teasing you and getting under your skin, which often leads to an outburst from you, and then sanctioned punishment from your mother.  In the spirit of sibling rivaly, she will also often challenge you to bets or games, though when she wins it always means torture for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea (21) Your oldest sister.  She dyes her hair red, though it is naturally brown.  She has freckles, hazel eyes, and a devious smile.  She is a Religious Studies major at a local university, a subject with which she is deeply, perhaps even eccentrically, familiar.  She often breaks into a lecture or monologue without thinking about it, and often uses her knowledge as a rationalization for the incredibly cruel acts she commits towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha (40) Your mother.  Tall and thin, with long, straight blonde hair and hazel eyes.  A stern and strict housekeeper, she relishes in punishment.  While some of this discipline falls on your sisters, it is mostly directed at you.  Just as well, she enjoys incorporating your sisters into your punishments, which none of them object to.  Manipulative and patently unfair at times, you can't help but wonder what caused her to become the cruel woman she is.  It hardly matters, of course, as she is the matriarch, and as far as the household goes, her word is law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father has been absent for what part of your life has memory.  You often imagine your condition was shared through your shared genetic lineage.  You hoped, perhaps before your birth, maybe even before he was aware of it, your father escaped from this tortuous family.  But will you ever escape?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot if you're still everyone's favorite plaything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Rules-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">No male interaction, please.</span>  Forget that.  Make sure male character additions have a choice preempting them, though.<br>\r\nTry to write well, and don't break the second-person perspective.  <br>\r\nFeel free to add any sort of interaction so long as it makes sense.<br>\r\nNo choice chains.</td>",
