Agumon was walking down a particular street when he came across a new shop selling health-care products. A huge sign written in Japanese wason the roof and the door had a welcome mat just below it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, he walked into the shop. It was neat and tidy inside with clean white walls and glass shelves. Every item was in order. The shopkeeper, a slim-looking Veedramon, came up to Agumon and welcomed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning and welcome to my little health-shop. Since your my first customer, you can have a free item.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the offer, but I don't have anything in mind,\" said Agumon.</span></div></div>",

He went into his room just opposite Tai's and shut the door. He excitedly tore off the plastic wrapping and popped off the cap. He shook out a simgle silver pill from the inside and a small slip pf paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take one pill a day for instant growth,\" it said in small black letters. Agumon then swallowed the single pill in one gulp. Seiing that the pill would take some time to take effect, he decided to take a nap. Yawning, he lay down on his matress and soon fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 minutes into his nap, Agumon felt hot despite his air-conditioned bedroom. That was because of his changing physique, which took on a humanoid form, his bones cracking and reforming. His round belly flattened, and then six lumps raised up where the flab once sat and hardened into muscle. His small pecs and shoulders grew larger and tighter, bulging with hard muscle. His arms grew longer and bulkier as biceps the size of basketballs formed. His legs grew longer and stronger so as to accomodate the \"thunder-thighs\" and bulky calf muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the change grinded to a halt, a small stubble appeared on Agumon's chin as it grew into a dark brown goatee. He raised his arms subconsciously to reveal growing bushes of hair on his armpits. The foul stench slowly circulated the room and soon reached Agumon's nostrils, which woke him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering his snout, his body felt...different. He looked down and discovered he had muscles!</span></div></div>",

He flexed an arm and immediately, the muscle bulged bigger and a vein popped up along its surface. Agumon's eyes widened at the sight. He flexed the other arm and he got the same result. Agumon smiled, fully satisfied that the pill had done its job. He then put himself in different poses to make his muscles stand out more. He could see the tension lines in his pecs as he puffed out his chest and tensed his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted his massive arms and took a good look at his newly acquired body-hair and goatee. The smell was terrible at first but Agumon soon enjoyed the manly stench. \"Oh yeah!\" Agumon roared, his voice slightly deeper than before. A thought crossed his mind...</span></div></div>",

His shoulders grew wider and stretched larger to accomidate the expanding size of his lats as each individual muscle on his back started to bulge and swell bigger. His biceps stretched even more and his triceps began to take on the shape a horseshoe but three times the size. His thunder thighs started to grow into tree trunk thighs.

You definitely got yourself quite the build.\" said the Veedramon from behind the counter. \"Yeah, your stuff really works!\" he said while flexing his bicep. \"Do you have anymore stuff I can try?\" \"Of course!

Also, it was a variety pack which had a multitude of flavors as strawberry, orange, chocolate, etc. It sounded and looked very good for Agumon, and something that can really pack on more pounds of muscle than he has now for his quest of being a very strong mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before his growth, this attack was a small puff of fire but now it was a massive fireball which blazed through the darkness, lighting up some hidden torches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the cave lit up it was revealed to be a corridor carved out of the earth, with around 20 or so torches on the walls. It was obvious that the cave was inhabited at some point in time. Agumon walked down the corridor and noticed that the walls had some pictures hung up on them. They were etched brass plates, many with the image of a muscled Digimon in a different pose. The brass had tarnished over time so some of the Digimon's faces have faded away. Agumon had the feeling this place had something to do with, and could enhance his power. He smiled and flexed along to the pictures, growling with pride as his muscles bulged out further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having his fun flexing, he continued on and down a small flight of stairs to the end of the corridor where he was met with a 40 foot tall stone door decorated with two Digimon bodybuilders facing each other much like an ancient Egyptian carving. Agumon looked at it and thought about it. Perhaps he could tell others about it, on the other hand he thought that maybe he won't tell anyone else and see what's behind the door for himself....</span></div></div>",

Most everything in the store was health food, and like all others of the type, all looked bland and taste less. Then, he came across a row of things that looked interesting to him. There were two right next to each other. One was labeled, \"body swap powder\" which sounded interesting, but Agumon had no idea how that would work, but the store owner came over, and saw his inquisative look. \"Yeah, that's some special stuff right there. There a pill you take in the can that marks you as the owner of the powder, then you get someone else to eat the powder. It's relatively tasteless, so it's not hard to get someone to do it. After it gets in their system, their build will switch with yours. If your fat, and their skinny, then within a few days, you'll be skinny, and your body fat goes to them. It also works with muscles. Though, some of the people who tested it found that if they got someone to eat the whole can, they completely switched bodies, so be careful with it.\"  That sounded like it might be entertaining to Agumon. Heck, Davis had been getting pretty muscular lately to impress Kari, he could swap muscles with him. Heck, there were plenty of digimon with more muscle weight than him. \"Heck, I wonder what flamedramon would think if he suddenly lost his definition, or gained greymon's fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an appealing idea, but the other product was also looking good. It was a ray beam of all things. \"Oh yes\" chimed in the Veemon, his voice filling with pride at the opportunity to describe his product, \"this is a temporal thought changer.\" Agumon continues looking quizzical. \"Well, to put it simply, you point it at someone, and you change their attitude about their bodies, but you can do it through time, so, say, a friend of yours is skinny. You set this ray to ten years ago, and set it to fat, history will change so that throughout that entire time, they wanted to be fat, and bam! They're obese in the present, since the past has changed so that they always wanted to be heavy.\" Now Agumon was just stunned. He could change the past?! How is it this guy hadn't thought of using this ray for other things. \"Of course, you can always experiment and find new ways to do things to people.\" Agumon liked that idea, and he could use it on himself to be more muscular.

The dirt trail led him through twists and turns in which the expectation for the end of forest beyond each hopeful bend led him to disappointment. Persistent, Agumon trudged on, the thick trees and undergrowth still framing the path he had been traveling on since he entered these woods. His growling stomach lowered his determined optimism and, to distract himself, he began  examine the wild life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just occurred to Agumon that most of the plants of this forest were over sized and enlarged; the trees, as large as a big minivan for the smallest, appeared to be stuffed moderately over their limit and  vegetation looked at though they were filled with water. Agumon stared, bemused. He rarely seen plants as huge at these, seemingly overindulging in their nutrients to the near breaking point. Oddly, Agumon got the impression that if the plants consumed all their nutrients without fail for the rest of time, they would grow like balloons forever and never reach their exploding point, if they had one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinosaur Digimon then sensed a foreboding sensation that radiated from his surroundings and shuddered. This wasn't the usual dread that signaled the oncoming threat of a homicidal being, which confused and unnerved him. This feeling was like a group of mischievous individuals concocting a plot to play a childish and good natured prank on an unsuspecting victim who wouldn't hold their actions against them. For a moment, Agumon was curious if that smell was part of this and was on the verge to wait around to see what scheme he would fall for, when he shook himself to his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got to get out of here,\u201d muttered Agumon as he continued on the endless trail, \u201cWhy did I decide to take a walk here, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgumon's rumbling stomach grew louder, the increasing absence of something to eat sending his digestive organ in a great titter. His attempts to ignore it were soon becoming pointless and as the trudged on and on with no end in sight, Agumon wondered if his hunger was going to drive him crazy. He was briefly considering how much the trees and plants would fill him when a break in the forest on the path's side caught his sight. To slight disappointment, further investigation revealed the the grassy shores of a wide light blue river. The opposite bank was the spitting image of its counterpart and the river led to areas that Agumon felt no inclination to explore, but the water looked good enough to stave off his hunger for a couple of hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgumon rushed to the bank and dunked his maw into the water, reemerging a few seconds later to give a small howl of delight. The liquid was cool, clean and felt wonderful and the dinosaur was only too eager resume his long drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been thirty seconds before Agumon satisfied his thirst and he paused to sigh blissfully. That felt very good! That should keep his stomach busy long enough so he could find a way out of this forest. With nothing else but this goal in mind, he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was then he sighted something usual and to further exploration revealed...</span></div></div>",

He would normally have two helpings of a meal when it was available, though he had been known to have three when he was particularly hungry, like he was now.  This time when they brought out the food it looked liked it was in even greater portions.  He began shoveling them into his mouth and after polishing off a few plates he felt his stomach pushing against the table.  In fact he had to grab the food with the tips of his fingers.  Eventually his stumach grew too large for his claws to grab any food.  Fortunately, some of the other fat Agumon helped move the food onto his stomach for him to better reach it.<br>\r\n   It wasn't until he ate the last bite that he really tood a good look at himself.  \"Wow, this food is fattening.\" he thought to himself.  His stomach had grown to the size of a five foot boulder and about just as heavy.  It was too heavy for him to carry and the fat actually spread to his arms and legs, which had begun removing their once muscular details.  His behind had grown as well and made his stubby tail seem even smaller in comparison.  His face had even bloated out a bit.  He didn't know what to say, but \"Can I have some thirds.  Not a lot like before, just one plate.  And if you could try not to make it so fatterning.  I mean I'm just visiting right?\"<br>\r\n   The native Agumon began to look much less hospitable than they were moments ago.  Agumon had a feeling he said something he shouldn't have and was in for trouble.  He didn't want to hurt his new friends, but if they were going to attack him he'd have no choice.  The food came and the portions were bigger than ever.  \"Um, I said I not that hungry and could only...\" the fat Agumon moved in closer. \"a...\" closer still. \"little.\"  Agumon's voice was almost silent now.  The other Agumon were so close now that he could feel them breath all around him.  He had to get them to calm down so he began eating.  He finished the first plate and felt comfortably full.  They stepped back a little.  He looked at himself and felt even heavier then before all around.  His legs were starting to strain from the weight.  If he became to heavy to stand as Agumon he could always digivolve to Greymon.  He ate through the second plate slower than the last one.  He felt like he was going to burst.  The fat Agumon seemed less aggressive now, but he was in trouble.  His stomach was too far to reach his mouth now and he was worried was he was going to do.<br>\r\n   Suddenly a couple fat Agumon came over and put the food in his mouth.  He had to chew quickly and swallow as they wouldn't let up, in fact they moved faster and faster.  Soon he could only swallow whole to keep up.  He made it half  way past the fourth plate before his feet reached their limit.  He lost his balance and fell backwards.  After that he knew he was way to fat to get up.  His stomach blocked his view in front of his.  His arms and legs looked like fat tree branches, stiff and barely able to move at all.  His head was now just a bump on his massive torso.  He could hear footsteps, not one pair, but many.  All the fat Agumon were walking closer to him with food in hand.  The elder moved to stand next to him and answered his worried expression.  \"We are sorry if this is giving you pain, but as our prophits proclaimed.  One day an Agumon would come to us from the river and lead us to the land of Fatty Foods beyond our wildest dreams.  We believe you to be him.  Uh, and also somewhere along the lines of him being gargantuan beyond belief and as blubberous as they one could believe.  I know you didn't match the prophecy perfectly, but you do know, at least almost.  After a little feeding you'll be perfect.  Please don't be afraid it will all be over soon.<br>\r\n   Agumon was starting to think he'd better get out of here and get to DigiWeight Watchers fast.  He couldn't imagine what his friends would say and do to him except point and laugh.  He could probably get out of here as Greymon with ease.  Then another thought occurred.  The previous feeling of full in him was gone.  He could almost feel his stomach... rumbling in hunger?  He then felt fat hands massaging him.  He could only guess the Agumon were massaging him to help him digest the food faster.  Blubber was pouring on him by the second.  The food getting closer to him was starting to look delicious.  He had to make a decision fast.  Either get out of here before he was too hungry to digivolve or to give in to their prophecy and get fed to an even bigger size.</span></div></div>",

He chewed it only a little before swallowing and then he shouted \"MORE!!!\"<br>\r\n   His voice thundered and ended the initial shock he gave them and they began to bring more and more food to him.  The other Agumon massaged his massive paunch helping it to digest and fat continued swelling all around him.  His legs were consumed as his tail.  Some of the Agumon had to keep his ever-growing flab from convering over the rest of him.  Finally the village chief ordered all the Agumon to stop.  They all did except for Agumon who had a gut bigger than the huts now.  He finished all the food, but his gorge had him stuck on an eating rampage.

They began walking through with torches on the walls to give them light.<br>\r\n   \"What is this place?\" asked Agumon.<br>\r\n   \"This is the Agumon Shrine.

He was already licking his chops.  He was going to be pleased with what was coming up.   They made it to the end and found a huge shrine that seemed to go on forever.  In here Agumon felt small, despite his epic size.  Finally, the other Agumon appeared as if from nowhere.<br>\r\n   \"Let the feast begin!\" shouted the leader of the Agumon.<br>\r\n   The villagers cheer and Agumon's excitement peaked.  He wanted to eat, but then he realized there wasn't any food in sight.  He couldn't even smell any food.\"<br>\r\n   \"Uh, where's the food?\" he asked.<br>\r\n   \"Behold above, the vortex.  For within the Agumon have been preparing food for you from ours and other villagers near and far all for you our savior.  Now it is time for you to accept your duty and feast upon it all.  The first course as it was written is in soup.  Behold the first course.\"<br>\r\n   Suddenly, data poured from the vortex and transformed the a large portion of the area into an ocean.  However, when Agumon smelled the water it didn't smell of the beach, but of soup.  He wasn't sure what kind it was, but it smell delicious.  Not wanting to be a bad saviour and just stand there he ran up to the soup and began spooning it into his mouth.  It was delicious.  After a few minutes he looked up and saw he still had a long way to go, but wasn't any less hungry.  It just seemed tiring to be on his knees the whole time.  The chief Agumon came over to him and whispered some advice to him.  Agumon's stomach growled agreeance to the idea.  He took several steps back and then ran forward, jumped at the edge of the soup ocean and canonballed into the middle of the ocean.  It was deep even for him.  He began swimming and drinking up large amounts of the soup.  It wasn't long before he found chunks of fish, meat, and vegtables, big ones at that.  He spent some time clinging to them to take a breath of air and relax his arms from his big journey ahead.  After which, he would devour it and continue on.  The soup grew difficult as he filled with the broth and it weight him down, but the soup was too tastey to stop unil he finished it all.<br>\r\n   About two hours later the soup was gone and Agumon emerged back where the Agumon waited for him.  His gut was bulging with soup, as hardly any on if turned into fat.<br>\r\n   \"Uh, when's the next course going to come?\" asked Agumon.<br>\r\n   \"Momentarily.  First you must be relaxed and allow your body to turn each course into fat.  Now, begin with the massage.\"<br>\r\n   \"Dozens of Agumon began scrambling for the giant Agumon.  He laid on his back to make in easier for them as they climbed on his stomach.  They began rubbing his stomach and Agumon felt relaxed and closed his eyes in comfort.  As he relaxed the soup began to digest and turn into fat on his body.  First on his body and then on his arms and legs.  His face started to puff out a little and a bit on his tail.  After the soup was gone they all scrambled off Agumon and he rose.  He felt a little heavier and his footsteps made time  marks on his feet, and even a light thunderous sound.<br>\r\n   He looked up and saw more data pouring out.</span></div></div>",

His once muscular form was rounding out and his stubby tail was even stubbier.<br>\r\n   When the data took on solid form he was delighted to see it was one of his favorites, a mountain of fried chicken super sized times 10.  A drop of drool dripped from his mouth and caused a loud splash on the ground below.  He was about to walk over to grab it, but he had a better idea.  He sat down crossed legged.  \"That's quite a way to walk.  How about a few of my followers carry the pieces over here.\"<br>\r\n   The elder chuckled at his request and nodded.  \"Well, what are you all waiting for?  The Great Agumon is turning to skin and bones with every second he doesn't eat.  Move out.\"<br>\r\n   Groups three and four fat Agumon began carrying a piece of the massive chicken to Agumon who tore off large chunks.  They were made extra greasy and so <br>\r\nAgumon also guessed it mean extra fattening.  His suspicions were confirmed when he realized he was sitting on a pillow.  He looked around and saw his massive rump had swallowed his tail to the tip and ballooned out giving him a soft layer of fat to act as a cushion for him.<br>\r\n   The pile of chicken grew smaller as another pile of bones grew larger.  Agumon's massive body was growing with each piece of chicken.  He easily gained 200 lbs. from the greasy of the chicken, and his stomach was beyond his normal capacity of food.  Usually, he'd stop after eating so mcuh, but he loved chicken so much he pushed himself to eat.  His limbs were becoming thickened with fat making it hard to reach his mouth.<br>\r\n   The final piece came and ripped the chicken from the bone.  He chewed it up and swallowed.  When it hit his stomach he couldn't eat anymore if there was anymore food there.  He fell onto his back and landed with a loud crash.  The force was so great he left a crater in the ground.  His stomach was so full in front of him it appeared to be a big orange mountain.  He was so bloated he couldn't even more any part of his body.  Suddenly, he felt the food being drained from him as the Agumon began massaging him.  The fat spread around him with great speed.  His paunch had at least tripled.  He had gained a triple chin and he had a rounder, chubbier face.  His arms and legs were so thick with fat they covered his hands and feet to the tips of his claws.  His toes and fingers weren't even visable anymore save for his tumbs.<br>\r\n   When the Agumon finished he got up, but found he wasn't quite standing.  He was shocked to find his stomach reached beyond his toes and combined with his plump rump he found it was impossible to even waddle.  He tried to move his arms, but his body was too heavy to move.  He could barely turn his neck a little.<br>\r\n   He was worried what he'd do after the next meal came.  He couldn't even feed himself at this point and he was getting afraid of how fat they needed him.  He could've been a small island of fat on that soup ocean he had recently drank.  He knew he couldn't back out of this now, especially when he couldn't move.  Suddenly the next data stream came and something in his brain took control of him instantly.  His stomach rumbled so loud it shook the ground around him.  He had eaten so much and he felt hungrier than ever.  The chicken meal he had moments ago seemed like an apetizer now.</span></div></div>",

Despite devouring that mountain of fried chicken moments ago he felt like he hadn't eaten in days.<br>\r\nJust then one of the fat Agumon approached him \"Great one, perhaps you would care for a beverage to satisfy your thirst?\" <br>\r\nAgumon thought about this for a moment, it did sound tempting after all that soup and chicken \"Sounds good.\" he replied. <br>\r\nJust then another vortex opened up above him and data poured out of it, it then took the form of a long tube which snaked down and into his mouth. Seconds later a rumbling sound from above and then tube was filled with a clear sparkling liquid that flowed into Agumon's mouth and down into his gargantuan gut. Agumon's mind was covered in a euphoric like mist as he felt himself being filled with soda as if his stomach were a water balloon. His stomach was swelling with each second, blocking more of Agumon\u2019s view as it expanded.<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours the torrent of soda dried up and the tube in Agumon\u2019s mouth reverted back into data particles. The moment that it vanished Agumon let out a large earthshaking belch which resulted in several of the other fat digimon around him to fall on their behinds, the force of the releasing gas causing in his stomach to slosh and churn.  Agumon let out a groan as the fat Agumon got back to their feet and rushed over to massage his gut in preparations for the next phase, he tried to raise one of his arms to wipe his mouth and found that he couldn\u2019t. His stomach was now the size of a three story building, and his arms now hung uselessly at his sides far too heavy for him to lift up at the moment. <br>\r\nWhilst was going up the elder Agumon stood over to one side watching as events unfolded. He walked over to where Agumon lay as the others rubbed his ridiculously bloated gut, the liquid inside him transforming and adding several more layers of blubber to his body. He placed his hand on Agumon\u2019s belly. </span></div></div>",

This is making me hungrier and hungrier.\"  Indeed, his rumbling stomach was shaking the leaves on the nearby trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder simply smiled and looked to the sky where yet another vortex formed.  \"The prophecy tells of a course of fruit, specifically watermelon.\"  The rumbling in Agumon's belly grew much louder, and rocks chattered on the ground they laid on.  Watermelon was one of his favorites, and his gut was ready to be gorged.  \"And I can see you're ready to accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassive de-rinded wedges of the fruit digitized next to Agumon, who was helpless to get it himself.  The fat Agumon worked quickly, shuttling the pieces from one another and up the growing mountain of Agumon.  He relished the taste and the feeling of the cool liquid flowing deep within himself.  His gut began to churn with the delivery of so much fruit, grumbling and bubbling as he continued to eat.  Thanks to his love of watermelon, he stuffed himself much further than he normally would, and Agumon's belly groaned loudly with the increasing pressure on his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with an incredible collection of gurgles and moans, Agumon's sloshing belly could hold no more, having consumed the entire collection of watermelon slices.  His gut released a long whining sound, a plea for help.  Not even his swollen stomach could digest this much, and the fat Agumon scurried to its aid in digesting the syrupy fruit.  Thick burbling noises issued from him as the teams massaged his gurgling gut.  Agumon's head began to sink into the extra chins that had taken over his neck.  His legs had been virtually conquered by his increasing obesity.  But as the feeling of being greatly overfed subsided, Agumon could feel an intensifying hunger rushing to take its place.  Surely it was a product of his intense gluttony</span></div></div>",

The other end was raised high above his head.  Agumon tried to ask what this was for, but he couldn't speak.  The elder understood him anyone and explained.<br>\r\n   \"The funnel will help you to maximize consumption.

He grabbed it and munched it down in three quick bites.  No sooner did he swallow it did a second piece of bread seem to almost magically appear before him.  By now he was getting suspicious as to the true nature of the bread.  He ate the second one, taking only two bites to finish it off, not that it's size had changed or anything.  Sure enough it reappeared in front of him again.  He felt his hunger was swayed by what he had already eaten and concluded that the bread was up to something or at least whomever was the creator of the bread.  He decided to walk away and get the others to help investigate, but his feet weren't responding.  Instead of leaving to get the others they trudged him toward the next piece of bread.  His arms automanically reached down for it and moved the bread to his mouth.  He tried to keep it clamped shut, but his self control was no match for the tastey bread.  He managed to fit the whole thing in his mouth this time.  The taste seemed more overwhelming the more he resisted making it harder to resist.  Then finally he swallowed.  It landed with a thump in his stomach.  The lost battle had left him mentally exhausted, but his body was already going toward the next bread.  He devoured it before he could even try to struggle.  He continued eating the bread one by one.  In the brief moments he called for help few digimon came help him, though none succeeded.  Some ran in fear the moment they realized what was happening.  Others tried to pull him away, from the bread, but his body attacked them.  He was starting to wish he wasn't so strong as he sent all of them packing too.<br>\r\n   After the 50th or so bread he felt bloated.  In fact he was.  His stomach bulged out further than it had ever and it seemed some of the contents were draining into fat spreading all over his body, plumping him out.  It wasn't much, but if he didn't stop soon he'd probably burst.  But despite knowing the situation, there wasn't any actual pain.  He didn't have a stomach ache from eating too much.  He didn't feel full, though he wasn't hungry either.  It was like the bread was chocolate.  You can eat a lot and not feel full, but what was the purpose of this.  His answer finally came.<br>\r\n   Pixiemon came by and saw Agumon 's predicament.  \"Ate the forbidden bread didn't you?\"<br>\r\n   \"Yes, but I didn't know it was.  You'd think they'd put up warning signs or something like that.\"<br>\r\n   \"They do, but digimon usually are too hungry to notice before it's too late.  Eat two loaves and your hooked.\"<br>\r\n   \"Man, and I was suspicious after the first loaf.  I shouldn't have taken the risk.\"<br>\r\n   \"Don't beat yourself up.  This isn't a punishment, it's a trial.  It's called forbiddedn bread cause only the worthy may eat it.\"<br>\r\n   \"Uh, so what it the trial?\"<br>\r\n   \"You're already doing it, you just eat the forbidden food, and not just bread, but other foods, but forbidden.\"<br>\r\n   \"Right.... forbidden.  Uh, it this going to last long?  I mean this is like my 60th loaf and I'm already getting kind of fat.\"<br>\r\n   \"Well it's a good thing you're a big eater normally.  You fail the test if you lose mobility.  Since you're used to binges like these you should do better than some of the others.\"<br>\r\n   \"But I don't binge... at least not like this.  And what do you mean others?  How many others took this trial?\"<br>\r\n   \"Thousands.  Hey, it's really good bread.\"<br>\r\n   \"Ok, so how many passed?\"<br>\r\n   \"None, and they suffered the consequence.\"<br>\r\n   \"What consequence?\"<br>\r\n   \"Well, naturally, if you become immobile you fail and if you just wait for you to lose weight you'll just go back to eating.

To make matters worse, nothing seemed to be on TV at all which left Gabumon with nothing to do. \"Might as well go take a nap,\" Gabumon sighed, reaching for the remote to turn off the TV when an ad came on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling fat? Do you have that spare tire you can't get rid of? Is your stomach your personal air bag?\" the announcer asked, holding a small box in his hands, \"Well say good bye to those jelly rolls and say hello to a new, improved you!

A quick phone call later and Gabumon was now energetic with anticipation since the band would be coming by some super express mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 2 hours later, a small thud came from the front door and Gabumon rushed eagerly to get his package. After ripping the box open and removing the extra packaging, Gabumon held the Muscle Band in his paws briefly before putting it on. A sudden tingling began to occur in Gabumon's body, starting at the Muscle Band and spreading throughout his body. With the tingling came a wave of drowsiness so Gabumon went down for a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was sleeping...</span></div></div>",

He was laying on the gray wall of a small store, with aisles of swelled fruits and vegetables in their possession. The air, strangely grim and cheerful all at once, made Gabumon uncomfortable and he averted his eyes to the conveniently placed checkout counter. A cheerful Monodramon decked with a white hat and apron stood behind it and he waved encouragingly at Gabumon with a glint of mischief in his eyes. Apprehensive of that look as he was, Gabumon felt no choice but to join him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello stranger.\u201d the Monodramon said pleasantly, chuckling over his own greeting. \u201cWhat brings you here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabumon blinked confusedly. \u201cUm...I don't know. The last think I remember was going to sleep in the area I guard. How did I get here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonodramon's smile turned mischievous. Gabumon stared at him warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you bring me here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup!\u201d said Monodramon cheerfully. \u201dBusiness was sort of getting boring for a couple of days and I decided bring a customer in myself would lighten up the monotony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should have asked permission first before doing that,\u201d Gabumon said sternly, \u201cTaking someone when they are asleep doesn't leave a great impression on your customers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey generally don't come even when I ask.\u201d replied Monodramon vaguely. He waved at his selections. \u201cWant some fruit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabumon was about to say that he wouldn't buy anything from the person that kidnapped him, but upon inspecting the selections, he paused. Many of the selections were things of his taste and this fellow didn't seem too suspicious. Probably wanted to pull something harmless on him that would have both of them laughing in the end. With a shrug, he made a choice and was handed a watermelon-like melon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, oops. I don't haven't got any money.\u201d Gabumon discovered sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, that's no problem. In fact, that wasn't what I intended.\u201d Monodramon pointed his thumb backwards. \u201cI just want you to follow me to the back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabumon suddenly felt a wave of uncertainty. Following this odd Digimon to the back of a store where he had obvious control sent alarm bells ringing in his head. However, he couldn't pay for this product and he felt obligated to do something to make up for that. </span></div></div>",

Well, I hope you'll have fun with what I have in mind, but I'm sure as heck will have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's not dangerous. It might hurt a little at some point, it's most certainly pain-free.\" Seeing Gabumon still defensive, Monodramon sighed. \"Oh, c'mon stop being like that. Or don't. It's fun when I have a struggling victim and it's fun when I have a willing victim. It doesn't matter. So, straight to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I enjoy making Digimon fat. Whether they be just bodied hatchlings or appealing megas, I amuse myself with swelling them to impossible size and seeing how I can make this happen. Now, whether you like it or not (It doesn't matter to me), you are my next victim and you are going to make you fat. With that fruit your holding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabumon yelped and dropped the fruit. Monodramon happily dived for it, but Gabumon, recognizing his folly, quickly reseized it and dodged to the side. Monodramon turned to find Gabumon holding the melon like a weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you going to make me fat with this when I hold the cards?\" Gabumon asked. \"I can simply shove this in your moulth and watch you go and simply leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonodramon laughed. \"Oh please, I went through this before. YOu think if you simply make me the victim you can escape while I swell to immobility. There's no way out. That door has been designed to take an Ultimate's attacks and only I can know how to force it open. And you can't force the information from me. I enjoy most tortures and I have great pride in being tickled to beyond infinity. Besides,\" he added, grinning as he patted his basketball-sized gut, \"I enjoy being inflated. The person who once made me swallow every fattening food in this storeroom got squashed and I eventually had his way with them. The size he grew made that look like a pebble. And you...I'm considering making that barely a molecule compareed to how big you are going to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabumon stared, uncertain. Even if he stuffed Monodramon with the fruit, the punishment would be pointless if the recipitant enjoyed it and he would still be trapped until he was fattened. On the other hand, he told himself, he would be swelled to beyond immobile size and he would be abscent for weeks and his friends would be worried. What should he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe decision came for Gabumon in an instant.  </span></div></div>",

Monodramon just assumed that the other Digimon was desperate for his approval, which was why he was allowed to advance closer to the purple rookie. Suddenly, Gabumon snatched the fruit, gobbled it up, and grew heavier with a slight burst of fat. He dived for Monodramon, ready to incapacitate him in order to satisfy his craving, but the other rookie, alarmed but not surprised by the attack, seized another fruit from a nearby crate and squeezed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a squelching explosion and the two Digimon were sent flying apart in a burst of pin. They landed in an twenty foot area covered with a pink, ice cream-like substance, looking like they dived into an overlarge milkshake. Gabumon, his senses railed back in, sat up and shook his head, splatting the substance everywhere. He looked around and discovered Monodramon opposite of him in a similar physical state, though the way he was acting hinted that exploding fruit was a normal, even entertaining event for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...I love this stuff.\" the purple dragon said, licking around his face. He sent a grin in Gabumon's direction and said. \"I was kinda hoping you would do something like that. I always find an excuse to use the exploding milkshake watermelon. It was of those things I made that I really love being a victim of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Gabumon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonodramon's smile widened. \"You'll see.

Why don't you have a lick or too before the effects happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\" Monodramon repeated, and went back to licking everywhere the substance was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabumon stared at him and gave a tentative lick around his face. His eyes lit up. It WAS good! Gabumon began licking with more energy and would have cleaned the whole mess up if each half wasn't being slowly absorbed by both Digimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" he wondered, amazed as he watched the pink stuff disappear beneath his skin like a sponge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonodramon was wiggling in anticipation as the same happened to him. \"Ooh, this is gonna be good! I can't wait, I can't wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't wait for what?\" Gabumon asked, but any possible answer was cut off by an ominous....</span></div></div>",

He looked down to see his stomach bloating out, but not with more  rolls of fat, it was inflating like a balloon! Gabumon was starting to feel stressed, but Monodramon on the other hand, looked to be enjoying this. The Monodramon was growing a bit slower than Gabumon was, since Gabumon's skin took in more of the melon's juices. Gabumon's stomach continued to bloat out, then the other parts of his body started to as well. His legs and arms were starting to get blown up, when the hissing sound ceased and the inflation stopped. Most of his fat was gone, since his skin bloated up. His fur looked like it might drop off soon, looking almost too small for him.<br>\r\nGabumon sighed with relief, glad it was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonodramon, however, had different plans. While Gabumon was distracted, Monodramon grabbed more of the fruit, 5 of them to be exact, and shoved it into Gabumon's mouth. Gabumon got a bit of a shock, but with Monodramon clamping his mouth with his strong hands, Gabumon had to swallow the fruit one by one. When Monodramon let go after Gabumon was done, Gabumon coughed a little, \"Hey! Don't do that!\" Monodramon simply laughed at Gabumon, \"Pfft, I do what I want to my victims. Besides, if half of one fruit juices and absorbed instead of eaten can bloat you up THAT much (Gabumon took up nearly half the size of the room), then I HAVE to wonder how much FIVE of them, and eaten instead, could bloat you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabumon had a face of worry and anger and just as he was about to say something, the hissing sound returned, but louder than before. Gabumon gasped as he started inflating, more and more, at a faster rate. Monodramon laughed and quickly ran (or bounced, since he's kinda inflated) to the door, opened it and then went outside of the restaurant to wait and watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabumon was worried, but he couldn't help but think, that this actually felt really nice. Air inside his body, stretching and inflating his skin. Gabumon's fur soon fell out, as he felt his back reach the ceiling of the room. And then, BAM. The roof burst open as a giant yellow balloon continued growing. Monodramon smiled, and very simply bounced up to the inflating Gabumon, stuffed even MORE of the fruits in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabumon groaned as he was forced to swallow it. He started inflating even faster, the whole building nearly destroyed. However, Monodramon didn't really care too much about it, watching his victim grow like that was better. Monodramon started to rub and poke all around Gabumon's body. It had that rather tight feeling, something like a baseketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonodramon then proceeded to simply sitting on Gabumon's back, or what should be the back, since it's hard to tell. And casually said, \"Hm, well aren't you having fun? Because I am.\" But Gabumon didn't seem to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued growing, bigger and bigger, but he didn't float though. Apparently this air didn't work the same way as helium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the hissing sound has ceased, Gabumon was huge, as huge as...</span></div></div>",

His legs two now resembled large hams more than anything. Unfortunately, his new weight made it very hard to move. But he didn't care. He ran towards Monodramon and shoved him into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Gabumon,\" said Monodramon nervously \"lets not be rational huh.\" Even he was pretty big, Gabumon was now twice his size and this of course frightened him a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's this for rational, BLUE BLASTER!!\" Now this time intead of a small stream of fire, a huge horizontal pillar came out of Gabumon.

He shrank back to his original size by the end of the attack.<br>\r\n\"NNNNNNOOOOOO.\" yelled Monodramon as he slowly distentigrated into data \"Mark my words, I will come back and I WILL MAKE YOU FFFAAAATTTT!\" With that, Monodramon's data swirled in the air until it turned into a digi egg and was transported to the primary village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did it.\" yelled Gabumon leaping with joy. Just then a portal opened up where Monodramon had been and Matt leapt into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gabumon, buddy, I missed you so much.

His body blocked out the light from above the surface.  Hours passed until some of the digimon found the courage to get back up.  There was nothing in the ocean around them but other digimon.  It had been swept clean, but Gomamon was nowhere in sight.  They tried to figure out what happened.  Some thought he just ate himself, but that was hardly the case.<br>\r\n   In reality he was miles from there now.  At least twice and fat and big as before and probably three times as hungry.

It would burn at least and reduce half of his girth size, now over 600 feet long and 450 wide, if he used all of his might to pull himself half a mile to the mainland. <br>\r\nGomamon's whole middle section was noting but rolls of fat too numerous to count (or a huge furry belly if you want to think it that way). His front and back flippers were huge and suprisingly Gomamon's claws were not engulfed by his girth and were thick with fat. His neck was bloated with girth and jutted 6 feet out compared to his slim, original form. His cheecks were big as three beach balls and his face was blimped up like the rest of him. His tail would be big but because he was fattened so much, he couldn't turn his head much. His butt would also be enormous, too, like the rest of his body. He was suprised that he could even move his enourmous form and walk but make a mild tump everytime he took a step. Walking was a diffulculty, with his huge belly pressing against his legs, what sorta felt like being Ikkakumon (except much bigger). <br>\r\nSuddenly Gomamon had an urge for water. Seeing no other liquid except sea water, he said, \"Ah, at least sea water is something to derink!\", and threw himself into the ocean, making a huge wave. He gulped as much water as possible, but his bloated face kept him from swallowing more.When the whale was tired, he laid his back (his face was 1 foot underwater) and drank as much as he could. As he finished, his girth expanded to 800 feet long and 600 feet wide. (Is it beter to be fatter wide or more spherical shaped?) the water level had gone down a foot! He was full and still longed for a turm for the fatter but slept conquered him and fell asleep.<br>\r\nThe following mornining, Gomamon woke up and found out it was almost impossible to even walk!

In fact, only about 20 fish would fit into his mouth at once, and when it was full, he had to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, he was packing on tons and tons of blubber, adding more to his already massive body. At the end of his monstrous feast, he had grown to almost a kilometre long, and perhaps half as wide. The rocky outcrop of the cave was now only about half the size of his body, and that was how big he had grown from last time, and for a small seal like him, it was a great achievement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGomamon let out a deep, gargantuan belch of satisfaction after his feast, so loud that it could possibly be heard from a long distance away. He was enjoying every moment of being full, packed and massive. He floated on the surface of the ocean to rest and digest his rather filling meal, so that he would have the stomach to spare for another round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, in the middle of his rest, he heard a sound, something like the sound of crumbling rock. Out of surprise and curiosity, he swam down to the cave to check it out. To his surprise, he found that the cave had crumbled apart, due to a HUGE school of HUGE fish, now they were almost a 100 metres long each! It was then he realised that the wishing fish made the fish he ate scale with his size, so that he would enjoy eating them at any size he grew to, and even further increasing his gain! Gomamon then saw the confused fish heading toward him, and he happily thought to himself, \"I'm going to enjoy every moment of this.\" and opens his mouth really wide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens soon after?</span></div></div>",

It was then he quickly realized that the fish was too large for his maw to swallow normally. He had to try something else if he wants to gulp it down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Gomamon had an idea. With the fish still struggling in his maw, he slowly tilted his head so that gravity would assist him in downing it. Gomamon swallowed once, and the fish slid a little into his gullet. He was making progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, you can do it...\" went the wishing fish, motivating him to continue his swallowing. Gomamon swallowed as hard as he could, although his maw felt uncomfortable, he knew he could do it...eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen half the fish went down his gullet, he felt it easier to swallow on. Down went the gigantic fins, and he continued to swallow. Finally, when the tail was left sticking out of his stuffed maw, he opened and closed his mouth for the final gulp. \"GLOP!' went down the wishing fish, and a giant bulge was seen on his throat, where it disappeared into his belly.

He waddled for a short distance, (acutally longer than you think, due to his MASSIVE size,)  with the numerous layers of furry blubber on his belly and paws jiggling as he moved. You could even feel the earth shaking beneath you as he walked. \"Feels great to be mobile once again,\" says Gomamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I want my mouth to be able to stretch as far as I wish!\" His swollen, blubber packed face hindering his jaws was no longer restraining his maw from opening, so he opened it REALLY wide, and REALLY wide, that it could fit almost anything. \"Whoa, that's really wide.

Gomamon rolled and laid down on his back, petting and rubbing his gigantic, soft, furry and blubbery belly with his paws (and feeling a sort of comfort like he's never had all his life which is lying on a warm mass of blubber, and most notably, his very own), and said, \"Don't worry, my stomach - there's an even greater feast, coming right up, so be prepared!

The Digi-World, actually, if you put it more specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his body on its side until his expansive belly spread on the surface of the planet, he dunked his head into the ocean's water, and slurped it up. Whatever that was left in the ocean, be it rocks, seaweed, shipwrecks and junk, even including that pile of humongously large fish building up in the distance due to his previous wish, were all sucked in a swirling motion, much like a whirlpool, only larger, entered his mouth, travelled down his gullet and finally landing in his stomach, never to be seen again. Soon, he also drank the ocean and its contents dry, leaving nothing behind but small puddles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's just the soup down.\" Gomamon went. His belly had now swelled out slightly more, but he was still hungry. \"Next, the floating morsels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGomamon gulped the islands around him of the very earth, one by one, sending them down to meet his stomach. It was such a sight, with Gomamon stretching his mouth so ridiculously wide to fit the islands in. For some of the larger land masses, he would tear them off the surface of the earth, gulping them down like the Titanic sinking slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all the visible land masses were swept clean, Gomamon's body (the his blubbery mass, mostly) was now covering nearly the entire entire surface of the planet. He could feel the mass of the \"food\" that he had swallowed make a pulling feeling against his stomach. Along with that, he heard his stomach groan and gurgle, as it continued to stretch and stretch longer and larger to fit his next loads. \"Giving up yet? I don't think so, you seemed so confident! Good. Next up is the filling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at the now barren surface of the Digi-World. He then bent down, and sank his mouth into the mud, and started slurping down the section of the crust. He knew that if he kept going, he would reach the mantle of this planet, which is filled with delicously hot magma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was right. After boring a massive, deep hole in the crust of the planet, he could see the red-hot magma rising quickily towards him. Seeing this, he quickly stretched his maw over the massive hole, covering it entirely. Things were going according to what he wished for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the fiery hot magma shot up to his massive mouth, flowing down his gullet like a landslide, and, as with all things he had swallowed, into his stomach. The feeling was undescribable. He had a hot, warm and spicy feeling all over his body when the magma gushed in, and although his mouth began to hurt a little because of all that red-hot magma, he still held on, and continued to swallow the gushing magma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the magma chamber was emptied, he had a tingling, spicy aftertaste in his mouth. \"Wow...nice...but spicy...need something cool to wash it down...\" Gomamon went, gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moist mud around his was his answer. He immediately buried his head into the soft mud, and began to scoop it all up with, and into his mouth. As he did so, what was left of the crust slowly disappeared into his bulging, swollen stomach, now stuffed from what he ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this wasn't over yet. \"Now, that's exactly how the cookie crumbles!...Hey,is there anything I missed?\" Gomamon went, as he searched the black space around him, now visible because most of the planet was gone. Finally, he spotted a red sphere, which is actually the core. He propelled himself towards the glowing red ball, opened his maw wide, and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the warm feeling of the core moving along as it slid into his mouth, down his gullet and into his stomach, Gomamon felt successful and victorious. He had devoured the entire Digi-World, and within less than a day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGomamon felt very large and happy as he hugged his blubbery yet swollen belly, and murred to himself. \"Now this is the life. I've never felt this gigantic before...and I'm enjoying it. Plus, my stomach, you can now rest and digest my meal now. Have fun!\" His stomach groaned in unison, now full and satisfied, and backed down to begin digestion of its load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was enjoying his immense newfound size, right smack in the spot where the Digi-World was (which Gomamon conveniently replaced its very position), he saw the moon pass him by. Seeing this, his eyes widened. \"I've changed my mind. I'll have one last dessert before I finish my meal...a grey, bumpy, delicious ball!\" Gomamon spoke, in a confident tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe propelled himself towards the moon, and you can already guess what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the entire moon had finally entered his stomach, Gomamon was now a morbidly obese, white and purple spotted balloon, drifting about in the place where the planet used to be. You could still see some jagged marks on his belly, due to whatever islands he had swallowed earlier. Step aside, Digi-World, and make way for the planet-sized Gomamon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left out a soft, yet satisfied murr. \"Ahhh....now that was one big meal. I'm sure you enjoyed it as much as I did, my stomach! I feel full and content now, and you should be, as well!\" Gomamon said, as he closed his eyes, resting and letting his stomach digest...</span></div></div>",

The islands were the first to be digested, and they slowly sank into the putrid pools of acid within his stomach, never to be seen again, and then added on to his bulk. The magma he had swallowed had already solidified, and was also going through the same fate. The moon slowly met its fate as well, dissolving from a sphere of stone into nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGomamon was so tired, that he slept for two whole days before waking up again. When he woke up, his load had already finished digesting. Loads and loads of blubber were packed all over his body, belly, back, paws and all. Due to the air left behind in his stomach after digestion, his belly appeared to swell out a little, like a rutound ball. He was now the size of the Digi-World when it was still there, effectively taking its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving both huge, blubbery paws, he rubbed and patted his belly with satisfaction. \"I'm sure you enjoy it as much as I did, my stomach!\" Gomamon went. \"Mmm, this size is really comfortable, with blubber to cushion me wherever I go, and it keeps me warm and fuzzy...\" He let out a soft murr, but then felt a strong pressure welling up his throat. He let out a monstrous burp, which rumbled throughout his belly, vibrating the flabby mass of his blubbery body. After he had finished, the swell on his belly had diminished, but was still laden with layers of blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, that felt much better.\" Gomamon said. But he felt his stomach start to grumble again, signalling that he eat even more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting a little impatient, are we? Ah, but that was just an appetiser of sorts.

When he was just a few metres away from its flaming surface, its massive size dwarfed even Gomamon's blubbery body. He felt the intense heat on his face, and his entire body. Normally, anything else would have combusted upon reaching such a celestial body, but his blubber somewhat helped him to survive even this intense heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot...hot...\" Gomamon said, squinting his eyes as he stared at the fiery body in front of him. \"Ready up, Gomamon, and my stomach, the main course is coming right up!\" he went confidently, closed his eyes tight, his maw stetched open as wide as he could, and attempted his meal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very scorching feeling was felt in his mouth as his maw sank into the fiery Sun. It felt soft, as it was a giant ball of burning gas after all. He inhaled and swallowed the hot, burning gases down, where every swallow brought a yellow glowing swell down his gullet, much like water flowing through a hose, where they ended up in his stomach, still glowing. Gomamon could feel his gaping maw hurt intensely, but he continued gulping due to the warm fuzzy feeling that flowed along his throat, growing and collecting in his belly. \"Mmmm...this is so comfortable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gomamon slowly gulped down the sun, his belly swelled outwards like a swollen inflated balloon, growing bigger and bigger, while the sun started to shrink in size gradually, as more and more of its contents began to end up in Gomamon's hungry belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Sun had finally been swallowed whole by Gomamon, Gomamon's belly was so swollen, that he felt as if it was going to burst. But his stomach, being a rather competetive one, was not one to give way that easily, not to mention that his blubber was also helping Gomamon to contain it without burning a hole right through him. Right not, Gomamon's belly was glowing like a giant torchlight, and he felt all warm inside, as the swallowed ball of gas began to digest inside him. He let out a small puff of fire as he finished his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoosh...That was a rather spicy experience, there. I feel so warm...and I'm even glowing!\" he cried out in excitement. \"You did well again, my stomach.\" He said, as he patted and rubbed it once again, enjoying the warm feeling as the glow slowly faded, being extinguished by his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sun digested rather quickly, and as his belly reduced in size, his blubber began to expand out even further, to the about the size of the Sun he just ate. \"Mmm...it's over already?

He ate it too, but no soon had he swallow than another bigger one took it's place.  He kept eating the trail of fries seeing this as pointless until the next food up ahead was a burger.  Bigger than a fry, but still miniscule for a whale-to-be.  He turned his head to complain about the slow pace on his weight gain, but found him nowhere in sight.  He tried to think how many fries he had eaten and how far he had gone.  It was a dark cave, but he still should have seen him.

Patamon knew that TK would likely be visiting him soon, and he had immediatly decided that the only real option was lose his extra pudge by the time his friend returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatamon visited a number of gyms in the coming days, however none of them offered the immediate results he sought; until the last one. To Patamon's surprise it was this gym's grand opening, and as a promotion it was offering free one month memberships. Time was still Patamon's main issue, but he decided to try it nonetheless. It was moderatly crowded, but to Patamon's surprise he was speeded ahead of the others; apparently the staff recognized him as one of the heroes whom had saved them in the past.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was greeted by the staff members of the gym, a small angel digimon he did not recognize and the most muscular Greymon he had ever seen, whom politely welcomed him. Oddily enough the gym had none of the exercise machines of the others, instead it more resembled a supermarket filled with cans of some sort of drink. To Patamon's surprise this gym guaranteed immediate results with no effort! According to the angel the gym's \"program\" was simply to drink three cans of it's special formula a day, and watch the results! Apparently it altered the body's metabolism, so that rather than gaining weight, eating more would instead produce mass muscle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing seemed a bit too good to be true, yet the greymon insisted that it was how he attained his results, and finally Patamon decided he would give it a try. His month long membership gave an unlimited supply of the drink so Patamon took home a few cases. It was still early so he took his first drink right before having a rather large meal, and to his surprise he quickly found that his form had slimmed out in only these first few minutes. He repeated the process over the next two meals, and by the time he settled into bed he was looking almost as fit as the greymon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Patamon awoke he immediatly planned to down a drink; however he had trouble rising! A gasp of shock burst from Patamon's mouth as he glanced down, finding himself now at least three times as heavy as when he had started; his muscles had completely melted away! It took some effort but he finally managed to roll from his bed; far too bloated to fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

First, you can keep to diet for a while and see if things improve, if not come back, or you can go to the back room...\" At this point he gestured towards a blue door in the back of the gym. \"and we can remove the excess fat and get you back to normal.\" Patamon thought for a moment, maybe he would improve if he kept to it, or he could just try to get back to normal and hope TK didn't notice him being so out of shape.</span></div></div>",

Lucemon's eyes widened a bit as he realized he had an unwanted guest, and he finished his meal with a quick gulp. Pushing from the desk he extended his eight wings to hover. \"You weren't...\" His words were than interrupted by a light burp. \"supposed to come back here yet; though I must admit you look the tastiest of our customers.\" Patamon stepped back, staring up at the angel furiously. \"It was all a lie wasn't it?!

However Lucemon showed strength far beyond his size as he squirmed upward, locking his jaws firmly around Patamon's head. Patamon squirmed frantically as Lucemon lifted back up, taking a few licks of Patamon's chin to sample the flavor. Everything seemed over, when Patamon came up with an idea. He focused all of his energy on pulling back as he released his trademark attack. \"Boom Bubble!\" The force of the bubble blew Patamon free, however Lucemon was not phased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot, not only did the exercise help work off my last meal, but now I'm very glad you decided that you would rather be eaten than help me.\" Patamon was breathing hard as Lucemon spoke, but he nevertheless managed a reply. \"Don't... count me out just yet. So far we're pretty even!\" This response caused Lucemon to break into greater laughter, unable to continue for a moment. \"You obviously can't tell when someone is toying with you, combat is a wonderful tenderizer.\" Patamon prepared to muster another Boom Bubble when Lucemon simply opened his mouth and breathed in, a powerful wind generating from his lips and pulling Patamon towards him. It seemed impossible for a digimon to generate such a force, yet sure enough Patamon could not escape the vortex of Lucemon's maw. His only option was to bite into one of the desks, hoping his own mouth could keep him from being pulled in.</span></div></div>",

In a panic he spun around and fired off a boom bubble, unfortunatly it was simply sucked down Lucemon's throat. Patamon spun about in a frantic attack but they were of no use, and finally his head once more entered Lucemon's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatamon fired yet another bubble but this time Lucemon's grip was stronger, and he kept Patamon held firm. To his horror he could now hear the sounds of countless digimon, just beyond the black opening before him. Lucemon let Patamon stay in place a bit longer, savoring the flavor, before taking his first gulp. Patamon's head now entered Lucemon's throat, the sound growing louder, and the powerful muscles held him firm; he was unable to move his upperbody. However Patamon's huge belly was far larger than Lucemon's head and he hoped that it may be enough to save him from the angel's appetite, but his hopes sunk as Lucemon's next gulp sent his bulk halfway in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatamon was now in a situation very similer to the one of the Agumon he first saw, with his lowerbody extending from Lucemon's mouth. At this point Patamon could see partway into Lucemon's stomach, and to his shock there were at least twelve digimon within the boy's belly, and yet he seemed completely normal from the outside. Some of the digimon were staring at him but the vast majority were focused on other matters, probably searching for some method of escape. Despite his dispair Patamon couldn't help but laugh as Lucemon's tongue tickled his belly, moments before he slipped even further. Patamon did not want to hurt the other digimon but had no choice; he fired off rapid Boom Bubbles. The muscles of the throat were too strong however, and in a moment  the final slip was made.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucemon closed his mouth with satisfaction as his meal vanished into his belly, it truly was the best of the day. After giving his belly a few soft rubs he sat back to enjoy himself for a short while. Patamon meanwhile was trapped with the other pudgy digimon, desperate for a means of escape. A lot of air had entered with Lucemon's inhalation, however it was quickly being depleted by the countless digimon. In the end he collapsed, falling into unconciousness. Lucemon chuckled as he felt the last of the struggles fade away, and gave a last contented sigh. With his meals finished he hit the button nearby on the wall, signaling Biyomon to send in the next \"patient\".     </span></div></div>",

Yawning as she got up to walk across the room, she reflected on how dull everything had been over the past few days. Going from fighting the sources of the world's evil, to living the normal boring life of a house cat was quite the shift, and frankly she was bored. Sure, they went to the digital world all the time, but the days spent lazing around the house weren't her favorite. There were days like this when she though about getting a bit of romance in her life, like that would be able to give her a bit more excitement. \"It seemed to work out for Kari.\" Kari and TK had become an item recently, and they both seemed happier for it. Naturally, everyone assumed Gatomon would start seeing Patamon, but the two hadn't really talked about it. Patamon wasn't the type to advance on a girl, being shy about the whole issue. \"Not that much different than TK in that respect,\" she muttered to herself. Indeed, it was Kari that had asked TK out, and not the other way around. \"Well, If I wanted someone outgoing, I would have hooked up with Veemon a long time ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGatomon was in a bit of a dillema. She really did want to ask Patamon out, but, it was more important that he wanted to do it, and if she went after him, then he might just go on the date out of the pressure to say yes. Perhaps she just needed to be more impressive. \"If I looked a bit better, it might just get him to ask me,\" but what would accomplish that. Contemplating hard, the digimon walked over to the mirror, and looked herselve over. \"Well, I'm not very muscular. Maybe adding a few pounds would make me more attractive to him.\" It didn't sound like a great idea in her head, but why not? It's not like she was doing anything else today. \"Now, how can I get bulked up quickly?\" With a plan forming in her mind, she casually walked over to the answer to all of life's problems, the computer.</span></div></div>",

Kari had gotten her a new bed to sleep on and it was the best sleep she felt she ever had.  When she opened her eyes she was shocked to see the sun was so bright.  She knew it was way past seven when she usually awoke and looked for her alarm clock.  It was gone so she ran to the kitchen for the time.  It was past noon.  Kari was in school and figured she must have taken it before she left as part of her pampering.  She walked back into her room to make her bed and found that she had been left a bowl of cream.  Kairi must have left that for her too.  She gave it a lick and found it wasn't her normal low fat cream.  She looked at the bottle and found it was a very fatty brand.  It wasn't she didn't like it, but that she didn't want to drink this kind too often or she might put on pounds.  She walked back into the kitchen to find her usual brand and found only a few more bottles of the fattening cream.  Feeling defeat she went back to her room and lapped it all up.<br>\r\n   She was about to leave for her daily patrol.  She didn't intend to find anything, she just liked to get the exercise, but found a problem.  She tried opening the terrance door, but found it locked.  She tried unlocking it, but it wouldn't budge.  She tried the doors and all the windows, but she felt trapped and alone in the house.  She began panicking, feeling confined she jumped when the television turned on.  She hadn't noticed she stepped on the remote.  She never watched much television before.  She enjoyed watching the catfood shows and the fishing channel every now and then, but found it more of a distraction than anything, but in this situation where she had nothing better to do she sat down and watched it.  A moment later she noticed another bowl of cream.  She hadn't noticed it before and wondered if all of this was Kari's doing or was she merely having a nightmare.  She pinched herself and found out it was no dream.  She decided she'd relax today and demand answered from Kari.  She could always try and exercise in the house.  She grabbed the bowl and started chugging the milk.  On hte last gulp she realized what she had just done and swallowed hard.  She felt more like a pig than a cat the way she had acted and felt disgusted at herself.  She felt fat, but it wasn't until she put her arms on her stomach that she realized this wasnt a dream and that she had a few inches on her paunch.  She was ready to do several jogs around the house when she felt tired.  She felt tired and collapsed right into her bed.  Now she knew something was wrong.  How did she get back in her bed?  She tried to get up and investigate, but her strength was leaving her.  She felt like a normal housecat that lays around most of the day.  She tried to fight to stay awake, but fell into darkness.

I don't know exactly what's going on, but you are definately not Kairi.  This place, everything here isn't real.  What is really happening?\"<br>\r\n   Kairi's kind smile changed to a smirk.  \"Well I guess you are a sharp one aren't you.  You're right you aren't in your world at the moment.  Your in an illusion my master created.  He has a thing for turning everything into lazy slobs and he especially likes a challenge.  You've proven to be a great challenge and discovered this place is all smoke and mirrors faster than all the others.\"<br>\r\n   \"What other?\" Gatomon shouted.<br>\r\n   \"Your friends of course.\"<br>\r\n   Suddenly, several holes in the reality were opened and all the other digimon were unconcious and extremely obese.  They seemed more like digiblobs at this point.<br>\r\n   \"What did you do to them?\"<br>\r\n   \"A little coaxing at first.\" claimed the false Kairi who started tranforming into the other digidestined one at a time. \"But after some time they''ve grown to like this lifestyle... and so shall you.\"<br>\r\n   \"And when I give in you'll kill me like them?\"<br>\r\n   \"Don't be so judging.

First it was just carrying Gatomon. then as she became too heavy Kari got a small wheeled cart and padded it with pillows to move Gatomon about. Though really they didn't go far, mostly it was just to the living room to watch TV and back to Kari's room to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a week of this Gatomon was about the size of a large footstool and pushing two hundred and fifty pounds. She sat in front of the TV, lazily flipping channels with the remote in one hand and a buzzer in the other, her drink with a straw propped between her burgeoning breasts. She was just getting into a cooking show when Agumon entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh Gatomon you really need to do something about this,\" the golden colored dino muttered as he stepped up beside the bloated feline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" she muttered sluggishly. These days anything that wasn't food or talk of food seemed unimportant to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\" Agumon repeated and jabbed her belly with a claw, not hard enough to bruse but enough to show his claws sinking deep into her side, \"It's getting way out of hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGatomon just sighed as Agumon withdrew his claws. The hole in he side lingered for a moment before the fat filled it in again. Curious Agumon couldn't help poking her again. And again. And again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Gatmon growled as she turned to look at Agumon, her round cheeks wobbling on either side of her face. \"I don't need you telling me how to live my life. And my stomach has been feeling weird all day so just cut it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to cut it out,\" Agumon muttered as he waled off, \"Cut out the fat that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that!\" Gatmon replied and rubbed her stomach as best she could. She missed her gloves but they'd gotten too small to wear a couple days ago and she really didn't want to tear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her stomach groan and undulate some more Gatomon hit the buzzer, assuming she needed more food. It took Kari only a few minutes to enter with a plate full of nachos covered in melted cheese. \"Here you go Gatomon, my precious chubby kitty,\" Kari grinned as she set them on Gatomons belly just in front of her now softball sized breasts. As usual Gatomon barely replied with a nod and a smile, but that seemed to be enough for Kari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit of an effort to eat the nachos as Gatomons arms were hard to move with all the layers of fat. She ended up having to set down both the buzzer and remote to reach the cheesy treats. However something was off. Almost as soon as she bit into the nacho Gatomon felt the feeling in her stomach increase rather than decrease. It wasn't painful but it felt like some sort of pressure. Still she refused to stop eating and the more she ate the more the feeling grew inside her. It was building to something but she didn't want to believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she lifted the last nacho to her mouth and, almost hesitantly bit into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mushy cheese hit her stomach, Gatomon groaned as the feelings suddenly intensified tenfold. Something was happening to her. Something new... and yet... almost familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when a faint glow began in her stomach that it hit her. it felt like the pressure before she'd naturally digivolved to Gatomon from Salamon. But this wasn't normal digivolving. It was something different. The glow intensified as it spread across her body. And when all of her was glowing with a soft blue light she felt the pressure release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>BBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Gatomon digivolves to Glutmon. Almost identical to her former self but now taller and with bigger breasts, plus the ability to make other fat and then steal that fat for herself if she desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Gatomon digivoles to Queen Gatomon. Likewise taller and bigger.

Strangely resulting in a smaller gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was six feet tall, six foot five inches if you included her ears. Her frame was positively pear shaped, with her hips wide enough to be three people's width. She had a rear end to match too. Her belly easily made it half way to her knees. Her paws however, were focused on one of her new feature, a pair of actual breasts. Before all she'd had was flab on her chest, but now she had a set of full mammeries. Her paws, still sporting a pair of improved gloves, were grasping her new chest. A small moan escaped her muzzle. \"Oh, this is quite nice...D Cup... I think its what Tai called them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled over to the bathroom, the first time she had moved herself in weeks.

She wanted to find Agumon pronto and pay him back for that teasing earlier. If he had thought her fat before, it would be nothing compared to what she'd do to him in turn.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0First Glutmon tried the kitchen. She knew he wasn't there of course but her new figure needed food and pronto. One box of toaster pastries and another of doughnuts latter followed by a large glass of chocolate milk and she set to looking again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled as she tiptoed down the hall. She could practically feel the high calorie food she'd consumed adding new layers of softness to her larger frame. Unable to resist she ducked into the bathroom briefly to look herself over in the mirror, giggling as her massive hips wedged in it briefly along the way.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Most of what she saw in the mirror was unsurprising, though the fact she no longer had to jump on the sink to see herself was different. But there was one feature that caught her off guard. She had hair. Not body fur but actual hair. A long and straight, weight like her coat too. It reminded Glutmon of Mimi's hair a bit, if somewhat shorter as it hung to her shoulders.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Grinning she hefted her large breasts, her other most noticeable asset. Each was nearly arm armful and capped with big pink areolas and nipples the size of shot-glasses. She was also sure she could hear faint noises of something sloshing inside as she moved. Giving her left nipple a gentile tweak she could feel the bead of milk squirt onto her fingers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my,\" Glutmon grinned and licked the delicious tasting cream off her clawed finger, \"Well, this should add a bit more fun to the game.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once more sneaking out of the bathroom (and doing her best to resist suckling on her own nipple as her hips wedged more firmly in the door frame this time), she made her way down the hall to where she knew Agumon would be. Sure enough the sounds coming from Tais room indicated the small digimon was inside playing a game.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Glutmon slowly peaked through the crack in the door and spied the small digimon facing away from her playing an old side scrolling adventure game. Spotting the score counter in the corner of the screen, Glutmon got a great idea. Keeping her voice to the faintest whisper she activated one of bher now 'attacks'. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cat's Cradle.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She could feel the invisible web of energy connecting her to Agumon and the game he was playing without the digimon noticing. Now she had control over his size. Still whispering to herself she directed the changes, \"For every point scored in the game, Agumon will gain one ounce of new fat. And for every 1-up, ten pounds.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Almost immediately after she'd said that Glutmon watched as Agumon hit a secret block and out popped a 1-up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The small digimon was too eager for it to notice as his character touched it his belly began to soften, gently sagging a little further as his hips gained a little more mass. The new ultimate grinned in glee as she watched. Every sixteen points a new pound of fat rolled onto Agumons frame. And given the games generosity with the score, killing even one enemy could result in two or three pounds of new fat rolling onto his frame. But Agumon was so into the old game he failed to notice as his rump continued to widen and his legs thickened like expanding rolls of dough while his belly sagged forwards to cover them little by little. He'd nearly reached the end of the level and he already looked nearly fifty pounds heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long does this go on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Agumon quits at the end of the level, but that final time score racks up a number of points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Agumon plays a few more levels until he feels strange and notices the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Agumon doesn't stop until he has trouble holding the controller thanks to his fat body growing too large to keep his arms together.</span></div></div>",

She watched as his muscular pecks practically melted, slowly starting to rest on his flabby gut.  His legs even got pushed apart as his thunder thighs pressed against his fat stomach. The adipose tissue just pressed into each other. His second chin sagged down towards his moobs, but before it could get all the way, a third chin formed underneath it, pushing his head up a bit. It got to the point his belly stretched to four feet in front of him, and his c cup moobs were pressing against his arms.

I'm one sexy kitty now.\" She turned her torso a bit, to give her rear end a playful swat to show off. \"I figure, why not help my friends be as sexy and fat like I am! I tied your fatness to your score in the game, but you're too flabby to even lay around the house and play video games!\" She reached down to the dino lazily rubbing her paw against his gut. \"You're a whole new level of fat.\"</span></div></div>",

Also, his balls had swollen so much(and were still growing very slowly) that they were currently as big as his head in height and width!

It was a small rectangular... piece of electronics. It almost resembled a video game system, but had an attached keyboard. \"Tai doesn't own a PSP.\" The flabby cat thought to herself. She wanted to investigate, but pounds and pounds of flab had made moving difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flabby kitty sighed as her paws pushed against the bed, barely able to push herself along the bed.

Cup size, areola size, nipple size, and so on.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wow, so many choices...\" Gatomon mused, \"Well, I know Kari said C-cups were about average, so I'll give her a little more than that.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Gatomon began punching in random numbers she could see the wire-frame change to match, though at the same time an 'execute' button appeared, presumably to start the actual changes on Kari once she was done. if that was what the program really did.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And why not,\" Gatomon muttered to herself, \"I've seen stranger things in the digital world anyway.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she neared the end she noticed a button marked 'Lactation Yes/No'. Briefly Gatomon considered it but decided yes when her butterball of a belly gave her an impatient grumble, reminding her how hungry she was. The idea of nursing from Kari seemed strange, but again, Gatomon had seen weirder.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With everything in place the feline hit the executte button and waited. For a moment nothing seemed to happen, then kari stirred faintly., rolling onto her back. As she did so gatomon watched in amazement as the new mounds on her partners chest began to growm, straining her night shirt. The expanding mammaries pushed up and spread wider straining the fabric and pulling the buttons apart. One even popped under the strain as Kari's breasts grew to softball sizes with no sign of discomfort.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It really works...\" Gatomon marveled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However she was interrupted a moment later by something.</span></div></div>",

The young girl was probably reacting to her her breasts getting so much heavier and pressing against her shirt. Gatomon just smiled, realizing she only had a few seconds to do whatever she wanted. She quickly snapped to the biography section and typed, \"Believes anything and does her partner Gatomon tells her. \"That'll make this easy.\" The spoiled cat thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari started to sit up in bed, missing the weight of gatomon's flab on her side. \"Gatomon?\" She said, starting to look around before looking around and noticing her fatty cat partner on the floor. \"Did you roll out of bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep...\" Gatomon said with a sly smile. Kari reached out and grabbed her. Kari's hands practically melted into her flabby body, picking her up and hefting her body back up, embracing the feline. \"We really should get a bigger bed.\" After saying that, her pajamas started to form to large dark spots. Kari's lactation had already kicked into effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're making a lot of milk. I should start nursing from you.\" She didn't hesitate to unbutton Kari's top and pop  her breast into her hungry muzzle, slowly suckling the milk out from her partner. Kari followed her programming, holding the flabby cat in her arms as Gatomon gently sucked at her nipple. The furry fat was comfy to hold onto, made her feel warm and comfy. Meanwhile, Kari was moaning softly, feeling her larger chest being played with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed by, Gatomon only pausing to switch side's of her partner chest. Her belly satiated, the digimon smiled up at her partner. \"Mmmm.... what can I say Kari, you taste really good.\" She put her paw on the side of Kari's breast, practically cupping her. \"We should do this more often.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human girl was leaning back against her pillow, loving the feeling of everything that had just happened. She was heading into a whole new level of spoiling Gatomon. \"Go back to sleep Kari....\" Gatomon said looking back at the device. Her being awake seemed like it could complicate things. \"You'll feel much better in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight gatomon.\" Kari said before almost instantly fading back into her dream. The flabby cat in her arms just served as the world's most comforting plushy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... what;s the best way to put this to work?\" Gatomon wondered as she looked over her new favorite machine.</span></div></div>",

Deleting that and typing in 'Digimon' offered a new set of options. The first one was a check box for 'Anthro / Non-Anthro'. A click on the question-mark icon brought up the text that described the anthro form as being more 'upright' and generally humanoid in shape with mostly digimon traits.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Much as Kari would look good as a full Digimon, I think this 'anthro' thing might be worth trying for now,\" Gatomon mused as she made the selection.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After that came a large pull-down menu of a lot of different Digimon forms to chose from. Some Gatomon didn't even recognize. What were 'Renamon' and 'Guilmon' forms like, she wondered. Figuring she'd save those for later Gatomon knew exactly the form she wanted for Kari. Another gatomon shape. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was just about to hit enter when Gatomon spied the weight for Kari at a paltry 120 pounds. \"Well why not?\" Gatomon smiled patting her own belly, \"Us Gatomons deserve to be big.\" She upped the number to a solid 300. Just to start with. No sense in going overboard yet.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once the button was pressed, Gatomon felt Kari shudder gently as her figure began to change. Most noticeably was the soft white fur that began to spread across her body and under her clothes. Her ears perked and then continued rising, growing up as the moved to the top of her head, becoming large and triangular as they emerged from her hair. Kari's upper lip divided slightly and melded with her nose which pushed out into a small muzzle on her face, sprouting whiskers at the same time that twitched in her sleep. Her hand gained soft pink pads and and black claws which were soon covered by the yellow gloves Gatomon wore. Her feet popped and cracked a bit, becoming claw tipped paws as well and a small tear sounded as a tail grew from her rump like a weed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And speaking of her bottom, that was where the new pounds began to pile on. Her rear end widened and stretched as her belly gurgled and swelled. Her hips thickened and Gatomon felt Kari shift next to her on the bed as the new layers of fat began to strain her nightwear. By the time it ended she wasn't huge but having more than doubled in weight Kari was a bit of a butterball herself with a soft double chin and a stomach that looked like she'd swallowed a basketball.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The feline smiled at her newly changed partner, enjoying the look as she cuddled close. The machine was amazingly powerful if it could do this, and Gatomon wondered what else it could do. Perhaps Tai and Agumon deserved some attention as well? Or maybe she could change herself some this time? But then again Kari\u2019s breasts were already starting to fill again as they popped another button to roll out of her nightshirt with the soft pink nipples looking hard and thick in the cool air of the room. Perhaps another snack would be worthwhile...</span></div></div>",

'It's pretty nice having her carry me around everywhere...but I could be the biggest person here... Hmmm.' The flabby cat thought to herself. Maybe this anthro thing was a good idea. Why be pampered as a pet when you could be worshiped as a queen?\" She smiled, feeling her fat body cuddle and squish against Kari's. The screen lit up as she went to her own species setting, flipping the anthro switch on. That one change made several new fields appear, breast size. \"Hmmm... how large and in charge do I want to be?\" She went through, slowly building her new body. 6'5''... she'd be the tallest person she new, bigger even than Flamedramon. For weight... \"I want to be a whale of a gatomon.... but still able to walk, no one around here is going to be able to carry me.\" she settled on 700 pounds of pure fat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She added one more detail to her description, \"People feel compelled to do whatever she says.... why should Kari be the only one spoiling me?\" With that she hit execute, and the changes started instantly. Her body began stretching, making her taller. As she stretched out to her new height, she felt herself able to walk under her own power. As soon as she realized that, she jumped out of bed, her belly jiggling slightly. She ran to the bathroom, eager for a mirror. She was already at the 4 foot mark, and getting taller, but also fatter. Flab packed onto her body as she watched, new boobs growing in that rested on a pudgy belly. She rubbed it, squeezing her gut as it grew and squished in her paws. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The process took seconds, and there she stood, massive, pear shaped. She guessed she was at least 4 feet wide, biggest at her hips, but still with a nice set of E cups that drooped onto her love handles. Her face was a blob of fat with apple sized cheeks resting on a set of three chins. \"One more change,\" She said, reaching back to the editor. To handle it, she had to squeeze her fat arms against her breasts, shoving them together. \"I'm turning my lactation on, why should Kari get all the fun.\" After a few clicks, she felt her chest getting heaving, firm up like they were being inflated. \"Oh...\" Paws grabbed her big areolas, squeezing and making small beads of milk pour out. \"I like this new body.\"</span></div></div>",

Now lets see how they like it.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gatomon crept (as best a nearly six and a half foot severn hundred pound feline could) down the hall towards Tai and Agumons shared room. Ever since Tai had started taking collage classes at the nearby campus he'd been given his own room to work and study in, with a separate smaller bed for Agumon next to his.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peeking into the room Gatomon grinned, seeing both were still asleep, Agumon twisted about in his bed and Tai snoring nearby. Both were just too tempting of a target for Gatomon not to mess with. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0First she pulled up Tai's profile and started to make the changes. \"Tai never got into collage,\" she muttered as she typed it out, \"He tried but failed the entrance exams.

Both he and Agumon have been putting on weight as a result.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gatomon selected Tai's profile first and bumped his weight to 400 pounds. And then did the same for Agumon. Briefly she considered making both of them anthro, but figured that could wait until after this first round. She had lots of ideas and wanted to savor each one.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Grinning she added one more bit of text to all their profiles, \"Both Tai and Agumon love Gatomon's and, to a lesser degree, Kari's milk and try to sneak tastes whenever they can. Kari finds it cute and both play along pretending not to notice their brothers attempts for the occasional taste.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After Gatomon hit the enter button she watched as the changes occurred. First the room drastically changed. Though much was still there, the trash bin was overflowing with old burger bags and wrappers, Tai's clothes hanging nearby changed from a school uniform to a somewhat grease stained shirt and pants. And then there were the two snoozing individuals themselves.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tai thickened and swelled in his pajamas, buttons straining over his developing belly and male breasts. A new double chin sagged over his neck increasing the noise of his snores. His pajama bottoms tore as his wide rear stretched the seams to their breaking point.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Agumon, though lacking clothes, was going through the same thing, albeit to a greater degree on his smaller frame. His arms and legs puffed up into cones of fat as his torso bloated rounder and thicker until he was nearly as wide as he was tall. The tops of his bloated clawed feet pressed against the underside of his sagging belly, the dome of which was capped by a pair of male breasts as thick as Gatomons pudgy fists.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was going to be so much fun when they woke up.</span></div></div>",

His arms and hands were in for a similar fate as Tai lost one finger on each hand to give him three clawed digits and a thumb.

She discovered it was quite pliable, but as long as she kept moving she never sank too deep for it to be a problem.

The warmth radiated out from that gut as he she kneaded the soft doughy stomach. Slowly Tai started to moan and smile in his sleep, A toothy smile forming on his face. \"Well, finally, a way to get Tai where he belongs. Pampering me like his little sister does.

And she had a good idea of how to begin.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The first thing she changed was that one month ago their family had won the countrywide lottery. A jackpot of easily ten billion yen (or just over 81 million in US dollars), enough to have them all set for life. The month wait had been for such a huge amount to be cleared and officiated and the first installment had arrived just the other day. Sure it might have been easier to just make it happen, but this way the money could be used for so much more as well. Kari's family would already be holding a party of sorts, so this was just a creative alternative.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before going back to sleep Gatomon added that Kari already had the big catered feast ready. It was a surprise for all of them really, though Gatomon knew about it already. Their parents would be off having their adult party and Karimon and her siblings along with all their friends would be enjoying the main feast held at a local conference center. unable to stay awake any longer, Gatomon finally dozed off. At some point in the night she suspected Tai had snuck a drink from her heaving breasts since they seemed less full when she awoke. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Clawing her way out of bed she discovered Kari was already up. The pudgy feline morph was in the kitchen making breakfast for everyone using the completely overstocked contents of the refrigerator to make a meal of bacon, eggs, toast, sausage, pancakes hash-browns, and more.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Tai! Agu! You both better get in here before Gato eats all the food!\" she called playfully as she set the heaving platter in front of Gatomon to enjoy. Before long there was a series of soft thuds as the pair of bloated dinos rounded the corner, waddling into the dining area. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sheesh Tai,\" Kari giggled poking his belly which was barely half covered by Tais too-small blue shirt, \"If you get any bigger the neighbors will think we're keeping Godzilla here as a pet.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I am not that fat,\" Tai grumbled trying fruitlessly to tug his shirt down over his orange gut, \"I just like a good meal now and then, is that so wrong.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well you're going to get plenty today,\" Gatomon giggled as she watched Agumon already shovling mouthfuls of scrambled eggs down his maw.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's right,\" the shorter scaled being muttered thickly before swallowing his eggs and grinning, \"Today's the day of the big feast. Oh I can't wait, I'm going to have one. No two. No... ten of everything.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You look like you could manage it,\" Gatomon teased, reaching around and poking Agumons blubbery rear end, \"By the way, how many of our friends are comming Kari? Is Sora going to be there?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tai's face went from orange to red in a few moments and he gulped some slightly tart orange juice to make it pass as his feline sister giggled, \"Well, I sent out invitations to all of them. Hopefully they'll be able to make it.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey if they don't, more food for me,\" Agumon chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out...</span></div></div>",

Fried food was the general theme. Things that had been deep friend in fat made up the main course, but there was Gatomon's favorite, sushi, as well. Not everyone knew how high calorie it was. She was impressed with everything Kari had put together, especially the fact that nothing was low calorie. But then, how else were her 2 brothers going to keep gaining weight. \"Oopps... forgot I haven't done that yet. Hmm, I wonder if agumon and Taimon would work better as brothers. I certainly wouldn't mind Kari as a younger sister....\" The powers the device gave her just made her keep thinking of fun ways to change things. Of course now, she had all the digidestined to work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis was still trying to work his moves on Karimon, the species change not affecting his crush in the slightest. Taimon was still making eyes at Sora. \"Everything is perrrfectly normal.\" Gatomon smiled, leaning back into the couch. She was easily softer than it though. As she had programmed, everyone thought their new bodies were normal, and everyone even teased Tai a bit about the weight he had put on working in fast food. \"Oh yes.... lets have some fun.\" Veemon was still making eyes towards her, so she hefted up her belly and winked at him. He blushed and quickly walked away. \"Looks like the new gatomon is a bit too sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out the device from where she had been hiding it...</span></div></div>",

Next she brought up the data forms of herself, Agumon, and finally Kari along side Tai's data. And after a few minutes of careful selecting she fixes it so that all of them would receive the genetic traits selected. Traits that would allow them to become extremely horny, produce massive amounts of cum/breast milk, grow fatter at will/fatten up as they have sex, never suffer from health issues, grow massive cocks, balls, &amp; breasts, and even the ability to spread it amongst the other trainers and their Digimon as well!! <br>\r\n         As she finishes up the final data input into the editing machine, Gatomon sets the start up weight stats for the group to be at an immense....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She turned around, her massive body almost hitting the wall behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled over to Kari's room, feeling her flabby body shake with each wide movement. Gatomon loved the feeling of her thighs gliding across each other. The cat enjoyed each step of her bouncing body, before getting back to her own room, and her partner. It was only a few minutes ago she had turned the human into a beautiful gatomon like herself. She was still lying in bed, making a massive bulge underneath her warm covers. \"My little pet here has done such a nice job of feeding and caring for me. She even let me get a drink from her without so much as a question. I'll deal with her butter ball brother in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid down in bed, feeling her fat body melt against Kari's. Their fur rubbing together only caused more heat to erupt between the two of them. Gatomon even heard a timid moan escape from her friend's muzzle. Moving as carefully as possible, she wrapped her flabby arm against her, cuddling her partner as well as she could without waking her. In a quiet voice, she whispered, \"Cat Nap.\" The world quickly went dark as she entered Kari's dreamword....</span></div></div>",

Stretching up and out on both sides. A bout five stories up Gatomon could make out a deep indentation that resembled a cave. Kari's belly button. And beyond that were the twin jutting cliffs of breast flesh that had to be bigger than whole city blocks. If not entire downtown districts. Each was also tipped with a huge nipple that, while hard to be certain at such a distance, were probably bigger than houses.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kari's face, let alone her head was impossible to see due to distance and angle. Fortunately being a dream the laws of physics didn't need to apply and Gatomon was able to bound to the indentation of Kari's navel with a single leap.

Piles of doughnuts, whole cakes. Tuna sub sandwiches almost a yard long, all were swallowed by the felines eager mouth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But what Gatomon hear between Kari's acts of gluttony was the real surprise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've only eaten two tons for lunch! I know we can keep pushing that higher!\" He leaned down while, pushing the food into her gullet. He was reaching down to stroke the blobby side of her muzzle, lightly petting her. Then, standing back up, he noticed Gatomon.  \"Hey Gato! I know you can't give her belly rubs like you used to, but can you help us stuff this fat cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGatomon smiled from her position on Kari's massive chin. \"Of course I can!\" She waddled over the sea of fat, getting to her partner's muzzle. Each step was precarious, and forced her to balance on pure flab.  Padding over the giant fatty took time, but eventually she made it. \"Come on Kari, keep eating!\" She decided to lie down, making sure her face was mere inches away from Kari's, and ensuring as much of her heavy, fat laden body was pressing into her partner as possible. \"Eat more, you know you want to. I passed your breasts on my way up here. Maybe if you eat a few hundred pounds more, those massive tits of yours will turn into a water falls of milk.\" She reached to the side, pinching her cheeks. \"Oh sure, it may hurt a little, but you know you want it. Kari Kamiya want's to be a massive tank of lard, and her family is going to make sure she gets there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGatomon could practically see the fur over the horizon of her cheeks turn pink.

She could even feel herself 'sliding away' as all the other chins inched along at a glacial pace to make room for the new fat.

Agumon of course wore nothing, but that just made his developing folds all the more visible when he swallowed a box of doughnuts all on his own.

Bending a bit he removed Tai's pants followed by underwear. And then reached between the dinos legs to fondle his moderately big sausage and swinging balls. Tai moaned and licked his lips as Agumon leaned in closer, going for a lick of something else. Slowly his tongue teased at Tai's member, swirling around the kiwi sized head and teasing along the uncut foreskin of his shaft.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tai was practically drooling at the pleasure already and Gatomon couldn't help feel her clawed hands reaching down to gently rub her own moist folds. Somehow this was simply the hottest thing she'd seen in a long time. And it was about to get better.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Agumon took Tais whole member into his mouth little by little, rubbing it gently with his teeth. Once he had a firm grip though Agumon began to walternate sucking and then blowing. And this was where 'dream logic' made things interesting. With every exhale Gatomon watched as Tai's belly swelled a little further, his hips inched a bit wider, and his tail thicken a bit longer. But it was Tai's breasts that got the most love.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With every puff his nipples thickened a bit more and with every huff his male breasts firmed and swelled by at least a full inch or more. And all of it wasn't air given the sag, it was more fat just like Kari. All too soon Tai was sporting a rightful pair of proper tits, each the size of a large melon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But Agumon didn't stop.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh this is incredible...\" Kari moaned and Gatomon had to agree. As Tai surpassed what had to be almost six hundred pounds of dino flab his breasts were the size of beach-balls and his remaining clothes were beginning to tear under their weight. The only reason Agumon wasn't yet buried was because Tai's member had apparently been growing as well. Agumon had to take a step back as the once small sausage had become a proper yard long slab of deli meat, the throbbing orange and red length was twice as thick from before and barely protruded passed Takatos nearly four foot gut.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was just as his clothes seemed on their last legs Tai finally let out a half-stiffed roar and came, squirting mouthful after mouthful of cream down Agumons throat. And as a result Agumon too began to swell. Belly first then hips and tail. And like Tai his breasts got a massive dose of expansion as they dropped lower and lower, ipples fast reaching the size of corks, then shot glasses, then up to 4oz drinking glasses and still they swelled on ballooning tits that were trying desperately to catch up to Tai's.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Tai finally tapered off and Agumon had sucked down the last few dropps, the bloated dino was almost as big as his partner. Agumon was shorter certainly and had a bit less belly, but his breasts were definitely bigger, each twice as big as his head and sagging heavily on either side of his belly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmm, you taste good Tai,\" Agumon chuckled patting his partners belly, \"Like marshmallow fluff.

Their flab heated up from being so close and in contact, making both girls feels warmer from the embrace. It didn't take long for her to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they woke up, the two girls felt each other's massive bodies against each other.

She was nuzzling in against Gatomon second chen and taking in the smell of her loved partner. \"Come on, I'll make you breakfast, a big one...\" Then she put her paws right on Gatomon's breast, cupping the thick pink nipples, \"And from the way these look you need a milking this morning almost as badly as I do.\"</span></div></div>",

Really creamy. At least from what I've heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe you should give it a try now,\" Gatomon suggested turning to her 'sister', \"Have a few gulps, I'm sure the boys wouldn't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks on their faces both certainly did mind but neither wanted to speak up as Kari waddled over to Gatomon and sat down beside her.

And thanks to the device she could give quite a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the first changes to begin to show on Karimon as her form began to gently thicken with new layers of adipose. Her rump in particular Gatomon was able to watch as it expanded inch by inch and grew over the sides of the chair. Her stomach gurgled and sloshed as it gently began filling her lap. Karimons own white furred breasts bounced and sagged as well, adding a couple more cup sizes easily as her whole figure began straining the few clothes she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arg, this is so unfair Gato,\" Agumon grumbled, \"I want a turn.

As Kari was finishing her own extended drink Gatomon watched as her breasts jumped another two cup sizes. But what was weird was Agumons breasts were doing the same thing. Not just the sagging male pecs he'd had before either. These were full, soft, <i>sloshing</i> with milk, female breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Agumon finally pulled back, the Digimon was either immobile or close to it under a small hill of orange scaled fat, but he'd also picked up a couple throw-pillow sized breasts in the process. And naturally was earning a few stares from those present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Agumon asked seeing the looks before he noticed himself. \"Wow! What the...?\" His clawed hands, bloated to nearly mittens of fat reached up to cup his breasts, easily a match for Gato's or even Kari's orbs. \"Wow...\" Agumon repeated feeling over the sensitive melons, \"...I have boobs. That's weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but look on the bright side,\" Gato smiled, \"Now you can give Tai a drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai looked from the girls to Agumon.

Currently both were staring slack jawed at the TV screen the family had been watching. Beside them on the couch their father Susumu Kamiya had seemed to have passed out and their mother Yuuko Kamiya seemed to be shaking him desperately to wake him. <br>\r\nGatomon had barely taken all this in before she was suddenly scooped up by Kari who once again make the squealing shriek Gatomon had mistaken for a scream of fear. Now up close (painful as it was) the white and purple feline could detect it was a squeal of excitement. She kept bouncing up and down as she twirled holding Gatomon in a near choking embrace. All the while squealing, 'We won! We won! We won! We won!'<br>\r\nFinally Gatomon managed to pull free enough to take a breath, \"What's going on Kari?\" she asked, nervous that some evil digimon had damaged her family's minds, \"What's gotten into you?\"<br>\r\n\"Gatomon,\" Kari grinned the largest smile she'd ever shown, \"We won! My Dad bought the lucky lottery ticket! And we won!\"<br>\r\n\"Won what?\" Gatomon asked, still feeling unsure. She knew some things about the human world but this was a new experience for her.<br>\r\n\"The lottery,\" Kari smiled, barely able to explain from her excitement, \"We won the jackpot! Forty-five <i>billion</i> Yen!\" *<br>\r\n\"Is that a lot?\" Gatomon asked, her eyes growing wide. She'd never had to deal with more than a few yen for vending machines before when she got thirsty out on her patrols.<br>\r\n\"A lot?\" Agumon seemed to snap out of his daze at Gatomons question, \"It's enough to buy out almost every business for ten blocks in every direction.\"<br>\r\nTai chimed in, \"It's enough that if we spent eighteen yen a second all day, every day, for the rest of our lives, we still wouldn't have used it up before we die.\"<br>\r\nKari held Gatomon close and smiled, \"It means we're set for life Gatomon. Everything we could ever want and then some.\"<br>\r\nGatomons mind reeled and she suddenly understood why Susumu had fainted. \"I... I think I need to lay down Kari...\"<br>\r\nKari nodded and carried Gatomon to her room and placed the tired feline on her bed, \"Just relax Gatomon, tomorrow things will start changing for us.\"<br>\r\nThe feline just nodded as she settled in and tried to fall asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note: roughly the equivalent of five hundred and fifty million in US dollars.</span></div></div>",

The other Digi-Destined.

Mom and Dad got a nice deal on one of the large traditional houses there. So now we'll have a proper yard for you and Agumon to play in.\"<br>\r\nGatomon 'hmmph'd a bit at being thought of like a pet that only needed more room to play, but she knew Kari was only teasing. And a large yard would make for some nice room to practice her fighting techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took almost the rest of the day to pack up, thankfully though the movie took little time and by dinner the family was eating at their table in the new house. Gatomon felt a little uneasy though. Nice as the house was, it was a bit big and empty for the moment since they'd be unpacking tomorrow.<br>\r\nAfter dinner Gatomon decided to explore some. The house was even larger than she thought. Not counting the entrance walkway, which lead to the front gate and could be shuttered in the winter or left open in the summer, the house had four bedrooms, three full-sized bathrooms, two half-bathrooms (just a toilet and sink, no shower), a kitchen, dining room, living room, exercise room (pads replaced floorboards), a half dozen closets, a basement and an attic. It was enough to make Gatomons head swim.<br>\r\nStill, she decided if she was going to explore, she better do so methodically. That meant starting in the attic and working down or the basement and working up. <br>\r\nAs she tried to decide Gatomon couldn't help but chuckle, recalling some stories she'd read online and how there always seemed to be some unusual find to be discovered in an attic or basement. She doubted such a thing could happen to her, but then it would have been fun to be proven wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, where to start...</span></div></div>",

And if you know what's good for you, you'd keep my equipment intact if you don't want to face the punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" said the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finally, when you're satistfied and want to deflate you replace the hose with this.\" he guided their eyes to a thinner hose with a breather mask at the end. \"This'll carry what you're inflated with back into the tank so it'd be purified from the germs and junk that you have. I warn you not to turn the knob otherwise it'd go right back into you full force. It'll uncontrollably inflate you with more potency than what you're about to take so don't take it. Oh and the circular button near the gauge activates the inflation, so press it when everything is secured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm done, so,\" Digitamamon concluded before being cut off by cheers, \"It'll be two hours before I check upon you here, One two minutes in the Digital World. If there is any trouble, come to me at once. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" Davis and Veemon chorused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So until then, enjoy yourselves. And don't break anything!\" With that, Digitamamon approached the door, tapped the necessary numbers in a panel (He is able to hold things or press buttons without hands, as evidenced in the final BlackWarGreymon episodes, but I don't know how), and closed the door behind him in a snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis faced his partner with a grin. \"Ready to get pumped?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure am!\" exclaimed Veemon enthusiastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFixing the hose mask carefully on his face and making sure it was secured, Veemon gave his partner the thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" an impatient nod let Davis slap the inflation button on, which lit up. \"Now it begins!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every little motion made his spare tire jibble and ripple against the table. \"Wow... never though... I'd be this fat.\" He said, reaching back to rub his claw against the back of his head.

Plowing his way to the 'males room' he approached the sink to confirm his suspicions.  There in the mirror was not a human but a very large, very busty, very <i>feminine</i> Exveemon. She was only a couple inches taller than Davis had been and sported the same colored hair and goggles he had worn. And eye color aside that was where the similarities ended. She was soft and round, easily as big as Sumomon was now. All her clothes had been shredded in the change with the exception of her flight jacket which now failed to cover any of her large chest. And speaking of which each ponderous breast had to be the size of her whole head, with nipples as big as her clawed thumb. Each hip was a mass that barely gave her room to clear the door and her bubble but alone could have provided a seat for a small rookie given how far it jutted from her rear end.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A free hand reached down under her large sagging belly to feel the definitive void of a certain piece of anatomy that was no longer there. \"This can't be happening,\" she moaned, not so much in anguish but utter confusion and desperation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On one evening in the Digital World, Armadillomon was scaling around Infinity Mountain in a laid back manner. Armadillmon liked walking: as long as he wasn't rushing, it felt good to move around and have the mountain air rush around him. It always revitalized him so he can go on for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned a corner, his eyes fell on a piece if corn laid on a flat slab. Armadillmon stopped and squinted at it. What was that doing here? That had never been on the path before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Armadillomon was musing upon its origins, his stomach reminded him that he skipped breakfast this morning and his cheeks reddened. He nervously surveyed his surroundings and cautiously approached the corn.  He picked it up and studied it carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it wouldn't hurt to take a bite out of this.\u201d muttered Armadillomon as he took a chomp out of the corn. His eyes lit up. \u201cThis is good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe attacked the corn eagerly. When Armadillomon finished it, he rubbed his belly, licking his lips. That was really good! He should keep an eye out for more corn like that. It was so tasty and filling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the air ahead of him began to churn ominously, nearly throwing Armadillomon off his feet. As he regained his wit, a Dorugremon materialized in the gush, gazing down menacingly at the rookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you ate the corn, have you?\u201d the Ultimate hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-did I do something wrong?\u201dArmadillomon stuttered nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you ate the Sacred Corn of Sin,\u201d said Dorugremon, \u201cWhen anyone tries to eat it, they demonstrate the sins they exhibit. Yours is sloth and gluttony.\u201d he smiled unpleasantly. \u201cAs punishment, you will be indulged in those sins until you can't stand them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan't I just apologize and move on with my life.\u201d Armadillomon begged. \u201cLive and let live, you know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorugremon exposed his teeth in a grin. \u201cToo late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWind began rushing around them, disorienting and pushing Armadillmon around until couldn't judge up from down. Unconsciousness swept the Digimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he knew, he found himself in a large, shadowed room with large walls, facing a long corridor with cell doors. Dorugremon towered over him, smiling sinisterly down at the rookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, you are awake. So where do we begin? Ah, yes. You have two punishments. One, is the Thirteen Snakes of Ascension. Two, you face the Eternal Fruits of Longing. Neither are fatal and both would teach you a lesson on abiding to your sins. When probably recover from your punishment, you may go.\u201c he laughed. \u201cOr not. There are rare times when the punished begin to enjoy their consequences and come here repeatedly for more, but I'm sure you would want to go. And there are those who don't recover. Anyway, you are lucky, you can choose your punishments. So which will you choose?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there a third option?\u201d Armadillomon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorugremon displayed his sharp wings. \u201cYes. You being reformatted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmadillomon winced. How was he suppose to choose a punishment he didn't know about? He'd have to guess the one that sounded less menacing. But both of them sounded menacing and Armadillomon was nervous about both. Finally, Armadillomon came to a decision...  </span></div></div>",

It's face was expressionless, a thin tongue occasionally flitting our of its mouth. The snake's body seemed just as wide as its head as the snake slowly slithered closer. Armadillmon began backing away, his back hitting the cell door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not letting that thing bite me! It'll probably rip my guts out!\" Armadillmon said fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a scaredy-mon. You won't even feel the bite on your stomach. And besides, I'm not letting you go until you get bit by <i>every single snake in your punishment,</i> understand?\" Dorugreymon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmadillmon looked back at his captor through the window of the cell door before gulping. He regretted ever going on his mountain walk, and eating that dumb corn even more. He slowly walked up to the snake, which had stopped slithering closer and was now just staring at him. Armadillmon blinked, hoping that Dorugremon was telling the truth about the snake's bite being painless. The snake suddenly wrapped itself around his body, something that greatly surprised the small digimon, and opened its mouth, revealing fangs glistening in snake poison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't hurt, please don't hurt, please don't hurt!\" Armadillmon said, closing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt something push into his stomach, but tat was about it. He opened his eyes, seeing the snake's fangs buried deep into his body. It's mouth retracted as the fangs pulled out. The snake unwrapped itself from his body as it slithered back into the darkness of the cell. Armadillmon placed a tentative hand on his stomach, which  began gurgling loudly. It didn't hurt at all, but now his body felt weird. His stomach began growing in his hand! It was piling up with fat, growing rounder and rounder. He felt the rest of his body undergoing the same changes as well, his limbs rounding out as fat piled on. His cheeks felt fuller and softer, as his stomach became a round ball. The sensation stopped as he looked at his body. He gained 50 pounds of fat in that bite!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've decided to go a little bit easier on you, since you're relatively young. I know I promised to have the snakes bite you at least four times, but I think once will be enough.\" Dorugreymon said through the cell door. Armadillmon sighed in relief as he rubbed his swollen stomach. \"But don't think this will get you out of your punishment. You still have twelve snakes to go, and the last snake still gets to bite you as many times as I wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew this wouldn't be that easy.\" Armadillmon sighed, grabbing his soft stomach and kneading the new fat into him.</span></div></div>",

Oh right, the THIRTEEN snakes... So obviously that one was the first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell either way, it did feel pretty nice getting all fattened up like that. Armadillomon rubbed his claws and poked his stomach to get that nice feeling, but as he was distracted, two more snakes were there and they lunged at Armadillomon, both biting his stomach.

Totally bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmadillomon moaned intensely, feeling as the weight gain was about to start, his stomach gurgling and gurgling, before it continued to expand with fat. Expanding slowly and steadily, Armadillomon savored the moments. He really did often gain weight, but never this much and it never felt this good. Armadillomon rubbed his stomach more, earning more moans from him, his shell still expanding with him. If this was the two regular serpents, he would have stopped a while ago, but he's still going! Growing and growing, he winced again as he felt his shell reach another ceiling and started pushing hard against it. Well, he WAS in a dungeon. And dungeons are often below the buildings. So this was obviously the main building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis ceiling was harder to break open, the cracks getting bigger and bigger only oh so slowly. But his weight gain was impatient and continued to grow around him, filling up practically the whole room, some of the fat on the side pushing open any windows and making some holes in the wall. It took a while for him to finally break through this roof, but obviously there was still some growing fat and he almost shot up with the sudden gain, the whole building breaking down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened to Dorugremon? Oh, right. He's somewhere else. I'm more focused on the expansions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as the weight gain started to slow down, the rest of those gargantuan snakes bit on him (the rest of them, meaning... 5 of them.) and they were even BIGGER than the previous ones!

If this was how he felt from one snake, he was terrified about what he'd be like after he finished with the others.<br>\r\nDorugremon chuckled meanwhile, observing the now morbidly obese digimon struggling to move.  He said with a grin, \"Glad to see you're receiving a fitting punishment.  Still, something tells you should give it a second chance.\"<br>\r\nArmadillomon was using his now pudgy claws to clutch at his gut when the snake bite's second effect began to occur.  He observed himself, all jiggly, and found himself enjoying his new physique.  He even wanted to expand further.  He needed to get fatter.  Suddenly, he snapped back to reality as another snake, double the size of the first one, bit him.  He immediately began to expand with more fat, getting a perverse pleasure from his growth.  He developed new rolls on his stomach and began to get a third chin.  His claws became so pudgy he couldn't use them, but since his stomach had expanded out so far, he had been lifted off the ground anyways.  Even his small tail had become covered in fat.<br>\r\nDorugremon began to laugh as Armadillomon became lost in the bizarre pleasure.  He began to rub his stomach, despite his mind telling him he shouldn't.  Still, the sensation of his sensitive rolls of fat being rubbed by his softened paws was divine.  He was excited to gain more just to increase that wonderful feeling.  He began to say something that sounded like \"More!\" but it was muffled by his fat cheeks.  Then, he snapped back to reality, telling himself he couldn't and shouldn't enjoy such a disgusting practice.  However, he had to admit that being fat and content had an upside.  He couldn't decide what to do; should he enjoy it, or despise it?<br>\r\nDorugremon, noticing his inner conflict, said, \"Remember that if you don't enjoy it, you'll be able to leave, but you'll never experience this feeling again.

Like the sound of wet rubber being pulled taught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilmon, do you hear that?\" whispered Takato as he looked around for the source of the noise which was slowly growing louder.<br>\r\n\"Not only that, Takato,\" replied Guilmon sounding a little tense, \"I feel it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato looked over at Guilmon and saw that he looked somewhat bigger that before. Peering through the dim light of the hut, Takato could see that Guilmon seemed to be standing up straighter than usual and he definitely looked thicker than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do ya mean?\" asked Takato as he took a step towards Guilmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato could see now. Guilmons muscles seemed to have doubled in size. He no longer had the small paunch he'd always had. Instead there was a thick six-pack in its place. His legs were about a foot wide and his arms the same. In short it looked like he was about two hundred and fifty pounds of pure muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Guilmon, it really worked! I bet you're much stronger now.\"<br>\r\n\"But Takato I still don't feel good.\" Guilmon wined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato didn't understand at first, but then he saw it. Guilmons muscles were still growing! As Takato watched they seemed to almost double in size over the course of a minute. Guilmon had to be almost 500lbs. now and was starting to have trouble moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Guilmon had to be at least four times Takato's height.  The boy didn't even come up to his bulging calf muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay Takato.  A bit scared, but okay.  I just hope I won't grow anymore.\"  Unfortunately, that was to no avail, as Guilmon's muscles became more firm and larger.    He bent down on his knees and stomach to avoid destroying the hut, but in a matter of seconds his back and shoulders were pressing against the ceiling and the cracking continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika and Renamon looked up in awe.  Right before their eyes, Guilmon, the dopey little digimon they had always known and respected, was now growing into a virtual titan of muscle and power.  With his strength alone, he could probably wipe out any champion--even any ultimate level digimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon's tail pushed far back against one wall while his arms and legs began to push against the other walls.  His humongous neck began to stretch out, forcing his large snout to push out towards Takato, who had little room left to move about within the hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takato!\" cried Guilmon, \"you've got to get out of here!  Take the others and run away!  If I can't stop growing, I could accidentally crush you all--and I won't let that happen!\"  The gigantic digimon moaned as his entire back now pushed against the ceiling, causing it to fracture and split in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna leave you Guilmon!\" replied Takato, \"You're my partner, and what kind of digimon tamer would I be if I abandoned you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takato, we don't have time for this!\" yelled Rika, \"I know you care for Guilmon, but he's trying to protect you.  At the rate he's growing, you'll end up--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you abandon Renamon if this was happening to her, Rika?\" interrupted Takato, who had tears in his eyes now.  Rika was left speechless.  He did have a point.  If this were happening to HER partner, she surely couldn't--no, she WOULDN'T ever dare abandon Renamon, even if it put her in imminent danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a large part of the ceiling collapsed and fell directly over Rika.  Renamon, sensing this, quickly jumped towards Rika, tackling her and rolling her out of the way before the debris smashed into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renamon,\" Rika said softly, \"thank you.\"  Without her partner, she'd be dead right now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it Rika.\" replied the fox digimon.  She smiled for a second, but then realized that in another minute that the entire hut was going to collapse.  \"We have to get out of here now Rika.\"  Rika nodded and yelled to Takato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey goggle-head, we're getting out of here, and I know that this hurts abandoning him, but Guilmon will be fine, so get your butt out of there!\"  With that, the duo was out the door and far from the hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Takato wasn't listening.  He merely hugged the muzzle of his titanic friend, tears streaming down the cheeks of his face.  He felt ashamed to be crying like this.  He hadn's cried this much since Guilmon first digivolved into Growlmon, and even though he looked big and scary, it was only a fraction of the intimidation that Guilmon's current size and power showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Guilmon's in trouble,\" thought Takato, \"I'll be there for him, EVEN IF IT COSTS ME MY LIFE!\"  A moment later, as the building was ready to collapse, he heard a soft voice from somewhere close to him.  It was Guilmon's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takato, I know that you care about me.  I'm greatful for that, but I can't let you do this.  I care about you too much to let anything bad happen to you because of me.  Don't worry about me, I'll be okay.\"  The big simpleton smiled as he reached out a massive claw for Takato, gently holding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Takato snatched gently in one arm, Guilmon cocked back the other arm, his muscles bulging as they did, and puched with all of his force a hole in the wall were Takato was just standing.  The hole was a good ten feet high and several feet wide.  The giant digimon then took one final look at his partner with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you, tamer.\"  He then pushed the arm holding Takato through the hole, which was relatively small to Guilmon at his current size, and gently let his tamer go.  Takato fell softly onto the grass outside the hut and looked back as the giant arm grew and the hut itself began to give way altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilmon!\" shouted the young boy as the hut nearly exploded, sending dust and debris everywhere.  A big chunk of it nearly came falling towards Takato, but then a yellow blur snatched him away before it landed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato looked to see just what had saved him at the last second and found himself in the arms of Renamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Takato?\" she asked.  Takato nodded yes.  Once again the fox digimon saved the day.  She released him on the ground and nodded to Rika a few feet away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a good thing we stayed around or else you'd be as flat as a pancake right about now, goggle-head.\"  stated the slightly-sassy female tamer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thank you both.\" he answered back.  With that, he turned towards the remains of the hut to see that the dust had cleared and now standing amongst the wreckage was a towering, muscular-built, god-like, fifty-foot Guilmon.  His body was rippling with muscles and power.  Every part of his body--his arms, legs, chest, theighs, neck, back, hind-end, claws and feet, even his tail was built to solid perfection.  His yellow eyes had narrowed becoming shinier and more open and slightly changed to a nearly pure golden color.  His defined mouth was filled with solid shining pearl white teeth that were sharper than any blade and harder than solid steel.  His chest and stomach were colored in a pure snow white while the rest of his body was colored in a fiery bright red.  His claws and toes were much thicker and sharper now as well.  The markings on his body had grown with him as well, becoming darker and more well designed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilmon!\" cried out Takato, \"can you hear me Guilmon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the titan of a digimon turned towards where the sound came from.  Apparently, that card also heightened Guilmon's hearing, sight, smell, and touch as well as his overall size and strength.  He looked down to see what looked at first like three dolls a few yards away.  But when he squinted his eyes, he found them to be Takato, Renamon, and Rika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Takato, I can hear you!\" he shouted, not knowing how loud his voice was now, as it caused a small quake in the area and shook the trees, causing entire flocks of birds to take to the skies.  Takato was in shock of Guilmon's voice alone, and wondered just how powerful was he now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon looked back and was glad to see his partner safe from harm, when he realized one thing:  He had stopped growing--for the time being anyway.  It seemed as though the card's power had worn off, but you could never be sure.  With that he walked over towards the gang gently, for he also knew that his new size meant extra weight--by a couple tens (if not hundreds) of tons in this case--which meant possible damage even at the slightest gesture.  It was when he was right in front of them that something a few feet off in the forest came out, which turned out to be...</span></div></div>",

The only thing that disproved that was the fact that the object in question was moving slightly and low groans were coming from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving closer Takato reached out a hand and felt the off white surface before him. It was soft and warm and as he did so another groan came from the figure. Looking up he could see where the expanse of white ended and roles of red started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Guilmon?' Takato asked hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon opened his eyes, which in and of itself was a slightly harder action, and stared down at Takato from the mass of roles that was his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Takato?' Guilmon mumbled, even his voice sounded extremely fat, 'What's going on?'<br>\r\n'I don't know.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon was, in a word, immense. Resting on his belly in the center of the room, he almost filled it up. He had to be almost a thousand pounds already. His gut pushed him up almost to the ceiling. His tail was thicker around than his whole body had been. His legs had been absorbed into his mammoth gut all the way down to his feet. His arms were nearing the same fate, only a few inches showed besides his clawed hands witch were themselves too thick to close. His neck was incredible, fourteen chins and cheeks that looked like they held basketballs. The top of his muzzle was covered with enough flab to hang down and cover all but the very front of his mouth when he talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What exactly did you wish for?' asked Takato<br>\r\n'To never be hungry again.'<br>\r\n'Oh man. This is not good. All the food around you is being absorbed into your body.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact now that Takato knew what was going on, he could see tiny, almost invisible, streams of data flowing into Guilmon. As Takato stood there and watched, he could see Guilmon growing. Every second that passed brought another inch of blubber to his body after ten seconds another chin came into view on Guilmons already overly fat face. Soon he'd be too big for the hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Takato do?</span></div></div>",

One second Takato was standing their, stunned and bewildered as the data entered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike I said one second he was stunned, the next there was a *whump* as an enormous gut brought him crashing to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth tamer and Digimon watched (one with horror and the other with delight) as Takato swelled with blubber at the same pace as the titanic virus type. Growing by dozens of pounds every second he quickly began to fill Guilmons hiding spot. His legs already thick as trees along with his arms, his belly surging out already at 7, no 8, make that 9 feet and rising, he had only a few chins but each one was double the thickness of the last one with the biggest already 30 pounds with another forming benath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon couldn't be any happier with his tamers condition, something Takato didn't share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GUILMON!\" Takato shouted in ditress \"What did you do!\" He was close to tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Guilmon could move his head then he would tilt it in confusion at the sadness and anger in his tamers voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you upset Takatomon. I just made another wish too...\" Takato cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anoder wif!\" He was becoming muffled by his fattemning cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon would have nodded if he could \"Uh Huh. I wished I'd be like you. Thought it'd make me human like you but I guess it's working the other way huh?\" Guilmon said innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato's eye's bulged past the squint they were quickly being forced into. 'You mean I'm gonna get as big as Guilmon!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh that wasn't good. His dinosaur digimon was already into the thousands in terms of tonnage and looked like a red and white blob with a digital hazard sign stretch over it, his head all but hidden past the countless waves of blubber. If he was gonna be like Guilmon then that meant he'd join the rookies Blobular fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon giggled happily as he watched from outside as his tamer grew bigger and bigger, quickly flling up the small space and causing the walls to crack under expanding pressure. Soon Takato would be outside and as big as him, then they could be fat and happy together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing still bothered him though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why Takatomons cloths havent ripped?\" Thought the digimon who was pondering the mystery of why his already ton sized tamers cloths were expanding with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he could shrug he would, Guilmon just stayed silent and watched his tamer move up past his 2 ton and rocket past his third and fourth with mere moments between these milestones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was fun<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Triceps, biceps, quads, delts and pecs just to name a few ballooned at a fantastic rate, sadly his unmuscled bodyparts did not. It was fortunate that digimon don't really have bones or anything but data, because a flesh and blood creature's skin would have torn open from the several ton's of muscle the new Guilmon had already packed on.

That's a promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika simply smiled back and waved off as she continued pedaling out of sight.  She knew Renamon cared deeply for her and felt as though she would always take her feelings into consideration, even if it didn't show a lot of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon smiled as she returned to the house.  She walked back down to the basement, where she saw those same weights lying on the ground.  She walked over to them, picked one up and started to lift it up and down.  After a few minutes of lifting, she noticed something on the weight itself glow.  It was the incantations.  They lit up and caused the whole room to fill up with light.  Renamon dropped the weight in surprise and was shocked as the other ones started to light up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBright white light overtook the digimon as she covered her face.  There seemed to be no end to it, but after about another minute, in an instant, the light disappeared.  Renamon brought down her arms and looked around in shock and awe.  Nothing had happened to the basement or the weights themselves.  Everything appeared normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on here?\" thought the digimon to herself.  \"Maybe Rika's right about these things after all.  Well, I'm definitely going to take a break for a while and see what we can dig up about these weights tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do that, my little pet.  Nothing will save you when the time comes.\" said a dark voice from nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon gasped.  \"Who is there?  Who are you?\" she barked out.  \"Just how do you know about these things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry, my dear.  When the time comes, all will be answered and you will do my bidding.  Until then I must be going now.\"  The voice left with an echoing cackle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!  Come back!\"  shouted Renamon.  But there was no answer.  The dark presence had come and gone.  The digimon was scared somewhat.  She hadn't felt a presence this dark and wicked since the D-Reaper or the Parasimon.  \"I better let Rika know as soon as possible.\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon ran out the basement and out the front door, ready to find Rika.  However, when she ran out the front door, she smashed her head against the doorway.  When she came to a few seconds later, she saw the big gaping hole that was a good three or four inches tall now.  There were also cracks and bents along the sides of the doorway too from her massive arms.  She had just damaged Rika's doorway without even knowing it or feeling a thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god.\" she whispered. She looked at her surroundings and noticed her arms, legs, chest, and overall body had become slightly more muscular than a few minutes ago.  She could see veins and bulges of muscle along her body and she wasn't even flexing them.  This was beyond belief.  Her knew muscles also gave her a few more inches in height and made her a tad bit wider as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got to find Rika--NOW.\" said Renamon as she jumped high into the clear blue sky.  Time was of the essence.  </span></div></div>",

What the hell happened to you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" the vixen shrugged, her bigger breasts bouncing under her white furred collar, barely decent for the moment, \"I just woke up and I was like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're not freaking out?\" Rika asked in disbelief, \"You've spent years keeping your body in top physical condition, all that training, all those fights, and this new weight doesn't bother you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should it bother me?\" Renamon asked, \"I feel fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later her stomach growled and with barely an excuse the vixen moved past Rika towards the kitchen. Rika had never seen a binge outside of the time Takato had forgotten to feed Guilmon. Her jaw hung slack as the human tamer watched Renamon devour whole loaves of bread, slurping up jars of peanut butter and jelly in it's wake, fruit vegetables, blocks of cheese... Basically anything immediately edible and requiring little to no preparation soon found it's way down her throat as her belly stretched to contain it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long  her stomach looked like she'd swallowed a large beanbag chair and the kitchen had been nearly picked clean. With a sudden yawn Renamon waddled back out, brushing against her still stunned tamer as she moved to Rikas room and, without a word, flopped onto the mattress pad and dozed off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika stumbled into the room a minute later, still unable to believe what she was seeing as Renamons large belly gurgled and digested slowly. Silently the thought crept into her mind that maybe Renamon didn't look too bad like this.

Deciding to see what her human partner was up to, Renamon slowly lumbered out of the room and down the hall, her strong connection to her partner guiding her.

It was over twice as wide as she had been before.  Renamon rocked to her side to get a better look, and saw just how far the damage had spread.  Her thighs were three times as thick around, and her bottom and ballooned just as much.  Her arms were similarly thickened, threatening to rip apart her purple armguards.  The fluff on her chest was sticking out, too.  Further inspection showed that it had developed into a pair of large pillowy breasts that lay on the curve of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...

With a few more grunts she managed to lift herself from the bed and waddled over to one of Rika's full length mirrors, noticing the new rolling and jiggling sensations from her additional weight.  She turned to look at every angle, now noticing the fat on her neck forming a double chin and her face looking much fuller and rounder.  \"How did this happen to me?\"  Renamon pinched a belly roll just to make sure it wasn't a dream, but this was definitely reality.

And since she ate so much, the effect was to accelerate. Now her body would need more and more food, as shed continually grow bigger and bigger. <br>\r\nBut soon she stops thinking about all that because of how hungry she suddenly feels. Luckily for Renamon, Rika had just returned from the fast food restaurant with a car full of 100 hamburgers, the food that made her grow to begin with. <br>\r\n'Look Renamon, if you want get bigger, this is the right food. It has to many calories for humans, so imagine what it'll be like for a Digimon!'<br>\r\n'Yes!'<br>\r\nThen Renamon moved Rika out of her way, picked the 100 burgers, and put them all in her mouth, swallowing them in a single gulp. As Renamon rested, the 100 super fattening hamburgers have a big effect, which lasted some minutes. But in this span of time, the growth was magnificent. Renamon began to grow fatter and taller, bursting up into the second floor of the house. Her arms and legs were the size of motorcycles, her breasts were bigger than Rika, and her belly was the size of a medium car. Renamon's weight was most likely 1200 pounds. Rika just watch the massive growth and, when it was over, she had an idea. <br>\r\n'Renamon, I want to be big and fat, just like you, maybe even more! Why we don't go to the Digiworld and see if the food of there have the same effect on me?' <br>\r\n'All right Rika. But I won't be able to grow as fast there.' <br>\r\n'But with your increased appetite, I think you'll end up eating a lot there, much more that you used to eat here, and grow fat.' <br>\r\n'I guess so.

It was because the Rikas body was full of food that it couldn't support. So, the data of her body copied the data of Renamon's body, which was big enough to support such amounts of food. <br>\r\n'Oh, now I get it Renamon. But what do you think about my body?

By the end of the afternoon, all of the forest had disappeared off the map. And all that remained was just two immense Renamons. And when I say immense, I mean gigantic!

Now sit down and tell me what you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon nodded, realizing for the first time that the effort of storming out here had tired her out.  Slowly, she sat down on the steps leading into the TV room where Rika was.  She sighed, and said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know much about what happened.  I tried some of that food you gave me and ended up eating all of it.  Then, about a few seconds after I finished, I just fell over, going to sleep in an instant.  I woke up like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika looked thoughtful for a moment, and sat down next to her partner as she thought.

The fat fox Digimon didn't stop her, as she had done this before in thoughtful moments, although it did feel a little awkward with her new girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Rika said, \"Maybe it was something in the food.  Normally, you just eat healthier stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon frowned, her chubby face making the expression look cute.  \"Maybe,\" she said, \"But what could make me this fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika scowled.  \"I don't know.  But don't worry, I'll find out somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, and blinked, as Renamon's belly rumbled loudly.  She grinned, as Renamon blushed.  \"Sorry,\" she said, \"I guess I'm hungry again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika grinned, and poked Renamon's flabby gut.  \"Guess I better get you some food, then.  After all, we want to keep up your girlish figure.  I should probably get some breakfast as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that thought, Renamon shivered again.  \"Could we try and figure something out first?  Maybe call the guys and get their thoughts on this?  After what happened last night, I'm afraid to eat again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika frowned.  She hadn't thought of that.

She didn't want to wake Rika and would have been content to watch her sleep for a while longer.

Now the bloated female looked more at home as the 'circus fat lady'. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Renamon was big. And very big at that. Her stomach was the biggest part of it. Large enough to look like she swallowed an armchair and covering most of her legs.

Part of his but was what they'd seen sagging out the window, his cone of fat tail curling slightly above it against the wall. He wobbled and gurgled as he rested in yards of his own flab, both legs absorbed into thick dimpling swaths of it and arms close to doing the same with only claw-tips to be seen. His head was barely visible, the ears poking out above cheeks the size of a beachball and the bottom of his head pressed close into his fat. The TV had been scooped up by his belly now bigger than a car and rested in his folds as he sat watching it. He had to be more than a ton of scaly flab at the very least.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Renamon almost dropped the tray in amazement looking at his enormity.

And it's amazing, I can think so much clearer now. I feel like a new 'mon.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You look like you're the size of twenty at least,\" Rika muttered, \"Guilmon, where's Takato?

If his partner was already immobile, whats a few pounds in exchange for Guilmon being the world's greatest genius? \"Um... you can have a few too if you want...\" Takato said looking over at Renamon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The vixen smiled, entertained by Takato's attention to her figure. \"Oh, me and Rika just want to see what happened, though I wouldn't mind an order of fries or two.\" There was a bench on the opposite side of the room, that she and Rika walked over to. It would make for a good set of bleachers for the show, and only inches away from where the curve of where Guilmon's belly ended. \"Though Rika might want something.\" As they sat down, Renamon reached around her partner, pulling her more tightly against her adipose frame, squishing the girl's face into her flabby tits. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Takato just got to the task at hand. Guilmon was too fat to move or feed himself anymore, so Takato actually had to climb up on his belly to get to the dino's head. He kicked both shoes off, walking up the piles of flab until he got up Guilmon's flabby muzzle. Guilmon greeted him by rubbing his tubby cheeks against the boy, doing his best to nuzzle his partner. Then he started to slowly feed Guilmon his collection of burgers.</span></div></div>",

The quiz had started out fairly straightforward with questions like:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which of the following Digimon has the Special Skill 'Terra Force?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: HiAndromon<br>\r\nB: WarGreymon<br>\r\nC: Rosemon<br>\r\nD: Machinedramon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which of the following Digimon is NOT a Data Type?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Renamon<br>\r\nB: Lillymon<br>\r\nC: MachGaogamon<br>\r\nD: Gatomon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which of the following Digimon is a Digivolution of Veemon (directly or indirectly)?<br>\r\nA: Magnamon<br>\r\nB: Flamedramon<br>\r\nC: UlforceVeedramon<br>\r\nD: All of the above\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But it had started asking questions of a more arbitrary nature, such as:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TigerVespamon's name is derived from the scientific name of the Asian Giant Hornet. True or False?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A better question would be 'why are you even taking that quiz if it's so ridiculous,'\" Terriermon asked? \"It's not like anyone's forcing you to take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,\" Henry began, \"I had no idea this quiz would be this ridiculous for, one thing. Second, I really want to see just how extensive my knowledge of Digimon is.\" He turned his attention back to the quiz. \"Ok, what kind of question is this? This is just stupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just before saying that, Rikamon and Renamon teleported into the room. \"Isn't that basically the nature of trivia in general\" Rikamon asked, looking at the screen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe,\" Henry replied, briefly glancing at the fat vixens and then back to screen, \"but this question is downright unfair. It's showing me picture of an orange, reptilian Digimon's foot and asking me to identify what Digimon it is, but there are four different Digimon it could be: Agumon; Greymon; MetalGreymon; and WarGreymon. And I know trivia questions can be a bit obtuse, but this is like taking your driver's test and finding the question: 'You're driving down the road at 40 miles an hour, an ambulance is fast approaching on the wrong side of the road, and someone in the backseat has a gun to your head. What do you do?' With the correct answer being: 'You die like a man for the glory of Mother Russia.'\" Henry then blinked a few times, finally having registered what he had seen when he glanced at the girls, and slowly turned his head to look at them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hi, Henry,\" Renamon smiled. We've got quite a bit to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-y-yeah. You can say that again,\" Henry flusteredly responded, simultaneously confused, scared, intrigued, and mildly aroused by what he was looking at. \"And I have a lot of things to ask: why is Rika a Digimon now; why are you both so fat; what's all the food for; and what's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ok,\" Rikamon began, idly handing Terriermon a bag of food, which the digital rabbit began eating from. \"I'll answer your questions in order. 1st question: Renamon now has an ability to turn humans into Digimon and used it to turn me into a Renamon like her. 2nd question: the modelling business is slow right now, so mom's turned to showing up in fast food commercials, and has been given free food which I gave Renamon. It made her fat and somehow gave her that new power I mentioned earlier, which had a side effect of making me fat like her. 3rd question: we figured we could give some of this food to Terriermon to make him fatter and stronger. Speaking of which, 4th question: Renamon shared some of that food with Guilmon and he's somehow a Mega Digimon now. On top of that, Renamon's a low-level champion now, and has that new power. So we're here to make Terriermon stronger with food, and use Renamon's new power to turn you into a Terriermon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Henry was taken aback by how much information Rikamon had just given him; it was far more than he was expecting to say the least. \"That's quite a lot to take in. I don't really know how to-- Wait, you're gonna do WHAT to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You heard her,\" Renamon smirked. She placed the food she was carrying on Henry's bed, pointed her finger at Henry and closed her eyes. \"Zen Form!\" Her body began glowing, and a beam of light shot from her finger, engulfing Henry. \"Form of... a Terriermon!\" Renamon smiled as Henry's body began to change: his skin started turning into white fur with green markings; his ears grew long enough to reach his thighs; a short horn grew out from his forehead; and his body started to fatten up as well, stopping only when he was as fat as Rikamon. The light then faded and Henry's transformation stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're looking pretty good, Henry,\" Terriermon smirked. While he was eating, his own body had changed to the point where he was as tall as Gargomon, and just as fat as Renamon. He then looked over himself. \"Wow, and so am I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wow, you've certainly grown,\" Renamon said to Terriermon. \"You're as tall as Gargomon, and probably just as strong, too.\" Terriermon blushed at the compliment, and blushed even brighter when Renamon began rubbing his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Henry looked at his new body in the mirror hanging on his wall. He lifted his belly and jiggled it in his paws, barely able to comprehend that all that jiggling flab was now a part of him. He felt...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Some conflicting thoughts were going through Henry's mind. On the one hand, he'd be lying to himself and the other Digimon in the room if he said that he didn't like the feeling of his soft, velvety fur and squishy, jiggly flab, the latter of which he even found a bit arousing. Not to mention it was intriguing to think that a human could be turned into a Digimon at all. <i>Is this only possible because Rika and I have Biomerged with our partners, or can ANY human be turned into Digimon</i>, he thought? On the other hand, the fact that he was so easily going along with it was a bit disconcerting. Not to mention he had no idea how his parents would react to seeing that their son had transformed into a fat, anthropomorphic, digital rabbit. Suzie would probably be happy to see that her big brother was now a big, soft rabbit, but that wasn't really putting his mind at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How's it feel to be a soft rabbit, 'Henrymon,'\" Rikamon asked? \"I bet it feels nicer than being a hard, metallic one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,\" Henry replied, paying no mind to the nickname the vixen had just given him, \"this warm, soft fur DOES feel nicer than MegaGargomon's cold, hard armor. And I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel calm and relaxed in this body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I imagine you'd feel more relaxed as a plush toy than you would as a weapon to surpass Metal Gear,\" the ever-snarky Terriermon said, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Very funny,\" Henry rolled his eyes. \"But what worries me is just how calm and relaxed I am. I can't tell if I'm simply loosening up bit, or if my mind was in some way altered by the transformation, and, if the latter, I can't help but worry if your minds were affected too. I think would should have Hypnos check us over and, if nothing else, at least see if anything bad's happening to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Altered our minds,\" Rikamon asked? \"Henry, did you even listen to what you just said? The fact that you're even slightly worried about this should be proof enough that your mind is still completely intact. If you were completely calm about this, then maybe - keyword \"maybe\" - that would mean our minds were altered, but, as you said, even that could just mean that you're just loosening up a bit, so it wouldn't be THAT concerning. Besides, I can tell that you're enjoying this as much as I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W-what do you mean,\" Henry asked? Rikamon's tone in her last sentence was bit more... seductive than he was expecting. \"And, for that matter, how can you tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,\" Rikamon said, walking over to Henry while seductively swinging her hips, \"you took biology with me, so I know you know this, but I guess I'll have to remind you about it. When animals are sexually aroused, they give off pheromones that other animals can smell. Humans once had the ability to smell them too, but, thanks to evolution, that ability has been lost to time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That explains why humans are always playing head games with each other instead of making love,\" Renamon joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And what does that have to do with anything,\" Henry asked? He didn't like where the conversation was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"In case it wasn't obvious,\" Rikamon began, now having pressed her flabby body up against Henry's, \"you're now a rabbit and I'm now a vixen. With my new canine nose, I can smell your arousal clear as day. Hell, I could smell it the moment you saw us. I'm fully aware that you want these puppies.\" She then lifted her coconut-sized breasts up to the poor bunny's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Henry blushed as red as a tomato; this was a lot to handle. In recent years, he had discovered that he was a furry and that he was more into furry porn (including Digimon related furry porn) than he wanted anyone to know, and now he felt like one of his furry porn fantasies had come to life. Ever since Rikamon and Renamon had arrived, he was very quickly learning that he had a fetish for big bellies and the feeling of Rikamon pressing her belly into his own was quite a turn-on for him. Rikamon was pressing all of his buttons, and he was simultaneously loving and hating it. He could feel his growing erection pressing into his belly, making him grateful that his belly at least provided him some modesty; at least he didn't have to worry about getting charged with Public Indecency if he left the house in his new body. \"Ok Rikamon, you win; I'm turned on by all of this.\" He hoped that admitting this would make Rikamon relent with with her sexual advances, which thankfully, it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm glad you see it my way, Henrymon,\" Rikamon said pulling away from the horny bunny. \"I think now you can see why Renamon and I are so calm about all this; our minds don't need to be altered to know that we like how all this feels.\" Renamon nodded in agreement with her partner's statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess I can get used to this, and being called 'Henrymon,'\" Henrymon said, defeated. \"Can we at least go see Yamaki later and find out how this is all possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rikamon smiled. \"We can do that. Right now, I think...\"</span></div></div>",

The were only one of two customers inside at that moment (which suited the Digimon just fine), but Takato and Guilmon were nowhere to be seen; just Takato's parents, Yoshie and Takehiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hello,\" Yoshie greeted the Digimon, likely recognizing Rikamon and Henrymon because they still had their human hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hi, Mrs. Matsuki,\" Henrymon nervously said. \"Is Takato around? We've got a few things to talk to him about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry,\" Takehiro answered. \"He asked us to help him take Guilmon over to the park a few hours ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see,\" Rikamon sighed. At least she could get some treats while she was there. She looked at some very big cakes behind the counter; each one was big enough to feed ten people... or two or three obese Digimon. And there a lot of doughnuts on sale for about \u00a550 apiece. \"How much for three of those cakes and four dozen doughnuts?\" She pulled some money out of her pocketbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's quite a lot of sweets, Rika,\" Yoshie said. \"What's the occasion; throwing a party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess you could say that,\" Rikamon replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ok. Well three large cakes and four dozen doughnuts would round out too...\" Yoshie punched some numbers into the cash register. \"Ah yes, that would round out to about \u00a57,230.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author's Note: That rounds out to about $66.52 USD)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm,\" Rikamon put a paw to her chin. \"That's much cheaper than I was expecting.\" She paid for the baked goods, and Yoshie gave them to her in very large bags. \"Thank you, Mrs. Matsuki.\" She bowed as much as she could with her belly in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're most welcome, Rika,\" Yoshie smiled. With that, the four obese Digimon waddled outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Jeez, Rikamon,\" Terriermon said. \"How can you afford to spend that much yen at once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,\" Rikamon smirked, putting her pocket book back between her breasts, \"between my mom's successful modelling career and my own winnings at Digimon card tournaments, my family has plenty of money. Besides, if we're going to turn Takato and the others into fat Digimon like us, it helps to have as much food as possible. And knowing Takato, he probably already brought as much bread to Guilmon's old hideout as possible. Anyway, let's hurry up and get to the park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once again, the obese Digimon held paws and teleported away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The four Digimon arrived just outside of Guilmon's old hideout, and it seemed much bigger than it was when they first saw it; it had gone from a small stone hut built into the side of a hill, to a small stone hut built into the side of a hill with a house-sized room dug into the back, complete with a tile floor, wood paneling on the walls, and a wooden ceiling. On top of having a much larger room, there were some furnishings such as - among other things - a door, some beds, a mirror, a space heater, a couch, a table, and even a half-bath, bizarrely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Someone's been doing some renovations in the six years since the D-Reaper incident,\" the ever-snarky Terriermon said. He and the other Digimon waddled inside and saw Guilmon eating from a pile of bread as big as he was while Takato rubbed his massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Takato looked over at the four Digimon and was clearly surprised by what he saw. \"Whoa, what happened to you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,\" Rikamon began, \"Renamon apparently has a new move that lets her turn humans into Digimon and makes them fat in the process. Actually, I'm wondering if Guilmon and Terriermon have the same ability. Anyway, she used it on me, I decided I liked being an obese Digimon, and we decided to share this gift with the others, starting with Henry.\" She pointed to the blushing Henrymon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait a minute, you got Henry to go along with this?\" Takato blinked a few times. \"How did you get him agree to this? Wouldn't he be freaking out and wanting to talk to Yamaki about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Henrymon blushed even more. \"Well, y-you see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rikamon brought one of Henrymon's furry porn fantasies to life by teasing him with her tits,\" Terriermon said bluntly. Rikamon and Renamon giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Henrymon's entire face turned bright red; his secret was out. \"Thanks, Mr. Smooth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Takato blinked a few more times; Henry being into furry porn was definitely not something expected to learn when he woke up that morning. Then again, he also didn't expect Guilmon to grow to the size of a car or become a Mega just by eating fast food, and he also didn't expect to see Rika and Henry become obese Digimon and start calling themselves \"Rikamon\" and \"Henrymon.\" His eyes widened a bit when he realized something. \"Wait, are you guy here to turn me into a Guilmon? Because, I'd actually like that a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's right, Takato,\" Renamon smiled. She put down the food she was still carrying, pointed her paw finger at Takato and closed her eyes. \"Zen Form!\" Her body began glowing, and a beam of light shot from her finger, engulfing Takato. \"Form of... a Guilmon!\" Renamon smiled as Takato body began changing: red and white scales covered his skin; his human ears changed to bat wing-like ones and moved to the top of his head; his face elongated into a reptilian muzzle; and the Digital Hazard symbol appeared on his belly, which began to fatten up, stopping only when he was a fat as Rikamon and Henrymon. Then the light faded and Takato's transformation completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Takatomon is a Guilmon like me?\" Guilmon giggled excitedly; his best friend was just like him now, and he couldn't have been happier for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That I am, boy,\" Takato smiled. \"I really am Takatomon now.\" The two obese dinosaurs hugged each other tightly and nuzzled each other's cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's the most precious thing I've seen in quite a while,\" Rikamon said sincerely. \"Anyway, I think the next tamer we should give this gift to is Jeri; I think she'd like being a big, strong and fat Leomon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm actually curious to see what a female Leomon would look like,\" Renamon added. \"Would she look just like a male one, or would she be more like a real lioness and lack a mane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"In that case,\" Takatomon said, \"I can call her and ask her to come here.\" He then grabbed his phone off the bed and called Jeri, something found relatively difficult with his new clawed hands. \"Hi Jeri. I was wondering if you could come meet me and the others at Guilmon's old hideout in the park. We've got a surprise for you... Ok, I'll see you soon.\" He then hung up. \"She'd be here within half an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ok then,\" Rikamon said. She and Renamon began setting the food out on the table. \"Yeah, we've brought lots of food; we're gonna need it given how much Digimon can eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A little while later...</span></div></div>",

It was very small, hard to spot unless one knew what to look for. But as Renamon's keen eyes watched the curve of her stomach as she stood still, she could see it increasing a millimeter at a time with every heartbeat. And that wasn't all. After her transformation, Rikamon had grown to almost the same height as Renamon (maybe an inch shorter), but now Renamon felt herself looking down ever so slightly to meet her partners eyes as the tip of Rikamon's vixen nose was about level with Renamon's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It... ooooh, feels so good Rikamon,\" Renamon moaned, rubbing her body happily as she felt it tingle all over from the expansion, \"So nice...\" Unfortunately for Renamon the changes stopped far sooner than she was ready for them too. In the end she'd grown maybe another couple inches and perhaps a proportional fifty pounds of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, what just happened?\" Terrirmon muttered with a cocked head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't know,\" Henrymon mused putting his new pawed hand to his chin and getting distracted for a moment as he felt a 'double chin' under it, \"It happened after Renamon changed me though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So maybe if I change someone else it'll happen again?\" Renamon asked, sounding a little too eager to try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ooh, we should go try it on Takato next,\" Rikamon smiled, \"I bet he'd love this.

They're the only ones with the technology to figure out what's happening to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a moment of silence. \"How about wee put it to a vote?\" Renamon asked.</span></div></div>",

A Renamon like me.\" The chubby vixen looked at her, \"Almost exactly how I used to be. Before Rika could speak again, her body felt warm. It appeared the data was still being altered. The clothes that were on Rika's body ripped off and reformed around her wrists, much like Renamon's gloves. Her fur became a slightly darker shade, looking more like it was her natural hair color, and her hair spiked back a bit to show her new ears peeking out. The emblem that was on her shirt now appeared on her legs in place of the previous markings. A belt appeared that wrapped around one of her shoulders and down on her opposite hip. The energy stopped, meaning the changes have ceased. The fat Digimon chuckled, \"Actually, you look more than a Renamon, you're more of a...Rikamon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her partner laughed, Rika's new hands clenched into fists. She ran closer and threw a punch. The punch landed hard, but it was merely bounced off of all the fat. Still, the impact caused Renamon to take a few steps back from the force. She looked astonished to her partner, \"Rika?! Why did you do that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate this!\" She spoke, \"Why did you turn me into a Digimon!\" Rika threw another punch, but this time Renamon had enough speed (oddly enough) to dodge it. \"My life was fine as a human! Now look at me! I didn't want this! What will my friends say? What will my mom think?!\" The newly made Digimon gently grasped her head as she fell to her knees. \"I...I never wanted this...\" Deep down Renamon knew it was the wrong decision, but she made it so that Rika could see how it was. But now, she only caused more pain to her partner. The chubby vixen waddled and sat beside her partner. A hand was extended and Rika was soon embraced in a warm but fat hug. \"I'm...I'm sorry Rika\" Renamon apologized.</span></div></div>",

Before another word could be said, Rikamon ran out the door in a burst of speed; too fast and too sudden for Renamon to catch with.

It made a beeline to a tree, the tree Rikamon was in. Gently, the robed figure began to float up higher. Rikamon's new sensitive ears picked up something, causing her eyes to open. She made a startled gasp as the robed figure was right in front of her. She could see two red glowing eyes deep within the hood. \"Hello...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while for Rikamon to calm down, let alone have the courage to even speak. This was not a good time to even speak with her. But, the digimon muttered a few words, \"W-Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" the figured chuckled. \"I'm what you can call, a friend. You seem to need one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I have friends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You mean like the one that gave you those burgers, or the one that tried to turn you into a fat version of herself?\" Both of the memories stung and caused her to breakdown again. However, a tissue was handed to her. \"Now now\" the figure spoke, \"Don't cry...\" Rikamon took the tissue ad wiped her eyes. She did feel a little better now, oddly enough. \"Now, I've come to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Help?\" Rikamon asked, \"Y-You can turn me human again?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly, I am afraid not.\" This caused the digimon to lower her head. \"But, I think I can help you with something else. A bit of...proper payback.\" Rikamon turned as the figure went on. \"You see, unlike your \"friends\" I know the real reason behind this. Those nasty fast food burgers have this nasty chemical that affects the code for Digimon. The chemical causes a digimon to grow stronger, unfortunately causes a...\"big\" side effect.\" Rikamon nodded as she understood. \"Now, payback is what comes to mind to the digimon known as Renamon. She thinks she can get more powerful no matter if she's fat or not. And she may be a champion now, I have a better idea. However, you must ask me what you want first. You want to let your \"partner\" get away with this, or do you want to face her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikamon pondered for a few seconds before looking, \"I'm listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have two things.\" He held up two items in each of his hands. One looked like a vial of this blue fizzing liquid, while the other was a larger burger. \"The vial in my hand has a special chemical inside of it. Unlike the chemical in those burgers, this one will instead cause one's body to grow healthier. I'm talking about height, muscle, energy; everything better than the repulsive fatness. And, there's another, dare I say unique characteristic to this chemical. While the chemicals in the burger made a Digimon more powerful by rank, this chemical makes your power equal to the higher rank without changing anything. Imagine yourself now young Rika, body that was a big and beautiful and strong as a Mega Digimon, but your class was no different than a Rookie! Then imagine this; you have the power of a Mega as a Rookie, and you still have the capability of digivolving...\" That thought lingered in Rikamon's mind, and she had to admit that sounded really good; <b>really</b> good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the other hand\" he held up the bigger burger, \"This burger has sort of a reversing agent chemical. If Renamon eats this, her power will weaken. But, her fat will double each time this happens! So if she thinks she can get more powerful with each new roll under her chin, we'll add ten rolls under her chin and make her the weakest digimon ever!\" The figure \"smirked\" to her, \"Now, the only think you have to do now is choose.\"</span></div></div>",

After about a minute, the changes stopped. Rikamon jumped down to try and compare herself. She flexed and arm, seeing a decently sized bicep pulse up. Looking down, she saw a nice large round pair of breasts, about D cup, greet her sight. Her head nearly hit a tree branch, which last time she needed to jump to even reach. So she had to guess she was about eight feel tall now.

I can't think of a better person to give a new... beautiful shape to.\" Renamon smiled. So they set a trap. They waited at the front door for Seiko to come home. Two flabby renamon with infinite patience. Later, appearing with a bag of groceries, Rika's grandmother opened the door, holding a single paper bag full of groceries. They were both so eager that the maternal tones of Renamon and the young eager voice of Rikamon blended together. \"ZEN FORM!\" Energy shot out from both of them, mixing in mid air with a brilliant spiral pattern, before striking the elderly Seiko, who instantly dropped her groceries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah!\" She shouted, before the bag hit the ground with a dull thud. Vegetables rolled over the floor as she was stunned with two beams of white, radiant energy. Before their eyes, she grew. She gained weight as a massive pace, bursting out of her clothes, almost like she was digivolving. Unlike Rika, who took time transforming into a renamon form, Seiko's twin burst of energy made her explode into a morbidly obese vulpine. She looked much like Rika, but almost twice as heavy! Her belly sunk down three feet in front of her, past her knees! Her arms rested on massive rolls and boobs that would make any man drool! At least four chins framed her face and propped her head up, letting her softbal sized cheeks rest on more furry flab. At the end though, she didn't have any wrinkles, or signs of weakness. Even with rollging thighs, and hips that couldn't fit through the door behind her, she seemed strong, balanced, powerful. The flab on her frame just served to show how much weight she could throw around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the new renamon Seiko looked up...</span></div></div>",

She squeezed her boobs, getting a fresh new charge from her body. \"Ypur grandma can feed you....mmmmm\" She moaned, not used to the wave of pleasure that washed over her, or the total lack of inhibition that came with being a digimon. She waddled forward, squeezing her fat bod between her grandaughter and renamon. \"This body is amazing, why not put it to work?\" Seikomon waddled through them, her massive vulpine body shaking and jiggling wildly with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery motion was filled with energy and stregth. She seemed not to mind that she was waddling around with eight hundred pounds of flab on her. Rikamon and Renamon just followed. Rika, having adapted quickly to the idea of having more \"fun\" with renamon needed a second to register her grandmother's new youth and energy. She had blushed a bit when her Grandma sucked her own tit. How would she manage breast feeding from her? Still she followed and watched as Seikomon sat down on their living room couch, her massive form nearly taking up the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikamon smiled seeing just how massive her grandmother was now in profile. Her soft belly managed to reach the small table in front of the sofa, and it gently melted against the hard surface. \"Well dear, come on,\" She reached up, arm fat pressing against her as she hefted up her new breasts. \"Grandma Seiko wants to make sure you're well fed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon didn't hesitate for a second, walking around, and pressing her fat body against her elder digimon. She latched on and started to suckle from Seikmon nipple. Rika waited a second, her young mind still rushing, trying to pick up everything that had happened. Still, when it stopped, she was hungry, and someone she loved dearly was offering to feed her. Why not get back into nursing? Especially when it made Seikomon so happy? She waddled up, feeling their heavy flab push against each other. She pressed her muzzle against her grandmother's breast, the skin firm from arousal. Slowly, she started nursing from the fatty breast, a white, heavy cream pouring into her throat. Rika was instantly hooked, but she managed to hear her grandmother moan in the background...</span></div></div>",

In amazement Rika realized her 'grandmother' was growing additional breasts all along her belly like a feral fox. No less than four pairs were developing under her original  two, which was bringing Seikomons breast count to an incredible ten. Non matched her top-most pair for size, but even the second largest just under her original set would have put most models to shame and each below that was only slightly smaller before long.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my,\" she moaned feeling all the new orbs bouncing and jiggling on either side of her big belly, large nipples all standing at attention as they tried to hold back the milk inside, \"I'm becoming quite the milk factory it seems.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">I've seen too many Digimon weight gain stories where it's only the Digi Destined that change and almost never the Digimon themselves. So this is a story for everyone who wants to see Digimon grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, I want a clean story. No mature themes. No blood and guts. And no Gay/Lesbian stuff (I don't have anything against such people, I just don't want such things in my stories).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you need reference pics for Digimon, most if not all can be found here: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Digimon_Wiki\" target=\"_blank\">http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Digimon_Wiki</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT: You can involve the kids as well, but I want the focus to be kept on the Digimon.<br>\r\nEDIT 2: I reserve the right to edit chapters as they are posted. I will fix spelling errors, grammatical errors, and try to make the chapter flow a bit more smoothly. But I will do my best to keep the chapter to what the poster wanted to happen. If you have a problem with that, tell me and I'll see what I can do.<br>\r\nEDIT 3: I won't tolerate /human/ vore. creature vore is fine. though.<br>\r\nEDIT 3.5: I'm expanding this to include Digimon vore. Any creature that is not intelligent is free to eat, though. Fish, deer, ect.<br>\r\nEDIT 4: Villans can vore characters, but I'd rather refrain from the heroes doing vore, ok? This is not an iron clad rule. It can be broken now and then. But I don't want to see a dozen chapters on vore in one line of the story, if you catch my drift. Fattening or muscle growth with some macro or microism thrown in is fine, though.<br>\r\nEDIT 5: I reserve the right to delete chapters that are either crudely written or absurdly short and only there because someone wants to control the next decisions made without contributing anything to the story.</td>",
