In the beginning, the people followed the spirits, and all was peaceful. But that era of peace soon came to an end. The evil Demon King rose to power, destroying everything in his path. The spirits had no choice but to face him in battle. The war that ensued seemed to last an eterity, and much blood was shed. Finally, the spirits subdued the Demon King, although they could not destroy him. Their powers were heavily depleted. With their remaining power, they buried his spirit in a dark, dark realm. They built shackles to imprison him, along with a tower that acted acted as a lock. These shacles cover the land to this day. With their power drained, the spirits returned to the heavens. Suddenly berefit of both demons and spirits, the land was entrusted to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Do I know how to tell a good story or what!\", said a very familiar old man. \"I call it \"Spirits and Demons...at War!\"\", he exclamed proudly. \"I only do this once a year, you know! It's a blasted masterpiece! A...a...a blasterpiece!\", he rambled. \"What's this?\", he asked, \"You fell asleep during my magnum opus?\" (You lay there, sleeping on the ground. You get up and looked at the old man.) \"I can't believe this! you know, Link... A lot of people would love t be in you're position. As my roommate, you get to se my work for free!\", he kept rambling on. \"Plus\", he continued, \"I'm not getting any younger here. This story might be the only thing that proves I existed.

Go crazy,<br>\r\n but remember it's E rated. Here's a few rules to balance the fun out a little. Think of this as a creative test, just for you! So get going!<br>\r\nStay with the game, Don't stray from the \"tracks\". (Heh heh, get it?)<br>\r\nIT IS E RATED!!!!!!!!!!!!! Be appropriate with this people!<br>\r\nTry to still involve Link.<br>\r\nAdd any new character from your character to demons. Be creative too.<br>\r\nPrincess Zelda MUST be in this!!! The story would fall apart without Zelda in it.<br>\r\nTry to keep the demons in it too.<br>\r\nHave fun! (Yay, fun!)<br>\r\nP.S. Honest to god try to have SOME clue of the game, watch walkthroughs <br>\r\non Youtube if you have to. <br>\r\nI made this because I once daydreamed \"Wouldn't it be cool if you could change<br>\r\nanything you wanted in a video game?\" Then this was born.</td>",
