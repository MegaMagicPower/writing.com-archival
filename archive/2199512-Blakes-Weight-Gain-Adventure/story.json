            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake Lange is a 17 year old teenage boy, living in suburban New Jersey. He lives with his father, Marty Lange. His mother passed away in his childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty has two other step-children from his second marriage.  Jesse, a 13 year old boy and Eden, an 10 year old girl are Blake\u2019s two step-siblings. They live only 25 minutes away and have bedrooms in the Lange household, but only stay there on the occasional weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake isn\u2019t what you\u2019d call an athletic teenager. He\u2019s got plenty of friends but never has participated in athletics apart from little league and soccer in his early childhood. Over the past year or two, Blake has begun gaining weight. He and his father chalk it up to puberty, but Marty is concerned about his son. There\u2019s not really anyone overweight on his side of the family, and he\u2019s not sure why Blake has started ballooning, besides the fact that he eats non stop and exercises very little. Marty hopes once Blake isn\u2019t a hormonal teen that his weight will plateau.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Lange looks at his growing son and can\u2019t help but think of his little boy. But things have changed, as his son now outweighs him by almost 75 pounds. That\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s all fat, his son is a few inches taller than him at an impressive 6\u20192\u201d and somewhere around 235 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty worries he\u2019s not being a good caretaker to Blake, but Blake is becoming his own man and he tries desperately to let him live his life independently. And he does. Blake has his own car and plenty of friends, and his father gives him his freedom to do whatever he wants within reason. He worries that\u2019s why his sons large belly has been continuing to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake\u2019s perfectly happy with himself though and in some ways takes pride in his newly acquired bulk. Some of his friends have even started calling him Big Blake, and there\u2019s something in him that really likes it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should we start?</span></div></div>",

It was becoming more and more difficult to fit into his desk these days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake wasn't completely oblivious to this but he also was less inclined to notice his weight gain than those around him. His father, his friends, and his teachers were all more keen to notice that Blake had gained at least twenty pounds in the last month. It was often brushed off as a growth spurt, but when would it stop?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake threw his backpack on his bag, causing all kinds of jiggling to occur, and headed out into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey big guy, how's it hanging?\" Blake's friend Mike asked as he ran into him in the hallway. Mike playfully punched Blake in his soft shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was about six inches shorter than Blake and eighty pounds lighter. The two were polar opposites and were somewhat of an odd couple. Mike was a slim but athletically-built blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake smirks in response as he sips on a Coke bottle he had been holding onto. \"Not much, man. Hungry as fuck though.\" Blake held his belly as he said it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else is new?\" Mike responded rolling his eyes as he looked at his friends growing midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair were headed to next period together. Where to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an awkward conversation. Not necessarily a new one but as Blake\u2019s waistline grew, so his fathers concern. An audible gulp and a deep breath came from Mr. Lange as he approached his son, who was working on his sixth slice of pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Blake, take it easy there,\u201d he bellowed. Blake looked up from his mostly empty pizza box and blushed a little. He took a few sips of the 2 liter soda beside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get upset. I just worry about you, son. I want you to be healthy and to be the best you can be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake tolled his eyes and sighed. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m not the best I can be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon. You\u2019re bigger than most of your classmates. I see you struggling to make it up the stairs and I keep having to buy you new clothes because you\u2019re outgrowing them so fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty felt horrible for being so blunt but with Blake\u2019s excessively rapid weight gain in the past year, it needed to be said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not that big, and I\u2019m happy with myself. It\u2019s my body not yours. I don\u2019t get why you feel the need to make me feel like shit because I\u2019ve gained a little weight.\u201d Blake ate a handful of fries during a brief silence, drawing the ire of his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like shit,\u201d Marty began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen don\u2019t tell me how to live my life. Im not a little boy anymore.\u201d Certainly not, his father thought, looking at his nearly 250 pound son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m 17 now. I\u2019ll be in college next fall. I won\u2019t be your problem anymore,\u201d Blake said aggressively. He got up from the table, grabbed the pizza box, bag of French fries, and soda bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Lange knew where this was going, Blake was headed to his room where he did most of his eating anyways. Marty took a deep breath and knew it wasn\u2019t worth chasing after his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake closed the door, and Marty knew that was the last he\u2019d see of his son for the night. Blake put on a Netflix show, laid in bed and finished off the food that remained. He\u2019d fall asleep before his hunger woke him up a few hours later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight (but usually later) snacks were a very common routine for Blake. His father was usually asleep. If his step-siblings were around, they would be too. He snuck out of his room and down the stairs, the groaning of the steps was louder than he had expected. So what if his dad woke up though? He was right, he\u2019s a grown man now and can make his own decisions. His dad has no right to tell him that anything\u2019s wrong with his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause he was confident he\u2019d not run into anyone, Blake was shirtless, only wearing his boxer briefs which prominently displayed his voluminous butt. It was surprisingly sculpted for someone who had worked out almost never. What wasn\u2019t sculpted was his belly. It proudly hung over the waist band of his briefs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was his belly and accompanying man boobs constantly growing, but his chest and stomach hair was beginning to grow in thicker and thicker. Dark brown, almost black hair began at Blake\u2019s neck and thickened in the middle of his flabby chest. It sparsely covered his belly, more than could be expected due to the growing surface area. He looked down and almost proudly stroked his jiggly, hairy flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was surprising how hairy Blake was becoming considering his father was not a hirsute man. It must be from his mothers family, he suspected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake made it to the kitchen undetected, and peered into the fridge. He rubbed his stomach while he considered what he could dig into. He saw some leftover cake from his step sisters birthday and decided to go with that. He began chowing down when he heard a noise.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One of the rich kids, Liam, had his parents out of town for the weekend, so he did as all high school kids do, and invited most of the school to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake arrived with his buddies Mike and Alex. \"Beer?\" Alex asked as they took in the scene. Blake and Mike followed his lead as they went to the backyard where a keg was waiting beside the biggest pool they'd ever seen. Alex helped the three of them each to some beer from the keg and they settled into the party a bit. Kids were swimming, drinking, eating, typical high school party stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where to fellas?\" Mike asked his two friends.</span></div></div>",
