The mailbox flag was lifted up, signifying mail had been delivered here. Your mom and sisters had already gone to work and school(respectively), so you were left to go. You went over and picked it out.<br>\r\n\"Bill...bill...my bill....dads playboy...everything seems in order.\" You say as you pick up your bookbag that you set down. You started your walk to the bus stop - a corner about a block and a half down the road.<br>\r\nYou didn't have to take the bus, you had your own car, but at gas at 4.15 dollars a gallon at the moment, it was just easier to take advantage of the free ride. Surely he was the oldest on his bus, but only by two years. You start to shuffle through the mail, until a particular letter appears to you. You open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Skye fakelastname,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have recieved you letter and would like to inform you that we would be happy to let you attend Brown. We would honor to have you at are campus. Welcome to the Ivy League. Of course, even with your outstanding record up to this point, we require you finish your high school education this year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigned,<br>\r\nThe Brown People<br>\r\n(and Carl, our Janitor)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoe lee shit.\" You say as the letter drops from your hands. You figured they would turn you down, you figured even Clown College would turn you down! This was awesome, now your name would live on, Skye, the man who didn't completely fail at life! Thoughts raced about your head as you arrived at the bus stop, and even when the bus arrived. Hell, you were shaking with joy. Your off to college! Well, if you pass. And with only two weeks(plus a day) of school left, it was going to be easy. Of course, you would need to avoid anything that could screw it up, but whats the worst that could happen. You couldn't wait to tell Anna, your girlfriend. You had both tried to go out for Brown, and you were sure she would make it. You were only a smidge better, a few grade points better. Her weakest point being Math, she normally got Bs and Cs on it, but failed a few tests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce arriving at the school, you skipped off the bus and walked your happy walk up to the doors. You breath a big breath of air, whip open the doors, and.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBLACK THE FUCK OUT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up an hour later, 20 minutes before first period ends. You see it on the moon.<br>\r\nThe moon....?<br>\r\nThe moon isn't in the school building, whats going on?<br>\r\nThe thing is, what your looking at is not the moon, its the hallway clock. Its big enough that you can hear its ticking. You can also hear the feet of a teenager who is walking towards you, hall pass in hand. Wait, you know her! Thats your best friends girfriend, Kaitlyn! She and you are on a friends - not friends basis.You antagonize her and everything, she threatens to break your face. You are her boyfriends best friend, so she might help you. It could go either way.<br>\r\nTheres also Anna, or even Jun, your best friend, himself! They are in two different classes, English and History respectfully. You could also go for you younger siblings, but they are all in father away classes, and its not certain if you could make it to them or not. While the closest class belongs to Amelia, she kind of hates you. She goes to Home Ec during second period, so you might just want to journey there. Its on the other side of the building, and is a long, hard distance, but you might catch her there.<br>\r\nBritney, while being a dumbass, has Chemistry next period. Its closer, but shes a dumbass! And Jessica, well she, uh, never told you her schedule, or you never listened....how old is she anyway?<br>\r\nWhat do you do?!</span></div></div>",

Also, your ride was your sister Amelia's backpack. Thing is, you were only two and three-fourths tall. Now, this wasn't weird or new, to you anyway. You suffered from a rare birth deffect, RFSS, or Really Fucking Small Syndrome. It was genetic, and according to your doctor, had remained dormat in your mothers family for hundreds, maybe thousands of years. Some mixed drugs and smokes brought it out though. Your mother even quit them before Jessica was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thats why your the only 'small' person in your family, but you did have one small friend, Chijinda You, whose mom also did some hard drugs and smoked, only difference from your mom is that she didn't quit, and died of overdosing. Chijinda's dad remarried, and Chijinda rather enjoys having two younger brothers and an older sister-in-law.  Even though they were all average sized. You had three younger sisters(though one doesn't seem to have your dads Y chromosome), and one younger brother, but he had been kidnapped by ninjas...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thats why you were in your sisters knapsack at the moment, they all shifts when ut came to looking after you...Amelia took you to school, Jessica kept an eye on you throughout the school day, and Britney drove you home in her car, though she is kinda an airhead, and usually takes you along with her to the mall. Then again, you'd rather be with the airhead then with the sister going through her homicidal phase. Don't be foolish though, years of near death experiences had made you tough, smart, and able to take being stepped on or sat on. However, it had still hurt, and your bones never stayed whole for long, you weren't immortal, but you were resilient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still, you had been a burden to your family. Turns out, checking everything before you did anything was tiring, even eating was a pain in the ass for them. You would be locked in your (custom made)doll house and placed in the attic during family cleaing day, and kept out of the way when guests came out. Also, you were never permitted near any sibling under the age of nine, god knows what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then again, it wasn't all bad. Your dad was a developer at Apple, and made you a mini Macintosh Computer, it even had 14 GB worth of memory. Jun(your normal sized friend) said that wasn't alot, but you need to take in the size of it. Your dad also payed a famous carpenter and builder to help him build you a doll house, that could plug in to have full electricity distributed throughout it. Hou wished you could never leave it sometimes. Plus, you had Jun, Chijinda, and Isaac to hang out with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You snap out of your memories when a hand comes into the rucksack and grabs you. It lays you not-so-gently infront of the door to your homeroom. Amelia waves her hand back nonchalauntly as she walked away. Ahhh, you caring siblings.</span></div></div>",

You and Jun shared the first four hour classes together, so he took you to each class. It wasn't until Lunch that you saw Chijinda or Isaac, who both had the same first four hour classes. You all met up at Lunch where you'd play cards, crack some dirty jokes, or have a generally good time. Josh and Isaac would allow you and Chijinda to eat their food's crumbs, since it would do you guys more good anyway. Also at the table was Kaitlyn, Anna, and Courtney. Kaitlyn was dating Jun, Anna was dating you, and Isaac boned Courtney. Chijinda said he online dated, and was with some blond Japanese chick. You all tease him about it constantly, since she sounds fake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Checkmate!\" Anna said happily as she one again beat Courtney in Chess. You all rarely played Chess, but it was fun once in awhile. Courtney slapped herself with frustration. You all chuckled, watching mellow Courtney get frustrated was funny.

Your dash threw it so now its moving back and forth, and jumping off now would most likely result in an encounter with the floor.

Would she just kill you so you couldn't be in her way anymore? That's why you STAYED in the shoe, this foul smelling abyss of what could be your undoing. You didn't want to die now, and especially not a virgin. You didn't even have a will, and you'd be damned before Isaac got any of your stuff.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well well well, looky here. Seems Sykes not as stupid he looks.\" Kaitlyn said in a mocking manner as she lifted you up. She set you in her locker as she put on and tied her shoe. You knew that you should have ran, god knows how demented Kaitlyn really was. What if those rumors you started were true and she did kill puppies by shoving them up her who-haw? Guess that would end your dieing a virgin problem...but it IS Kaitlyn, and even though she has titanic tits and a vigorous vag, she is your best friends girl. Plus, ITS KAITLYN FOR GOD SAKES.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, I think I look pretty damn sexy, and if stupid means sexy, then your pretty damn smart.\" You replied sarcastically. Wait, why did you say that? Her finger could kill you by flicking you. Just into the wall about ten feet away(your height). God knows out into the middle of the locker room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kaitlyn smirked. \"You do realize I could easily kill you and no one would find you, right? Your honestly not going to act this stupid, are you? You know I'm not bluffing, you know how I could punch you in the face until you were a bleeding sobering mess when you were NORMAL size, now, I can step on you, or eat you I wanted too, and not a second thought would come to mind, except maybe; \"Huh, I just cleared the world of one more douche bag.\"\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That was definitely not a bluff. Kaitlyn just talked about first fucking degree murder, god knows what else she would do to you. She might even torture you, she did live in a rural, small town. Surely, she could spend a day just walking around putting you in harms way. The thought of that chills your spine, mainly because, it could and might happen.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I can tell by the way your looking that you do indeed know I'm not joking. Now remains one question; What should I do with you? Should I take you home, and keep you as my own little plaything, a toy that I could break and never even have a sad thought about, or should I kill you now? Maybe even leave you in such a deadly place that you'd surely die, and I could just sit back and watch...</span></div></div>",

Hehe\" She giggles at the thought of your death at her hands. You know that shes basically going to put you death off for another hour or two. But that's another hour that you can use to think of a plan. You've been described as having a silver tongue, which basically meant you were really good at lying and talking your way out of problems, no matter what they were.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now then, I'll just pocket you until I can get to my locker, then I'll deposit you in my book bag. And you'd better stay in there, as it would be just crushing if you were to get out.\" She said in a tone that made her sound like some psychotic  bitch who would torture you until you died. Oh wait...she must sound like how she is. Kaitlyn snatched you up quickly and shoved rather roughly in her pocket. Her iPod was next to you. Funny thing, you'd never owned an iPod, or anything made  by Apple, as you'd read several article on Cracked.com about its products. Ho hum, it was such a simple time.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It wasn't too long before you saw light again, this time though, it was the light of a hallway, and before you knew it, you were surrounded by darkness. The floor was cloth...you must be in Kaitlyn's book bag! No wonder too, you heard the sound of her zipping it, as it was a loud buzzing sound amidst the teens talks and cries, booming all around you. You fumble around in there, papers crunching around you random markers and containers getting scattered everywhere.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shit, its so dark in here, I can't see my own nose. You cross your eyes, not even a nose. The book bag smelled of tabaco, but you know Kaitlyn didn't chew it. Jun had been very descriptive on how the inside of her mouth tasted, during their deep tonguing trips with each other. Jun's parents didn't know he was dating her, so they made out at school and the park in town. You didn't live in the same town as them, so you'd never caught them in the act, but you wouldn't doubt it...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thats when you realized, you could be stuck in here for a few more hours, how would Kaitlyn know if you escaped or not. Surely there was something in here that could be hid in, and you could just sneak in and hide. Then again...if Kaitlyn found you, how would you explain it? You couldn't it, would be a sure death sentence...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The fact that people can kill you without realizing it, made the idea of someone out to kill you terrifying. You were a one man army against a huge, giant army. And no matter what, you weren't going to win this fight. You had two options; Resist to secure your pride and eventual death, or allow them to take you prison and make the best of it. Death sounded rather ugly so it looks like your stuck with prisoner.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the hours passed until the bell at 3:30 sounded, Kaitlyn came and went of her own accord. Occasionally checking to make sure you hadn't escaped, or died, yet. You occasionally heard her have a few exchanges with a friend or two, but they were rather droll and you tuned them out for the most part. At one point she even chatted with the girlfriend, who asked where she thought you had gone. Kaitlyn, the bitch, said she saw you go home sick early on in the day. Well, at least the sick part was somewhat true!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, a loud, longer, more drawn out bell occurs. The stampede of teenagers and young adults once again deafens your ears. The sheer sound makes you dizzy and your knees fail, and buckle. Soon you on all fours, grimicing at the sound. Then, a loud metal <i>scrreeeech</i> makes you dig your fingernails into the backpack. This effort, however, is not even close to good enough to hold you in, as Kaitlyn picks up her bag, your thrown into the side with a force making dark spots appear on your eyes. You fall down, motionless.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However, there is still something that can effect the outcome of your day. Kaitlyn's car could still be in the shop, as she has been having some engine problems with it. This would force her to take the bus home, and this is somewhat safer then the hallways. At least the bus has less people, and less walking! However, if Kaitlyn's car is repaired, she will probably inform you more about what she'll do with you and she might even go to a destination before going home, maybe a store or a Mcronalds! This could let you hide somewhere in her car if she left you there, or she might take you inside with her. Which is it, though?</span></div></div>",

You gaze up at the top(at least, you hope its the top...), and see a blidning light. As it pours in, Kaitlyn's hand come with and feels around for you, and since your unable to move without whimpering in pain, you can not avoid her.

I'm going to meet up with some friends later, at a party or something, and I would prefer you stayed in my purse and kept your ass shut. Failure to do so will range from me killing you quickly to me slowly, painfully, killing you.\" Kaitlyn says as she drives, never even taking her eyes off the road. \"And trust me, there will be beer and alcohol, so even if you managed to contact someone, how reliable do you think they'd be?\"<br>\r\n\"More...then a...psycho...like you.\" You gasp. Your heads throbbing, probably from the minor concussion you got from hitting some much stuff.

Then the smell hits you, nearly burning your nose right off. Its alcohol, and your covered in it. After rubbing your eyes from ten minutes, you see the Kaitlyn's flask wasn't completely close, and a few drops made it on to you. Then you hear it, a booming sound of speakers. You climb up to the purse top and squeeze through a gap, coming out to see a few light but otherwise darkness. You slip and start sliding down, hitting the counter, which is also extremely slick, and slide over to the edge. All your effort is used, and you manage not to slip off the counter top. You shake your head, and look around. You could probably make it down from the counter if you used the cord for the blender, but you'd have to walk around the bartender once you go there. You glance down the counter, and while there are many people dancing, there is only one sitting there....Renae. She seems sober...but even then. Best figure out soon, before Kaitlyn comes back.

A pretty good mission, you think. You take note of the nightstand, but it really only works in a \"get noticed\" plan, and you choose not to take that path.

You return it. Then he blinks once, and runs towards you! You nearly slip trying to run back under the bed, farther then you could see before. You have some old socks, pink, on either side of you. On your left are some magazines also, and behind you some type of broken box. You wait to be bombarded by Satan, but instead hear the bed creak. Even from here you see Renae's bare feet over beyond.

Same old same old, I'll kill you if you even leave that drawer once. Clear?\" You nod your head, with a big smile on your face. Mainly to piss her off, but also because the second she leaves this god forsaken house, your out of that drawer and out of her life. \"Good.\" She then drops you down into the drawer and closes it. You hear her walk away, open and close the door, and a faint distant door opening and closing. Good shes gone. You turn around and notice a crack between the drawer and back. You wiggle your way through it and make it to the drawer beside it. Also closed. You jump down to the once beneath it. Also closed. Shit. You jump down one more, and find it for the most part closed, but a shirt holds it open enough for you to squeeze out!

Some television noise is in the background, but you can't really make it out from far up here. You look up and notice her door is probably a five minute trek, if you can manage to get around the mess that is her floor. It's covered in random clothes, some food, and a really disturbing picture of Jun. Never unsee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You manage to make it to the door without any problems, and climb out from under it. Your now in a barren hallway, with two paths.

Peering down them, you notice that they lead to a small room with another door, so it doesn't really reveal where you'd be going too, or what could be coming. You swallow some spit in anxiety. Why can nothing ever be simple?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Also, further down the hall is a small table with a plant, a window, and a closet. Nothing really handy(the window's on the second floor, so jumping out of it is probably considered suicide), but the closet could make a handy place to hide. However, if you ever needed food, water, or something else vital to life(read: vidya games), you would have to travel by Kaitlyn's room, and this closet could be frequented by her since it's so close. Her promise of killing you remains ever-present in your mind, so your not too thrilled on being caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The choice is never easy, and certainly a big one. Each way could lead to you being a little less alive then you were this morning, but you do have to choose one. Which is it; The Steps of Hell, or The Closet of Calamity?</span></div></div>",

Either way though, there is one small problem with the staircase. It consists of somewhere around twenty steps, each one is taller than you. If you want to descend the damn thing alive, your going to need to do so quickly(as to avoid any nasty encounters with Kaitlyn's families feet), and carefully as possible. Which is pretty hard considering how small you are in contrast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Coming up to the first step, you slowly turn around, while grasping the wood floor in front of you, and start to ease your way down. However, your feet can't grasp the wood surface of the side going up it. Your feet frantically try to get a hold, but they end up sliding off it, leaving you nothing but your arms to dangle by. You gasp, strength quickly ebbing out of your arms, until both feel dead. A few seconds pass, and you release. You hit the wood below with a thumb, bouncing a tad, but not down the other steps. Looks like that way isn't going to get you down fast, or safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now on the second step, your ready to try another tactic. Bracing yourself, you stand on the edge and kneel down. You then take a deep breath, and jump off it entirely! You flail in the air for a few seconds, trying to land on the stair, but rapidly approaching the edge of the second stair down. You hit the edge, with one leg straight up, and barely manage to straighten yourself up. If you hadn't, you would have went headfirst onto the next step. Oh shit, that was too close. Fast and convenient, though now pain is shooting up your leg. You notice the wall that used to be alongside the staircase leaves three steps down, revealing an old guardrail used to grip on while walking upwards. You could use that to slide down(the bars have little areas on the side you could use), and it would be much faster. However, you could slide off and down however far it is to the bottom. It's probably fatal though. You use the slide down method(mentioned paragraph 2) to get down there, and it goes off better injury wise but not speed wise. Now you have a choice to make; Use the guardrail to slide down it, or keep using the steps.</span></div></div>",

The whole room smells like her locker, and the floor is sticky. You silently thank the creator of shoes as you roam.<br>\r\nThere is a drain in front of you. Ahead is a room that you assume the girls would shower in after a sports event(your school had softball and volleyball, plus some played girls basketball). The drains must help drain the water. You take your time to edge around it - for you would surely drown if you were to go to the sewers.<br>\r\nTo the left of that, about five football fields(your perspective), was a few bathroom stalls. Rip off, the guys didn't get doors, just one wall, and a urinal on the other side of it. It didn't smell and better. Best to avoid them, seeing girls piss wasn't going to be a highpoint of your day.<br>\r\nYou don't know where the exit is until you choose to follow the noise. Its on the opposite corner, and its closed. The door was usually closed and locked since the seniors did a 'panty raid' last year. No worries, you weren't a senior then...so you didn't get harshly beat up and exposed for stealing girls underwear for fun. It made the seniors a laughing stock.<br>\r\nYou know that you would never make it over there in time. You had obviously been there for forty-five to fifty minutes. It would take twenty to get there, on a straight journey. It was also a thick door, so you would also have to take about another five minutes to crawl under it, if you could fit. You knew that the girls each got their own locker[Note from author - This is how schools I've attended have done it, so its totally verified. Not sure if yours did, but dare to dream], so you were sure that you could hide in some girls locker and catch them later. Kaitlyn would be out of the question now.

Kaitlyn could search the locker room top to bottom to find you, and chances are no middle schooler would help you. Maybe you could run out into the gym, or at least build yourself a hovel somewhere safe. Maybe a hole that you always noticed in the cafeteria(which you could get to from the gym). There was a stage on the north side of the gym. You are on the south side, in the locker room. The gym is about the length of a football field, and polished wood at that. There is a middle school class the period after this(so period five), and they always run ten minutes before getting to whatever else they do that day. Though its supposed to be around a certain box outlined on the floor, thats never stopped kids from running inside it. If you didn't get to the STEPS of the stage, you might as well kill yourself before being trampled underfoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even then, they could play lame rip offs of kickball or baseball, where one of the teams will line up on/off(or both) the stage. Granted its on the edge when their on it, but you were in middle school once, you know that they can get rowdy. Of course, past the stage curtain would be safe, between that and the cafeteria is only the janitors office...and they are usually only there in the first two and last period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking about this, you have about another human yard, or a shrink's football field to run. If your lucky, you could make it too the door before the girls come in. The Phis Ed teacher unlocks it and you'll probably have one minute too run out before the girls charge in.

You should do something to convince her you just a ant or something...you don't know.

It wouldn't be worth it to walk over there just to dump it in his portable trash can, which was almost full anyway, he'd be dumping it if he went there, and that was even more work...so he just stepped outside, walked a little, and halfway down the sidewalk, deposited the dust and this fucking ugly ass bug in the grass.

You have to get someone's attention. And that means you have to approach one of these young behemoths. You quickly decide on one of two targets. The girl who you first spied is one option.

If you time it right, you could let go at the last moment and go flying to her pocket.  There you could wait until she sat down.  There might be a better plan since you came up with this one in half a second, but time is up.  As Kelsey's ked reaches the top of its swing, you let go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Weeeeee!

Before the period was even half over, her toes, still shiny from foot sweat, were craving the feel of her new favorite toy.  Sliding her right foot back into its home, she quickly found the piece of rock, and started to gently massage it.  <i>This is amazing!  I should have put a pebble in my shoe years ago.  I'll need to find a similar pebble.</i>  That reminded her that she hadn't actually seen the pebble yet.  She would have to take it out later to examine it.

Feeling her precious little pebble rubbing the bottom part of the ball of her foot was nothing short of amazing. A slight twitch of her big two, and it slid to the right. The smallest twitch from her pinky and fourth toe, and it slid to the left. It was almsot as if that tiny pebble had a will of its own - trying to oppose her petite toes at times. As Hannah hummed a little song above - she just couldn't ignore the feeling that it almost felt as if that tiny pebble, that's been making love to her sweaty foot for the last hour or so, almost didn't want to be under her..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just had to check it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother twitch, another hell. No, hell didn't even begin to describe what you've been going through. You could feel every muscle at work here, and sometimes, when her toes started moving around - it sounded like the cracking of an old ship at sea. Sweat covered each inch of this part, and when you adjusted to the low lightning, you could actually see drops accumulating between her gigantic, stinky toes, forced down her ball as her toes wiggled in anticipation all around you. <br>\r\nAt one point, you would be rubbed head first into the soft, sweaty flesh. Forcing your mouth open, your clothes soaked wet and your eyes burning with a salty sensation. You wanted to scream, fight, do something - but all you could do was cry, as the foot made contact with your upper body, forcing you into a deep, passionate kiss.<br>\r\nAt first you thought all of this movement around you was random, at best. But then, you started to notice something - after a few good seconds of agonizing rubbing, her big toe would start to pount against the shoe insole - forcing you towards it, rubbing off any dirt or sweat that has accumulated along the way. After reaching a certain point, they'd stop their constant wiggling, and make sure to give the ball's flesh a chance to rub itself against you. Then, the same thing happened again - only this time, to the other direction, the smallest toes leading the way..<br>\r\nYou couldn't speak, almost couldn't move - and almost couldn't think. But the only thing that passed through your weak little mind during this insane torture was, that, this little girl is no dummy. No, when it comes to pleasuring herself, she knows exectly what she's doing. And you just earned yourself a front row seat to the entire show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how long it's been. Maybe a few seconds, minutes or even an hour. You've been rolled around for so long, you've gotten to know every part of this little girl's smelly foot. You don't even remember what it's like being a person, anymore - all you remember is that you're just a tiny rock. Rolled in sweat, gunk and dirt. Rubbing itself against the soft, moving flesh of this goddess above you. Absorbing her godly sweat and rubbing against her colossal ball, with the tiniest of tickles.<br>\r\nYep, those little laughes and moans of pleasure, hardly reaching into the inner surface of the sneaker from up above - made sure you remember your pathetic part.<br>\r\nAnd made sure you'd keep doing it, well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen, suddenly..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah couldn't resist it anymore. After playing with the pebble for a few good minutes now, allowing it to massage the sore ball of her foot and gather every single drop of sweat from it, she just had to get it out and find out what it actually is.<br>\r\n\"It's material is so absorbent\", So whispered to herself, \"I've never seen or felt a stone like this before..\", she giggled.<br>\r\nShe knew how lucky she was, finding her little pebble friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the heel of her foot out of the shoe, Hannah stuck one of her fingers into the sneaker through the back. Fearing that someone might notice her bizzare behavior, she took a few good, long moments, scratching her dry heel. Only when she was sure nobody was watching her, she continued inserting her finger further, scraping against the sole of the shoe, and the beggining of the ball of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to get her prize out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\", was all you could think of.<br>\r\nAt first, you thought you heard some sort of a distant sound, like a screeching of sorts, but thought this girl might have just shuffled her feet about. However, when the screeching became closer, and getting more violent - you understood something was very, very wrong. Without warning, the ceiling of foot flesh above you, collided with your tiny body, forcing you under it. Every single muscle fiber was contracting all together, and altough you had no idea what was going on, you knew that something was disturbing them.<br>\r\n\"Am I going to die?\", was the last thought that went through your head, as the tomb of flesh around you sealed shut.<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, you could feel something. Near your feet. The flesh is.. lifting? up? what is going on?<br>\r\nAnd then, something else. Something was coming in, nearing your direction. Like a giant snake, it lifted itself off the ground in the smallest of steps. Its front, glistening end facing your upper torso. <br>\r\nIt fought against the sticky, smelly flesh that was trying to hold it back - but it's nimble movements were no match for the smelly surroundings around it. Soon, it reached your leg, forcing itself over it. You felt its sheer power, overwhelming and merciful at the same time, slowly glide towards your head. After covering some more ground, it finally reached your penis - rubbing against it slowly, as if it was trying to understand your exact form and shape. \"No, please..\", you cried out, and as if it heard your cries, just before the climax, it lifted up and continued on its journey.<br>\r\nA few more gentle squeezes, and it was already at your head. Rubbing its pad aginst your hair, it locked itself around you, wrapping you in warmth and squashing you into the insole below, forcing some more room. Then, as a final courtesy, forcing its glistening end under your head, like a gigantic pillow.<br>\r\nYou lay there, looking at the vast cieling of flesh above you. You lay there, humbled to be in the presence of such a creature, and almost feel yourself drifting into sleep in the hands of your saviour. You finally think that this torture, this hellish nightmare is over - since the foot flesh is seem to be held in its place for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly and without warning, Your saviour pushed you, head first, into the soft ceiling of flesh. You thought the toes has powers beyond your understanding - but this was something else. Your entire body jolted into action, you yelled at the top of your lungs as you were trying to get the tiniest bit of air into your chest..<br>\r\nWhatever this thing was, it was trying to suffocate you into death.<br>\r\nThen, at the highest of speed, it retreated. Taking you along with it for the ride. Scraping your head, torso, legs and even erect penis into the vast line, that was this little girl's foot flesh. What the hell was she doing?!<br>\r\nBeing rolled over all around the place by this enormous snake, you gaged for air. The feeling of vertigo forcing you to hold your stomach down as hard as you could. You couldn't breathe, couldn't move, couldn't comprehend what was happening to you, or why did your seviour turn up on you like that.<br>\r\nAll you could do, is wait for this torturous ride to be over - you, or the sweaty ridges of her smelly foot. Whichever comes first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally snagging her prize with her index finger, and securing it in place - Hannah pulled her finger out of her smelly shoe.<br>\r\nMaking sure to squeeze the pebble between her foot flesh and her finger, so he couldn't escape - she started rolling him up her foot, all the way to her heel.<br>\r\n\"Man, my feet sweat like crazy.. No wonder this pebble feels so squishy, I wouldn't like to be in it's position\", she giggled once again.<br>\r\nFinally making it to her heel, so used her thumb to press the tiny pebble between her toes and brought it to her face. Finally reaching her eye level, she squinted her eyes a little to try and make out what kind of metarial her little friend was made of..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to her surprise..</span></div></div>",

You are damp, no, coated entirely in the little girl's foot sweat as she crinkles her nose and examines you, your form so small that it makes it difficult to discern the minute details of human features. Unfortunately for you, you had attracted so much dirt, dust, and dead skin from Hannah's heel (which had readily adhered to the sticky sweat covering your tiny body) that you resembled, at least to the eye of a regular sized person, a small, grey-brown pebble. And to Hannah and her powerful toes, that's precisely what you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe visible ridges of her fingertips grip you easily, pinning you nicely between them as the preteen goddess comes to this unlucky conclusion. Your hair, matted and tangled from the long rubbing against the sweaty ridges of her sole, rife with bits of dirt and coated with oil from the girl's skin, hardly was any help as your captor's fingers prevent any movement aside from curling up in a defensive ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be a porous kind of stone.. Like pumice?\" The intelligent grade schooler mused aloud. \"That't the only explanation as to why it's so absorbent... and not too hard, either.\" Hannah ponders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light brown brow of the once little girl furrows in concentration. She recalls the last week in class, learning about something called the scientific method. Her face lights up. \"Ah, that's it! I'll run an experiment!\" She grins, plucking up a small stone from the ground. \"This can be the ... control!\" she says, slipping the pebble into her opposite shoe to share your hellish fate. \"And I'll take notes on how each pebble reacts to sweat and pressure... and if they don't match each other, I'll know that my favorite pebble isn't one of those!\" Hannah beams, quite proud of herself. You try to make any sign of your sentience, reach out to this curious little girl that has been subjecting you to a foot-flavored hell, but it is too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hannah, excited to learn more about you and try out her new knowledge, lowers her huge digits towards the dingy flat, sliding you through the small pocket of air between her raised heel and the slick insole below. The towering legs in jeans that reach to heaven are replaced by the all-too-familiar sight of the light-brown skin above, glistening with barely perceptible pores dripping with sweat, the soft, bunching wrinkles giving way to a taut arch as she stretches her foot up, the cavern getting narrower and narrower, as she grinds her new favorite pebble along the slick folds of skin in the hot flat, the insole and the ball of her foot sandwiching together as she slips you back where she has decided you belong. you poop into the small arch formed by her toes, and the creak like monstrous constructions, squeezing around you like they've missed playing with you. The familiar stench of little girl feet permeates your pores as they clench you into the salty expanse of light brown skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heel slipped back into the flat, giving you a newfound sense of pressure and dread as the toes gripped you securely. All for the name of science! Although, Hannah wouldn't deny she was having fun with her new toy. And she was going to find another pebble just like it for her other flat, to take her all the way through middle school, she decided right then and there, Even if she had to rule out every pebble in the world, ask for all sorts of rocks for her birthday to slip into the shoe until she found one that pleased her petite feet just like you did, sucked up her hyper-active footsweat so nobody would notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there were a lot of pebbles in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the experiments begin!\" Hannah thinks aloud, clenching her toes roughly around you. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Am I free?</i>  You struggle to your feet but before you can do anything a giant light brown finger reaches in.  <i>She felt me!  She's going to help me grow again!  Oh thank god!</i>  You rush up to the finger, only to watch in horror as it tips the shoe out onto the low carpet.  You roll over and look up to be greeted with the sight of the foot that has been abusing you.  You flinch as it rushes towards you...  And hits next to you?  Staring right at the arch, you are too shocked to notice the other foot of this titanic preteen swooping in to grab you.  Raised in the air between the second and third toe, you can only watch as the long, slender and dexterous toes of the other foot begin to pummel your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good, it was time for social studies.</i>  Hannah loved this class because it was a two hour class with only enough work for five minutes.  Quickly finishing her assignment, she slipped of her flats and tipped them over.  She grabbed the pebble with her right foot and began to massage her grimy left toes on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smacked on the ground as her grip loosened.  Too beat up to move, you are helpless as the girl you know as Hannah rolls the slimy ball of her foot over you.  Too crushed to fight, you can't stop her as she smashes you under her smelly heels.  Too sad to care, you give in as she rolls you between her powerful soles.  After being used as a foot toy by every part of her foot, your spirit had been just as crushed as your mangled body.  As her toes came in for one last crush, you sigh and accept your fate as nothing more than a piece of rock to a girl who used to be half your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BBBRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last bell.  Hannah reaches down and drops her prize into her flat, she lightly slides her foot in.  Giving it another toe hug, she skips off to the buses.  During the ride, she tucked her feet under her butt and began to play with her pebble upside down. <br>\r\n<i>I bet this rock was happy it landed in my shoe.  All day I have been gentle to it.  If it had landed in my sister's shoe, the poor rock would probably be ground to dust.  Jinny is nowhere as gentle as I am.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after the world flipped upside down, you lost consciousness.  Waking up some time later, you realized there are no feet in the shoe with you.  Although you should be overjoyed, you have been shown such an awesome power you have no belief you will still survive.  Maybe you should just go find Hannah.  She might beat you down, but at this size, you deserve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of the flat took longer than you had anticipated, but a quick glance at a clock shows it is 1:00 in the morning.  Hannah will be sleeping and you will have plenty of time to get what you deserve.  However, your plan falls into despair as you realize there are two beds in this room.  One of these has your girl Hannah on it, and one has...  Someone else.  With no better options, you pick a random bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe climb wasn't so bad.  The sheet reached the floor and at your size the wrinkles were the right size for getting up.  Having reached your destination, you find in front of you two giant Asian feet.  These could be Hannah's, or they could be a relative.  Peering at the clock, you realize there is no time for indecision, so you climb the lightly wrinkled sole and wedge yourself in between the toes.  They react immediatly, and clench around your body, crushing the consciousness out of you.</span></div></div>",

Not only were you unconscious for at least half of the previous day, but your \"bed\" was between the toes of a sixth grade fidget.  When the sleep did finally come, it was restless and uncomfortable.  The sleep ended shortly after starting as Hannah moved her foot off her bed, dragging you along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost middle school students love Saturdays.  Not Hannah.  On Saturdays her Mom forced her to practice her instruments for the entire day.  To quote her, \"A healthy mind must never stop.\"  Sighing as she shifted her feet to the floor, Hannah realized something was between her toes.  Glancing at her flats, she clearly sees it must be her pebble!  But how?  She knows she left it in her shoe...  <br>\r\n<i>Oh well.  Why look a gift horse in the mouth?</i><br>\r\nWorried it may fall away from her toes, she grabbed the nearest pair of slippers and began her day.<br>\r\n<i>Maybe today won't be as bad as normal.  I do have a new friend...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was different.  The smell was stronger, the colors were off and the entire shoe was bouncing on the foot like it was three sizes too big.  This wasn't the flat you were used too.  However, the pain was the same as the limber toes stretched you out and smothered you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at her piano,  Hannah was unable to fully play with her pebble thanks to her songs requiring the pedals.<br>\r\n<i>Darn it.  This is hard to do with these loose slippers.  I must have grabbed someone else's.</i><br>\r\nSliding them off, she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanges once again happened for you as the pink plush inside of the new shoe rushed away.  In its place rushed a solid chunk of metal as the towering tootsies of the monumental girl smashed her foot into them.  Unlike the soaked insole of the flats or the plush insole of slipper, the metal had no give.  On your other side was a foot with enough force to render a town to dust.  <br>\r\n<i>I WAS FREE!  WHY THE HELL DID I GO BACK WITH THIS WHORE!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was barely better.  As hard as Hannah tried, she just couldn't play the song right with her plaything shoved between her little piggies.  Sighing, she kicked it behind her, and tried again.  This time Hannah played excellently.  She played so well that she barely noticed when her sister Jinny came and took back her slippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hannah kicked you backwards, where did you land?</span></div></div>",

Step after step, you were pounded under her toes, sometimes by yourself, sometimes alongside the debris that had accumulated on her unwashed skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she sat down, crossed her legs, and began to bob her foot. After the first couple shakes you were dislodged from the skin, tumbling around the foot. With the force of a car accident, you slammed into the side of the shoe. You held on, free from the toes, but the shaking continued, and your grip on the greasy fabric was lost. You hurdled back to the toes, their wriggling shapes just visible in the darkness. They remain above you, your tiny body rolling across the bottom of the shoe to the ball of her foot. You erupt into screaming as her legs uncross, forcing the unknowable weight of her body onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Jinny hands her exam to the proctor. She knows she failed.

Whenever her foot was flat on the ground, your face was driven into the ancient insole, releasing gallons of musty, salty, stinky sweat that covered your skin and filled your mouth.

Tonight was the school dance, and Jinny was taking her there.  Hannah didn't know why Jinny was acting so kind, but there was no reason to look a gift horse in the mouth.  She shot a quick text back to her sister: \"o right.  on my way,\" and ran back to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, none of this information was available to you.  The constant pounding had pretty much driven your ears out of commission, and it was doubtful you could have heard her through the shoe even if they did work.  All you knew was that when Hannah got home, her foot pulled out of the shoe, leaving you laying in a toe imprint that quickly filled into a lake of sweat.  So that's where you lay, not knowing and not caring about your future, just happy for a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah finished up her shower quickly, since time was already running low.  She did her hair and put on the finest dress a sixth grader could find, and prepared to put on her dress shoes when the pebble slipped back into her mind.  The shoes she had in mind were strappy heels, which a pebble would easily find its way out of.  She could always wear a closed toe heel, but they were no where near as comfortable.  Hannah bit her lip, and making her final decision, grabbed a pair of shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleep wouldn't come to you as you lay in the puddle.  The drying sweat was uncomfortable, and every single joint and bone in your body ached.  You sit up, wondering how long your peace could last.  Apparently not long, as slender fingers reach into the opening of the sneaker.  They grope the ground, reaching out for something - you.  Sweat oozed out of the insole as they pushed down, trying to feel the pebble.  Every fiber and tendon in your body urged you to flee, but there was no where to go.  You were at the end of the shoe; all you could do was wait for the fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't take long.  Within moments, they worked their way to you, and your body was roughly grabbed between two of them.  They pull you out, into the light of the cool afternoon.  For the first time since you slipped into this psychopath's footwear, you were seeing light.  Your eyes began to water, not just from the brightness, but from the realization of what your life has become.  Your body shakes as you let out a sob.  While this force was tiny, combined with the sweat as a lubricant, you slipped from the fingers mid travel.  The ground rushed to meet you; but your welcoming wasn't very nice.  The ground was filthy, and you rolled in the dirt as you came to a stop.  A quick glance down at your body shows that the dirt stuck to the drying sweat; you truly looked like a stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your last chance to be noticed washed away, you hardly react as the sun is blocked out by a massive form.  The massive elementary school student was towering over you, reaching out to pick you up.  With your new dirt covering, she'd never be able to tell that something was up with her pebble unless she got her eyes <i>reallllly</i> close to you.  You let out another sob as the slender, soft and extremely powerful fingers drop you down into the sole of...</span></div></div>",

The lights were dimmed and flashing, the music was playing loudly from speakers scattered all around, and the floor was packed with kids doing dances that weren't always age appropriate.  Sure, there were chaperons, but nowhere near enough to keep the party fully under control.  As the night progressed, things got progressively out of hand, leaving the poor adults helpless in the face of the chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's where you come in.  Tucked under Hannah's toes, you didn't have any of this information.  All you could tell was that it was loud, smelly, cramped and sweaty.  So it came as a surprise to you when your captor slipped in a disregarded puddle of juice, sending her loosely fit heel sliding off her foot and across the floor.  Hannah instinctively stretched her once they lost their shoe, dislodging you from their oppressive grip for the first time in days.  You smash into the cold gym floor, and watch with disbelief as the girl who was your entire world for over two days simply hobbled to her shoe, put it back on, and blended back into the crowd.  You were finally free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe celebration proves premature as a massive dance flat splashes into the puddle next to you.  A shadow is cast over you as the foot's owner dances above.  As her feet move rhythmically to the music, you do your best to dodge.  The song is foreign to your uncultured ears, so prediction is impossible.  Instead, every step she takes is a mad scramble to not end up underneath it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heel crashes down next to you, forcing you to dive backwards.  Her rear foot swings over your head, swiping at your hair as you duck for cover.  Close call after close call dictates your next few minutes, but miraculously, you survive.  The mystery girl wanders off, presumably to go torture some other poor soul with her groove.  With a moment to catch your breath, you plot your next move.</span></div></div>",

Just last week you were hanging with friends, worrying about exams and planning for college. Now, you are hiding in the shoe of a little girl who spent the last two days raping you with her toes, just because you don't want to be stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hours pass. You begin to wonder if Hannah's forgotten you. Would that be for the best? Somewhere in the back of your mind you knew she was your best chance at being found, but it was hard to remember that with all you've been through. A few times you peek out of the heel's opening, only to flinch back to safety as a giantess's foot stomps down by you. You grimace, laying against the drying insole, disgusted by what you've become: A bug, scurrying away from the footsteps of children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as you were beginning to wonder what you'd do all weekend if you were left in the empty gymnasium, a familiar voice calls out from above. \"Just let me grab my shoe!\" Suddenly she's there, her skyscraper sized form leaning over the shoe, her empty palm quickly filling up your vision. Instinctively you scream, clutching the thin insole tightly as she lifts the shoe up to head height. You spare a glance; her brown eye, bigger than you, locked onto your form. \"Good,\" she muttered. \"The rock's still there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you were falling, dropping to the ground as she set the shoe down. You bump, hard, tumbling back down to the very tip of the shoe. The familiar scent of Hannah's foot, still slightly fruity from her body wash but now with the tinge of sweat, wafts down to your nose. Looking up, you watch in an all too familiar horror as her foot crest's the shoe's top. It slides down, the shoe bouncing as she wriggles her foot in, and you let out one last scream as her toes overtake you. The clench around you and writhe, moving your body firmly between the biggest two, before giving you a squeeze once, twice, three times. Her tanned flesh engulfs you, whirls and wrinkles that would be imperceptible to her becoming all you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steps forward, still uncertain in heels, and you find yourself weeping as you sink beneath her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty my little pebble friend,\" Hannah says later that night. She'd made it home and changed into her PJs, and was now fishing her foot toy from her heel. Gripping between thumb and forefinger, she plucked it off the damp insole and ripped it out into the fresh air. \"Today's just about done, but tomorrow I'll be sure to walk on you a bunch~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dim light of the bedroom, covering in a layer of dust and grime, weakened and beat by the last two days, you really did look like a pebble to the sixth grader. And so, as a girl half your age squashed the breath out of you with just two of her soft fingers, you remained helpless as she...</span></div></div>",

Coated in sweat, juice and dirt, you really looked like nothing more than a piece of lint that fell off of a girl's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah spent the rest of the night with only one heel.  Sure, it made dancing difficult, but it was quite the conversation starter, and a few boys thought it cool.  Maybe the cost of a lost heel was worth it.  Either way, she didn't go looking for the missing heel, and had completely forgotten about it by the time she got home.  Her mother would scold her over it, but she'd only care that she'd lost her pebble.  Oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slept hard.  You slumbered through the end of the dance, clean up, and the janitor finding the shoe.  The journey to the lost and found didn't even wake you, tired as you were.  However, as the sun shined through the office's window on the following morning, you finally did rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost unconsciously, you climb out of the pile of discarded objects and stretch your muscles.  It had been days since your poor arms and legs got any use at all.  So, sitting on top of a desk in an office of an empty school on a Sunday morning, you find yourself full of energy, although still extremely hungry.

It's tough to hang on, but somehow, you make it back to her classroom, and you soon resume climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're awfully tired. This is your second ascent of a girl today. You can only assume you're a little bit tougher and stronger because of the shrinking; there's no way you would ordinarily be able to make this climb. Nevertheless, as you reach the girl's knee, you're feeling okay about yourself. Now comes an easy part, running along the girl's thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, easy is a relative term. You have come out on her inner thigh, and the jeans, while not form-fitting, are still tight enough that there's little give between the girl and the jeans. You find that it's slow going, as you're pressed between the hard canvas of the pants and the warm thigh of the girl. Making matters worse, you're not going completely unnoticed; occasionally the girl pushes her thighs together, trying to take care of the slight itch she's feeling; that itch being you, you find yourself slammed together between tons of girl, unable to breathe for a few seconds as she takes care of the annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, mercifully, you feel the cavern suddenly widen. You've been forcing your way along for so long that you actually tumble into the small expanse, before colliding with a soft, warm wall that smells slightly of vinegar. You fall down in a heap, before you pick yourself up again, using the wall to situate yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the walls all around you press in hard, as the girl reacts to a sudden flutter that has hit her in her most sensitive spot. Her thighs contract, and push you hard up against the wall, which you realize is just a thin cotton covering over the tween's vagina. You struggle against the force, and as you struggle, you realize the wall is just slightly damp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally realize you need to lie still. It won't do to be found like this, and if you keep this up, she will definitely go looking for you. Heck, for all you know, she's well aware that something is doing something down there.

However, as the door swings open, you instead see just one pair of feet clad in green flats.  This must be the teacher.  From your low perspective, she seems to be fresh out of college.  Must be one of her first years teaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she sits at her desk across the room, you realize that this is the opportunity you have been waiting for.  Not a kid in the class and a stationary teacher!  She would be the best bet to contact.  A short jog to her and you stop in front of her shoes.  Up close, you can see these are not new.  They've been scuffed, stretched and flattened.  No doubt these are her favorite shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you ponder the state of her footwear, and how to best get her attention, miles above the exhausted educator sighed.  Being a teacher was harder than she had first thought.  These little kids would listen to a word she said.  Not only that, but she had to spend the entire day on her feet.  <br>\r\n<i>I'd best give my feet a rest before lunch ends and I'm stuck with the little devils for another two and a half hours.</i><br>\r\nSliding her feet out of their prisons, Miss Curtis stretched her toes out above the floor and set her feet down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back below, you had decided on your plan right as the colossal feet slipped out of the worn out slip-ons.  Shocked that anything that big could move so gracefully, you only stare as the soles of the feet, shiny from sweat with skin peeling off the ball of her foot, raises above you.  The five pink obelisks attached to the end extend out and bend, blasting a cloud of stench right at you.  You fall back as the never ending expanse of muscle slowly settles on your body.  You can feel the sweat soak into your body as the wrinkled arch of the foot covers you whole.  You know you should be panicking, that this woman can end you with a scrunch of her toes.  Hell, this foot is twice as big as Kaitlyn's shoe, and six times as big as the shoes of the first graders you passed, but as you lay between warm, sweaty foot and cold linoleum, you feel completely safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It feels so good to Miss Curtis as she presses her hot, hurting soles into the frigid linoleum.

Lunch was over, and he'd wasted his time under this magnificent foot.  But, was that time really a waste?  This felt so, so right to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Curtis's foot lifted off of your body.  While you should be rejoicing, you can't help but miss it.  You haven't felt that warm and safe since Kaitlyn got her bitchy hands on you.  You decide not to lose that feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer left foot is already grabbing for its shoe, so there's no time to lose.  You lunge over her right foot and roll into the discarded green flat that lay there.  Your face hits the insole and sweat splashes up.  Doubts are beginning to form...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no time for that, as the twenty-something's toes grab for the shoe.  Your world shakes, then goes dark as the foot enters.  You'd positioned yourself under the arch in order to keep as safe as possible, but the shaking slid you around the insole like a fat man on an ice rink.  You watch in awe as the foot crashes into the bottom of the flat.  The titanic foot slides forward, but you realize something is wrong...  The foot is ahead of you.  Why is it not over you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky goes dark, and Skye has enough time to look up and realize his mistake before the teacher sets her foot all the way down, trapping the poor boy under her heel.  Now, Skye didn't go unnoticed.  Even with her feet worn down from all her standing, she could still feel the inch sized boy under her.  Reason told her to take the shoe off and remove the foreign object, but she couldn't.  It just felt too good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the kids all find their seats, Miss C passes out their assignment for the day.  She walks down each row of desks, handing out the paper to each student.  Every step she takes damns Skye to further torment.  Unlike the warm, welcoming flesh he felt when her arches lightly rested on him, the skin of her heel was rough, without much give, and each step forced the entire weight of her body on him.  When her foot lifted, Skye was given just enough room for the sweat rich atmosphere to flood his mouth and make him gag.  When her foot went down, the sole shoved him into the insole, forcing torrents of sweat out of it to add to Skye's personal hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Miss C reached the last student, she stopped.  He wouldn't take the paper from her.  \"Sarah, what's wrong?\" she asked her.  \"I don't wanna do math.\"  Miss C sighed, and keeled down to talk to her.  The heel of her right foot popped out slightly, but she didn't notice while she tried to persuade a first grader to  do its homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye felt his cycle of hell under the heel break for a second.  Miss Curtis's foot was at a 45 degree angle from the ground, and the shoe was at a 35 degree angle, slightly off of her foot.  This gave Skye room to breathe, and even let some light in.  He had realized his mistake, and was done with this woman.  There was no comfort in here.  He pried his bruised body from the insole, careful not to hit the sole that was only inches (in his scale) above him.  He began his climb to the source of light, but before he was even half way there, the shoe shifted slightly.  It was too much for Skye, and he started the slide down the shoe's slope.  He crashed into the ball of her foot, which still touched the insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss C felt something hit her foot.  She figured it was the insole just acting up, as old ones tend to do.  She could easily stomp her foot and be rid of the problem, but a breakthrough was so, so close with Sarah, and she wasn't going to jeopardize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye quickly g ot his bearings, and he scampered to the opening.  He knew if he didn't make it, he wouldn't be alive for long.  Does he?</span></div></div>",

The first couple of kids missed you, their massive steps soaring over your head, but that luck would never last.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying right side up near you was a plastic toy car, window eternally ajar.  It's frame would be stronger than shrunken flesh and bones.  You run for it, dodging the kids as best as you could.  Doing a very impressive flip, you dive into the window and land on the seat.  No seat belts, but it'd have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had only taken around three seconds for the door to open and you to enter the car, but it had felt like an eternity.  You slump in the seat that was a bit too big for you, thankful to whatever gods were watching out for inch tall stowaways.  As you sent up the silent prayer, the sky went dark.  Did the gods not like it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who left this toy out?  We know that toys belong in the toy corner until playtime.  I'll put it away this time, but next time, you'll be in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booming voice of what you could only assume to be the teacher rocked the car.  From behind the car swung her foot, stopping next to the driver side door.  Encased it a ratty green flat, her foot was three times the length of your ride.  Her hand grabbed the front of the car, pressing against the windshield and blocking the view from the front.  She lifted, dragging the front end up and leaving the back end to dangle in the air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, lightly swinging her arms as she walked to the corner of the room.  For her, it was gentle and almost unnoticeable.  For you, it felt like you were in a tornado.  You smashed into the roof of the car, then into the sides, then back to the roof, then down to the back seat.  You feel a bump as she sets the car down.  Panting, you listen to her walk back to the front of the class.  The sound of her voice as she taught the alphabet was soft and muted back here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying in the back seat of a tiny toy car and nursing a bruised head, you can't help but wonder what happened to your life.</span></div></div>",

True, Kaitlyn might not recognize you this way, but your common sense demanded that you comply and take the desk route. The only problem was this would take some careful premeditation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the top of Kaitlyn's higher knee, you were just a few inches from the desk's surface... a gap which seemed like you could barely clear without an advantage of some sort. That's also assuming that she didn't get up or even absentmindedly fidget, causing you to lose your precious balance and fall to an untimely death. Inhaling deeply and staring at the space, you prepare to make the leap of faith with a generous running start, arms flailing as you tried to achieve balance while sailign through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fortune would have it, the combination of your flawless jump and lightweight body allow you to barely make it to the edge.

It was just across the hallway, to your excitement, which meant you'd get there in no time. With ten minutes to spare before the final class bell rang, you would have time to get in and even get comfortable before Amelia and her classmates arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin the cross the hallway carefully, as if crossing a busy street.

You hurry, measuring out the distance as best as you could, as well as planning how you'd avoid the feet that were already headed in a beeline for your body. Sweat began to develop on your face, but you were in too much of a rush to dab it away. Then it occured to you: if you were going to die, you might as well see the face of who was going to become your unwitting killer.

You now realize that it was one of the metallic studs on Amelia's boot that had saved you. You had always thought that they were over-the-top, even for your fledgling goth of a sister, but now you vowed that you would never complain about them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any close calls, you arrive with Amelia at her first hour class. The class was Physical Science, by the look of the room. As she settles into her seat, willfully ostracized from the majority of the class, you begin to plot your next move. Crawling the height and breadth of your sister seemed pretty risky, but your options were incredibly limited. After all, there was no way you could get her attention from down here, because Amelia could never feel anything through the thick material of the boot, and her attire had very little skin to show for as it was. You would have to rely on other means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, you would need shelter. When your sister got up again, you'd go through the same painstaking and potentially fatal process of trying to stay attached to the boot as she walked. Instead of fighting for your life, you could always stay snug in the boot, at least temporarily. After an uneventful but very informative trip upward (regarding the best way to climb the gothic boot) you reach the collar, and peer down inside. Amelia's black socks were all that stood in your way, but you were small enough to slip down inside without touching them.

The momentum of your slide coupled with the step sent you catapulting into the air, destined to meet your end on the floor below. A violent rush of wind cuts off your air temporarily, and you are sent soaring to about knee height before plummeting back down as quickly as you had been tossed upward. There's no time to brace in any way for the impact, and in your disorientation you are suddenly sent forcefully to the unforgiving floor tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a warm trickle by your ear, dizzily looking around. Your head and brain addled, you were seeing double... but as if by some curse your vision cleared up just in time for you to see the bringer of your unfortunate fate. On the same stride, Amelia's other boot was already coming up in step, its owner completely unaware that it was about to descend upon her brother and finish what the first boot in the pair had started. You can see the grime that had collected on the sole of Amelia's boot... each narrow groove and detail as it hovered over you in what felt like slow motion. It came as a swift end to your agony, crumpled in an incapacitated heap at the feet of the gigantic goth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she been aware of it, Amelia probably would have felt at least some remorse.

Sure, she'd hear the news of her brother's disappearance and speculate for some time... but the reality was too farfetched to ever occur to the girl. Your mouth hangs open in an inaudible scream as the boot connects with your maimed body, crushing it effortlessly into a scarlet paste beneath the comparitively tremendous weight.

You sprint to the other side of the cafeteria though, making it to the oposite wall the houses doors leading to the auditorium.

Unless the were dragging themselves along the wall, they'd have no need too. You make a note of this handy way of travel for later, before finally making it to the far side of the room. Here was a huge hole leading to another hallway, and you turn and start to go down it. The first door on the left is Amelia's Home Ec classroom, and you are probably only ten minutes late to it. Can they blame you though? You didn't even have time to go to your locker! You chuckle at your own joke as you continue on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At last, you are here. Outside the Home Ec room, your target awaiting you inside. You let loose a sigh of relief, you made it here alive. Now comes the hard part - getting to Amelia and having her not kill you. Also making sure none of her classmates maim you either. That'd be pretty bad. You slip through a crack in the door and go inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The first thing that greets you is the sound of beaters beating. The smell of cooking is filling the room with it's aroama, and you observe that today the class is baking cookies for the end of the year assembly. It's basically an excuse for the teacher's to not draw up lesson plans for the students on one of the last days of school by hosting an event for the whole day in which everyone relaxes and enjoys life. Some can clean out their lockers, others just visit their friends before they're gone for the summer, it's all a very fun event. The whole school attends it, so you'd hate to still be lost and small then. On that note, you make your way towards them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gah! This is hard.

Why shouldn't you be entitled to all this grub instead of their ungrateful asses. You snort with disgust as you pick up a cookie. You helped cook, you've earned this. You plop it into your mouth and chew. Mhmmm....this is actually pretty good. It has a...unique flavor to it. You're going to have to swipe more later, and maybe even the recipe. If you have anything to do with it, more of these cookies will be made, and go straight into your belly!</span></div></div>",

You look up ahead of you. On the side farthest from her is a tray full of cut out cookie shapes. You could probably sneak through by hiding behind them, but it'd be dangerous. On the side closest to her, you have her collection of cookie cutters. You could weave around them and avoid detection that way. Each side is dangerous, but one may be fatal.

If you hurried you'd be able to catch her as she went in. On second thought, all of those stampeding feet as they rushed in before the bell rang wasn't something you wanted to be in the midst of. If you made good time you'd have to wait on the sidelines until the class had settled into their seats. But you'd work out the finer details later. You start out with a brisk jog across the tile, knowing Britney's chemistry classroom was only a couple doors down from where you were. However, at your shrunken, handicapped pace, that was still a very long and arduous trek. The tile practically stretched on for a mile. Okay, maybe not a mile, but it was still a pain in the ass to traverse. Regardless, you have twenty minutes to get there, so you'd take your time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter roughly twenty minutes passes, you arrive at the door, right on schedule. If you really had wanted to arrive there, you could've made it in ten minutes, but there was really no rush since your sister wasn't even in the classroom yet. As if on cue, the shrill bell sounds, and there is a thunderous din of noise as virtually every student converges into the hallways. You stand rigidly with your back to the wall beside the entrance to the chem leb, being meticulously careful not to be crushed by any stray foot as it passes by. After what feels like an eon, you finally notice Britney heading for the door, gabbing mindlessly with some of her other ditzy friends that are clearly not in any rush to get into the class despite the bell's imminent ringing. Britney and another friend are the last to slip in, but they still have a minute to spare to talk by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic sandal of Britney comes to a clamorous drop just a few inches from you, and you wonder what course of action to take. You had a window of opportunity to your sister's attention now, of course, or in the very least hitch a ride at her feet. But then again you might also want to wait ntil she sat down as was already idlely looking around the room in boredom to catch her attention. That option also came with the risk of someone else finding you too, however. Decisions, decisions. You had less than a minute to sweat it out, and it would take at least thirty seconds to secure yourself on Brit's sandal, so think fast. Then again, you didn't even have to choose her. Her friend might be of better help to you, although she was also probably as stupid as her friend. You metaphorically rub your chin and weigh your options.</span></div></div>",

You gulp nervously as you wonder what could happen if she mistook you for some kind of insect. Living with her all your life, you knew what kind of draconian punishment she could dish out on any bug that crossed paths with her. Yeah, for now you'd be content just to hitch a ride until the opportune moment where you'd be sure she'd recognize you as the human you are... albeit, diminished a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now or never. Taking a second to prepare, you pick up speed over the course of a few inches of tile before vaulting yourself over the soft material of Brit's sandal. You brace for the impact as the wind around your body picks up. You're practically sailing through the air, something you hadn't accounted for but now realized was due to your now very lightweight body. Even so, you find that your progress has been limited. With a fairly graceful landing, you end up just above the toe strap of the sandal. You quickly slide down her big toe in order to secure yourself beside the strap, figuring it might be something to hold onto once the roller coaster-like rhythm of Brit's footfalls began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, you once again feel that unearhtly breeze, this time magnified by the sheer size of your sister's foot as it swung through the air. The ground looks as if it's 75 feet or more below you, and relative to your size it might as well have been. Grabbing tightly to the sandal, you clench your teeth as air whips over your face, making it difficult to see ahead of you as it forcefully closed your eyes. Just when you thought you were about to puke from the awful ride, it came to a sudden stop. Britney had reached her desk and was already settling into her seat. None the worse for wear, save for some nausea, you'd made it to the next stage of your plan.

Since Britney was seated now, her feet were allowed to relax without much weight on them. The toes had spread out, releasing you from their constricting vicegrip. It was a relief, seeing as you wer eplanning to venture out now. Being trapped down here was one of the most degrading things you could think of, and you hoped Britney would never know that you had been groveling at her feet (literally) and had almost been trapped there without her even having to try to imprison you. You'd leave these little details out of your explanation once Britney discovered you, you quickly decided. She already had enough dirt on you as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Another damn day in this stupid place, and I'll, like, totally rip my hair out</i>, Britney thought impatiently. George Washington High had to be the dullest institution on Earth. She had long since taken her focus off of the frenzied activity of the classroom and was pretending to listen to her friend Rachael blather on about her little brother's annoying qualities. Britney's little brother was a loser, too, but at least she didn't talk about it all the time. Yawning futively, she nodded at her friend, who had finally come to a loss of things to say. They were supposed to be studying for a test or something, but her memory of it was foggy. Glancing at the paper, Brit grimaced and pushed it away. She'd do it later, if at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she felt something itchy on her foot. Resisting the urge to bend down and placate the irritation in front of the class and embarass herself, Britney bit her tongue and suffered through the continued feelings of irritation. It was barely perceptible, but at the same time incredibly annoying because ithere was nothing around to distract her from it. That's when she got an idea. Lifting up the opposing sandaled foot, she decided to scratch it with the nail on her big toe. All of her manicured toenails were long and sharp enough to give it a good itch, so if she tilted her foot just the right way it'd feel much better. <i>Sometimes I wonder why people don't recognize how much of a genius I am</i>, Britney thought smugly as she unknowingly proceeded to smite her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is an Interactive about an 18 year old Skye at his school. <b>He can be killed, tortured, wounded, maimed, and etc.</b> I ask that you keep out anything to do with cock vore, cocks in general, experiences with men genitalia at all, anything gay. I do not hate gay people....its just the fact that Skye is not gay. Hes straight, simple as that<b>. I would also prefer the correct use of grammar and spelling. As Skye is used to using it, and its easier for most to enjoy.</b> this will not fly. THIS WILL NOT FLY. \"I AM TALL BUT TALKING LIKE THIS IS ANNOYING! I MAY BE A GIANT, BUT JUST PUT he/she said, but at Skye's height, it sounded like shouting. This will fly.<b> I also ask that you try not to make a huge amount of run ons.</b> <b>Please refrain from 1 sentence chapters. Make it at least a paragraph or two. Thanks.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye's Appearance:<br>\r\nSkye has brown hair. His hairstyle is very plain, short cut with nothing special to show. Has blue eyes with a normal average body. Not obese, but not a stick figure. Is wearing a cutoff or T-Shirt, and normally sport shorts, for sports ya' know. Is a boy, if that was not obvious for the unisex name. Has a girlfriend, one Anna, who has been dating him for the better part of six months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFamily:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas three sisters, and a little brother. But considering he will only see his brother if he is kidnapped by ninjas, lets just say his name is Paul, black hair with brown eyes. Actually Paul is dead to the story because any GTS related stuff you want to do with a little brother, who's an <u>infant,</u> in this story would be risque and wrong, let's just pretend he's dead. You can keep Paul in your own sick dark fantasies though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister 1:<br>\r\nName: Jessica<br>\r\nAge: 17 1/2<br>\r\n<b>Appearance</b>: Black hair with purple highlights. Is on a good basis with Skye. Normally wears jeans and regular punk rock T-shirts. On her left upper arm she has a vague tattoo that probably won't mean shit later on in her life, it's kind of hilarious. Wears hair down and long. Has a C cup. Is pretty slim figured and enjoys running and general exercise.<br>\r\n<b>Personality</b> wise, she is humorous and relaxed. She can go easy and may not take things seriously. Isn't a ditz but also isn't a feminazi, just your typical teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister 2:<br>\r\nName: Amelia<br>\r\nAge: 14<br>\r\nAppearance: Amelia is going through one of those phases where she goes anti-conformist. She is goth and wears all black with a lot more black. Wears ripped up Jeans because the man don't like it, even if it's in style. Has an A cup. Again, slim but since she's 14, thats a given. She mostly just acts lazy around the house though, and probably knows her way around a hitter or bowl, if you catch my drift. If you don't, that means she does drugs. Doesn't go hardcore, but still, for you puritans that's probably bad.<br>\r\n<b>Personality</b>: YOU DON'T KNOW HER STORY, OK?! SHE'S A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHO'S INTO DEATH METAL AND SMOKES SHE IS A PRECIOUS FLOWER. Yeah no, rocks have more personality than her sometimes. Which is fitting seeing how often she is stoned. When she isn't off smoking, she's being angsty because she is a beautiful soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Three:<br>\r\nName: Britney<br>\r\nAge: 16<br>\r\n<b>Appearance</b>: A perky blond who your dad probably suspects came from an affair with another man. Has green eyes and is always happy, though she may just not realize how bad things are at times. Shes not smart, but she's not brain dead. She would probably see Skye as a bug, and not look deeper in it. Has a D cup. Kind of a thicker figure, but not fat. Got dem curves, mmm. Wears loose fitting jeans and shirts as a result, and sometimes even a thong. You come from a high class family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother:<br>\r\nName: Carrie<br>\r\nAge: 47<br>\r\nNote: I would prefer that no deep interaction goes on between Skye and his mother. I mean, its his mom, just avoid from sex using his tiny body, or any of that. Vore, crush, and etc is ok. No unbirth or sex. Mmkay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriends:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy:<br>\r\nAmy is your 18 year old nemesis. She hates you with a passion. It might be because, a while back, your class was making paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 gifts for old people in the nearby old folks home, you stepped on a ruller that a tray of glue was on, and it flew. Amy's upper body got 'glued' to say the least, and shes hated you for it. You would figure she would forgive you for something that happened 7 years ago.<br>\r\nHas bright red hair, but its dyed from her usual brown. Has brown eyes, and is 5\"7. Wears a thin red shirt and has a huge DD cup. Is the popular girl. Go figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna:<br>\r\nYour girlfriend and a real sweetheart. Is 18 and amazing when it comes to beauty. She loves you and would never hurt you. Has brown hair, blue eyes, and wears a pink sweatshirt with jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun:<br>\r\nThis is a boy.<br>\r\nYour best friend, in many ways. He saved you from becoming a drug addict by talking you out of cocaines grip, he wanted it and stole it. Your friend, Bob, tried it and died from overuse a month later. You've been friends ever since. Is dating Kaitlyn, whom you may not like, but he is your friend. Has black hair and brown eyes. Wear casual clothing, usually jeans no matter what the weather. He is kind of fat, yet athletic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChijinda:<br>\r\nYour other best friend. Can be funny, and might be shrunken along with you. He is brothers with Kyon and owns a cat. Is dating a girl named Narue who lives in Japan. He reminds you of an infamous video game character. Probably won't be mentioned much, hes to lazy to make cameos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaitlyn:<br>\r\nA rival of yours. To the fullest extent you don't hate each other, but you don't like each other. Is tall and has brown hair down to her torso. Blue eyes and a B cup make her ok. You antagonize her, so she MIGHT hate you. Knows how to kick your ass. Just a warning though; She can get freaky and demented, especially when she has teenage hormones and your tiny body. She'll probably just fuck with Skye and kill him, seeing as how she a cold hearted bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan: <br>\r\nKaitlyn's Younger sister by two years(16). Is a blonde, perky, smart girl. Exceeds in all her studies, which seems to be amazing due to stereotypes(don't you hate how opposites of their stereotypes get fussed over just because?). Plays Volleyball with some other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan T.:<br>\r\nA boy, this one's a boy.<br>\r\nHe is athletic, and can be a dick. You guys get along. But he can be a dick. Has blonde hair, and wears athletic shorts and sneakers.Wears muscle tees most of the time. Did I mention he can be a dick? Though, I'd find him just as reliable as any other friend in a life or death situation. He plays most sports in the school, and hosts many parties. He wouldn't kill you, and may even help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac:<br>\r\nHes smart, blonde, with a red shirt and black pants. Is a buddy of yours, who hangs out in the Library taking mostly online courses and reading. You use some of his locker because he rarely goes there, or anywhere outside the Library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal Ball:<br>\r\nA 17 year old girl who has a minor crush on you. Owns a pet spider named Emma. Has black hair with a blond tint that she dyed in. Is into Athletics and wears a T-shirt with shorts in most weather. Has hazel eyes. You never really talked, so she could go either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael:<br>\r\nAnother blond girl with blue eyes. Is a dumb ass like your sister, Britney, and happens to be one of Britney's many 'girlfriends'. Not in the dating sense though. Only has a few classes with Britney, and didn't really acknowledge your existence much when you saw her. She is also afraid of bugs, but don't let that stop you from <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">being stupid</span> trying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenae<br>\r\nA girl in the same class as you, she has had a crush on you for awhile, and wouldn't hesitate to 'take advantage' of your size(if you know what I mean). She has alot of freckles, black hair, and wears black. But imagine what she'd be like drunk. Thats the stuff nightmares piss themselves about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney:<br>\r\nBlond with lots of freckles, Courtney  is just one of those random background types. You only started noticing her when she was the size of a building, going out with a guy...but kind of slutty. She'd ride any guys roller coaster, if you catch my drift. She wears loose fitting shirts and shorts so short it's almost illegal. Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather:<br>\r\nBlack hair, asian, and all the intellegence. Heather is one cold calculating bitch. Despite being rather cute, she remains single because \"no guys are up to my standards\". She may be a feminist, so watch out for her. She has a small B cup, and wears glasses. She may be able to reverse your shrunken state, but that's if she wants to. Rather not squander her genius and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily:<br>\r\nEmily is a freshman, with everything going for her physically. You're saying she has a nice ass, if you're one to judge. And you are, you'd even say you're the ass concierge. Besides that, she has a deep tan and a nice rack, and wears clothing tight enough to show it. Yowza! Plays Volleyball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikayla: <br>\r\nShe is 16 and 5' 5\" with brown hair and green eyes. She is quite fond of you and is popular with many people at school, though mainly because she's \"gotten around\" so to say. You dated for a time but eventually agreed to a mutual break up, which she understood. May be trustworthy. She also plays Volleyball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea:<br>\r\nShe is 16 and is 5' 6\" with brown hair and amber colored eyes. She is an african american. She is on the volleyball team and is popular with a lot of people at school due to her outstanding sports record and community work. You flirt with her occasionally, so you suppose you're on good terms?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail:<br>\r\nShe is 14 and 5'1\" with short blonde hair and green eyes. She is caucasian, and one of your sister, Amelia's friends. She is much cheerier though, and is about average in the intelligence department. You know of her, don't know her, so she doesn't like or dislike you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby:<br>\r\nShe is 13, 4'9, and afraid of bugs like no other. Afraid of bugs as in \"Oh fuck a bug, let me squash it!\" too. She won't shriek, she won't eek. She'll stomp, inialliate, and destroy any bug that attempts to touch her. She is fond of you though, and might even have a girlhood crush on you. That's a thing you bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaide:<br>\r\nAsian, 12, and 4'11, Jaide is a grade below Amelia and a very shy girl. She's sweet to her friends, and quiet to everyone else. You never managed to get that close to her due to that, but you assume you'd of gotten along. Has black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Final Note: Please follow all the rules at the top.</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit: <br>\r\n<i>I would also like to say that this story can be unaware/aware. As I know people prefer them both, its up to the writer if Skye is found. But keep in mind he is small, and would need to get up close to their face just to be noticed,and even then, might not.</i><br>\r\nSkye can leave School, he can go anywhere. Why? Because hes Skye. &gt;:P</td>",
