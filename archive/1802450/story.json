But unknown to Sonic, someone else was looking to take full advantage of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Inside the Master Emerald~<br>\r\nTikal felt a subtle change in the emerald, knowing someone had shrunk it to move it. And from what she felt in the outside world, there was a female echidna current;y in heat with a suitable male close by. This was her chance to leave the Master Emerald as her original body was long gone, absorbed by the energy within the emerald. With this the right moment, she could implant her spirit into a new life that could be conceived near the emerald. She sense not arousal from the male, and felt the aura and knew it was the one that defeated Chaos. Knowing full well he wouldn't mate with someone that was already taken, all she had to do was give him a little 'push', induce his arousal to the point he wouldn't care if the female was someone else's mate and just rut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Outside the Master Emerald~<br>\r\nSonic was just about to step out to give the echidna girl her privacy, but then something stopped him.

If he was ever freed, he would become Perfect Chaos and ravage the world once more. No, his old body had become to diseased to allow him the freedom of peace.

By mixing a tropical plant pheromone with a powerful aphrodisiac, you had created a chemical that would make anyone your obedient and loving sex slave. Some would think you were too young to have sexual thoughts, but you had been in love with a certain hedgehog for years. If Sonic was indeed in love with you, it would reveal his true feelings and allow him to accept them. If he didn't, he would. Now you just had to design a machine that could release the mixture discreetly and concentrated to only one person. You didn't want the mixture to make you a mindless sex zombie too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tinkering for a few hours, you had a device to spray a concentrated stream of the mixture that would be immediately absorbed so that it wasn't hanging around in the air.

For those of you who don't know, Mobius = Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that most of the \"Pick your start\" stuff is done, members may now freely add chapters as they please. The rules for adding a chapter are as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No Death (No one can be: Stabbed, Shot, or digested in any way possible. Things such as soft chewing, bleeding from the nose/vagina (Too Big + Too Small = Pain), and any pain on a minimal level. *Bruises, bumps, slaps, whips, SMALL cuts = Okay. Slashes, bullet holes, burning skin, = No-No.<br>\r\n-Must be AT LEAST twenty words. Anything I post is not subjectable to this rule.<br>\r\n-The listed kinds of vore are allowed: Soft, Cock, Unbirth, and Anal. No hard vore, or any disturbing kind of vore not listed.<br>\r\n-Micro-Macro is allowed on one condition- A chapter must describe how the character got Macro/Micro. People do not start out giant/small.<br>\r\n-Tentacles are a yes. Impregnation by tentecles, also a yes. Tentecle strangling, NO.<br>\r\n-The Mobians may change gender, but must be effected by something: Radiation, technology, magic, etc. No Mobian starts out as a herm exept: Chaos, Metal Sonic, and Chao characters.<br>\r\n-DO NOT CHANGE FROM CHARACTER TO CHARACTER! PICK ONE AND STICK WITH IT.<br>\r\n-Absolutely, Positively, 100%, no Scat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT</b><br>\r\nRemember this is a story. Not every character out there is going to whore themselves to the protagonist. Please attempt to create a scenario that \"Sets the mood\". Sappy junk that takes up two pages isn't needed, but I am asking you to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's Going To Be Inside:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-General Sex<br>\r\n-Masturbation<br>\r\n-(Possible Vore)<br>\r\n-Rape<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">-(Possible Incest)</span> -<b>THERE WILL BE INCEST</b>-<br>\r\n-Hyper<br>\r\n-Magic<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't like any of these things?
