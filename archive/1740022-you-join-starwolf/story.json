The walls of the building were metal, but with an unusual and eye-catching characteristic: they glowed, a faint silvery-white light that illuminated the otherwise darkened corridor. The hangar wasn't far - they had only gone about twenty feet before they were in an open area with a few Wolfens and Landmasters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stopped and stared. The other member of StarWolf was a girl. And a rather nice-looking one, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly thing was, she'd lost her right leg. Her left foot didn't look real, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO'Donnell, who'd gone some paces ahead, turned and looked at him. \"Matt, this is Shasira, our tech. Shasira, Matt's just joined us. I don't know anything about him, except that he's got the right stuff to be one of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi,\" said Matt hurriedly. It was all he could do not to blurt out, \"How did you get hurt? And what are you doing in a group like this?\" She didn't look tough. But as he got closer, he could see the glint in her eyes that said, \"Don't mess with me, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze softened slightly in a smile. \"Hey, Matt. Welcome to StarWolf. Oh, and it's okay. I don't mind if you ask what happened to me.\" She winked. Matt guessed most people wondered what <i>had</i> happened when they first met her. He hoped he didn't have his usual dumb expression on his face that said, \"What the heck...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, okay. So... \" He raised his eyebrows and tilted his head ever so slightly in her direction, the question unspoken but there nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"We were ambushed by StarFox almost two years ago, and I was caught in the middle of an explosion,\" she told him. \"It was... yeah, it wasn't too pleasant.\" She made a wry face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt winced sympathetically. \"Ouch. Yeah. Not very nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she hasn't been able to go out with us since then, but I couldn't just drop her.\" Wolf grinned. \"It's hard to get techies like her now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasira grinned too. \"Nice to feel appreciated,\" she countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, out of the blue, there was a huge explosion and the hangar shuddered and rocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...!!!\" exclaimed Wolf, snarling.</span></div></div>",

Matt subconsciously classed him as fit, competent, a good pilot, and dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf introduced them and Leon asked, \"So, Matt, you any good as a pilot?\" He fixed his piercing stare on the new recruit. Matt felt uncomfortable under the scrutiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some,\" he muttered, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. \"I haven't flown in a while, though, so I don't know how out of practice I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chameleon flashed his teeth at Matt. \"I know a way to find out,\" he said, in a not-so-nice way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf threw Leon a quick look. \"You can't put him through The Obstacle Course, not yet anyway,\" he growled, apparently alarmed. Matt could literally heard the capital letters. Oh, shoot. That sounded ominous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Leon's expression was hard to judge - Matt was only good with human reactions. \"If he makes it, he's good. If he doesn't, I've just saved you from a terrible mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf growled deep in his throat. \"Not yet, Lee.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, I didn't exactly bump into him, mind you.  He zoomed straight into me on his little plane.  For goodness sake!  A FROG driving a plane, and wearing a purple and black armour?  That was crazy!  But not as crazy as talking to a fox with a red and green suit earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, this must be a crazy day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog bumped into my side with a thud, before jabbing furiously at his controls and screaming bloody murder from his seat in the tiny plane.  I watched with amusement as the frog tried to make a detour, before realizing that his plane was suspended in mid-air by my fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't going anywhere!  Gosh, the frog was cute! HA! So I took the plane by its propellers and began walking up onto the sidewalk to show Mom this amazing flying amphibian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you!  Who do you think I am?\" The frog yelled at me in English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was slightly taken aback.  \"A frog?\" I admitted truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A FROG?\" He screamed, thrashing about in his pilot seat angrily.  \"Annoying Human! NO! I am the Great Leon!  Ace Pilot of Star Wolf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you look like a frog,\" I said unafraid.  After all, no matter how great a frog was, he still couldn't do anything much to human.  Maybe he could croak at me angrily and jump on me furiously, but that was all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am no frog!\" He yelled hysterically.  \"If you must know the more degrading term, it is a chameleon, not a frog!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... Alright,\" I relented.  \"Though I don't see the difference, Chameleon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The Great Leon</i>,\" he corrected irritably.  He hesitated for a moment or so before casting me a sideways glance.  \"It's you!  You're that meddling humani fool who aided Star Fox!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fox?\" I asked, perking up.  \"Yes! There was a green and red armoured fox in my garden!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Great Leon</i> cursed me every single bad word he knew.  \"So you admit it!\" He shrieked.  \"You helped Star Fox!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told the talking fox where I last saw the talking wolf if that's what you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" A large maniacal grin tainted his features.  \"I am the assassin of Star Wolf!  And you will die!  It seems that it is you whom I was sent to murder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sent a frog- I mean, a Chameleon to murder me?\" I asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not look down on me!  I shall torment you for all eternity instead of handing you a quick death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure. \" I muttered.  \"I'm having frog legs for dinner by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a frog!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignored him.  \"Mom!\" I called out from the backyard. \"Come and see this!  An amazing talking Chameleon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Great Leon's eyes widened in pure horror, before aiming his tiny little gun at me.  Idiot.  It was just a little froggie gun!  What could it do?  Maybe a little needle might come out through the hole and poke me or something.  I honestly didn't know what to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I definitely did not expect this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started shrinking, and shrinking, and shrinking.  And it seemed like I would never stop.  Fine, I did stop, but by that time, I was the about the size of a tiny ferret.  No wait, I was a tiny ferret to be precise.  With fury paws, and fury feet... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  WHAT IN THE WORLD JUST HAPPENED?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a deep breath and looked to the Chameleon which was approximately the same height as me now.  He was grinning sadistically and triumphantly, as though he had fulfilled his life's sole dream or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were part of the war,\" he chortled wickedly.  \"Therefore, for joining the losing side, you must pay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I wasn't wrong...\" I stammered, frightened now.  \"I think the 'little war' you were speaking off happened in my garden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were talking about a fox and a wolf right? I saw them both,\" I told him.  \"Chasing each other about in my garden.  Oh yes, and with weapons.  I thought it was some sort of dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as the chameleon furrowed his brows (if he had one) in careful deliberation.  \"You talked to the fox, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" that scary smirk of his returned to his features.  \"We want to know where that stinkin' fox is.  So you, little fool of a humani are going to tell us!  YOU, ARE GOING TO HELP US!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if say no?\" I stuttered, knees shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't reply, only tied me up with tiny ropes which didn't seem so tiny anymore, and chucked me on his 'Star-wolf plane'.  Then, the Chameleon climbed onto the front seat and started the engine once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can torture you for the information,\" He said.  \"Torment you for eternity for it! - and you will remain a prisoner!  Or you can just tell us.  If you do, we will allow you to  be a true member of Star Wolf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell would I join a Wolf's gang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you won't get tortured!\" He grinned merrily at the thought of torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't want to get tortured, nor did I want to join this weird team called 'Star Wolf'.  What kind of name was that anyway?  All I wanted to do was go home.  But at the moment, it looked like it was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Well, this is awkward,</i> I thought, staring blankly at the wall. And it was awkward. Not only had I been transmogrified (which I'd thought only happened in <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>), kidnapped, and threatened with torture unless I helped fight a war in which I should have no part, the way I had been tied up was cramped, uncomfortable, and, well, awkward. To me it was just adding insult to injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon the Chameleon might have thought he was going incredibly fast, but I figured the little plane was only making about 25 to 30 mph. I wondered in which direction we were going. Time ticked by. I felt I would go nuts if I didn't say something, but talking to amphibians in airplanes who had been sent to assassinate me wasn't very high on my list of favorite things to do. I vowed to keep silent if it killed me. Maybe this was the first way of torturing me for information. Somehow they must have found out how fond I was of talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about forty minutes, I fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stutter of gunfire smacked the side of the craft, barely missing the pilot. Boy, did I wake up fast. We were hurtling toward the ground at a speed that made our previous velocity seem like snail pace. The chameleon cussed himself blue (literally) and desperately tried to get the plane to glide. When that didn't work, he looked back at the fast receding sky and glared impotently at our attacker, a sleek blue miniature... I don't know what. All I knew was that I had never before seen a flying craft that shape. It looked like a piece of modern art, and I was amazed that the thing could even get off the ground. Then we hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow we survived escapes my understanding to this day. Correction: how The Great Leon survived. He wasn't wearing any type of safety restraint and by all rights should have been killed. I merely fell off the back seat onto the floor. Fumes and smoke made me cough and gag until the chameleon grabbed me and dragged me out of the wreckage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" I screamed at him, once I could speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snarled and pointed his gun at me again. \"None of your business, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he glanced at a device on his wrist. From the expression on his face, I suddenly realized that he was the one in the awkward situation now. His radio had been destroyed and he had a prisoner. I couldn't walk unless he untied my legs. I smugly pointed this out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was not happy. (Understatement of the year.) But he had no choice.</span></div></div>",
