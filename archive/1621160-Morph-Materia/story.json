Over the course of many years, this crystal grew to become a chunk of materia that travelled on the rivers of life energy, until eventually bursting to the surface on a fountain of mako energy high on a mountain top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt lay on the edge of the fountain for a while, until by chance a curious bird picked it up in it's talons and took to the air. The bird flew over the countryside, carrying the materia with it, until eventually the creature's thoughts turned to food. The image of a fat, juicy worm formed in it's bird brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird transformed suddenly, sending the materia and a very confused worm plummeting to the ground. The materia landed with a thud, rolled a little through the grass, and came to a safe stop. A hand reached down and picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand that belonged to...</span></div></div>",

His bright blue eyes passed briefly over the ever-changing hues of the materia that had almost fallen on his head before he handed it to Aeris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are really rare, if it's what I think it is,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless it can help us rescue, Tifa, I don't care,\" he dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it can,\" she replied. The materia glowed in her hand, there was a flash of light, and the long metal staff in her other hand suddenly became a bunch of flowers. She smelled them and smiled. \"It <i>is{/} what I thought it was; morph materia.\" His amazement amused her. Turning the flowers back into her staff with another mental command, she raised her right hand for him to see. \"That's nothing. Watch this.\" There was another flash of light from the materia, and her arm, from her fingertips to her elbow, became another perfectly-real, perfectly-scented bouquet of flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we can use this to sneak you into Don Corneo's mansion,\" she explained as she turned her arm back into an arm. \"He doesn't allow men to enter, so we can disguise you as...\"</i></span></div></div>",

The expression on his face was pained, and she couldn't help but feel relieved as his head shrank and vanished into his swelling torso, leaving an open neck-hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was shrinking, and was already light enough for her to hold him up from the dirty cobblestones of Wall Market. His clothes, fortunately, were the last to change. They unravelled and shrank, becoming lengths of string that trussed his body tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformation completed, leaving him as a sizeable bird; she estimated him at around 10 pounds. Quickly, she took the morph materia and pushed it inside Cloud's chest cavity, before placing him onto the cart as it passed through the gates.</span></div></div>",

He could transform back and attempt to fight his way through the crowds of henchmen taking care of the delivery, endangering himself and potentially Tifa. Or he could wait, maintain the pretense of being poultry until he was in an area free of guards, then morph back, and save her with minimal effort and danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out that maintaining the pretense of being a chicken was really quite easy; and consisted of allowing himself to be manhandled by one of the henchmen and carried through a side-entrance, down a passageway, and into a kitchen, where he was placed down on one of the worktops and left alone. The Morph Materia, which had tumbled about precariously during transit, came to a rest inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last vestiges of his human heat leeched out into the cold marble of the worktop.</span></div></div>",

Don Corneo held him up in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it!\" he cried. \"My, my, my, look at you. This was quite a disguise, I must say. Unfortunately for you, I saw youu sneaking in.

Really, you look <i>just</i> like chicken.\" He tossed Cloud back down on the counter surface and ran a hand over his cold, plucked, puckered flesh. \"I expect she got the taste just right too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud began to struggle. Aerith was indeed skilled with the morph materia, and had been smart enough to give his new body a certain degree of mobility. But she had also trussed his body from gullet-to-drumstick with string so tight that all he was able to manage was a desperate wiggle. The Don laughed as the raw chicken writhed helplessly on the counter before him. With deliberate slowness, he drew the largest kitchen knife and pressed it's flat edge against the chicken's bare back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the SOLDIER I've heard so much about,\" he said, as the chicken shuddered at the sudden coldness of the knife. \"The one that ShinRa have tried so hard to stop.

The chicken, sensing this taste of freedom, began to wriggle anew. The Don allowed it's struggles to continue for a while, noting how it's movements took it ever so slowly, ever so desperately in the direction that the morph materia had fallen, before taking a drumstick in each hand and spreading them wide until the thigh bones and cartilage creaked and cracked, exposing the entrance to Cloud's body cavity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're here to rescue that Tifa girl,\" the Don asked, as he bustled about the kitchen behind Cloud. \"What a shame that no-one is here to rescue you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pelvis was broken, his legs immovable from their spread, vulnerable position, but his plucked winged still scraped weakly against the tabletop, pulling his body, millimetre by millimetre, towards the distant morph materia.

And he would be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy hand larger than himself held him firmly to the counter and another, balled into a fist, forced it's way between his drumsticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This may leave you a little tender,\" Don Corneo warned, as he pushed a handful of stuffing deep inside Cloud's chest cavity.

He removed his glasses and handed them and the morph materia to Yuffie with a look of determination. His body had already begun to stretch and grow; with all his wrinkles the effect was like an accordion being stretched out. He fell forward onto his bony hands to allow his legs, unused for countless years, to stretch out behind, as they grew longer, muscular, and less human by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't had a really satisfying stretch in years. He arched his back, bones and joints popping like bubble-wrap, and gave a contented sigh that rapidly became like a purr in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nose and jaw were pulled out into a muzzle, while the silver, fuzzy mustache and beard that adorned them became a mane of thick, scarlet fur which spread across his face and down his body. Not a second too soon either; his clothes gave way beneath his growing, feline body. As the wave of fur passed beneath his waist, a long, sinuous tail sprang out from the base of his spine; the very tip burst into flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of lion-like ears sprang from atop his head. His clouded, bleary eyes became clear and golden. Blinking in the midday sun, he looked around at Cosmo Canyon with fresh eyes. His gaze, however, quickly fell upon Cloud and Yuffie, and he hung his head in embarrassment. The flame-tipped tail drooped between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must think me a crazy, old man,\" Bugenhagen admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie goggled at the lithe lioness-like creature at her feet. \"N-not any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it makes you feel any better, I'm not really Nanaki's grandfather,\" he, or rather she, pointed out,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a relief.\" Yuffie gave it a little more thought. \"And kinda makes sense.\"</span></div></div>",

However, while Yuffie was making direct skin contact and Cloud was only touching it through a pouch resting on his pants, Cloud had had the materia on him longer, his soul more synchronized with it already, so it reacted to his thoughts first, and at the time, he was having a rather... \"wet\" dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe materia, unable to grasp a clear picture of his desire from his primal dreaming subconscious, decided to fill in the blanks and make an assumption on the part of its user what they wanted, beginning to work it's magic on Yuffie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell... did that materia just go off on it's own?\" Yuffie tried to whisper, holding her zapped hand. She slowly let go of her hand to see a shocking sight; her hand was even more feminine than she remembered, and now she sported long three-inch French manicured nailed painted in a gawdy hot pink glitter nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is...?\" suddenly her left hand was changing to match the right before her eyes. \"No no no...\" she quietly panicked. Atop her head, it felt like her hair was being tugged out her skull. Indeed, her pixie-cut hair was growing out, and in her periphery, she could see it growing and... lightening? \"Blond?\" Yuffie wondered as an invisible force pulled her lengthening hair into two pigtails, pigtails which were already past her shoulders and growing still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M... My legs...\" Yuffie grunted, feeling weak in the knees as she felt her legs lengthen as something forced her onto her tippy toes. Looking down, she saw that her shoes and socks had changed into white leather platform boots with five-inch heels \"<span class=\"chotpink\">Heels? Like, how am I supposed to do ninja stuff in these?!</span>\" Yuffie realized upon hearing that last statement out loud that didn't quite sound right. \"That's not what I meant to say. It sounded all... dopey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was about when she noticed her hotpants shimmer and begin changing as well, turning into a white leather micro-miniskirt that made Tifa's look modest, all as her ass firmed and swelled to giant proportions, meanwhile, her pussy bean to moisten up, and unknown to Yuffie at the moment was under her new miniskirt she was now going commando. \"<span class=\"chotpink\">Damn, like, whatever's going on, it's making me totally hot...</span> There it is again... No... Is my mind...? Am I... getting dumber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groans as her hips flare out, making her new miniskirt even more skintight on her, while her waist constricts to nearly inhuman tautness. \"<span class=\"chotpink\">More... More...</span> No...\" Yuffie struggles futilely against the magic flowing through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her green woolen top begins to fills with breast tissue, causing the ordinarily small-chested Yuffie to shoot through the alphabet. \"What? I no want to be big boob...\" Yuffie tries to decry, her intellect and willpower failing her. C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, she zipped upward, finally coming to a rest at NN, breasts that made Tifa look flat-chested by comparison. The top Yuffie wore surprisingly was not being changed too much, aside from the fact it shrunk to the point it purposely showed off most of her underboob now, and now a giant heart-shaped hole was in the chest, exposing maximum cleavage. \"<span class=\"chotpink\">Oh, like look at my giant titties!! I'm totally bigger than Tifa now!!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie's mind was slowing to a crawl as her libido began to shoot through the roof, all as her skin acquired a slight tan. Her lips plumped into a pursed duckface shape, coated in hot pink lipstick, as her pigtail finally stop growing down around her knees. Yuffie shakes her head to and fro. \"No... wa<span class=\"chotpink\">nt... more...</span>\" Slowly, her dark green eyes turn a bright blue, all intellect in them completely gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Tee hee!! Why was I just worked up? I'm like, a totally hawt bimbo!!</span>\" Yuffie exclaimed, jumping up and down, bobbing her massive mammaries, a wonder they slip out her top. The only traces that remained that this bimbo was ever the materia thief Yuffie Kisaragi was that the accouterments on her arms and her headband remained unchanged by the materia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the moistness of her loins, she then has, er, one of those headaches with pictures. \"Oh, I like totes know why I got so worked up now!! It's been like, forever since I cummed, and Yuffie needs some cock!! But everyone is asleep... Oh, like, what to do...\" Yuffie wondered what to do...</span></div></div>",

He was, in all reality, the group's leader, so if he said that she could do what she wanted, they would listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow...what was the best way to use Cloud to her advantage?</span></div></div>",

'My voice, it sounded like Yuffie's!'

However, the vibration and air puffs startle her, and she pulls it off quickly. Plugging her nose, she looked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Yuffie were capable of movement or sound, she'd be thrashing and screaming for her life. As it was, she simply lay in the bottom of the boot, surrounded by thick black leather and the worst thing she's ever smelled. She thought her feet were bad, but they were a drop in the ocean next to this. Suddenly the light started getting dim. She looked up the long black tunnel to the outside world (It was all she could do anyways, her eyes were frozen like the rest of her body, and wide open) and saw a monster approaching. She instinctively tried to grab her weapon, then remembered where she was, and realized what the 'monster' was. As Tifa's polluted reeking sock pressed into her body, she thought \"That's no monster, that's a final boss!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt herself helplessly vibrating against the foot, her nose and mouth working to cool the foot, even if it meant taking in this horrible odor. The foot just as quickly flew out of her just as quickly. Soon Tifa's face came into view looking down at her. \"What the...? Wait, what did she say?...she wished she could help me get a pair...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA triumphant look spread on Tifa's face, \"well, looks like the master thief finally got what's coming to her.

This may be the best thing that you could ever do for the party, so as far as I'm concerned, welcome to your new job.\" With that she slammed her foul sock covered foot back into Yuffie, and tied the laces tightly, sealing her in.

They both felt like they were going to go insane from being trapped in their new hellish bodies, but unfortunately Yuffie's wish had assumed Cloud was perfectly sane in his \"desire\" so they couldn't even escape that way. As the toes wiggled on their mouths, they heard the voice of, as far as the world was concerned, their owner say, \"I guess we'll have to try looking for Cloud tomorrow. I've looked everywhere\" Cloud's body started shaking extra hard as he tried to yell that she hadn't checked anywhere, but all it amounted to was more comfort for his wearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see Yuffie? She hasn't come back either,\" they heard Aerith say. They missed the beginings of Tifa's reply as she stomped in them towards the stairs to her and Aerith's room. Then she stopped and they could hear again, \"but she gave me this materia and said to not bother waiting for her. She'll try to catch up later. Which, you know, means she's probably causing another problem we'll have to clean up.\" It was Yuffie's turn to shake with rage this time. The only response she got was Tifa digging her toe nails into her lower lip, and then heading up to her room. She was so tired, she just flopped onto the bed and passed out fully clothed, boots and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, downstairs Aerith looked at the odd materia Tifa had thrown her. It was a type she'd never seen before, but it was just something to keep her hands busy while she thought. She got up and started up towards the room. They didn't have much money at the moment, so she was sharing a bed with Tifa. As she lay down on the tiny bed, cramped next to Tifa, her thoughts kept on Cloud's location. She thought to herself while still carressing the materia, \"I know he's nearby. I can feel it like I'm right on top of him. I just wish...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tUnfortunately for Cloud, that last wish was the one thing that would seal his fate. The materia was suddenly glowing, and even seemed to crack, in response to Aerith's wish, \"I know he's nearby, I can feel it, like I'm right on top of him, I just wish that were true.\" It wasn't Aerith who was on top of him, but actually Tifa, and shortly before that, Yuffie. Unfortunately for Cloud, he's about to be in a very stinky predicament. A rather ungodly smelling predicament. Tifa's feet began to glow as well, and then her boots flew off her feet. A disgustingly cheesy aroma immediately filled the room, much to Aerith's dismay. Aerith's feet then also began to glow, and then her boots flew off her feet as well. The stench in the room doubled and became very potent, like the unmistakable scent of a girl's stinky feet, very thick as well. Something regarding the materia was about to happen, and Yuffie, from within the confines of Tifa's incredibly smelly and damp boot, realized this and seized the opportunity. She focused heavily on the magic light that was surrounding the boots and made a wish, \"I wish to be free from here and be able to harness the power of that materia!\" Immediately, Yuffie was pulled from Tifa's boot in a flash of light that darted and zigzagged around the room eventually to come to a halt next to Aerith, and retake the form of Yuffie. \"Tifa you bitch! How dare you!!\" Yuffie screamed. When suddenly, her feet began to glow as well, and her boots flew off her feet. The stench in the small room became unbearable, even for the three girls from whom it was originating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCloud did not realize what was happening, and thus did not take advantage of the situation. In fact, he was the target of the spell that was about to enter him into his own personal hell. Cloud is in Tifa's boot, and thus under her, Aerith wished that Cloud would be under herself, and Yuffie had connected herself to that wish by asking to harness the materia. Cloud began to feel himself be pulled out of Tifa's boot. He emerged as a small ball of light that darted round the room, similar to Yuffie. But he would not be returning to human form . Cloud was relieved to have a break from that horrible stench and the ever increasing foot sweat that Tifa produced. The ball of light that is Cloud then split into SIX pieces. Cloud felt like there were six of him...it was a strange phenomenon, as if he were in six places at once. Then suddenly, the six balls of light darted straight into the six stinky sweaty soles that were currently glowing. Two soles from Tifa, two soles from Aerith, and two soles from Yuffie. Finally, all the light show subsided and everything returned to normal, except the materia now had a pretty big crack down the center. Both Tifa and Yuffie surmised pretty quickly what had just happened, while Aerith was utterly confused. Cloud on the other hand, was currently praying for death. He found himself smelling six extremely stinky soles at once. For Cloud, it was as if each one of their feet had become his senses. He smelled their entire sole, straight from heel to the tip of the toes, he even tasted everything, including the toe jam in between the toes. He could literally feel their feet, he felt as if he were a part of them, feeling them flex. Anything he saw had a hue of skin color over it, as if he could only see from inside their feet. Aerith had wished he was under her, and so the materia literally put him under her, and those currently connected to the materia. Tifa and Yuffie tried to pass it off as nothing, while reassuring Aerith that the materia was simply strange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYuffie whispered to Tifa, \"Hey, that was Cloud just now!\". Tifa whispered back, \"What?! I thought  another you was in my other boot!\". \"No you bitch, that was Cloud, I had him in my boot\" Yuffie replied. \"So what do we do now? Cloud is probably suffering so much right now...I haven't washed my feet or changed my boots since we set out for Sephiroth.\" Tifa said worriedly. Yuffie, in a rather confident tone, replied, \"Me neither, I bet my feet STINK!\" Tifa answered, \"I know for a fact mine just flat out REEK!, and I just got a whiff of Aerith's before...they smell just as bad as ours!\".  Yuffie thought for a moment and mentioned, \"Hey, let's not tell Aerith about this, you know she's got a thing for Cloud, and I don't know if this is reversible, let's just keep it between us for now until we find a way to change him back OK?\" Tifa affirmed, \"OK\". <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being on an adventure and everything, Tifa, Yuffie, and Aerith never took off their boots. They never washed their feet either. The sweat built up profusely and the smell never seemed to have a limit with how disgusting it could get. Cloud was forced to do NOTHING but SMELL their FEET and DRINK their FOOT SWEAT. He couldn't see anything except the sweaty insides of their boots, and he couldn't hear much from inside the boots...he wasn't sure how much longer he could hold on.<br>\r\n...1 Month later<br>\r\n\tUnfortunately for Cloud, it seemed he couldn't even lose his sanity. Something about the materia forced him to stay sane, it forced him to be practically invincible, like the Hero Materia. But suffering was something that the materia did not protect from. Everyday Cloud wished for this to end, somehow, someway. He did not want to spend an unforseen amount of time, day after day, smelling feet, eating toe jam, drinking foot sweat, trapped under ever encompassing foot flesh.  Tifa and Yuffie were trying to think up ways to return Cloud to normal. Meanwhile Aerith was searching for Cloud ever since, trying so hard to find him, not knowing he was right beneath her, just like she wished. Tifa and Yuffie figured that the materia works by wishes, so they should be able to wish Cloud out of there. They also remembered that big crack down the middle of the materia. Tifa explained, \"Look Yuffie, I think we only have one shot at this, the materia looked like it was about to break the last time we used it. We have to make sure we make the right wish, or else Cloud could be trapped under our feet forever.\" After a whole month since the incident, Yuffie kind of got used to having Cloud under her feet. She replied, \"Oooorr...we could use the last wish on something like infinite treasure you know? I'm kinda likin' the idea of Cloud under my feet.\" Tifa almost slapped her, \"Are you crazy!?..that's disgusting!\" Yuffie laughed back, \"C'mon Tifa, where's your sense of humor? He HAS to smell our feet...your right, it is disgusting, and he has to do it forever, thats what makes it so funny!\" Tifa actually giggled, but then returned to a stern face, \"No! We have to change him back, let's go talk to Aerith, she has the materia. We have to do this somehow with all three of us present, our boots off, and without Aerith knowing.\" *Sigh*, \"Fine...\" Yuffie replied. <br>\r\n\tThey met up with Aerith, in the same room where the incident originally happened. They convinced Aerith into a pedicure for all of them, and proceeded to take of their boots. An ungodly smell filled the room once again. Cloud could finally see and hear what was going on. Aerith seemed depressed. \"What wrong Aerith?\" Tifa inquired, already knowing the answer. \"It's Cloud, I wonder where he could be...It's as if he just...disappeared.\" Yuffie cut in, \"Oh, I bet he's somewhere nice and comfy. He's probably nice and hydrated too. He's even getting some sweet aroma therapy! He's having the time of his life right now! Bet you he never wants to leave. Not ever.\" Cloud overheard this and couldn't help but curse Yuffie. Tifa actually couldn't help but laugh at Cloud's predicament at this point, but not without telling Yuffie to cut it out. Aerith then replied, while caressing the materia, \"Well, if he's in a place like that, its got to be a much better place than this world. If he really is having the time of his life, than I wish he stays there forever.\" Yuffie and Tifa immediately gave each other wide-eyed looks. Tifa yelled, \"OH NO!\". But it was too late. <br>\r\n\tThe materia only understands what it is told. Because of Yuffie's first misunderstanding that Cloud actually LIKED her feet, the materia could only surmise that Cloud really was having the time of his life. Their feet all began glowing like the incident one month ago. Unknown to them, something sinister was happening to Cloud. Believing that Cloud was enjoying himself, the materia granted Aeriths wish, to keep Cloud there forever. Cloud suddenly felt funny, he felt as if he was now grounded where he was. He was overcome by somekind of anxiety that he would never escape his current predicament. The materia then shattered into pieces, effectively sealing Cloud in for life. <br>\r\n\tActually, very unfortunately for Cloud, Aerith actually said, \"forever\", so he began to feel something more. He felt like he was pulled deeper into the feet. He was drawn in until he found himself standing in a moderately lit room. He fell flat on his face into the apparently soggy floor. Some of the drenched floor got in his mouth and he immediately recognized he taste and scent. It was the combination of Aerith, Tifa, and Yuffie's feet. There were piles of Toe Jam 10-20 feet high in any given direction. The space seemed infinitely large. The smell felt like it was suffocating him, but there was nothing he could to do to offset it. His own body was saturated in the scent. Cloud cursed his fate, he tried to strangle himself, only to find he was unable. Suddenly, from all directions, he saw infinitely increasing pairs of feet that he clearly recognized as the feet of his previous captors. The feet came and rubbed him all over his body, forcing themselves into his mouth, all over his face, gripping his nose in between their stinky sweaty toes. The feet were so strong Cloud could do nothing to resist. He began to cry...why me? Cloud was pulled into a timeless dimension of Tifa, Yuffie, and Aerith's feet, where he would be forever subjected to Foot stink, foot sweat, and toe jam. An eternity of foot torture. <br>\r\n\tBack in reality, once again, both Tifa and Yuffie knew what happened. Aerith was once again so confused. Now that the materia was destroyed, there was no hope of saving Cloud. Tifa and Yuffie managed once again to explain their way out of the situation. As soon as they exited the room however, they burst into laughter. Cloud's predicament was no longer a serious tragedy to them, but something to laugh at. Tifa even banged her booted foot against the ground a couple times, exclaiming, \"Hey Cloud, hope you have enough foot sweat to last you forever, HAHAHAHA\", Yuffie followed up, \"Yeah, hope the smell treats you nice!\". What they didn't know, was that if they spoke directly to Cloud, he could hear them. So Cloud would occasionally hear their voices saying things like, \"Sniff this\" or \"Taste my feet Cloud!\". In Cloud's dimension, he could never get used to the scent, or the torture at all. it was constant, and eternal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote* -- This and the next chapter will be single path only, and the end result will be very much like the above chapter, so if you are not into that, steer clear. :) <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every single second without break, he experienced foot stink, foot sweat, toe jam, overall foot gunk, and just the constant sight of feet on his face and body at all times. He tried fighting it, but there were just too many feet, and they were too strong. Cloud lost track of time eventually, and tried to drift off into insanity, unsuccessfully. He is forced to remain conscious, and awake, as well as always receiving his foot torture. After a year, or what seemed like a century to Cloud, he somehow got the will to fight back again. He was fed up with the voices of Tifa and Yuffie telling him to, \"Inhale my stinky toes\", \"Eat my toe jam Cloud\", \"Drink up Cloud\", and \"Sniff in between my toes too Cloud!\", etc. He figured if it was a wish that put him here, it would be a wish to get him out. However he did not have wish granting materia. He merely had will power, and he figured it would be enough. He tried to override the will power of the materia which controlled this hellish universe with his own, somewhat unsuccessfully. He noticed he gained a bit more strength against the feet, but they still had the upper hand, relentlessly sliding sweaty soles and toes on his nose, and in his mouth. Sometimes the feet held his arms and legs and head down, and cupped toes over his nose to force him to smell for months at a time. Still Cloud forced his willpower into the Universe. Eventually, he gained enough strength, or maybe the feet lost enough strength, for him to break free. He ran, and ran, and ran, until he felt like his legs were going to bleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe found no escape in the seemingly infinite space that was strikingly similar to the inside of a boot. He finally made one last will power push, commanding the Universe to tear open an escape route. Suddenly, a bright flash of light opened up, a portal of sorts, and Cloud immediately dashed through it. He found himself in a giant expanse of lush green grass, a blue sky, and a nice breeze. He inhaled his first fresh breath of air since a time he can't even remember. He cried tears of joy, finally, being free from that hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCloud suddenly felt a presence behind him. He turned around and saw what could only be descrbied as a divine figure. It was a woman in divine clothing. It was...the Final Fantasy 7 Goddess Minerva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130524213135/finalfantasy/images/0/02/FF7CC_Minerva.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCloud asked, \"were you the one who helped me?\" Minerva responded blankly, \"No, that was a result of your own will power.\" Cloud exhaled, \"well, I'm finally free, finally!\". In a flash, Minerva was in front of cloud. She knocked him to the ground a placed on extraordinarily smelly, sweaty, and dirty foot in his face. \"You are not free. That wishing materia was a piece of my very soul. Its power is absolute. The fact that you escaped from its power is sacrilege, and you will pay the price for rejecting your fate.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He grew smaller, and smaller, and smaller, until her foot was pressing over his entire body. He couldn't see her anymore, just her sole. His body was then pulled into her sole and deposited back into a similar dimension, only this time, it seemed some kind of chains binded him to the ground. He fought with all his strength, but these were divine, unbreakable chains. He heard her voice. \"You will endure this forever. Not just the feet of your three friends, Tifa, Yuffie, and Aerith, but the feet of all from the dimensions under my control.\" Minerva proceeded to tell Cloud the following girls would be his torturers as well: (There from all of the other final fantasies.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFF1: Princess Sara <br>\r\nFF2: Hilda, Maria, Leila <br>\r\nFF3: Elia, Sara, Refia <br>\r\nFF4: Rosa, Rydia and the Magus Sisters <br>\r\nFF5: Faris, Krile, Magissa, Reina <br>\r\nFF6: Celes, Terra (Tina), Relm <br>\r\nFF7: Aerith, Tifa, Yuffie, Elena, Elmyra, Jesse, Marlene, Scarlet <br>\r\nFF7 DoC: Shalua, Rosso <br>\r\nFF8: Rinoa, Quistis, Selphie, Edea, Ellone, Raine <br>\r\nFF9: Garnet, Eiko, Freya, Beatrix, Queen Brahne, Ruby <br>\r\nFF10: Yuna, Lulu, Rikku, Yunalesca, Dona, Shelinda, Cindy, Mindy, Sandy <br>\r\nFF10-2: Paine, Leblanc, Lenne <br>\r\nFF11: Cornelia, Claidie <br>\r\nFF12: Ashe, Fran, Penelo <br>\r\nFF13: Lightning, Fang, Vanille, Serah<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these girls appeared before him, even Minerva herself, and took turns wiping their feet across his face, so that he could be acquainted with their foot scent.

To Cloud, it felt like a force was pressing down on him, flattening his spiky hair against his head and scrushing his spine.

Colour rushed into his hair at the same time as it retreated a little into his scalp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from that, the changes were relatively mild - he was fortunate that Yuffie was still young and he was rather epicene. His body remained slim, his features became only a little softer and more feminine. His left shoulder-pad grew down his arm, becoming a shield, while his right one dissapeared entirely. His woolen shirt rode up, exposing his rid-riff, while his trousers, socks, and shoes all bleached of colour to resemble Yuffie's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat mattered most to him was the change that underwent his Buster Sword.

For their part, however, Skotch and Kotch exchanged nervous glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, you see...\" Skotch started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is, um...\" added Kotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you weren't able to find one juicy female?\" asked Corneo, glaring at his henchmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry Don, really!\" Kotch exclaimed, \"We searched all of Sector 6 and Sector 5 today and couldn't come up with anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kotch is right, sir.\" added Skotch, \"They were all either too old, too young, or not up to your... standards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But we did find this.\" Kotch said, extending a hand to Corneo.  In that hand was a yellow piece of materia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Materia?!\" Corneo bellowed as he eyed it.  \"Now why would I need something like that?  You idiots no I have no use for that junk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But sir,\" Skotch said, \"At the very least you might be able to pawn it off on some of the townsfolk for some extra gil.  At an inflated price of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon grabbed the materia from Kotch's hand and eyed it once more, \"You're right.  I could just say it's rare and those sheep will eat it right up.\"  He then lifted his head back to his two underlings, \"You two, get out of here!  Start the search first thing in the morning.  Search every square inch of these dumps that's still standing and don't come back until you find something!\"  As he watched the two leave, he bellowed, \"AND I WANT DOUBLE THE LADIES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Corneo returned to looking at the materia.  He didn't have any use for it, he thought.  He wasn't a fighter, only a lover.  Unless this thing could bring him the women that he loved so much, it was useless to him.  Of course, Skotch and Kotch were probably right.  He had probably been through all of the choice cuts in the area.  There were still others he hadn't gotten, however, more higher profile girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirls like Elena of the Turks.  She tried to be serious and competent but in the end, Corneo mused, she was just some bimbo in a suit.  A suit that managed to make her look like a sexy businesswoman.  Oh yes, if she were here the things he would do to her.  And that's when he noticed the materia in his hand was glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was cut off, however.  His body was feeling weird... and it began to change.  He started growing a little taller, and his weight dropped considerably.  The small tuft of blond hair on his head changed into a full head of short blond hair, parted to the right side.  He grew breasts and... oh no, IT was gone!  And his close changed becoming a slick, blue suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of what to do, Corneo looked around for a mirror, he had to have one around here.  After all, how else could he admire a sexy beast like himself?  He finally managed to find one, stashed behind some cabinets and pulled it out.  What he saw shocked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" he said in a new, soft, feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at him was that \"bimbo\" herself.  The suit, the hair, that impressive body... it was unmistakable.  Somehow he had turned into Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, what the hell?!\" he asked,  \"I'm... I'm her.  Holy shit!  I'm her.  Why?!\"  And then he stopped and an uncharacteristic smile spread on Elena's face.  \"I'm HER.  I've got this broad's body all for myself.  I can do anything I want to it.\"  Corneo then raised his hands up and began fondling his new chest.  \"Goddamn, this girl's got an impressive set on her!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stopping, he looked back at himself.  The appearance was all Elena but on the inside, it was all Corneo.  He was still curious as to how he had turned into her and if he could turn back.  But looking at her, this broad was sexy enough in her suit and he was curious as to what she might look like in something a little less... formal and covering.</span></div></div>",

If he wanted to see this girl naked, all he had to do was get his men on it and grab her at a time where she was most vulnerable.  Easy enough to do, really.  And besides, he was a guy.  And not just any guy, he was Don Corneo!  He was the sexy Don of the Slums that could get any girl he wanted and knew just how to please them.  Playing with Elena's tits would've been great... if they didn't belong to him.  He wanted his old body back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when Corneo looked down to notice the materia, which he still held, glowing.  The same weird sensation rushed over his body and again he felt himself changing.  Looking into the mirror, he could see Elena's features washing away to reveal his own.  Within a few seconds, he was back to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Holy shit!\" he exclaimed looking back at his normal reflection.  \"But how...\" Corneo stopped himself and looked at the materia.  That was it!  It was this piece of materia!  It somehow had the ability to change his appearance.  But how did it work?  He'd never had to use Materia in his life.  Well wait, it changed him when he thought of that Turk girl and again when he thought of himself.  Maybe that's how it worked?  Corneo didn't want to risk losing his handsome features but this was definitely worth a shot.  Making sure he was holding the materia, Corneo began to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, his body grew in height, though mainly due to the high heels which began to replace his regular shoes.  His body became shapelier as his tuft of blond hair changed into a full head of blond hair, worn up and brushed to one side.  His clothes too changed into a very revealing red dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, yes, this is nice.\" Corneo said, his voice sounding a fair bit on the sultry side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet may have been a little older than what he was used to but she was still incredibly sexy.  He delighted in playing with her breasts and shaking them.  Not long after the dress was off and Corneo was staring at the naked body of the sexy head of Weapons Development.  It was definitely a sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis materia was amazing.  He never would've been able to see Scarlet like this he thought as he began massaging one of the large breasts.  Scarlet's body screamed sex and he was finding himself getting a little turned on.  Perhaps he should stay as her for a bit.  But then why?  With this materia, he could become anybody, see any girl that he wanted in the nude, GET any girl he wanted.  Maybe he should try experimenting with it some more as well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The death of Link was of the highest importance. After all, he was the one destined to deliver the final blow. Ganondorf summoned his most trusted liutenant, Aveil, to him and described the plan. After he became the Princess-in-peril it would only be a matter of time before the Link showed up. Immediatelyafter the resue, as the great Hero of Time lowered his guard, he would plunge a dagger into his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to to see the look on Link's face when he realized his beloved princess had betrayed him to his death, Ganondorf commanded the materia into action. Aveil watched in awe as the magic took effect on her King. The green palor washed from his skin, until it was pale and flawless as porcelain; similarly, his flame-red hair bleached and grew thick and long, cascading down over the throne, whilst a slim, pointed pair of Hyrulian ears poked their way up out of his new head of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis proud Gerudo nose withered away. Quickly, his face was becoming delicate, beautiful, but also haughty and cold as they changed to fit the image of the Princess he held in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body shrank, until his own throne seemed to tower and loom over him. For a man who had spent his entire life as the sole alpha male, the sudden loss of his powerful muscles was a shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack leather gauntlets became silky gloves. Battle-worn chestpiece became a flowing dress, adorned with gems and lace and, much to his disgust, the emblem of the Hyrule Royal Family. Ancient, metal codpiece became... well, he'd rather not say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tranformation finished, leaving the Princess of Hyrule sitting demurely in the Gerudo Throne, looking down at herself with a look of nausea. He rose to his new legs shakily and, for the first time for as long as he could remember, found himself looking up at someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" he barked, or tried to at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your magical prowess knows no limits, sire,\" Aveil said, bowing to hide a slight smile. \"However, if you intend to use yourself as a lure, perhaps...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a gesture in the air. Ganondorf's pretty face clouded with a scowl, but the materia glowed in his hand at her suggestion; his chest swelled outwards, whilst the gilded neckline of the dress plunged a few inches. He gave a soft, involuntary, feminine gasp as his waist cinched a few inches. His hips broadened to complete the more hourglass shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satisfied?\" he asked, briskly.</span></div></div>",
