But before getting up, he contemplated if he is in the mood to relieve some body urges (that adults have).<br>\r\nBut this time he felt none of that. He thought it was strange at first, but his dry throat made him get out of bed and into the bathroom to drink tap water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled groggily into the bathroom and poured some water into a glass cup. When he finished drinking he noticed his reflection in the cracked and dirty mirror that the bathroom lightbulb barely managed to illuminate. As his eyes adjusted and focused on the mirror, he pinched his cheek with his free hand. Realizing this is not a dream, he started to shake, and not just because it was so cold in the bathroom. The more he looked at his reflection, the more he was shaking until he reached a boiling point and screamed out loudly, breaking the glass cup he was holding in his hand and using the same hand to punch the mirror, shattering it to pieces and denting the wall it was hanging on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis panic attack lasted for a few minutes, but when he was out of energy, he went out of the bathroom and sit on the edge of the bed. Then he was in a daze, so many things going through his mind. He was now a she! Mad Dog was beside himself/herself. <br>\r\nHow did this happen? Why? <br>\r\nAfter a few moments there was a knock at the door. \"S**t\" Mad Dog cursed quietly. She woke up the other people in the motel. <br>\r\nWhat to do now?</span></div></div>",

As you sat there you started to get the common feeling of needing to use the washroom which made you turn your head towards the open door to your small rest room. Standing up you tried to run for the room for the feeling to urinate grew stronger fast, but due to the size of the shirt you was wearing you stepped on it and tripped yourself making you fall over and land flat on your belly and face. Tears sparkled in your eyes but you tried to suppress them the best you could. Unbuttoning the bottom of the shirt the best you could with your tiny fingers you started to crawl the rest of the way and struggled to get on the toilet.

Landing on your back and just laying there staring up at the desk as such a small fall was able to knock the wind out of you and you heard her running over. \"Are you okay? What your name and why you in Phil's room?\" She started asking as she stared down at you and you realized your skirt was up resting on your body and quickly pushed it down to cover the diaper bulge and sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pa... Pandora. Phil, is helping mommy and letting me stay here.\" You said trying to do your best at lying to the girl you knew your whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pandora huh.\" She said as she picked you up and sat you in her lap and gently hugged you. \"Really, now that is nice of Phil seeing how he has no sister's and his father is dead.\" She stated making you think that she is seeing through your lie like she always has. And like you always did when she caught you in one you lowered your head and tried to squirm and get away from her and avoid eye contact. She though kept her grip and just watched as you squirmed trying to get free before you started to cry. \"So Phil your experiment to reverse time on damaged cells failed? I heard of the explosion during the experiment.\" She said as you became still and just kept your head down as you wipe the tears from your face with your arms. You didn't want her to see you like this, not her. \"Shhh, it's okay. You know that I will not tell anyone. I mean we been friends for what are entire lives. Trust me.\" She said and smiled down at you and watched as you slowly lifted your head to stare at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rain.\" You whimpered as you turned around and buried your face in her shirt and she rocked you as if you was really a child. \"I am not a baby.\" You sniffled at what she was doing but at the same time was grateful for it but you never wanted to admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Pandora was it. Not potty trained I see.\" She jokingly patted your bottom making you pout as you stare at her with your red eyes from crying. \"You always was a cry baby.\" She teased and tickled you, you fought back the best you could and squirmed in her arms. \"I was worried for you missed class, and well with what happen. I thought you was in trouble, but I would never of thought that you be like this.\" She teased you and you only crossed your arms which made her think you looked even cuter trying to be serious. \"So how can big sis, Rain help her little baby sister?\" She teased making you pout and then point at your book. \"Your notes of the experiment huh.\" She sighed and pulled it over and held it open for the two of you to read. \"Maybe I should move in until your back to normal or have you stay with me in my room.\" She told you which did make your cheeks redden for the thought of sharing a room with her but you wished it wasn't with you being stuck like this.</span></div></div>",

Plus someone has to take care of you and your needs in such a small body.\" She stated as she stood up and picked you up. This was a shock to you as you felt your feet leave the ground and you was suspended by her hands on either side of your waist. Your back to her made it hard to look back at her. \"What am I saying, we are life time friends, and took baths as kids.\" She said playfully making you nod your head then look down at your small body and the clothes that you was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find it weird being a girl. Let alone how small my body has shrunk, I am not sure if the age of my body has been properly effected but going by the difficulty of my words despite knowing them I can assuming my cell's age might be matching the figure you hold.\" You state as you start to swing your legs lightly opposite to each other as if you was walking on air. \"My mind and memories are not effected but as time passes it is not known if they will be.\" You said and your voice was getting sadder for that thought was scaring you. \"If... If it does happen, don't let me forget who I am and our friendship.\" You said trying to fight back the tears again. \"Why do little girls cry so easily?\" You whine and kick your feet as you wipe your eyes on your sleeves. \"Promise me.\" You tell her as you felt her hold change as your back pressed against her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise that you will never forget and that you will be your old self again no matter how long it takes.\" She told you as she hugged you before sitting you in your chair and leaned down to kiss you on the forehead. \"Now does my baby sis need a change before I go and gather my things to move in and mother you?\" She asked in a cute way as though she was talking to a real baby girl. You pouted and looked away as you placed your hands over your lap holding the riffled lace end of your skirt in your hands. \"Aww, I take that as a cute no. Now be good until mommy gets back.\" She teased making you continue to look away with a light blush on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had left and closed the door behind he you couldn't help but sigh and pout. \"Why must she tease me like that?\" You whine and look around the room at the things that you had. There where posters of biological charts, and papers on nano-technology. Books on books in the book cases on the topics of physics, biology, robotics, chemistry, along with theories that he had written up to this point. There where a few small robots that he had built and programmed scattered about the room in different locations. Looking at your desk you stare at the computer and try to reach for the mouse while being sat. \"Oh, stupid small arms.\" You pout and shift into a kneeling position where you cold reach it better and started to go through your files.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After diligently reviewing your notes for a solution to get your body back to normal, you realize your two year old self needs to rest.  You lay down on the couch and when you wake up you are confused.  You look around for a few seconds and recognize that you are in Rain\u2019s apartment.  You stand up and notice you are now inside a crib and can\u2019t get out?  Even more surprising is that you look down and realize you are wearing a new pink dress.  Rain comes in the bedroom and smiles, \u201cWow?  You slept for nearly 3 hours!  I found you asleep on your couch and brought you back to my place.  Fortunately I have this crib because I baby-sit a lot.\u201d  Rain set down a baby monitor and giggled, \u201cI heard you fussing around and knew you were finally awake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c3 hours?\u201d  You reply, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I wasted the entire day?  Being in this body certainly wastes valuable time!  I could have been reviewing my notes and finding a way to get back to my normal body!\u201d  You look down at your new pink dress and ask Rain, \u201cWhat\u2019s with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRain picks you up out of the crib and says, \u201cWhen I found you asleep on your couch, you were wet.  You totally soaked your clothes.  Luckily, my niece Anna left a few things here and I was able to find you a new outfit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRain placed you on your back and pulled down your tights.  With a wink, she said, \u201cIt looks like somebody needs another diaper change!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch Rain change your diaper as you say, \u201cThanks for doing this.  I don\u2019t have the dexterity to change my own diaper in this body.\u201d  Once she finished changing your diaper, Rain pulled a pair of tights over your diaper.  You stood in front of the mirror and were surprised at your new outfit.  Your pink frilly dress was slightly above your knees and flared out really wide, \u201cIsnt this a bit fancy?  Did Anna leave anything else here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRain giggled, \u201cAnna loves to play dress up.  You are wearing her princess gown.  Lucky for you, she also left her shoes here too!\u201d  You watch as Rain puts on a pair of maryjanes on your feet.  Rain continues, \u201cIt was either that dress\u2026or this one!\u201d  Rain pulled out a much fancier flower girl dress to show you.  Rain winks, \u201cI almost put this one on you, but I didn\u2019t want you to get it dirty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start walking away, you feel your diaper crinkling with each step.  You tell Rain, \u201cWe need to get back to my apartment so I can look over my notes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the professor walked in the door and saw you.  With a  smirk, the professor says, \u201cCute dress!  I love the bow!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your cheeks turn red as you reply, \u201cIt\u2019s a long story.  What did you learn about the experiment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor picked you up and smiled, \u201cThe good news is that I talked to your other professors and managed to convince them that you were working on a special project for me.  You don\u2019t have to go to any other class in the mean time!  I also coordinated daycare with the university.  I pulled some strings to get you in while I am teaching classes.  I told them I was watching my niece.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaycare?\u201d  You say with crossed arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor looks at Rain with a disappointed look.  Rain replies, \u201cHe\u2026I mean SHE just woke up.  I didn\u2019t have time to tell her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still aren\u2019t used to being called, \u2018she\u2019 as you say, \u201cDidn\u2019t tell me what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor explains, \u201cEven though you have your normal college mind, you are currently in the body of a 2 year old.  We cant leave you alone in your apartment anymore.  You will have to spend the day at daycare until I can sneak you into the lab after my 3 o\u2019clock class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes get wide as you complain, \u201cDaycare?  You can\u2019t be serious?  I need to work during the day to figure out how to change back to normal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRain interrupts, \u201cYou cant even change your own diaper.  You need some supervision until we fix this mess.  You will have plenty of time in the evenings to go over your notes and figure out a solution.  But during the day when I am in class and the professor is teaching, you need to be somewhere safe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor nodded her head, \u201cYou should be thankful I was able to pull some strings.  There is a long list to be accepted into the university daycare.  You are going to have to use fragmented sentences and loosen your vocabulary while you are there.  We cant risk anybody finding out who you really are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this!  This is going to extend my research considerably!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor patted your back, \u201cI\u2019m sorry sweetie, but until we figure this out, you are going to have to play the roll of the body you are in.  It is the only way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRain handed you a glass of water, \u201cHere.  This will make you feel better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the water and roll your eyes, \u201cA sippy cup?  Seriously?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRain giggles, \u201cI don\u2019t want to clean up after your spills all night.  You are going to have to get used to little kid stuff for the time being!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a drink and then realize they are right.  Until you figure out a fix to your body, you are stuck like this.  You then say, \u201cFine, but can we at least get me some pants?  These dresses are killing me!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRain and the professor laugh.  Rain then explains, \u201cIt is much easier to change your diaper with a dress on.  If you don\u2019t mind, it would be easier for us all if you just wore dresses?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she was right, you groan, \u201cOk, but once I\u2019m back to normal, I better not hear anything about this.  This is embarrassing enough!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor and Rain giggle again as you start looking over your notes.  </span></div></div>",

Was daycare as bad as you thought?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her with a glare, \u201cOh no!  It was great!  I got to spend the day singing nursery rhymes.  I even got to play with dolls for a few hours!  It was SUPER fun!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor giggled, \u201cWow!  Somebody is a bit sarcastic today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point down to your dress and say, \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you made me wear this today?  This dress barely hangs half way to my knees!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor explained, \u201cThat\u2019s why you have on tights.  Girls your age don\u2019t have any idea how to hide their dignity.  You should relax.  That dress looks cute on you.  All the rest of the girls were wearing similar outfits.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crack a smile and reply, \u201cYou are right.  I kept seeing other girls lifting their dresses up over their heads and had no idea what they were doing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s what girls your age do.  It\u2019s not until age 5 or 6 where girls realize that\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d  The professor then joked, \u201cRelax\u2026You still have a few years left of getting away with that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the professor and glare, \u201cHa ha!  Very funny!  Let\u2019s just get to the lab so I can finally get some research done and figure out how to change back to normal!  I\u2019m not spending any more time in this body than I have to!  Wearing diapers is getting starting to get old fast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor nodded, \u201cThat reminds me.  You only have  few left.  We need to stop on the way home to get you some more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you enter the lab, you are relieved you will finally get a chance to access the computer system.  As you try to enter the lab, the night security guard notices you and says, \u201cExcuse me professor\u2026But I\u2019m sure you are familiar with the age restriction allowed in this area.  Minors under the age of 18 are not allowed inside.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the professor were both familiar with the campus rule.  However, you both overlooked the detail when planning to visit the lab.  The professor tries to convince the security guard, \u201cWould it be ok to stretch the rules this one time?  I have some crucial research I need to do tonight for a few hours.\u201c  The professor winks at you and continues, \u201cShe is a very well behaved little girl.  I promise she wont be any trouble inside the lab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe security guard didn\u2019t budge and replied, \u201cSorry professor, but unless she leaves the premises, I will have to file a report.  You don\u2019t want a report on your record do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a fellow student of yours named Abby approaches.  She is always staying late in the lab trying to get extra credit.  Abby witnessed the entire conversation and interrupts, \u201cHi Professor!  Who is this little cutie?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Professor quickly replies, \u201cUh..She is my niece, Pandora.  I\u2019m watching her for the next few weeks. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby smiled at you and says, \u201cI love your dress Pandora!\u201c  You give her a fake smile back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the \u2018brown noser\u2019 Abby is, she tells the professor, \u201cI heard you mention you have some very important research to finish tonight.  I will take Pandora back to my dorm room and watch her while you work.\u201c Abby bends down to your level and smiles, \u201cWe are going to have so much fun! I have some nail polish that will go perfect with your outfit!  And if the professor says it\u2019s ok, I have some lipstick that I know you would love to wear!\u201d  Abby then pats your head and says, \u201cYour straight hair is really cute, but I\u2019m sure it even looks better with curls!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are smart enough to know a girl your age would love to play dress up.  The last thing you want to do is  go with the brown noser Abby and get some sort of makeover.  However, you know the security guard will not let you in.  He even threatened reporting the professor for trying to sneak you inside.  Not wanting to risk the professor\u2019s lab access, you swallow your pride and give a fake smile back to Abby and try to look excited.  Abby takes your hand and tells the professor, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, us girls will have some fun while you finish your research!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the professor are both relieved Abby somehow managed to handle the awkward situation.  You are at least glad one of you will be able to get some research done tonight.  Before you know it, Abby picks you up and you start walking to her dorm room.  You look back at the professor and see her holding back a grin at your predicament.  </span></div></div>",

I think I will go to bed.\" He went to bed and crashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, he woke up to a woman's screams. His eyes opened, and he went to jump out of bed to see what was wrong. The blankets felt very heavy for some reason, and more than that, when he went to stand up, he fell to the floor! How did the bed get so high? When he went to get up, he had to brush long, brown hair out of his eyes. This was strange. He has had short his entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up and the room was very strange. Not only was all of the furniture huge, but it was not his bedroom at all. It was like a little girls room, only the dolls and stuffed animals were as huge as the furniture, except for a table and some chairs. As he got up, he felt odd. He looked down at himself and got an even bigger shock, the room was not big, he was small, like a child! Worse, he was dressed in little girls pajamas, and now he could tell that he was also wearing a diaper! What was going on? He felt very scared. Only now did he also notice that some if his discomfort was from an obvious mess he had in his diaper. He was scared, and suddenly he could not stop himself from peeing also. The way it felt coming out, he was sure the he was not only dressed like a little girl, he really was a little girl! He couldn't control himself and he started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the tears, Jeff saw a young woman appear in the doorway of his room. She was pretty, with long blonde hair and blue eyes, but looked very frazzled and confused, but something in his head told him who this woman was, and he needed comforting so badly he called to her, \"Mommy!\" He instinctively held up his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitated a long time, so he tried again, \"Mommy! Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman seemed to make a decision. She came over and picked Jeff up. Jeff found himself comforted as she said, \"Shhhhhh. It's okay sweetie. Mommy is here.\" She sniffed, \"Oh, and just great. What a welcome I get.\" She seemed to be distracted, \"Well, here goes nothing.\" She lifted Jeff onto a changing table and proceeded to undress and change him. She left him on the table, which seemed to be super high, and went over to a dresser and picked something out. She said, \"Well, we might as well have you looking pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff was dismayed that it was a lavender dress with unicorns on it, but he did not seem to have a choice, and found himself somewhat comforted by the feeling of the dress. Then she sat him up and brushed his hair. When she was done, she sat him on the floor. \"Now, why don't you play like a good girl for mommy while I go figure out if we have some food around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff watched her go. What a strange mommy! He sat down on one of the little chairs wondering how he got here, into this body, with a mommy he had never seen before? What next?</span></div></div>",

He doesn't need the money, he does it just for fun. He was wise with his money his whole life. In fact he always planned ahead, played it safe, and was always so careful. The little house near the beach he bought years ago when the prices were right. When he retired he had enough savings to last him and his wife for the rest of their lives. As it turned out that was only two months after retirement for his wife. He still thinks back to that moment so many years ago. He had hoped he would soon follow her, but it wasn't the case. He has been blessed our cursed with good health. Another product of his careful choices over the years. Their kids have lives of their own and he's lucky to get a card at Christmas now. Milton sighs and looks around. He feels out of place and without purpose. The beeping of the metal detector distracts him from feeling sorry for himself. He sets the detector down and pulls out a small garden spade. He doesn't have to dig very far before the spade strikes metal. \"Not jewelry\", Milton thinks to himself. He digs the object out and looks at it. It appears old, very old. It looks like one of those magic lamps from those Aladdin stories. With a little polish he figures someone will buy it. Milton sits back and begins to rub the sand off of it. Some young college age kids then run out onto the beach. Milton does not even notice the smoke coming out of the lamp. Milton reminisces as he watches the young people. For a second he imagines himself as one of them again, his whole life in front of them. He would do things different. He would have more fun, take more chances, and live more in the present than always planning for a future that may never come. He mentally shuts those thoughts down. \"Idiot, you're an old man, past your usefulness. Just die and be done with it. There's no going back \", he says to himself. Just then a voice beside him says, \"But what if there were a way to go back, Milton?\" Milton turns with a start to see a strangely dressed man with eyes black as coal. \"What\", Milton says? The man smiles and says, \"What if there were a way to be young again, do it all over again? Would you wish for something like that?\" The puts an emphasis on the word wish and that sets something off in Milton's mind. Milton looks down at the lamp and then back at the man's dress. He's dressed like a genie. Milton looks around quickly scanning for a camera. \"Is this some kind of joke\", Milton states! The man laughs and replies with, \"No, not at all, Milton. I'm what I appear to be. So, I ask again, do you wish to be young again, to live life to the fullest this time around.\" Milton ponders the question for a minute. There is no doubt in his mind he's being set up. he's seen the tv shows they have nowadays. He figures what the hell, at least he'll get on TV. \"Sure, I wish I was young and attractive like that\", Milton says pointing his finger at the college age kids playing on the beach. The genie follows Milton's finger to where it's pointing to see it has landed on the rather busty young woman that's in danger of coming out of her top. Gen take things very literal and figures Milton wishes to become a busty young woman. The genie has come across this often and has been confused why men always want to be women and women want to be men. He's come just to accept it. With a snap of his fingers Milton, the old man vanishes.  </span></div></div>",

This does not go unnoticed by Milton. She looks down to see her abundant cleavage that is bulging out the top of a almost to small bikini top. \"What the hell\", Milton exclaims! She then covers her mouth with her hands shocked by the sound of her own voice. Her eyes then dart to the genie. The genie has a rather shocked look on his face and then shimmers out of sight. Milton shakes and rubs the lamp trying to bring the genie back. After a few minutes of this her eyes turn to the beach. Milton suddenly feels very exposed, naked. She's not sure what her face looks like, but if her body is any indication she's hot. \"I need to get home\", is the only thought that darts through her mind, not daring to say anything out loud. If she hears that sexy voice come out of her again she's sure she'll lose it. She grabs the lamp and her metal detector and races down the beach. She slows her pace as she quickly discovers busty girls wearing bikinis should not run. The only thing worse than being nearly naked on a beach quickly filling up is being all the way naked. Milton is trying hard to keep her panic at bay. </span></div></div>",

She was happily married with two children, her son, Bruce, 3-years-old and her daughter, Serena, 5-years old. Her husband, Marcus was often on business, but they still made the relationship work.

The only reason they hired her was because her family was incredibly wealthy, not to mention that she often wore clothes that particularly accentuated her behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Harley drowned her sorrows at a local bar and ran up the largest tab she ever had.

Your boyfriend left yesterday after your dispute. So you're totally alone for the next few weeks. You take a shower, eat something despite you're not really hungry and are looking for something to dress for tonight's game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide for a pair of your beloved sneakers because you're not in the mood for high heels. It's just a hockey game. Then you decide for tight jeans and a red top. It's too cold in the stadium for a belly top. Therefore you grab a normal tight one and a coat. When you're looking in the mirror, your reflection is one of a sexy young woman. Tonight you're not a teacher, just a woman. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a bright Saturday afternoon, and Melanie Kelos felt like doing some exploring. The rambunctious 12-year-old was unlike most children her age. Melanie had very few friends, and on the weekends, she didn't go to the movies or hang out at other people's houses. Melanie's main hobby was rocks. She loved rocks. Collecting them, studying them, and scavenging for them. Melanie knew she was going to be a geologist one day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEquipped with her backpack and magnifying glass, Melanie made another trek into the woods near her house. The time spent away from her house did Melanie a lot of good. Melanie had a loving mother and father, but she's always felt distant from them. For reasons she could never explain, Melanie always felt unease with herself, as if some part of her was just...off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie was running through the forest, her long, blonde ponytail bouncing up and down. She had a goal of finding at least one new rock today, but Melanie was okay with appreciating the scenery around her. As she looked up at the giant fir tree next to her, Melanie noticed a shining blue object on one of the lower branches. She didn't know what it was, but she sure was going to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing every bit of her 4\"9, 92-pound frame, Melanie managed to climb ten feet up the tree, until she found the branch with the object. Trying to preserve her balance, Melanie tried to stretch her arm as out as far as possible to reach it. With a slight lean to the left, Melanie was able to grasp the object and carefully make her way back down the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a beauty\" Melanie exclaimed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello my child\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO SAID THAT!\" Melanie blurted out. She looked around nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry young one, I am emanating from the jewel you found. My consciousness resides in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what? You're INSIDE the jewel?\" Melanie asked. She was very confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no...I am a spirit of enchantment. I have no corporeal form, I exist for only one purpose....to help out those in need, and I sense you're in need child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel a deep, deep sadness within you....I don't what I can do....wait...wait...yes..I see. Child, I am going to grant you a gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gift?!!??\" Melanie perked up. \"Can I pick what it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...it is granting your subconscious desires...it will change your life as you know it forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie paused. She wasn't so sure about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems pretty vague.\" Melanie stated. \"Can you tell me what it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...the magic is rendered null and void if I state the purpose of the gift before you receive it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie took all of that in. Only 12, she still had a lifetime of possibilities ahead of her. Yet...would her life be truly enjoyable if she passed on this opportunity? Not many people have the ability to have their deepest inner desires to be fulfilled, and Melanie felt like she couldn't pass that up, even without knowing what the gift was. Of course, part of her was afraid that the gift would make her even less happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good 10 minute of thinking, Melanie came to a decision: she would accept the jewel's gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want it, whatever it is.\" Melanie said out loud for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad my young one....now in order to receive the gift, you must grasp me firmly in your hand and recite the following chant: Tethers of time and physics, break the chains and grant me that which I deserve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie picked the jewel out of her jean pocket and gripped it as hard as she could. \"Tethers of time and physics........break the chains....and grant me....\" Melanie stopped. For a moment, she felt frightened and unsure. However, she managed to convince herself that it was the right move. She deserved genuine happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....that which I deserve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the words left her lips, Melanie felt changes. Green pixels of energy started to come towards her and encircle her body. They started with her boots, worked up through her jeans, and then through her sweater. Soon, Melanie was completely covered in the energy. Suddenly, her body started rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?!!?\" Melanie shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry child...just relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute , the rumbling stopped. And then, the changes came. Her tiny hands started to enlargen greatly, as did her feet. Melanie  felt her skeleton growing and stretching; she was getting taller. She started to feel heavier as a significant amount of body mass was added to her frame. Her tiny breasts disappeared. Her legs and arms widened and lengthened. Soon, the body mass tightened, into what Melanie believed were muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is weird.\" Melanie exclaimed, her voice getting progressively deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes then went to her privates, reshaping into male equipment. Finally, her face was affected. Melanie felt her skull and the body mass on it rearranging.  Her nose changed shape and her lips got bigger.  An Adam's apple developed in her throat. The last change came as hair developed all over her new body. Oddly enough, the hair on her head did not change. Her clothes grew in size to accommodate her new frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energy on Melanie dissipated. Disoriented and not very aware of her surroundings, she heard the voice speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you like, you can go look in the stream to see the fruits of your gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie got up gingerly and walked to wards the stream. She felt off, but couldn't put why. As she reached the stream, Melanie bent down and looked at her reflection. She gasped. Starting back at her was not a 12-year-old girl, but rather a large 30-year-old male version of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started examining herself. Melanie looked quite handsome. The transformation sent the former child to a massive  6\"3, 196 pounds. Melanie started touching her body. She felt all the new muscles on her body. She felt...strong. Despite the dramatic physical change, Melanie felt unusually comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....why this?\" Melanie covered her mouth, startled by how much deeper her new voice was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chil...sir, I am able to see a person's soul for what it really is. I could see that you felt burdened by what you were, or rather what you were forced into. You may have been presented to the world as a female child, but you desperately wanted to be a boy, a man. You learned for the freedom to express yourself as you truly are and you wanted to be able to take control of your life and chase your dreams, only as an adult could. You were just never able to actualize these yearnings into cognitive thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie took all of this in. At first, she totally rejected it. What would this thing know about me, she/he thought. But then she thought about it more. Ever since she could form thoughts, happiness had always been brief for Melanie. All the nights spent up crying, failing to understand why. The inability to connect with or express herself to other people. The constant, negative personal thoughts about her appearance. It all made sense now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in her entire life, Melanie was in her right body, able to show the world who she/he truly is. As Melanie gathered her thoughts,  she came to a realization: she was genuinely happy. So happy, she burst into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you....thank you, so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie got up and started walking. As a new person, she had to take care of some things.</span></div></div>",

Looking down, Owen saw two large, fleshy spheres blocking his view, and next to them he saw his head. On the other side of things, looking up, Brianna saw her face looking back at her. \u201cWe\u2019ve switched bodies!\u201d Brianna said, in her new body. Despite the swap, they still had their own voices. \u201cIndeed! And that will be my final trick for tonight. We hope you enjoyed!\u201d Harold said. There was a round of applause from the audience, as Harold took a bow, then took Owen and Brianna backstage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow? What?\u201d was all Brianna could say. \u201cThis is cool!\u201d Owen let out. As the audience was leaving, Harold sat them down at a table. \u201cNow, listen. The rest of the tricks in this magic show were fake, but this one was a test. See, that box actually has the power to switch bodies. It was made by a friend I know who studies real magic.\u201d explained Harold. \u201cBut how do we switch back?!\u201d Brianna asked. \u201cWell, you have to wait a week to get it to change you two back, but when the time is up you can use it again. You can have it. You don\u2019t have to bring it back, we have about four more of them.\u201d \u201cBut there\u2019s not room in the car for it. How do we take it to our house?\u201d Owen piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, just sprinkle some of this in the car, and it\u2019ll work it\u2019s magic.\u201d Harold gave Brianna a bag of what looked to be glitter. \u201cHold on, how do we even bring it to the car? It\u2019s too heavy!\u201d Brianna asked. \u201cWell, that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. Try picking it up.\u201d \u201cOkay, if you say so\u2026\u201d Brianna went over to it, and lifted it with full force. Surprisingly, it was light as a feather, so it went flying into the air. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna break!\u201d Owen shouted. Owen and Brianna closed their eyes, expecting a crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, there was only the faintest noise as it fell to the floor, as they opened their eyes, as it was still in one piece. \u201cSee? Well, now I need to go, so if you need any help, call this number.\u201d Harold gave them a card with a phone number in it. \u201cWell, bye!\u201d Harold seemed to have disappeared as they looked back up to see nobody. \u201cGuess we should just go home, then.\u201d Brianna said. \u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d responded Owen as they walked back to the car with the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe said to sprinkle some of this in there, so\u2026\u201d Brianna opened the door and bag, as the glitter flew into the car, as the inside became a glowing yellow. The door closed itself, it seemed to have no changes through the windows. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d said Owen. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Guess we should look.\u201d responded Brianna. Opening the door, the inside was completely different. It was huge, and from the inside it looked like the biggest RV ever, but from the outside, the windows cast an illusion to make it seem normal. \u201cWoah\u2026\u201d Owen said, walking inside the mansion of a car, as the windows made him look like himself and not his mother, who followed him in his body. They put the box down on the floor. \u201cThis is AWESOME!\u201d Owen shouted. \u201cYes, yes I am.\u201d a voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho was that!?\u201d Brianna said, looking around. \u201cWell, I\u2019m your new car. I take it you want to go back home today?\u201d it asked. \u201cUm, yes?\u201d Owen responded, while Brianna was focused on how she was now her own son, and her car was sentient and deficient of reality! \u201cOkay, then. Would you like to drive, or should I?\u201d the car asked. \u201cUm, I guess you should drive. I\u2019m going to look around. Owen, do you want to look around?\u201d Brianna asked. \u201cOf course I do! This is the best car EVER!\u201d Owen shouted again. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re enjoying.\u201d the car said. \u201cI have rooms for you and your family. Take a look upstairs!\u201d it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing upstairs, Brianna and Owen looked into their own rooms. \u201cI\u2019ve made the rooms fit your current bodies to help you get used to them. It\u2019s going to be a long drive, so I suggest you look inside. They have their own AIs, as well.\u201d \u201cOkay, that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d Owen said, entering his labeled room as Brianna entered hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you want to focus on?</span></div></div>",

As he took his mom\u2019s flats off to feel the fluffy carpet, he saw a large comfy bed, a TV, a nightstand with a lamp on top, and a large vanity. To his right was a door labeled \u201cCLOSET\u201d, a door labeled \u201cBATHROOM\u201d, and a door labeled \u201cDREAM HUSBAND\u2019S ROOM\u201d [his mom was a single mom]. \u201cEw!\u201d Owen said, looking at the last door. Owen just went into the bathroom, as he needed to take a dump for the whole magic show but there wasn\u2019t a toilet, and apparently with the body swap his need to go stayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the almost blindingly white bathroom, he saw a mirror, a window, a white cupboard full of women\u2019s toiletries and a bath, but no toilet or toilet paper. \u201cWhere is the toilet?\u201d he asked. \u201cCode word \u2018toilet\u2019 recognised.\u201d he heard a voice of a man that his mother would find sexy. \u201cSo, do I get to go to the toilet now? I\u2019ve been wanting to poop for hours!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, well, Brianna, you sound just like Owen!\u201d the voice said. \u201cI AM owen!\u201d he shouted. \u201cNow, now, Brianna. Let me relieve you.\u201d the voice responded, as two tubes and some robotic arms came out of the ceiling, as the door locked itself. \u201cWoah!\u201d he said, as the arms took off his mother\u2019s dress, leaving him just dressed in his mother\u2019s underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have some sexy underwear on today, Brianna.\u201d the voice said. \u201cUm\u2026 thanks?\u201d Owen said confusedly, as the arms began to unhook the bra, as Owen was still confused. As the arms took his mom\u2019s panties off leaving him naked, an arm gave his new shapely ass a little smack. \u201cWhat was that for!?\u201d Owen asked. \u201cFor having such a wonderful, round ass, my darling.\u201d the voice said. \u201cThat\u2019s a swear word!\u201d The AI was confused. \u201cBriana, are you alright? You seem a bit angry.\u201d the voice asked. \u201cBriana\u2019s my mom! I\u2019m OWEN! We swapped bodies at the magic show!\u201d Owen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so sill-\u201d \u201cActually, they did.\u201d said the voice of the car. \u201cOh, um, okay, then.\u201d the sexy male voice responded. \u201cUm, oh\u2026 Let\u2019s just try and get this over with, then. This is a bit awkward\u2026\u201d the voice said, in a rush as a tube went into his mom\u2019s, now his, crack, and began to suck as the poop came out. \u201cThis feels weird\u2026\u201d Owen said. \u201cYeah, it is. Especially since you\u2019re an 8 year old boy in the body of a sexy, curvy 38 year old woman. Your new vagina should feel especially awkward.\u201d the voice said. \u201cVagina? What?\u201d Owen said. \u201cThe little slit in place of your penis down there.\u201d Owen looked down and parted his mom\u2019s breasts, and saw it. \u201cOh, yeah. I didn\u2019t notice that.\u201d Owen remarked as the tube receded and a hand with another tube, this time with a butt-shaped end was placed onto his mother\u2019s shapely bottom and started sucking the \u201cleftovers\u201d out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re done with the toilet now, Bria-I mean, Owen. Do you want to get dressed or see my body in the dream husband room?\u201d the voice asked. \u201cI\u2019m getting dressed. It feels weird being naked in a lady body.\u201d Owen responded. \u201cOkay, then.\u201d The door unlocked as Owen decided to get some clothes on and walked into the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, there was what seemed to be miles upon miles of clothes. \u201cHow do I choose any of these?\u201d Owen asked, looking around. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just ask some questions. Do you want to wear a bra, or not?\u201d it asked.</span></div></div>",

Johnny began to panic as he rushed to the door and banged on it, The Solid Thumping of his fist on metal echoing throughout the chamber. \"help me!\" Johnny cried out only moments before he felt his stomache begin to churn. The boy fell to his knees as pain began to fill his body spreading from his stomache to the rest of his body, like vines slowly entagling him. He Noticed that  his clothes her slowly starting to shrink on him. The pain continued growing even worse. Johnny just lying on the ground every now and then jolting from the pain, not even realizing the changes that his body was going through. He wondered briefly if he was going to die and why his aunt Betty had tried to kill him. This thought only lasted for a moment though because he realized that the pain had stopped. He was still extremely sore from whatever had happened to him, but no new pains were coming at him. The door clicked as a lock turned and the door opened. Johnny looked up to see his Aunt walking into the room, he heard her laugh although it wasn't her usal sweet laugh. It was something more, something that sounded crazed but with a mixture of pride as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked!\" she exclaimed as she looked down at the woman lying on the floor of the chamber, Her experiment had worked, What had once been a small ten year old boy was now a full grown woman, Betty could see that the clothes that Johnny had been wearing were now tightly fitted against what had previously been the boy's body. The shirt worked in a way to bind the breasts down, If she hadn't been looking for it she may not have even noticed, Johnny's hair had grown significantly, as much as one would expect if someone had not cut their hair for twenty years. It was hard to tell since the woman was lying down but Betty thought that it might even go down to the floor if Johnny had been standing. \"Get up\" she commanded to the figure. It would be easier to get an idea of how everything turned out if Johnny was standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny lifted herself up awkwardly, She was still recovering from the pain, but that wasn't the only thing that was weird, her arms were different and her legs too, Johnny couldn't quite place why they were different, but he had noticed that everything felt off. As she began to stand, Johnny noticed that everything seemed smaller to her. She looked over at her aunt and opened her mouth to speak, only to notice that she was having troubles breathing, the smaller clothes were pressing on her chest. She tried one more time \"Where's my mom?\" An exhausted feminine voice squaked out. Johnny wasn't sure why her voice sounded that much higher than it had previously, but she had just assumed it was from the tiny clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she can't see you like this now?\" Aunt Betty grinned as she took a step forward \"Can she?\" Betty looked over this specimen of a woman, Johnny was everything that she had hoped for. \"you'll have to come to the back with me so I can fix you up.\" You're probably hungry too. That must have taken quite a toll on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny realized only now that she was hungry and she did feel quite exhausted, maybe her aunt could help him out, but at the same time she wondered if her intentions were as pure as they seemed. after all her Aunt had just locked her in that chamber.</span></div></div>",

Johnny is obviously alone with her aunt, who has locked the shop to test her new invention on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's mom found a parking slot and enters the shop when Johnny reaches the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Johnny, you're looking nice as a women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny stopps running immediately. What's his mother telling him? He looks nice as a women? She knew what his aunt did with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Johnny, you don't know how it is to be a mother with two kids. I love your older brother Nate and you but it's really stressfull to be a mom. Therefore your aunt told me about her new invention and I decided to try it on you first. It would be exciting to transform your 16 years old brother but first I like to test it on you. So now you're the mom and if your aunts invention will be successful, I'll be your ten years old son in a few moments. And then I'll give you my female clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny is very shocked but he's not able to react because his mom disappeared to search his aunt.</span></div></div>",

But suddenly, some drunk driver careened off the road and hit her car, creating a horrendous accident.  She died the moment of impact.  After the accident, the family had been devastated by the news.  Even after the funeral, his dad was still distraught and barely focuses on his job.  Indeed, it takes time to heal those wounds, but Alicia was everything in the world for him and they knew each other since they were kids.  David knew that his mother went to Heaven and become an angel, but a part of him wanted his mom to return, so that his dad will be happy again.  He wanted to do something for his father, something to make him feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was looking out at the window in his room, David noticed a shooting star in the distance.  He knew in stories that when you wish upon a shooting star, that your wish would come true.  Looking up at the star, he closed his eyes and chanted those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStar light, star bright, first star I\u2019ve seen tonight.  I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish I wish tonight.  I wish that my dad would be happy again.  Ever since he lost mommy in that accident, I don\u2019t want him to be upset.  I would like to help him out the best I could and will do anything to make him feel better about himself.

She silently memorized every prayer she knew that she could find the witch who cursed her friends and plead for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the Spanish language \u201cHe Vinido\u201d started to wind down, which Erica recognized from an episode of Breaking Bad, the song \u201cMrs. Robinson\u201d started to play over the speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d whimpered Erica to herself in an audible whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d asked Don with a playful smile. \u201cDon't like Simon &amp; Garfunkel? I do, but I've got an old soul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I do. It's...nothing\u201d said Erica, her voice low as a mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon looked into Erica's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you might have an old soul, but I don't. It's kind of complicated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you don't have an old soul, you're a cougar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm a what!?\u201d asked Erica, almost offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. I mean, most women your age are settled down and married, waiting to grow old with their lovers, watching wistfully from the sidelines while the next generation grow ups and take over the world...but not you. You're a free spirit, Erica, and you and your girlfriends probably like younger guys such as myself because it helps keep you feel young. Am I right or am I wrong? Do I have you all figured out, lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica was about to answer Don, but out of the corner of her eye was the witch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she was, fifty feet away. She was at a table all alone by herself, eating curly fries and drinking a beer, watching with intent amazement that her magical concoction was going off without a hitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sorry buddy, but I've got to go\u201d said Erica, letting go of Don.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran across the dance floor, narrowly avoiding crashing into a few other couples making their way across the bar <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease!\u201d blubbered Erica as she approached the witch, the tears falling down her face, her voice shaky. \u201cI don't want to be a little old lady. I don't to be 103 and die! Please, have mercy on me and Dan and Donald. Change us back. I'm sorry! We're just stupid kids, and we didn't know what we were doing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica even fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErica, what's wrong?\u201d asked Don. \u201cAre you having a panic attack?\u201d asked the younger man. The crowd of bar patrons was somehow disinterested in what was going on and paid the crying blonde woman no mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that's quite a performance, deary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not a performance\u201d said Erica, her voice low again. \u201cI...\u201d, but Erica could not finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you're making... those other two guys...into...old men\u201d said Erica very slowly, as she was starting to hyperventilate. \u201cThey...don't...deserve that. They...did nothing...wrong. Please forgive...the three of us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is what you meant by 'It's complicated'\u201d said Don to himself. The witch put down her fries and smiled at both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica's profuse apology and plea for mercy did in fact soften the witch's heart. She will offer Erica a choice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The witch offers Erica to turn back into the young man she once was but Danielle and Donna will continue to rapidly age into little old ladies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The witch offers to turn back Danielle and Donna into young men again, but Erica must spend the rest of her days as a middle aged woman in their place.</span></div></div>",

But\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\u2026 But\u2026 But what?\" Erica said, trying to use every fiber of his mind to forget about his changes and get back to his normal, average, simple life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\u2026 I can offer you a deal.\" The Witch grinned a toothy, yellow grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon, meanwhile, looked on in a strange mix of curiosity and horror. \"A deal?

However, if I could change a couple of you\u2026 I might be able to do something.\" The Witch replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're saying\u2026 only I get to change back? Erica asked, sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, you think too much of me, dear. You should know by now that even when I'm fair, I'm not. It is not you who gets to change. It is them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon's eyes widened as Erica stared off into the distance. He tried to spot his now lady friends, but there were no sign of them. The dance floor was too packed to see beyond anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My offer is this, dear. Your friends can change as long as you make the promise to spend your days in a new life as a middle aged woman.\" The witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erica, don't!\" Don said, stepping in abruptly, \"I don't trust her\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Witch laughed. \"Ah. I see you're the white knight type. I see a very interesting future for you\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don, don't get involved. This is my cross to bear. You see how dangerous this all is.\" Erica said before turning to the witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You give your word?\" Erica said, sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! A deal's a deal. All you need to do\u2026 is shake.\" The Witch said, extending her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica looked at the wrinkled hand, then across the dance floor, then back to the hand. She grabbed the hand firmly, closed her eyes, and shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha. It is done!\" The witch said. Erica felt a very sudden and strong breeze. When she opened her eyes, the witch was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica flicked her blonde hair back as she looked in a mirror than hung behind the bartenders across the way. She looked at the woman she had now permanently become, and sighed. All she could do now was accept her new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was very foolish and brave of you to do.\" Don said, not really thinking if the words he was saying were helpful or hurtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica looked at him, and gave the boy a hug and a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Same to you. Knowing that transformation exists and still putting yourself in the line of fire.\" Erica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it, I guess.\" Don said, looking down at himself briefly to see if he had indeed changed at all,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it shows good character. You're gonna find a lot of love in your life.\" Erica said, thinking about the youth she lost. Somehow, in all of this nonsense, she felt more mature. Maybe it was the magic talking, but she felt like an adult woman now, instead of a young boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's see if my friends even still recognize me.\" Erica said, as she took Don's hand and led him back to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: It was a trick! The witch already made a deal with Danielle and Donna, whose rapidly changing mindsets made them want to be old women forever. Erica looks on as reality shifts. Donna becomes her mother, Danielle becomes her aunt, Erica obtains a new life of marriage, kids, and work, and Don gets a very strange change of his own. Erica vows to find some sort of magic beyond the witch to fix all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Erica returns to the table to find herself in a new reality where Donald and Daniel are her children, and she's now dating the Don she's just met, who is going through a few changes of his own...</span></div></div>",

He was in what looked to be a living room. There was a big flat screen tv on the wall. He was laying on a big sofa couch instead of the deak he was sitting in earlier. \"What the heck is going on\" he thought to himself. His whole body felt completely different. His body weight seemed to have shifted. \"This is getting weird.\" He thought. He struggled to sit up because of a mysterious weight on his stomach. He vaguely noticed a very large hump where his stomach should be. He pulled the blanket off of his lower body and was shocked at what he saw. He saw two enourmous, milk filled, GG cup boobs. Under them was a gigantic pregnant belly that was very hard and seemed heavy. \"That's what has been holding me down\" he thought not really taking the ramifications of the discovery. He struggled to get up with this new weight. He finally got up from the couch, noticing his center of gravity was all off. He nearly toppled over with the new weight on his stomach, butt, and chest. He waddled his new body over to a mirror and was shocked to see this. <br>\r\n[URL=http://s1175.photobucket.com/user/bfine2525/media/Pregnant/308DCFF50000 0578-3415644-image-a-10_1453727188678_zpsdlgl8grg.jpg.html][IMG]<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i1175.photobucket.com/albums/r625/bfine2525/Pregnant/308DCFF500000578-3415644-image-a-10_1453727188678_zpsdlgl8grg.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i1175.photobucket.com/albums/r625...</a>[/I MG][/URL]<br>\r\nHe was now an extremely pregnant woman and from the accent in his voice he was now an australian woman. He waddled into a big kitchen, passing by a window with the view of a beach. Finding a purse, an id with the name Kim Tucci of Perth, Australia. \"That must be the life I am now in.\" She said to herself. Also in the purse was a sonogram. \" It looks like I am 29 weeks pregnant with quintuplets . I am pregnant with five babies. So that's why I'm as big as a house\" she says in her new voice. Rubbing her gigantic belly instinctivly comes to her. Sitting down on the couch, rubbing her new pregnant belly, she thinks to herself,\"How did I become an australian woman pregnant with quintuplets half way across the world.\" A nine year old boy and a 10 year old girl come in the back door of this house. They both came over to you on the couch. \"Hey mommy, can we feel your belly. We want to see if we can feel the 5 babies. \" they ask. You look at your right hand, which is now slender and feminine, and see a wedding ring on it. \"These must be my other children\" you think to yourself. \"Sure you can feel my belly, but be very gentle with it. You guys don't want to hurt mommy and your prescious brothers and sisters.\" You say to the young children. They begin to rub your globe of a belly, putting their ears up to it trying to hear inside. Memories of your other marriage and that the nine year old boy was your child from another marriage. The 10 year old girl was your husbands kid from another marriage also. You felt 5 kicks in your stomach. You must be hungry. You remember that because of being pregnant with quintuplets, you have to eat 6,000 calories a day. \"Man it seems is all this woman does is eat food. But I love carrying these 5 precious babies.\" Your biggest problem with this body is your limited mobility. You have to waddle where ever you go, you have to pee 12 times a day, and your belly makes sleeping impossible. No matter how many pillows you place it on. You can still feel the weight of your belly. \"Man it is tough being pregnant. Especially with 5 babies.\" You think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinancially, you are really rich. Your husband is a wealthy businessman. It makes being pregnant so much easier since you can stay home on bedrest. Later that night, Kim's new husband comes home with a bunch of food. \"Hey honey, how are the babies treating you.\" He asked you while kissing you and putting his hands around your big belly. \" I love your bldy when it is this big. I am going to make tonight upstairs really special if you catch my drift.\" He whispered to you. Everyone gathers around the table for dinner. \"Here honey, I'll makr your plate, you really need to eat up. Per doctor's orders\" he said. \"I know honey, but I have already gained 105 pounds . Each baby weighs 4 pounds. I am now carrying 20 pounds of baby. I went from 125 pounds and now I weigh 230 pounds due to this pregnancy\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

They knew better than to stick around when mom started playing around with her scientific experiments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack knew this too, but had been tired from staying up late the night before on his computer. Therefore he had not heard his mom get up and start tinkering until it <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwas too late, and she flung his door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jack, would you do me a big favor and try something for me please???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh come on mom--the last time I did this I had to hide a tail for 3 weeks afterward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is nothing like that, and I don't ask you to do much for me--besides, I will let you go to that convention that comic thingy with your friends if you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, alright--I really want to go--just promise me that whatever happens I won't have to endure it for that long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise--now come on out to the table with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly Jack followed her out and there was a bowl of oatmeal with some strawberries on italong with a glass of orange juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where is the pill I have to take--or shot--or spray?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not like that, I mixed it with your breakfast. Go on, eat up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here goes nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, Jack ate up and finished the breakfast and nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is okay so far...\"he said and then paused...his voice seemed different...softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the look on his mom's face he could tell something had started happening, right before he doubled over as his guts started to rearrange and his chest began <br>\r\n<br>\r\nswell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it was too good to be true--oh now I know--I am turning into a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dear, and you are being a good sport about it. I put an additive in to make it go a bit faster for you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the consideration,\" she replied as she felt her masculine parts change themselves into feminine ones. She looked into her pants just in time to say <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe male extension fade to nothingness to be replaced by a hairy slit.Before he could consider this her mom grabbed her arm and pulled her to a full length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say I am a hot young lady of 22,\" she replied.\"Wait, how did I know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait--uhhhh, you weren't supposed to change age--that was supposed to stay the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great--well it isn't and it doesn't seem to be letting up--I just passed 26--no--27 now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh--just wait here--oh--and I am glad you wore loose sweats--and I think you need to go by Jaqueline or Jackie for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie--I like that--wait--You're leaving me here? To go through this by myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey--I am just going to my lab down the hall--I have some notes and something that may stop the aging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well be quick about it Claire--I'm not getting any younger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for sure,\"she replied, and then got a look,\" and I am still your mom--so call me mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am 33 and I think it is fine to call you an idiot--but I was nice--just go get that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay--it will stop the aging for now--but it may be unstable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get it dear heart--all this maturity along with these hormones is driving me a little crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire took off  down the hall and went through the room.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She did it!  Rachael did it!  After months of planning and research, she has done it.  As a highly regarded scientist in her field she was working a formula that can turn anyone who drinks it into another person.  She worked hard trying to get this formula right. And through all that hard work, she finally managed to create it.  Right on the table are two separate viles filled with two colored liquids.  One of the liquids is blue while the other is pink as they contain the DNA of herself and her son, Thomas.  Looking to the blue liquid, she smiled and was eager to try it, but not before her son comes back from school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since he was born, Rachael was a bit envious of her own son.  He had the youth, the energy, and the freedom that was taken away from her when she was young.  Sometimes she wished that she would be in his shoes so she can enjoy the carefree experience he is having.  Now thanks to the formula she created she can not only live that dream, but also her son.  For she knew that Thomas's dream is to be like her mom, always responsible and in charge of the house.  Not to mention understanding what it would be like to be a woman.  After all, Rachael is still quite a looker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the mirror next to her, she was still hot in her age.  At thirty-five, she had a voluptuous body with melons sized CC cup breasts, a curvy hourglass figure, and a round rear.  She also has a beautiful face with high cheekbones, a thin and petite nose, and an emerald eye color.  She even have luscious amber hair that goes down to her back, though she done it up in a tight bun whenever she goes to work.  Of course she was showing signs of aging from the way her breasts sagged, to a bit of muffin top on the hips to escalate the curves, the faint lines around her eyes and mouth, and the hair looking duller then before with a few gray streaks weaved here and there.  But still, she has the look to die for.  Though it will be sad to loose this body over a young male boy, she knew that she must sacrifice herself to live a different life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at herself in detail, she soon heard the sound of the bus horn and turned to see the window  Approaching it, she could see a school bus parked on the side as someone was getting out.  He was a young boy of eight with a thin stature and black hair short hair and the same emerald eyes as her. She knew that this is her son and was ready to tell him the good news.  So she left her room with the two viles and went downstairs to the living room, waiting for him to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the main hall, the door opened and young Thomas entered the house, plopping his bookbag on the floor.  \"Mommy!\" he screamed out loud, \"I'm home!\"  He waited to hear her when she said not far from her, \"I'm in the living room!  Please come here.  There's something I want to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas heard her and was confused with what she wants him for.  But he decided to listen to her as he walked to the living room and saw her sitting on the sofa with the two viles on the table.  \"Have a seat.\" she said to him, \"I want to show you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas was still confused as he wondered why his mom was acting this way.  Normally, it was the whole 'How was school today sweetie?', 'Did you get into a fight with those bullies?, or 'Have you met any cute girls lately?'.  But now it seems she was interested of something and wanted to share it with him.  Curious, he headed to the couch on the opposite end and sat there, starring in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mom?\" he asked, \"What is it?  What do you want that is important?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael took a deep breath and was ready to share this with him.  \"Well, I was wondering...  Remember when you told me you wish to be just like me when you grow up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas blinked and answered a little awkwardly  \"Yes...  I remember...  But that was when I said that you are the best mom out there.  Why you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael smirked and continued with her talk.  \"Well, truth be told, I always wanted to be like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas raised an eyebrow and was still confused by this reaction.  \"Okay...\" he said, \"Where are you going with this, mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother laughed it off and explained about it.  \"You see, Thomas, I always wish to be in your shoes because you always have such youth and freedom, while I have to work continuously on projects at work all day.  I didn't want to push myself a lot.  And since you want to be in my place, It is a perfect opportunity to try out what I was working with at my job.\"  She then showed him the two viles on the table and asked, \"Do you know what this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas looked to the viles and answered back.  \"Those look like the viles from your job.  Why are they doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain.\" she continued, \"You see, in these viles contains a formula that can turn someone into another person, be that of a different race, gender, or age.  These two contain DNA of the you and me and ones used, can turn ourselves into each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas heard that and was surprised by that sudden news.  \"Wait a second,\" he stopped her, \"back up.  Are you telling me that if I take one of them, I can turn into you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael nodded as she said, \"That's right.  And if I use the other, I can turn into you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas shocked expression turned into pure joy and he jumped up and said, \"Yes!  I can be a mother!  This is the most awesome thing ever!\"  He soon stopped what he's doing and realized something else.  \"But, how did you get that DNA from me and you?  It's not possible that you took it from me without looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother giggled and said, \"Simple, I took you to the doctor to get ourselves a blood test.  Of course that was really me setting it up so I could get the blood and extracted the DNA out of it to put in the formula.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas soon remembered that moment as he rubbed his arm from the pain.  \"Oh right...  I remember that.\" he said with embarrassment, \"It was a real pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's worth the pain!\" she continued, \"Once to use these viles, we will be in each other shoes living different lives.  Truelly a dream come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe son soon thought of something and asked, \"But even if our bodies are different, shouldn't our minds be the same?  I mean, people would get suspicious that the two of us would be acting strange in each others places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael smiled and let him know of something else.  \"Oh Thomas, you worry on the little things.  See, not only have I extracted the DNA, but also the knowledge, memories, and mannerisms of each other.  This will make our new lives easier.  But remember, we will still be ourselves, but in different bodies and minds.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, Thomas.  Do you want to miss out on a chance like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas heard her and gave it some thought.  Sure, the idea of trading each others lives would be cool, but then there's the mentality part of it as well.  The last thing he wanted is to think that he's his on mom and forget about his old life.  However, his mom knows what she's doing and is eager to give it a try.  So he made his decision and said, \"All right, I'll do it.  But I only ask one thing.  If we are going to turn into each other, how long does the effects last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael knew that he's really starting to question it and gave him in the hones truth.  \"Let's see...  If I were to guess I say the affects will last until...\"</span></div></div>",

And it's almost four o'clock right now, so we'll be swapping every day after you get back from school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached for the vials, Thomas grabbed her other hand. \"Wait, wait, Mommy! Something doesn't make sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael paused and looked at her son. Thomas was in his thinking pose; eyes absently gazing at his shoes, his left hand slowly twirling a lock of his hair. \"I really want a chance to be Mommy, and I think it would be fun for a little bit. But if we keep switching forever, what do we do if we want to stop? What if one of us gets hurt or sick and is stuck at home?\" Thomas frowned and his voice grew quieter. \"What if I . . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start forgetting who you are after switching so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas nodded. Rachael couldn't help but laugh inwardly at her worrywart of a son. Rachael had a habit of chasing wild ideas, both at work and at home, and while Thomas would always enthusiastically join her, she sometimes felt that Thomas fretted enough to be the mother of their household after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuffed the vials in her pocket and stood up from the sofa. \"Follow me, Tommy,\" she said as she led him to the calendar on the wall. She pulled out the pen she always kept in her pocket and pointed to the day's date, October 15th. \"Every day, we're going to write down who <i>you</i> are changing into that afternoon. If you ever feel unsure about who you are, just look at this calendar and you'll remember.\" She pointed to the blue silicone wristband Thomas was wearing on his left arm. \"If you want to be super sure, wear that wristband all the time and you can always remind yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael knelt down and put her hands on Thomas's shoulders. \"Also, your Mommy's smart, which means you're smart too. I'll tell you how we can stop if we ever want to, and if we run into a problem, we'll just figure it out like we always have. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a bit, Thomas returned his mother's smile. \"Okay, let's do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael smacked a kiss on Thomas's forehand before rushing toward the stairs. \"Come on! To Mommy's lab!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Thomas followed Rachael to her bedroom/office/lab, he realized he forgot to ask another question: how long would each transformation take?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got his answer as soon as he stepped through the door.</span></div></div>",

If Thomas had known his mom would use the atomizer so much he would have been more careful about building it with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let me test this out first,\u201d said Rachael as she dumped the contents of the blue vial into the device. She squeezed an asthma spacer onto the tubing, locked her lips around the mouthpiece, flipped the switch. . . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened. Rachael was confused \u2013 she <i>did</i> try using the atomizer with her new homemade vape liquid last week, but surely that wasn't enough to gunk up the works?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy, you forgot this.\u201d Thomas walked over and plugged the atomizer into the wall socket. The atomizer roared to life. Rachael shrugged her shoulders in apology as a white cloud filled the spacer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael began to take deep breaths, drawing the formula deep into her lungs. A sour taste coated her tongue, and she made a mental note to never use cotton candy flavor in her experiments again. She finished inhaling the formula after five breaths. As she pulled the mouthpiece from her lips, unplugged the atomizer, and began rinsing out the apparatus, she could feel a slight buzz kicking in. She also noticed the formula\u2019s aftertaste \u2013 a light, tingling sweetness. Perhaps cotton candy wasn't so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the atomizer and spacer cleaned, Rachael set up the device and poured in the contents of the pink vial. Thomas pulled the spacer to his mouth and nodded, signaling Rachael to flip the switch. A thick honey-like flavor filled Thomas\u2019s mouth as he began to inhale the formula. Thomas couldn't take breaths as large as his mother\u2019s so he finished after ten. As he set down the spacer, Thomas began to cough and hack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael rushed to him. \u201cTommy! What\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis . . . tastes . . . <i>horrible</i>!\u201d Thomas choked out. The formula had taken on a strong bitter edge, forming a bittersweet wave that rolled down his throat and spilled across his lips. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt should be cotton candy, just like mine.\u201d Rachael patted her son\u2019s back. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you rinse out your mouth downstairs, sweetie? I\u2019ll finish cleaning the lab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas stumbled out of the room as Rachael began cleaning her bench. Neither noticed the changes which were already beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do Rachael and Thomas transform first?</span></div></div>",

The results were cool (he and his mom had chameleon powers for two days), but the experience was unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Thomas was removing his jeans, Rachael had successfully completed the injection on herself and was filling up a second bulb with the fluid in the pink vial. \u201cOkay Tommy \u2013 your turn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t be too excited about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes later, both Rachael and Thomas were fully clothed again. \u201cOkay,\u201d Rachael said as she cleaned the syringes and vials in the bathroom sink, \u201cthe transformation should only take an hour so after we finish I\u2019ll need you to pick up some things I left behind at work.\u201d She craned her head towards her bedroom. \u201cTommy, are you feeling okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas stood stiffly as he helped wipe down his mother\u2019s lab bench. \u201cI need to be used to having things inside of me soon, so I\u2019m fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt times like these, Rachael wondered if it really was a good idea to be so open with her 8 year-old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure the lab was clean, the two sat together on Rachael\u2019s bed. Rachael was writing her third grant application of the day, and she had Thomas bring in his homework so she could help him if he needed it. Five minutes passed and nothing happened. Rachael expected this so she wasn't worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother five minutes passed, then another. After a total of 20 minutes of waiting, Rachael and Thomas felt no changes. \u201cDid I make a mistake with the vials?\u201d Rachael wondered. \u201cMaybe I should drive back to work now to investigate? I need to pick up my things anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas tugged on Rachael\u2019s sleeve. \u201cMommy, I don\u2019t feel any different. Did the experiment work?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Lola's husband had been killed right after Jake had been born while on a business trip. Because the insurance had paid double Lola had been able to get her degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola had gotten calls from Thomas school saying that he had been bulling  other younger students and that he has gotten suspend for a month. Lola had been working in her basement in her lab. She had been working on a new project for the government that was to help get the people who have been hurt in war or accidents. After Thomas had gotten home that night, she says that she knows that for the next month your out of school so you have one of 2 choices either   watch your sister while I'm working in my lab or you can help me test out my machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tells his mother that because I don't want to have to change diapers that I will be your test subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe told Thomas that the first were going to try and it on some animals that had been hurt and then ran the test and it came out perfect. She had already had scanned herself and Thomas into the machine. She had a total of 4 pads to use for the experiments. She had said that they tried all that they could do with out human trials.She then tells Thomas that if he will try the machine with her that  she will give him $200 and that if it successful that he will have the rest of his time off school free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens is that the machine had  while Thomas and Lola were on the pads somehow had gotten transformed into each other except Thomas and Lola still had there own minds. It was at that time that the sitter had said that that mother called to sat that she needed to bet home because her father had been in a accident and she need to watch her brother &amp; sisters. It was at the same time that Jessica started to cry and the sitter had said that Lola need to come and feed Jessica because it looked like she had forgotten to pump some extra milk in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHat had happened is that Jessica had been born after Lola had a one night stand. It was at the same time that the machine had shorted out  and when she looks at the circuits that she sees that 4 of the main board will need to be replaced along with some wiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola tells Thomas he needs to feed Jessica and that she will pay the sitter using the banking app., she then says she will have to try and see how long until she can get it fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas went and fed Jessica and Jessica had fallen asleep. Thomas then laid Jessica back in the crib and went back to the lab. What happens is that Thomas is told   the replacement parts will be ready in 2 weeks. She then says that we will have to act as if nothing is wrong and she realized that she had a  busy schedule tomorrow. She tells him that  tonight he has a date with Jefferson Thompson but that he usually goes with Jeff . She then says that the guy was one that he meet while at the park with his kids. She then says that Jefferson wife had died in a car crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then tells Thomas that the date is to be at 8 so that he needs to pump some bottles and then get the dinner ready and then final go and get ready for the date. What Thomas didn't know was that when it comes to drinking she always would drink very lightly because it caused her to become very horny. Lola had told Thomas that she would get him ready for the date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas had told Melissa that if she wants because it's the weekend that if she  wanted she could spend it at her friends because  Thomas was grounded for the weekend. Melissa had called her friend and said she would be staying over at Janet's place.  Thomas had  gotten fed and then both ready for bed and then tucked them in. Melissa right after dinner she went over to her friends so Lola had went in and gotten the clothing ready and then said that you need to go take a shower and then she would help finish with the make-up. Thomas had taken and washed how his mother had said and then dried off. She then helped Thomas get dressed and did the make-up. Thomas had to admit that he looked beautiful. It had just turned 8 and there was a knock on the door and when it was Jefferson and he had flowers and candy. Which Thomas had said thanks and it was then that Jefferson tells who he thought was Lola that he planned a dinner, movie, &amp; maybe dancing. Thomas says that \"thanks\". What Thomas didn't know was that his mom had been out a couple of times with Jeff that he knew how to get her body in the mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas and Jeff leave and arrived at the restaurant and Jeff had pre-ordered the dinner because Lola had told him what she like and what she usually drinks. What happens is that it was after Thomas had drank a number and didn't realize that he was already starting to give Jeff  the wrong impression. They then went to the movie which was a romantic and it was half way when Thomas realize that his body had gotten to the point that he tells Jeff that he wants to get out of here and go someplace we can be alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff occupation is a landlord and that he has a place that he was just fixing up to rent it. They arrived at the place and before Thomas knew what was happening he and Jeff was having sex and Thomas told Jeff that she needed to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Thomas or Lola realized is that Lola's was in the most fertile time of the month and that when Jeff and Thomas had sex that Thomas is now pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe see that after Thomas got home and gotten ready to help his mother work on the machine that Lola asked Thomas how the date went   well. We find that Jeff had already asked for another date and Thomas had agreed and then set it up for near 2 weeks figuring he would be back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 weeks had passed and Thomas was ready to get his body back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I woke up this morning with another pounding headache. The hockey season ended three weeks ago and the lacrosse season started the week after. Because we will play in the same conditions as the football team (anything but lightning) we have been practicing in the snow. We made the split between JV and Varsity after the first week and I played with a cold all of last week. Not the greatest of ideas because now I'm so sick I've missed the first day of school since I was in 5th grade. And it looks like I'm going to miss another day today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom came into my room to wake me up. \"How are you feeling today?\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still have a headache, but I don't feel as congested as yesterday\" I informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll call the school and you just focus on getting better\" she said. \"I'll be home around 4:30\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" I said. With that she left and I was left alone. I slept about five more minutes before I got up to get some breakfast. I grabbed a bowl and some frosted flakes. I ate the flacks and went up to my room to email my coach to say I won't be at practice again today. I then went downstairs and turned on the news. They were just starting the weather portion and it looked like it was going to start warming up. The highs for today were going to be in the fifties. With that I laid down on the couch and fell asleep. As I slept, I had a weird dream where I had been born a girl. It felt super real. In the dream, I was doing everything that I had been doing as a boy, just from the other side of the gender fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up after about a four hour nap. I looked at the clock on the wall and it read 10:13.  As I stood up, my center of gravity felt off. I looked down as long, shoulder length brown hair fell into my face blocking my view. I brushed it out of the way and saw boobs. I couldn't believe this had happened. I wobbled into the bathroom and saw a beautiful girl with brown hair that went just past her shoulders, blue-green eyes. She was about five foot nine inches and 135lbs. As I looked into the mirror, I noticed the girl staring back looked so much like me that she could be my twin. After the shock finally wore off, I went and found my iPhone. I needed to call my parents. I grabbed my iPhone and called my mom's cell. When she finally picked up, I said \"Mom, it's me Mike. I don't know how it happened but somehow I fell asleep after eating breakfast and now I'm a girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this? Why are you calling me on my sons phone\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really me\" I pleaded with her. \"Just come home and you will see\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok fine, I'll come home. But if your not telling the truth you and Mike will be in big trouble\" she threatened. She hung up, and I hit end on my phone. With that I wobbled my way up to my room to put something on. I was still wearing the boxers and teeshirt that I had on before this happened. The boxers were almost falling off and the teeshirt was stretched across my larger chest. When I finally made it to my room, I took of the boxers and quickly grabbed a pair of black compression shorts. I didn't want to even see my new body jacked yet so I closed my eyes as I put them on. I then grabbed some black sweat pants and threw them on. They were a little long now so I pulled them up to my belly button. The teeshirt kept my new breasts from bouncing to much so I left it on and grabbed my lacrosse sweatshirt. Then I went back downstairs. It was getting easier to walk the more I walked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom arrived home in about thirty minutes. And when she came in the door, she was really pissed off. \"Michael\" she shouted. \"What is this all about? Who is this girl on the couch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up and said \"it's really me mom. It's really Mike\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove it. Prove to me your my son\" she said. \"What is something only Mike would know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You named me Mike because of the M like shaped birth mark on the underside of my left arm\" I said as I pulled the sweatshirt off and rolled the sleeve of the teeshirt up showing the very same birth mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, how did this happen\" she asked in bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" I said. \"I just fell asleep around 6:10ish and woke up around four hours later as a girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to call the doctor and get and appointment. Maybe he will have an idea\" she said. I went upstairs to my room and sat on my bed, hooked my iPhone up to my speakers and listened to my music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes, my mom came up to my room and said \"I've gotten an appointment at noon. We'll leave at eleven\" she paused for a moment. \"Um, I think you should use a bra. You sister forgot one of her sports bras when she went off to college and I think I still have it.\" She left for a moment before coming back with one of my sisters pink sports bras in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It go's on just like a shirt\" she said as she tossed me the bra. \"I also suggest you put on a larger shirt that will fit over your new breasts\" with that she left me and I did as she said. Shortly after I felt a very familiar feeling. I needed to go pee. I went to the bathroom and was about to start when I remembered I need to sit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once we had checked in and were told where to go, we waited for two or three minutes before the my doctor, Dr. Samuels, came to see us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we felling today Michael\" he asked, not seeing you because his eyes were barred in the clipboard he carried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all that well\" I said. His eyes shot up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, where is Michael\" he whispered to my mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid this is Michael\" she said as I removed my sweatshirt and showed him the M shaped birthmark on my arm. He was the only person outside of our family who had ever seen it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stood in silence for a moment, then I said \"I woke up this morning and wasn't feeling good. After my mom left, I got up, had some frosted flakes, then fell asleep on the couch. When I woke up, I was a girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, give me a moment while I call a friend. He is a scientists who has been studying this topic for the past couple years\" doctor Samuels said. He left the room and went to his office a few doors down the hall. After a minute he came back into the room. \"My friend will be here in five minutes. Would you mind waiting\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\" my mother answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five minutes passed uneventfully, as I played games on my iPhone. I was starting to get bored when two men came into the room. One was dressed in a lab coat and looked like a stereotypical scientists. The other man was dressed in a black suit jacket, white dress shirt, black pants and shoes, and no tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael Smith?\" The man in the lab coat asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is George Black. I'm a scientists who studies the genetic disorder called Gendrotica. It's a disorder that, well as you can guess, changes a persons gender. This is my government connection Mr. Tanner White. He technically works for the department of health and human services, but in reality his job is to find the funding for the research of genetic disorder\" he explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I have this Gendrotica\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will need to run some tests to be 100% positive, but most likely the answer is yes\" Mr. Black said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we have to do after the tests\" my mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Mr. White started. \"After the tests we will provide you with additional or new documents. Extra stuff to fill out to go with your birth certificate, new drivers license, passport. We can also transfer you to a new school if you would like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I would like to stay in my school\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" Mr. White said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get started with the tests\" Mr Black said. \"All we need is some blood and urine samples, then we look at them and compare them to other tests you've had done. Then we see if you have the specific disorder\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And while he is doing the tests, I'll be taking you out for a short driving test to make sure your motor skills are still good\" Mr. White said. \"By then the tests will have come back. If they come back positive, I will give you a debit card that withdraws money from a government account for ninety days. During those ninety days, you can spend as much as you want for clothing, school supplies, health and medical supplies. We will also print off the new paperwork and inform your school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got started on the test. First they had me pee in a cup and then drew some blood. They had me wait five minutes before Mr. White took me outside for a road test. When we finally went for the drive, I was in a little discomfort with the seatbelt resting between my new breasts. Other than that difference, I passed the test with flying colors. We finished in twenty minutes, then went back to check on the test results that we all knew would come up positive for Gendrotica. Just as we walked threw the hospital doors, Mr. White got a text message on his phone from Mr. Black. \"The tests are officially positive. We can head down stairs and get started on the paper work\" he said. \"Your mom and Mr. Black will be there shortly after us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" I mumbled. \"So, what do we gotta do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first we will take your measurements. Then you will fill out some information that you will need to keep with your birth certificate. While that is going on we will be creating new drivers licenses, passport, the works\" Mr. White said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe began taking measurements when we got to the basement. I was measured to be 5 feet 9 and 1/2 inches, 134.7lbs. He then went and wrote the information, along with some other stuff like hair and eye color. Right before we started printing Mr. White asked \"What do you want your name to be? I don't think the Cops will believe your name is Michael anymore\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Michelle Hope Smith\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it\" mom said. \"It's close enough to your original name that it will be an easy change for me and your friends\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true\" added Mr. Black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe put the name on the documents and then we printed them. It was a long process. \"This is the only hospital in the state that can creat a drivers license or passport\" Mr. White said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that\" I asked without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was par of our funding. Because it would only be used for people who are effected by Gendrotica, it isn't used much\" Mr. White said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" I said. We took a picture for the drivers license, then waited for about half an hour for everything to print. For the first time in my life, it looked like I had taken a good picture. Just as I was about to leave with my mom and the new documents and debit card, Mr. Black shouted \"Wait! Take this to.\" He handed us a business card. \"It's the link to my website with all the known information and facts about Gendrotica\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We got mostly the essentials. Shirts, panties, bras, and a few pairs of shoes. We got one pair of running shoes ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://m.ladyfootlocker.com/?uri=product&amp;sku=80591005&amp;model=193841&amp;cm=GLOBAL%20SEARCH:%20KEYWORD%20SEARCH\" target=\"_blank\">http://m.ladyfootlocker.com/?uri=product...</a> ), a new pair of lacrosse cleats ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lacrossemonkey.com/lacrosse-nike-footwear-cleat-womens-speedlax-3-black-silver-white.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.lacrossemonkey.com/lacrosse-n...</a> ) and a new pair of my favorite shoes, a pair of  five fingers ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.roadrunnersports.com/rrs/products/VFF117/?cc=BKGY\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.roadrunnersports.com/rrs/prod...</a> ). Then we went and got a backpack (I already needed a new one). My mother wanted me to get something that was a little more feminine over gender neutral. I gave in. I picked one that was black and \"Ash\" according to the tag, with some bright yellow ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://m.kohls.com/kohlsopenapi/productmobile.html?productID=1499157\" target=\"_blank\">http://m.kohls.com/kohlsopenapi/productm...</a> ). We walked around a little before we deiced to go back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we finally got home, I put my new stuff away. My mom called the school to make sure they knew what happened to me. When she hung up, she came into my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey honey, you should text your friends and have them come over. I think they should know what happened to you. I already checked with your school and they are informing just your teachers and coaches\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a bad idea\" I said. I sent a text to my best friend and teammate, Benjamin. We are both on both the hockey and lacrosse teams. Im a goalie in Hockey and he was one of the top defensemen. He is our only goalie in Lacrosse and I'm one of the starting defenders (it flip flops I know). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe replied to my text saying that he could be over in an hour. That gave me plenty of time to try on my lax and hockey stuff. For the most part it all fit. All in all, I'm getting some extra years that I wouldn't have gotten had this not happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Benjamin as he knocked on the front door. I quickly got up and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ben\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, who are you\" he asked, a bit confused by my new appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Mike\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, how much is Mike paying you to say that\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really Mike\" my mom said as she walked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove it\" he said. \"What was our code word when we needed help with girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Language\" I said. That had been our code word in the off chance we needed help from the other with girls and we didn't want to tip off the girl. It was never really used, but I was the one that used it the most. Benjamin never really had a problem talking to girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is you\" he said. \"How did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He or she now, has this thing called Gendortica. It, well, changes a persons gender. It only seems to appear maybe once every tenish years\" my mom said. \"We have already talked to the school and they will inform only his teachers and coaches. Then they will talk with their classes on Friday during the hour that he's in or during practice\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when will you be back in school?\" Ben asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monday\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm planning on being at lax practice to\" I chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, so you wanna do anything right now. Maybe grab some sticks and go in the back yard?\" he asked. I could tell he was trying to help me be a little less uncomfortable with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love to, but I can't. I need to 'prepare' myself for a meeting with my teachers tomorrow\" I told him. \"You know, Incase they have any questions. Were going with the doctor and he's going to explain everything so they can explain it to their classes. They will only tell the classes I'm in and the lax team. So you'll hear about this a few times and because your my best friend, I'm giving you the heads up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks for the heads up\" he said. \"Is there anyone I can tell about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" I quickly answered. \"Keep this on the DL\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, see you Monday\" he said as he got up and headed to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later\" I said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the day went by uneventfully and and so did most of Friday. My mom was talking on the phone with my older sister Carla and explaining everything that had happened. Because she had already gone off to college, we didn't hear from her very much. But she told mom she would come home as soon as she could. She also said that I was welcome to use anything she didn't bring with her. I was glad she was going to college close to home because she would come by maybe every other weekend for clothes, and sometimes with laundry. We got along just fine for brother and sister. I think our friendship had a big part with her giving me all access to her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into Carla's room. Hesitantly, I walked over to her dresser. In the top drawer, she had her bras she didn't bring with her. For the most part, they were sports bras, which made me glad. I pulled out a black one. Taking off the teeshirt I wore to bed last night, I slid off the sports bra I was wearing and put this clean one on. I then opened another drawer and pulled out a black, compression short like thing ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.roadrunnersports.com/rrs/products/ASW2991/womens-asics-asx-boy-brief/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.roadrunnersports.com/rrs/prod...</a> ). I took of my lax sweats and male compression shorts that didn't fit as well anymore. Sliding on the new underwear, I was surprised by how they felt so different, hugging my new form in ways the other ones weren't. I proceed to Carla's closet. I grabbed a pair of jeans that weren't quite skinny jeans, but were tighter than I would have wore as a guy ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.revolveclothing.com/mobile/DisplayProduct.jsp?code=TRUE-WJ2175&amp;c=True+Religion&amp;utm_source=Pricegrabber&amp;utm_medium=CSE&amp;source=Pricegrabber&amp;cvosrc=cse.pricegrabber.TRUE-WJ2175&amp;CA_6C15C=730011320000670136\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.revolveclothing.com/mobile/Di...</a> ). Then I found a red teeshirt that had the name of the college Carla was attending in black letters. It hugged my new hour glass figure much better than the teeshirt that was from our pink-out game for hockey. I went and got the five finger socks ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.roadrunnersports.com/rrs/products/INJ130/injinji-footwear-run-lightweight-no-show-3-pack/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.roadrunnersports.com/rrs/prod...</a> )  and the shoes we bought earlier in the week, and headed down stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready\" mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I'll ever be\" I told her. With that we hoped into the car and made the quick drive to the high school. Once we arrived we saw the principle, Mrs. Jackson, standing outside waiting for us. School had only been out for an hour to let as many kids leave as possible so nobody who wasn't supposed to hear anything from our little conference would hear it. She walked us into one of the conference rooms in the main office,  where I found all of my current teachers and coaches, as well as Mr. Black.  It was a long and boring meeting as Mr. Black went over everything he had told me and my mother earlier in the week. When he was done, he asked if anyone had any question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's not contagious?\" asked my physics teacher, Mr. Burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" replied Mr. Black \"it is a genetic disorder that is only found in one and one million people statistically. However, this is the first case I've ever encountered in my lifetime. Any more questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that concludes our evening\" Mrs. Jackson said. \"And just as a reminder, Only people in the classrooms and on the lax team are to know that Michelle was really Michael\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The weekend started off uneventful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you see who that is honey\" my mom asked me. \"I'm kinda making breakfast right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" I told her. I threw on a sports bra I took from my sisters room and a clean teeshirt. I still had on the pair of sweat pants I wore last night and left my room. I opened the door to find Carla standing there, with a bad of laundry as normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carla\" I shouted as I jumped through the doorway and gave her a hug. I hadn't noticed it before, but she was still a tad bit taller than me. She is around 5 foot 10, and I was around 6 feet tall before this had happened. The fact that she was now the taller of the two of us just added to everything that I was going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready for your first shopping trip as a girl\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, where do we start\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first we eat breakfast, then we take that credit card you got from the government and get you some new clothes and shoes\" she told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After finishing breakfast, Carla stood up and said \"Meet me in my room once your done.\" With that she left for her bedroom. I started to eat very slow, but it still was only five minutes before I was done. I got up and slowly walked to Carla's room, fearing what might be in store for me today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in, I saw her on her bed. \"Don't worry\" she said seeing the look on my face. \"We are only doing your hair. We can skip the makeup\" she said. \"Sit down right here and let me get started\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe worked for a couple minutes in silence before speaking again. \"Now, let's get you dressed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with what I have now\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For starters, sweats are only ok for relaxing around the house\" she said as she grabbed the jeans I had wore to the meeting on Friday. I wasn't going to tell her I had already had them on. Then she pulled out a black compression shirt ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://m.kohls.com/kohlsopenapi/productmobile.html?productID=1492614\" target=\"_blank\">http://m.kohls.com/kohlsopenapi/productm...</a> ). \"Put these on. I tried to pick something a little more you for today\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" I said as I took the clothes. I put them on quickly and then went and got the running shoes from my trip to the mall with my mom earlier in the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice. Those will be great for our day\" Carla said as she put on a pair of runners herself. Once she was done we left for the mall. It was a quick five minute drive there, and we were able to get a decent parking spot. Once we got in the first store, it was a field day for Carla. She recommended that we start with tops, and I didn't object. I don't know how, but she managed to find a lot of tops that I was ok with wearing, that I wouldn't have looked at without some help. Sure, there was stuff I said no way to, but for the most part everything she had suggested I at least tried on and most of it I liked enough to end up buying. She even got me trying on bras, but a lot of the ones we ended up buying were sports bras. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we had been trying on tops (and bras) for close to a two and a half hours in several stores, I said \"I think we have enough for now\". I looked at all the bags as did Carla. There had to be at least fifteen bags all filled with tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your right. Let's put these in moms van\" she said. She hurried me out of the mall and to the car. Even with all the back seats folded down, the van was almost half full. \"Alright, now for the bottoms\" she said. It was impossible not to hear the excitement in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here is where I will be drawing the line. No dresses, skirts, or super skinny jeans\" I told her as we walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you at least try on a skirt. You might be surprised and like it. But I can promise nothing super skinny, or super short. Just short\" she said. \"Oh, but you will need something for like church and when you need to give a presentation at school. That may be to only time you wear a dress or skirt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" I said. And we were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we made it back inside, we started looking for pants. Carla had my try on tons of jeans, from different colors to different sizes. What I mean is some were skinnier that others. We ended up with fifteen different pairs of jeans, no two were the same. We also had eighteen different pairs of shorts, from jean shorts to workout shorts. Then Carla took me to another area of clothing stores I had never been to. The section with skirts. She went and had me wait in a changing booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here, I'll find one for you to try\" Carla said as she closed the door and left me. I started to wonder what she was going to get me, but pretty soon she was back and handed me a black skirt that came down to my knees ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://m.lulus.com/products/121674\" target=\"_blank\">https://m.lulus.com/products/121674</a> ). Putting it on, I was surprised when I actually liked it. It was a different feeling from what I was used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that looks better on you than I thought it would\" Carla said. \"Spin around, let me see how it looks from the back\" she ordered. I did as she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we can get just this one\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your no fun\" she said sarcastically. \"Come on, there's lots more to at least look at. I won't make you try them on unless you want to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess there's no harm in just looking\" I replied. I looked at a clock and it read 4:10. \"How have we been here for five hours already. I mean, it's felt like a long time but not five hours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a girl thing. I've spent twelve hours here one time with my friends and we didn't even go to every store\" Carla said. \"This should be plenty of clothes. Do you want to go home or start looking at shoes? If we don't do it today, we'll need to come back tomorrow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mouth dropped when she said we would be coming back. \"What's wrong with the shoes I've already bought?\" I asked gesturing to my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those were just to get by\" Carla answered. \"A girl needs plenty of shoes for every occasion\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then let's go put these bags in the car and get started. I'm starting to remember why I never would go shopping with you and mom\" I said as we began walking to the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be surprised. This is a ton of fun once you get the hang of it\" Carla replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we put the bags of pants, shorts, and a few skirts and a dress or two (I really don't remember because the day was starting to blur into one big memory for me) in the car we moved it closer to the mall. When we walked into the shoe store, I quickly realized why we were in this one. It was Carla's favorite store in the whole mall. From what I had heard, the store was divided  into four different sections. The categories are Casual, Sandals, Boots, and Athletic. And there was a lot of each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start you off in the casual. We can find your size and then I'll let you find all the shoes you like\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not helping anymore?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoes are different than clothes. In my opinion, you have to pick yourself. If someone else picks for you, there is no telling how long we will be here\" she answered while sitting down in a chair. It made sense to me, but she is starting to get tired like me, so I can give her a rest. Looking through the shelves filled with different shoes, I ended up picking three pairs that I liked. There was a pair of boat shoes ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC1200053-5116011/Sperry+Top-Sider/Linen_Oat/Womens+Angelfish.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC120...</a> ), a pair of grey converse's, and some slippers ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC1093868-5064512/UGG/Espresso/Womens+Cozy+II+Slipper.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC109...</a> ). I brought these to Carla and she approved them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the shoes down, I headed over to the sandal section. There was so meany to look at but I finally picked a pair of flip flops ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC1381952-5225666/Reef/Grey_Green/Womens+Harmony.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC138...</a> ), a pair of reeboks ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC1339809-5193668/Reebok/Black_White/Womens+ZigNano+Slide+II.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC133...</a> ), and another pair that it seemed like lots of girls at my school would wear ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/ec1358494-5139731/MICHAEL+MICHAEL+KORS/Optic+White+Leather/Womens+MK+Plate+Thong.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/ec135...</a>) and took them for Carla to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say anything\" she answered. \"Now, off to the boots\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a tad bit scared at first, but I figured the best way to get over that fear was to try something on. I tried a pair of knee high boots first because that was another common sight with girls at my school. I ended up liking the first pair ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/ec1366376-5207634/Madden+Girl/Brown/Womens+Legacie.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/ec136...</a> ) so much I picked out a second ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC1329808-5187639/Kensie/Cognac+Leather/Womens+Neverland.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC132...</a> ) and something to keep my feet smaller during the winter months ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC1329808-5187639/Kensie/Cognac+Leather/Womens+Neverland.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC132...</a> ). I brought them to Carla and went to the last section before she could say anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last section was athletic shoes. This, of course, was the most conferrable section. I was still uneasy because it was girls shoes that I was buying after all and I had spent my whole life up until this point a guy. But I pressed on. I picked out an extra pair of running shoes ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://m.kohls.com/kohlsopenapi/productmobile.html?productID=1492614\" target=\"_blank\">http://m.kohls.com/kohlsopenapi/productm...</a> ) figuring that this would be enough for today. I brought the shoes to Carla, we paid for all of them, and then we went home. When the car started, I couldn't believe it. We had spent almost six and a half hours shopping for clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*However, what I didn't know was as I was going around picking shoes, Carla had secretly deployed her friends to pick even more shoes for me. All she did was give them my new shoe size, and had the cashier hold the card for them, and I'd wake up the next morning with at least 40 pairs of shoes I'd never have chosen, from flats to heels. However, as I'd grow older and go on in the year, I would learn to be more like a girl and try as well as like the shoes they'd chosen for me. But I'd never let any of them know that.*</span></div></div>",

Get a life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly was pissed off. \"At least I don't play video games 24/7!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I don't have bloody underwear every month!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah like I can control that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad's friend Micheal walked by their fight. He hates when they fight. He wished they could just make up and at least not hate each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, shut up! You're so annoying!\" Michael was getting into the argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly and Diane stomped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God she's annoying,\" Brad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you guys have to fight all the time?! Do you know how annoying it is?\" Michael and Brad heard the bell ring. They both started to walk to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry bro she just gets on my nerves a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys need to figure it out because everyone hates it when you guys fight.\" Michael and Brad did a handshake as Brad walked off to his next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Michael walked into class, he started to talk to Gabe who sits right next to him. \"Hey Michael, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad and Kim were back at it again,\" Michael said, obviously bothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, speaking of which I think I found the solution to the problem between them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael couldn't believe what he just heard. \"You're serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe nodded, \"I'm pretty sure. Meet me after school behind Target, and I'll explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not explain now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too complicated.\" Gabe finished talking as the final bell rang for class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Michael met Gabe behind Target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man. So, what's the deal?\" Michael asked as Gabe began to shuffle through his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe began to pull something out of his backpack, \"My dad is a world class inventor. I asked him to make something that could brainwash Brad and Kim so they would stop fighting. So he built this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe pulled out a gun of some sort. It was an awkward shape, hard to describe. \"This will brainwash them to stop fighting. My dad said it should work perfectly fine, but he couldn't find anyone to test it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was in awe, \"Oh well, it'll just have to work! When should we use it?\"</span></div></div>",

They both knew where Brad and Kim live because they're all friends (except for Brad and Kim of course).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to Brad's house first. His house was a simple one story house, so it would be easy to zap him with the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, can I zap him through the window?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my dad knows how to bipass those things\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael aimed the ray gun at Brad and fired it. The blast went straight to him and hit his head. Luckily, he didn't wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it should work when he wakes up.\" Gabe explained. \"Now onto Kim's house\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim lived just 3 blocks away from Brad. She lived in a two story house, so Michael and Gabe had to climb onto the roof without making a ton of noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm in position.\" Michael aimed the gun at Kim and fired it. She also didn't wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Now let's go home and see what'll happen tomorrow!\" Michael and Gabe drove to their houses and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad felt kind of sick when he woke up. He felt like something happened last night, but couldn't put his finger on it. He looked around his room and knew right away it wasn't his room. 'Where am I?' He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up out of bed and felt a bit of weight on his chest. He looked down and saw two mounds on his chest. He started to panic as he ran to the full length mirror in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt very sick when he looked in the mirror. He saw a girl with long blonde hair, average boobs, and a cute face, but it wasn't cute to him. And if wasnt any girl. It was Kimberly! He was in Kimberly's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This can't be happening! I'm in Kim's body...\" He started to feel himself/herself. He always thought she was kind of cute and curvy, but their fights shielded all of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed her boobs. 'I've always wondered what it was like to have boobs..\" Then he grabbed the void in between his legs. 'Oh shit....' He started to tear up as he remembered his manhood was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got over that, he grabbed her butt. 'So this is what her butt feels like!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then remembered that this is weird. It's his enemy. He hated her. He hated this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn I don't know what to wear!' He thought to himself. He opened her dresser and saw many different clothes. But what should he wear?</span></div></div>",

Though this put Shawn in a rut. His parents were the only family he had. No grandparents, uncles, or aunts to speak of. Being the loving girlfriend that she was, Stella was staying over to help Shawn get through this time in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day he was waking up to a massive hangover (first time he went drinking in two weeks)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well there party boy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over to see Stella in one of his shirts as a night shirt.

It was kinda funny\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Stella was very femine looking and could be a girly girl at times, as Shawn and all of their friends put it, a man with perky boobs. Despite her size she good drink more then Shawn and not get drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I do anything stupid?\" Shawn replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing more then usual. You and Derrick has a backyard fight about something, you beer bombed and threw up 3 seconds after finishing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the normal stuff\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also said to move in with you and that you want to marry me someday.\" Stella said as Shawn looked right at her after the statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an awkward stair back and forth, Shawn replied \"Well, I mean it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you do.

The 16-year-old was just starting the second hour of an five-hour shift at Starbucks and she was already annoyed. Samantha had started working there six months ago part-time as a way to save up money for a car. Well, she wasn't saving enough money ($875) and she felt her sanity slipping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry sir, we don't make that drink here.\" The perturbed customer glared at her. \"Areeeee you sureeee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I wouldn't even know how to make an orange mocha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, missus, maybe you should get your manager.\" Samantha could feel her teeth slowly grinding themselves into dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our menu has a series of options. I can provide you with a mocha frappuccino. It's delicious.\" The customer was not having it. \"Look, I want the orang mocha frappuccino I saw in Zoolander and I want it now!\" Samantha had enough. \"THIS IS NOT ZOOLANDER AND WE DO NOT MAKE THAT DRINK, NOW ORDER SOMETHING ELSE!\" she screamed from the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her outburst, Samantha was a Starbucks barista no longer and realized that her dream of buying a car was that much farther away. The teenager, of Indian-Israeli descent, brushed her long black curly hair away from her face as she was walking home. The cold November wind was already pissing her off. She hated this time of year...the weather dropped 15 degrees ago and it started getting dark before 5:00.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was frustrated. Her mother and father was already saving money for her college education, whic meant that she had to try to buy a used car all on her own. She didn't particularly NEED the car, she just wanted it. All of her friends had one and she didn't want to feel left out. Plus, the car would represent her first steps towards independence. Samantha knew that life had big things ahead for her, she just wasn't sure what they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was walking down the street, she saw a flyer posted on a lightpole:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>UNIVERSITY OF DUVENT GENDER STUDY</b><br>\r\nLOOKING FOR ALL WILLING PARTICIPANTS<br>\r\nSIX-MONTH STUDY, PAYS $15,000 IF COMPLETED <br>\r\nLEARN WHAT IT REALLY MEANS TO BE A MAN OR WOMAN<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was gobsmacked. $15,000?!?!!? That would be enough to get her a new car and then some. The university was 15 minutes walking from her house. She reversed direction and started sprinting towards the university.campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes of walking and another 10 minutes of looking, Samantha had finally found the research center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the receptionist area, Samantha blurted \"um, I'm here to get more info about the gender study.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, you're quite young...I'm not sure if Dr. Creight has an age limit for this.\" the receptionist pondered. \"Well, fill this paperwork out and go ahead and take a seat, he'll be with you shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha sat down. She looked over the papers, asking general information and some weird psychology questions such as \"What do you consider your most appealing trait\" and \"Do you ever feel obligated to make certain choices?\" After filling out the questionnaire, she waited for what seemed like an eternity, before hearing an old man's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha?\" the old man asked. \"Hi, I'm Dr. Alex Creight. Why don't you follow me into my office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was intimidated from the outset. The 58-year-old professor stood a foot over her 5\"4 frame, and had the look of a man who had been doing this for a very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen plopped into the chair opposite Creight's desk. He looked at her for minute, collected his thoughts and began:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gender is a concept that has existed for quite a long time, and yet, in the last 30 plus years, we have really started to ask ourselves \"what does gender actually mean\"? For the longest time, we had it conflated with biological sex; if you're born with a penis and testes, you're a man, and if you have ovaries and a vagina, you're a woman. However, we've come to see through not just transgender people but straight and queer people, that gender identity is a wholly separate concept from biological sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha wondered where this conversation was heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that being said, the conflation exists in many people's minds still. So, the University of Duvent and a molecular biology institute decided to pair up for a study that asks a simple question; what, exactly, makes a man and a woman a woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was confused. \"Sooooo.....what are you paying people 15k for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Creight laughed. \"This is not a typical study. This requires an effort, a sacrifice. If you decide to follow through on this study, you will be required to transform. Samantha, you will look like a 16-year-old biological male and have the reproductive parts of a 16-year-old male. For six months, you will live as a teen boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to fully process what was just said to her, Samantha stared at the professor with her jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Creight explained the experiment further. The institute had provided machinery and chemicals that could change a person at the molecular level. The person who underwent the transformation would go back into their normal environment. They would write weekly diaries about their experiences in their new body, how they feel, how people treat them, and how it's altered the way they think/act. After the six-month period, the participants would be changed back into their original bodies and be required to follow up with diaries three months after that. For Samantha, she would start in January, after winter break, and end in June.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This study will provide a never-before-seen view into just how much a person's body shapes their self-image and their interactions with the rest of the world. Your experience, especially given how young you are, would provide insight into how early these notions are born and reinforced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a billion thoughts going through Samantha's head, and about 99% of them amounted to \"why are you even considering this, it's insane!\". And it was. She was an attractive 16-year-old with friends, a boyfriend, and a good amount of self-confidence. Would she toss all that away for money? Yet....it was a lot of money. It would help her, her family, and her future. There was also the possibility that this experience would help her grow as an individual, make her more of a well-rounded person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever she decided, it wasn't going to be today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sounds very interesting, and I'm super tempted, obviously, but I need time to think. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Creight nodded. \"That's okay. This is a big life change; it shouldn't be done in haste and without a lot of thought. However, we're going to move forward with the study soon, so I need to have a definitive answer from you two weeks from now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha got up to leave. \"You will\". As she was walking out the door, Dr. Creight stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing...as a minor, I will need both of your parent's consent to conduct this study on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes. $15,000 didn't seem like it would be worth all this effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
