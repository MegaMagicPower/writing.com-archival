Not to mention I would still need to be able to train and get used to doing sumo at that weight and I need time to work my muscles enough so I can support that weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Ben we have a solution\". Kenshin pulled out a bottle with red pills, \"these pills with greatly slow down your metabolims and triple the amount of calories in the food you eat. Not only that it make you able to put on lots of muscles quickly without losing fat. This will ensure that you gain enough weight before filming and the muscles to support the weight, and since there's so little crime now we will increase the number of visits and the length of the sessions so you can improve you sumo skills at a greater weight\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Ben a moment to proccess what he was just told, \"so these pills will make me put on weight faster and make it easier to gain muscle mass?\", Kenshin nodded, \"so will there be any side affects when I take these pills?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but just two your appetite will greatly increase and you will able to eat more then you could before. And you will have to take one pill a day in the morning starting tomorrow, do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, ok\", Ben takes the pills and puts them in his bag and getts back to the sparing match and finishes his session for the day. And heads home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next month Ben10K takes the pills and they start to work immediately, Bens appetite increases dramatically and stops at Leo's Burgers more and more and his orders get bigger and bigger, and he startes to gain weight a rapid pace. And as told his sessions become more frequent, longer, and intense, and starts to train in his bulked up alien forms for the movie, and due to that becomes a highly skilled in sumo and his muscles grew even stronger to accomodate the weight (even though they can't be seen under the flab). And finally Ben is in his last session before he starts filming, Ben just finished his last sparring match of the day and went over to Kenshin to get his final weight measurements, he steps on the scale and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Apparently in the movie he would make two companions played by the Cannonbolt and the Shocksquach, while the Kickin Hawk and Humungousaur were the main henchmen for the villan Kenko the shapeshifter played by a Slushpuppie or \"mud man\" because thier race can shapeshift their forms like the villan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen their were other people who played smaller roles and extras for the scenes but most of the actors human and alien had gained and trained like Ben had, but none of them were close to being as big as Ben. The biggest (behine Ben of course) was 450lbs, followed by others of various weights and sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen got to then work on his lines with the other actors to better memorize his lines and how he should act and say them when filming, and was instructed on his blocking during the scene and went through practicing on the set before they filmed. And the director had made a call to have some galvin's from Plumber's HQ to change the omnitrix so when Ben goes alien for a scene his alien form would be wearing a mawashi (kinda like how some of his aliens are wearing clothes when he turns into them), and of course they send Blukic and Driba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen is laying on the exam table when Blukic and Driba come in and hop up to the computer to start the process, Blukic looks over at Ben and says \"hey ben what's up, there's something different about you but I cant put my figure it out, umm... new hair cut mabey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Ben says, \"umm... new clothes?\" says Bluckic, \"Close\" Ben says as he pats his giagantic belly making it jiggle all over<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give up tell me\" says Blukic losing paticence, \" I am 5x bigger than when you last saw me and I weigh 700lbs\" and Ben shakes his belly for emphasis<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blukic I told you on the way over about how Ben was gaining weight for a movie role, thats why were here to alter the omnitrix to have his alien forms wearing sumo belts\" says Driba still typing on the computer, \"ohh sorry I forgot about that, but just look at how big he got\" Blukic says as he hops down and starts to jump up and down on Ben's belly sending fat rippling all along his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blukic stop playing around and get back to work\", then Driba looks away from the computer getting his first look at Ben since he started to gain weight \"Whoa, you did get big , I knew you were going to be bigger but not this much\", \"Yeah I know but I got used to all this extra girth, but it's worth it to be the star in one of my favorite movies\" Ben says as he rubs his gut. \"Hey could you guys hurry up I got to get back to the set to rehearse some more before filming starts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry were almost done\" says Driba<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlukic and Driba finish up and tell ben that he can switch on the Mawashi mode by saying \"It's sumo time\" before you use the omnitrix, and too turn off you say \"It's hero time\" and then they left and Ben heavted him self up off the examination table and headed to the set to finish up rehearsal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days pass and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's the first day of filming and Ben 10,000 is in his trailer getting ready by getting his makeup done and putting on his costume (which in the first scene is Ben wearing his sumo belt with a white robe and sash covering it), and having his 2nd pre lunch \"snack\" (which is a full meal to any normal person). But there was a slight problem, Ben's sumo belt was a bit snug and was difficult to put on which was weird because it was made custom fit the day he got here. It took 15 minutes with the help of an assistant to finally push the sumo belt over his gigantic gut, and still then is clung to him squeezing him making his love handles bulge and made his belly seem bigger which Ben thought was ok because his character is a sumo wrestler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen after getting ready left his trailer and headed for the movie set, and even though he had been here for the past couple days he still drew the stares of almost everyone as he walked by, but its to be expected because of how big he was, his belly stuck out 3ft in front of him and despite its size it didn't sag it was just suspended in air and with every movement it would bounce and jiggle as if his belly was filled with jello. And that was not the only thing that grabbed peoples attention there was also his tree trunk thighs which were permanently pushing against each other from the fat and his massive rear end, his rear was big enough to fill a park bench and they looked light two big beach balls that would wobble and bounce with every step. But lately Ben got used to the stares and just made his way to the set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ben arrived the set had been set up and it was what looked like a sumo dojo. Because the setting of the story is that Ben's character had been the Sumo Champion of the World,but he then lost his title and retired and opened up a sumo dojo and instead taught sumo wrestling, and in the first scene Ben is in a sparring match with one of his students when his old sensei visits and tells him that there is a villain that plans to take over the world and that the only way the villain can do that is win the grand prize in the Galactic Sumo Slammers tournament and that Ben is the only one who can stop the villain. But Ben refuses and his sensei leaves telling him to think about it and that if he decides to enter he would need what is inside the box the Ben's sensei left for him.<br>\r\nSo Ben goes over to the set and they start to film, starting with Ben leading his mooring sumo stretches when one student blurts out \" Sensei, I challenge you to a match\", <br>\r\n\"Not right now, I'm am in the middle of morning stretching\" Said Ben, \"Are you saying that your scared to face me sensei\" Said the Student, and that comment caused the other students to start murmuring.\" Fine then you want to face me\" Ben says taking of his robe to reveal him in his green sumo belt, \"Then lets go\".<br>\r\nThen Ben makes his way over to the ring and so does the student who challenged him who's name was Jacob, Jacob was moderately smaller then Ben and was only 17 with a height of 6ft and a weight of 410lbs, while Ben sensei was 7ft and weight over 700lbs. So the match began as Ben threw salt over the ring and raised his foot and stomped it to the ground causing his whole body to shake and bounce (especially his belly)and Jacob did the same and then they charged at each other and met in the middle hitting each other at full force their bellies squishing against each other as they tried to push one another out of the ring. And as expected Ben easily pushed Jacob out of the ring and he landed with a thud. \"Good job Jacob you lasted 5 seconds longer than last time, remember to improve your skills and one day you might be able to best your sensei\" said Ben. Then the director yelled \"CUT!\", he then walked over to the set and said \"Good job Ben you did great, but ... and the director then explained what he thinks would improve the scene. Then Ben and the rest of the cast had to redo the scene repeatedly starting and stoping in places to make improvements, and by the afternoon they finished filming the first scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after words Ben was exhausted he had to do the sumo match over and over and was covered with sweat so after he went to his trailer and changed he decided to walk back to his hotel which convenlently was right out side the studio. And Ben's room was on the top floor and he got the Royal Kings Suit and the place was huge, he had a big living room with a big flatscreen tv and a couch that could fit multiple people or a few and Ben, the kitchen was state of the art and in it was a huge fridge packed full of Ben's favorite food, which he will defiantly visit later. His bedroom also had a flatscreen in it with a bed that was could have fit 15 people on it but it was perfect size for Ben and next to it was a mini fridge that was filled with all kinds of sweets and drinks for him. And Ben's bathroom to accommodate him had been modified to fit his needs, the shower was wide enough to fit him and the bath tub looked like what you would find at a local Japanese bath house, it was the only type of bath Ben could fully relax in. So Ben started his shower and washed all of the sweat off and cleaned him self which was difficult because he could not reach certain areas due to his bulk but he managed. Then after his shower Ben decided it was time for dinner and he cleaned out the fridge and ate it all as if it were a normal quantity, he then changed into his PJs which clung to his curves and laid in his bed watching the tv munching on what the mini fridge had in stock and finally went to bed thinking that this was only the first day and that there were many to come after it but he also thought he could get used to living here as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seth agreed and began planning the scenario. Meanwhile Ben was busy eating out his fridge again. fortunately the fridge was made with technology that causes it to replenish itself whenever closed. Yet all of Ben's eating has been adding up on his 700+ frame. The director didn't mind since it made it seemed natural that he would get bigger when filming.

When Ben opened the door he saw the assistant director standing at his doorstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Miss Stunship, is there anything you need help with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The director needs you to gain more weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gain more weight?

When should I start?\" Ben asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Immediately, for your next scene after today you must weigh 850 lbs. In that scene you meet a galactic ninja girl who traveled far and wide. Today's scene will depict you deciding to heed your the words of your old sensei. You discover that you must prepare for the tournament as you see the minimum entry weight. After that you'll literally be eating on set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... If that what the movie calls for than I must do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for understanding Mr.10K. We'll be sure to give you a few extra fridges and a larger room. See you at 13:00.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the assistant director left Ben greedily gobbled down all the food in both fridges.

Because over the past week the studio had been shooting his weight gain montage which included Ben to eat, and train on camera,and they had just finished shooting the montage when the director Seth came to the set and called Ben over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Ben good job today on set, and I just wanted to inform you that your almost done gaining weight because the next scene we shoot will be at the end of the weight gain montage in which we see the results of your training and to show that you will have to weigh at least half a ton or more by that time and this should not surprise you because my assistant director already told you about this, correct?\" said Seth, \"Yes she did\" said Ben, \"Good, so you will have the weekend to meet your weight requirement while we shoot some scenes your not in\" said Seth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now it's Saturday morning and the night before Ben gorged him self as much as he could hoping to gain as much weight as possible and Ben is pleased that the clothes he got last night are already tight on him. Meeting the requirement will be a snap for Ben due to his diet recently his metabolism is almost nonexistent and Ben planed to make the most out of the weekend by eating as much as possible, and Ben would enjoy the experience because he liked how he felt when his belly was full of food and he also liked the fact that he would get heavier. Ben thought he looked good with some meat on him, being so much bigger than everyone else made him feel powerful and manly. So Ben cleaned out both his fridges and ordered everything on the room service menu thinking this will make a nice snack.</span></div></div>",

Ben's broad shoulders went a bit past the edges that the mirror could reflect, but they were strong and flabby. His head fattened due to his weight gain had several chins, but his beard gave them some definition and his neck bunched up from the girth that it bore. His chest had grown huge and flabby with giant pecs that swayed as he moved. Despite their girth Ben could still flex his huge pecs due to the enlarged muscles hidden under his flab.

Ben then spots a camera crew waiting over by the wall with Ben's Sumo outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome Mr.10,000 to \"The Beya\" I'm glad you made it\" Said Seth, \"Wait, what's going on here? I thought this was a factory, and what about the rift?\" Said Ben. \"Oh no need to worry Ben the rift has been taken care of, we just needed a reason to get you here. You see this is a new Sumo themed restaurant that is sponsored by the Sumo Slammers Movie, and this restaurant will also double as a new Sumo Stable or A Beya, hence the name. This is so anyone who wants to start Sumo can come here and learn.\" Said Seth, \"Well that is great\" Said Ben \"But why do you need me?\". \"Because this is where we will shoot your next scene, and you will cut the ribbon at the grand opening tonight and be the very first customer. And this will also direct attention to the upcoming movie.\" Said Seth, \"So nothing is wrong and all I need to do is the scene and eat dinner here, that sounds alright to me, when do we start.\" Said Ben, \"Right away\" Said Seth \"But one more thing after the shooting is done we will have some photographers here to take pictures of you in your costume, then I have hired you a custom taylor who will take your measurements and make you a suit for tonights grand opening. And I will keep the taylor around because we will have more meetings and interviews and events later on as the filming comes to an end, and do to your diet it would be best to have the taylor make bigger suits for you later on\". And with that Ben went to go change into his costume and shoot the next scene for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on after Ben finished doing his scene the photographers came and had Ben put his costume on, then they took Ben over to the Sumo Stable behind the restaurant. First they just had Ben stand still while they shot him from different angles such as from the front, side, and back, then they had Ben start posing first they had him go down into his sumo stance so he squared low to the ground with his belly just barely scrapping the ground while his humongous butt stuck out in the air, Ben then started to do different kinds of poses. He felt embarrassed as the photographers took his picture but he knew it was for the film so he went along, and after about an hour the photographers left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was for Ben to get his measurements from his taylor, but what Ben saw was a whole team of taylor's ready with measuring tapes. It took a team of 3 taylor's to measure around Ben's belly and even with a special long measuring tape it was still all used up while it dug in to Ben's soft flesh, then Ben had his arms and legs measured, then his chest which looked like were D-cups. And then the taylor's left to go make Ben's suit for tonight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was time, Ben was in his new black suit which fit him like a glove (But Ben was thinking not for long because of Ben's appetite), Ben stood next to the doors next to Seth the director and there were fans and paparazzi everywhere all trying to get a look Ben's new size, after a speech Ben was given a pair of giant scissors and cut the ribbon opening the restaurant. Ben then went inside and sat at a special booth made for people his size, Ben then saw the menu and noted how there was a special Sumo section in the menu that served chankonabe and other dishes which had huge portion sizes. And Ben ordered his food and ate and enjoyed him self for the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came and Ben had just gotten home a tad drunk and his stomach swollen caused his shirt to rise revealing some of his underbelly. Ben was really exhausted he took off his suit and went to bed in his underwear, then later that day Ben woke up to a phone call on his bedside phone, so he reached for the phone still half asleep and answered. It was Seth saying that Ben had the next day off because they were going to start editing the film, and Seth had one last thing to say and that was to congradulate Ben because they only have a week of filming left and the movie would be done, and Seth also said that Friday they would shoot the last scene and by that time Ben had to weigh...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the past week in order to reach Ben's final weight goal he had been binging himself as Rath so he could eat more and he had been given Thursday off to prepare for the final shoot Friday so he spent the entire day as Rath eating what ever he could get. Then there was a red flashes coming from the omnitrix symbol on Rath's chest and then Ben turned back into his human form which woke him up from his food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Ben had been gaining weight constantly for the film he had been given very stretchy clothes that would keep fitting him as he grew, but his clothes were now being stretched to its limits and they clung to his body tightly cutting into his flab and looked as if they might burst at any second. Ben groaned as he woke up and failed multiple times trying to get up right but eventually he got up after 15 minutes, \"I really need to hit the gym or soon I won't be able to get up anymore, but hopefully I won't need to gain anymore weight\". Ben then walked over to his bathroom which he now had to squeeze through and stepped on the scale waiting to hear his new weight, after a couple of seconds the scale said that Ben now weighed 1545 lbs and that meant Ben had done it and he would no longer have to worry about if he weighed enough, but he also thought  that he had gained 45 lbs of extra weight meaning that Rath had over done things again and hat he would no longer use Rath to binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then decided to start getting ready for the shoot so he went to go shower that had automatic helpers installed to reach areas Ben could no longer reach and spent a good deal of time squeezing into his clothes and had his 3-course breakfast. And afterwards Ben headed for the studio to film the final scene and then he would finally be done with the movie. When Ben arrived at the studio he went into his trailer to get ready and into his costume which was his sumo mawashi and a robe that he would wear over it, in the final scene it is just after he defeated the bad guys and saved to world and things start to settle back into place but Ben's character had decided to still teach but also to compete again being supported by his students and his love interest in the movie who his character is engaged with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen leaves the trailer and goes to film the scene and it goes off without a hitch and they film it on the first try and after the word CUT was yelled everyone started to celebrate the end of the filming, later that night there was a party for the crew and cast members and Ben was stuffing his face at the food bar when the director Seth pulled Ben over to the side. \" Ben I can not thankyou enough for what you've done for us you are the most committed actor I have ever seen because who else would gain over 1500 lbs for a movie\", Ben then started to blush a little and said \" It's ok it was nothing really plus I liked gaining all this weight because I could eat as much as I want and being like this makes me feel more powerful and manly than before I did the movie\", \"Thats great to hear Ben, because I have a proposition for you\" Said Seth. \"What is it\" Said Ben, then Seth told Ben that he wanted him to ...</span></div></div>",

After about a couple minutes of struggle with the help of Kevin, Ben got unstuck and entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that\" said Ben, \"Lets get started then because I need to be somewhere soon and need to hurry\". \"Oh\" said Kevin with a grin, \"You mean your \"date\" with your co-star\" said Kevin making Ben blush. \"Its not like that that\" said Ben, \"its only a training session\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok boys, if we could get to business please\" said Gwen impatiently, \"So here what we know so far, Xana recently stole a new satellite with an advanced on it.

Gwen then chanted some strange words and a light appeared around Ben and he then found him self outside the white house. Ben then rushed over to Carlina's place so he would not be late, when Ben reached Carlina's house it was what he expected, a huge nice house for a movie star. Ben headed up the stair which he did not like and knocked on the door, and it opened revealing Carlina in a workout outfit, and Ben realized he was still in his regular clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in\" Said Carlina, \"Im glad you could come today Ben\" said Carlina as she lead Ben through her house. In the West Wing Ben was lead into a full workout room with every kind of equipment imaginable, even alien workout equipment. Ben also noticed there were doors that lead to showers and dressing rooms and in the far side of the room a fully stocked gourmet kitchen, \" Hey Carlina I'm sorry but I forgot to bring workout clothes\" Said Ben embarrassed. \"Don't worry just in case I got some workout clothes specially made for you, they are in the dressing room\" Said Carlina. \"Wow\" Said Ben, \"Thanks for that, ok I will be just a couple minutes\". Ben went to the dressing room and saw that Carlina wasn't kidding, there was more than just a workout clothes there were all kinds of sports clothes all Ben size. From football clothes to wrestling singlets, and even a sumo belt, Ben decided to just stick with normal workout clothes. Ben now days had more trouble putting on pants as he tried to reach over his belly but after a minute he got the shorts on, and Ben put on his shirt which hugged his belly tightly, then again all Ben's clothes did, no matter what size.

I was informed that I would need another co-star and I was just wondering if you would like to be my second co-star.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what you wanted to ask. I'm busy right now, but I should be available later sometime tonight. If I don't get back to you by then expect a call within a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin then hangs up the phone. Ben also hangs up his phone and goes about his day as usual. Over the last few days Ben has managed to gain some more weight. He currently weighs 1825 lbs. due to his rigorous training and his humongous appetite. He has also gained some slight muscle definition that is hidden beneath his fat.

I was a bit busy looking into the whole Xana situation. Unfortunately her whereabouts are still unknown. I'm sure that you're not having as much luck either. I noticed that you challenged Xana on national TV a day ago. After talking it over with Gwen we agreed that by helping you with the show it may help us track down Xana. See you in a couple of months.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was excited about the answer. Before eating he calls Seth Manatok to tell him of his pick.

After seeing no results Ben proceeds to eat dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo months later it was time to shoot the first episode. Ben had managed to bulk up to 2100 lbs.

Once inside Ben lead Kevin over to an elevator so they could head up stairs, but Kevin stopped looking worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh Ben...I don't think that can support us\" said Kevin, \"Don't worry\" said Ben, \"Its a freight elevator meant to lift thousands of pounds, so it should be good to use for a couple of months\". \"Ok if your sure\" said Kevin not convinced. Ben had not considered having more than one \"large\" person other than himself in the elevator so there was little to no space after Kevin stepped in causing the elevator to creek. The elevator door just barely closed as it slowly began to rise, Ben was wishing the elvator moved faster because it was a very tight squeeze with both him and Kevin inside, Both of their bellies were squished against each other and was being pushed up into their faces, Ben was kind of enjoying the feeling of his fat being squished against himself, Kevin on the other hand was not enjoying it as much wishing the elevator would open soon. After what felt like an eternity the elevator reached Ben's room, which was more like a deluxe penthouse, it took a while for them to squeeze out of the elevator but they eventually got out. After all that struggle Ben felt hungry and went to his kitchen to get a \"snack\", Kevin also felt hungry and decided to join Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ben and Kevin finished their snack, Kevin lumbered over to a sofa and seated himself with a large boom, luckily Ben had specially reinforced furniture. Ben reminded Kevin that they were here to get bigger clothes, Kevin groaned as he slowly tried to stand back up heaving his large body forward trying to get enough momentum. Ben went over to his closet and opened it revealing his large wardrobe and next to it some kind of sowing machine. Ben noticing Kevin's curious look began to explain what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a special sowing machine that makes clothes for me whenever I need new ones. Seth got me this after he saw the bill he got after buying me new clothes, so he just gave this to me and it can make any piece of clothing imaginable at any size\". Ben pressed a button activating the sowing machine and it began to hum as it powered up, Ben told Kevin to stand in front of it and then a camera on the sowing machine scanned Kevin taking his measurements and began to make clothes several sizes larger than he was and after about 5 minutes Kevin had 3 new set of clothes each larger than the last. Next Ben did the same thing and got his new clothes,\"This should last us a while\" said Ben. Kevin was impressed and was thinking about asking for one of these from Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok now that we got our clothes its time to eat\" said Ben with a grin on his face, \"So where do you want to go? I'll let you choose\" said Ben<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we go to...\"said Kevin</span></div></div>",

Kevin noticing how tight their clothes were and how much their bellies were showing said \"Hey don't you think we should change into bigger clothes before we leave. Isn't that why we got them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are for later, trust me plenty of people will see you in a lot less than what your wearing so you just have to get used to showing off your body in public, I did\" said Ben as he stepped out the doors and was greeted by a mob of fans wanting autographs and wanting to touch his belly.

It was 5 days before the deadline and Ben and Kevin were weighing themselves to see the progress, an automated beep indicated they were done being weighed and a electronic voice said BEN TENNISON 2340lbs, WEIGHT GAIN OF 240lbs. KEVIN LEVIN 2160lbs, WEIGHT GAIN OF 460lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin! Have you been taking those weight gain pills again\"? Ben said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah so what, I put on a little more weight than you, your still bigger so were good\" said Kevin not really concerend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you forgotten what Seth said? I need to be 500lbs heavier than you and right now I'm less than 200, and we only have 5 days, if Seth finds out I don't know what will happen\" said Ben worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, crap sorry man I forgot... Wait we have 5 days, just use the pills and you'll be good\" said Kevin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they only do so much and if I'm to gain enough I have to be eating constantly and...oh great I have to be him again don't I? said Ben<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who now?\" asked Kevin confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm to meet weight requirement in time I'm going to have to be bingeing the entire time and the only one who can do that is Rath\" said Ben<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ok whats the problem with that?\" asked Kevin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well first he's gonna be mad that you got to fat. Second he has no control so if he runs out of food he will get super mad. Third he doesn't know when to stop\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey its good Ben I can deal with Rath, if its what you need to do, just do it\" said Kevin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kevin went and bought as much food as he could get and ordered multiple shipments of food to arrive over the next 5 days, and Ben set up the omnitrix to not time out for 5 days.

Ben was still unclear about what Sarth meant so he decided to ask Sarth more questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sarth do you have a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. What do you want to ask, Ben?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you mean that people on earth are evolving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that some clarification concerning our previous conversation is needed. It might be better if I explained the origin of my people. A long time ago when your planet was still young highly advanced aliens decided to take a good portion of the human race. These aliens then placed these early humans on various planets. Ten people were placed on each planet. The humans that were placed on my home planet are my ancestors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I mentioned before a fattening substance caused my sub-species to evolve in a way where fat is beneficial. Of course not all things were hunky dory. Many of the wildlife on the planet mistook my ancestors as food due to their small size, but as they got fatter and stronger things changed. By the time my ancestors reached my size they already trained most of the wildlife to be pets. From there my people have been growing like no tomorrow. We even had to enlarge the planet recently due to an increase in everyone's weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was dumbfounded by what he heard. If Sarth was truly a subspecies of humanity then there must be more hidden origins about humanity that have yet to still be discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if you're a sub-species of humanity does that also explain why you have orange skin and wings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarth chuckles at Ben's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My skin tone and wings are a mutation among my species. Only a small percentage of Homogirthsapiens experience any mutation. Not all of my people are compatible with the Beastialorn Flower. I don't think that humans are compatible either, but time will tell. It's been nice talking to you Ben.

Within moments Sarth opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben, how may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I finally decided to join the Universal Sumo League.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome. Let me give you a pamphlet. The pamphlet has vital information that should be be useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarth then sends Ben a text containing a link to the Universal Sumo League pamphlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sarth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome Ben.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then heads home, works out, and then has a meal. During the meal Ben read over the pamphlet. In the Pamphlet Ben saw that the next tournament is with in three months. He then saw that the Universal Sumo League had a minimum weight requirement. However, with Ben weighing 3025 lbs. he had a long way to go. According to the pamphlet Ben must weigh</span></div></div>",

Ben also found a note inside the box that read <i>Hey Ben by now you probably have seen the weight requirement to join the tournament and  know that you have a ways to go before your ready. Thats why I sent you this package to help you, inside is drinks that are made with concentrated Grithroot which is that plant on our homeworld that made us grow so large, with it you should be able to gain a lot more weight.

It was also good that he was done filming for the season which freed up his time even more. Now Ben's new goal is to workout so he could get stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today is the day where I increase my workout regimen. Maintaining this size shouldn't be difficult. If I can gain more weight by increasing my muscle mass I should have an advantage. Now that I think about it there is a massive gym at the Nebula Express. I think Sarth said he goes there to train. It's no surprise since he's roughly my size, yet maybe a bit bigger though. Who knew his time on earth would cause him to gain a lot of weight. Yet again Girthmans do have three stomachs so that isn't a surprise. Also if I work out at the gym I can get the Girthman Special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then heads over to the Nebula Express. Once there he heads to the gym. After he walks into the gym he's amazed by how massive it is. Various weights and exercise machines decorated the gym. He also noticed that several Girthmans and other patrons were enjoying the Girthman special buffet. He was also impressed by how ripped some of the larger Girthmans were. These Girthmans had a lot of muscle definition under their flab as Ben noticed how their bodies rippled with an almost equal amount of muscle and flab. He was even shocked to see a few Girthmans sport visible abs on their large stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang. That's impressive. I guess when it comes to physiology Girthmans appear more different than I thought. They may resemble humans, but it's clear that they are different on a physiological level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then proceeds to workout and train. After training Ben helped himself to a Girthman Special. Ben kept up this routine for a month. One month later...</span></div></div>",

Lower ranking wrestlers are expected to prepare meals for the higher ranking wrestlers. Once you gain a high enough rank you won't be expected to cook as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense. Just like sumo wrestling on earth seniority determines the pecking order.\" Ben replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. I can see that Xorn, my eldest son, has been hard at work. Ever since he married Illiania he's been rated as the best sumo on the planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then sees the same blue Girthman from the picture that Sarth had shown him before. Ben was shocked to see that Xorn was ten times bigger than he was in the photo. Ben watched in awe as Xorn effortlessly consumed a meal that would feed 20 wrestlers in one sitting and how he used his thick tail to pick a napkin to wipe of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a good meal. I'll take a nap and then I have a class I have to teach. Hmm? What do we got here? Hey, mom is that the new wrestler from Earth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is Ben Tennyson, also known as Ben 10,000.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. The name's Xorn. I'll see ya in class tomorrow.

The Board members can't decide whether Xorn's weight is the max weight, both officially and unofficially, or whether he and other wrestlers should be the start of a new Mega Heavy Weight Class.

It's time to join your fellow wrestlers who have passed my test. The four of you will have first dibs on the food since you'll be competing. Also, the higher ranked wrestlers should have finished their meal by now,\" Cruskor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Ben said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. Just try your best in the tournament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Cruskor head to the dining area. Once there Ben sees that the tables are piled high with several dishes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the day of the tournament, Ben had spent all last night gorging on food trying to pack on any extra weight he could in preparation. Ben's weight class would compete first because they were the lightest, and then the other weight classes would go in the same order lightest to heaviest, but this meant Ben had little time to practice with all last night taken up by eating and sleeping. Ben was in the waiting room with the others who were competing in the tournament, he looked around at the competition trying to gauge how tough the tournament would be. While Ben wasn't the smallest among them he was by no means the biggest, he landed somewhere in the middle when it came to size. If Ben got paired up against someone bigger than him, which was a fair possibility, he would need to rely on strategy and technique if he's going win. And winning was impressive if he was going to get anywhere, he wanted to impress everyone including Sarth who got him into this in the first place. As Ben was thinking the the tv in the room was turned on, the opening ceremony had started. On the screen was the Galactic Sumo Council, Ben wasn't surprised to see that most of them were native girthmen and that they all were easily Super Heavyweight Class, Ben took notice that Xorn was seated among them which surprised Ben considering his wife gave birth only yesterday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXorn then stood up and began speaking, \"Ladies and Girthmen, Its that time again for the Galactic Sumo Tournament. A time for those training with us aspiring to make a name for them self as professional sumo wrestlers get a chance to show their skills and make their way up the ranks and for some to graduate to the next weight class. As always we will start with the Lightweights and make our way up to Super Heavyweights, I wish you all the best of luck\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXorn sat back down as the audience cheered and the tournament was underway. Ben and the others all lined up and were taken to the ring where they were presented to the crowd and cheers filled the air. There was a jumbo screen on the far wall with pictures of all the wresters, then with the press of a button the matches were chosen at random. Ben saw that he was the first match and was paired up against a Girthman named Tallio, and he was one of the 3 others who passed Cruskor's test. He was slightly taller than Ben but had at least 200lbs on him, he had blue skin like Xorn except his was darker like a deep ocean blue and had white hair. His biggest aspect was his vast belly which easily held the majority of the weight, its because of that he lasted a full 20 seconds against Cruskor. Ben had to be carful or else he'll get taken down fast.</span></div></div>",

Then five days before filming starts, Ben was walking out of the hanger were he just finished rehersing a scene and a rushed and distracted inturn runs into Ben. Of course this does not affect Ben in the sligtest because with all the weight he put on it also caused him to grow about 6 inches (so now any normal sized person looks small next to Ben) so instead the intern just runs into Bens belly and is knocked to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry Mr.10000 I did not mean to run into you\" the intern says scrabling to pick up scattered papers. \"It's ok I didn't see you either past this guy\" Ben says as he smacks his belly which makes it bounce up and down and jiggle a lot. \"umm oh yeah I have a message for you from the director, he wants to talk to you and that he will be waiting in your trailer\" the intern says then runs off in a hurry to deliver the papers he was carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Ben goes and heads over to his trailer, it was specially made for him everything inside it was super reinforced so it would not break under Bens weight and it was about 3x bigger to acommodate his size. Ben walked up to his trailer reading the gold star reading Ben10,000 and opened the door to find the director Seth Manatok sitting on the couch watching tv waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there big guy have a seat\", Ben walkes over to the couch and sits down with a \"Umph\" which causes the whole trailer to shake along with his whole body.<br>\r\n\"So what did you want to talk about\" Ben says as he turns off the tv, \"I just wanted to say thank you, because of you I can make this movie and not only that you are almost the perfect envisionment of your character, but to fully look like my vision for your role you need to...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\" Ben interupted, \"change my hair style, shave my beard, color my...\", \"No Ben thats not it, I just well invisioned your character to be bigger\". <br>\r\n\"What do you mean bigger, im already 700lbs\", \" I know that but your almost there, we just need to make all of you bigger. Your arms, your legs, your butt, your chest area, and especially you belly it had to be the biggest thing about you, dont worry though well still make sure you have enough muscle to move around easily and so you can do you sumo scenes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" Ben says still a little unsure, \"I mean I took to the role this far, might as go all the way\". \"Excellent, then we'll get started right away then\" then the director gets up and heads to the door, \"Come and follow me please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gets off the couch and heads out the door of the trailer and starts to follow the director, \"so how much more weight will I have to gain?\" Ben asked. \"I don't really know, I'll just stop it when I think your ready\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and the director head out to the gates of the studio and find a limo waiting for them, then the director gets in and Ben barly squeezed through it and he took up half the space of the interior, then they are driven to a plain looking building about a thrity minute walk from the studio and enter. They find two rooms, one of them was filled with different workout machine's that could work out every muscle in the body and they were all super rienforced and up sized so ben coud use them, and there was a sumo ring for Ben to practice on. And in the other room was just one table with a convaier belt going in and out of the room and in the middle of it was the table as a stop point, two chairs one regular and the other reinforced steel chair for ben, an industrial sized scale and a big measuring tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Ben you have five days to meet my image, the first three days will be non-stop eating, the next day will be an all day training in the weight room to build up the muscle needed to so you can do what you need to do at your new weight, and the last day is for you to relax and rest cause the next day is filming\". \"How do you expect me to do all of that in a week?\" Ben asked, \"Simple you will take this\" Seth held out a single red pill and a single blue pill, \"first you will take the red pill, its like the one I had you take during your initial training but this one is a little different. This pill will triple the amount of calories in the food you eat, and turn everything you eat almost instantly into fat so you won't get full and you will become a bottomless pit, and a bonus it will make whatever you eat seem like the best thing you ever tasted so you won't want to stop, and it will supply you with energy so you won't get tired. This pill will last 3 days before it wears off, then you will take the blue pill for your weight room training. It will increase your strength and make it make you rapidly gain muscle mass with out losing any of your fat. And so by the end of this you will be the biggest actor/sumo/hero on earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So have a seat then\", Ben sits in the steel chair and the director presses a button and a bowl filled with something comes out on the conveir belt and stops at the table were Ben was sitting. \"What is this\" Ben asked as he sniffed the contents of the bowl, \"It's chankanobe, it's a traditional japanese stew eaten by sumo wrestlers. It's filled with calories and it's what you will be eating for the next three days\". Ben takes a sip from the bowl and says \"It's good\", \"Excellent, then lets get started, I'll be watching your progress through the security cameras in the room, then the director hands the pill to Ben, \"Just to let you know big guy when ever you finish a bowl another will be sent out automaticly so just set the empty bowl on the other conveir belt to send it out\". Ben nodded as the director leaves,\" Here goes nothing\" Ben says then he takes the pill and the effects start right away.</span></div></div>",

At this rate he'll be over 1000 pounds by the time we're ready to shoot. In preparation I made a few tweaks to the script.

It was also the last day until he would have to workout. Ironically, the producers had to find something to replace the chankanobe since it was almost gone.

With Only 24 hours left before the next phase of preparation Ben was expecting to exceed the executives prediction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Manatok, we were out of ingredients to make chankanobe so we had to find a few substitutes.

As Grandpa max drove he noticed something strange in the air, it was none other than hex's niece, Charmcaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Grandpa max spotted the young witch in the air, stopping the RV as fast as he could, throwing the kids in the back of the RV around for a loop, \"grandpa watch it, me and doofus got thrown around back here\" Gwen stated while opening the Rv door to help battle hex's niece. Ben transformed into diamond head to battle Charmcaster, while Grandpa max got some of his famous plumber tech to help Ben. Using her new found powers she made many rock golems to distract the both of them, she had another reason to track down the Tennysons. This reason was Gwen she needed her for a reason, during the confusion a smoke screen was placed into the area as well. \"Grandpa, Ben?
