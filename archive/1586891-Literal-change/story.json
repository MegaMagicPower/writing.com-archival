It then came to a screeching halt on the memory of your sister's locker combination. Running over to Jill's locker you open it and pull out her gym clothes. Hearing someone enter the room, you then jump into a stall and wait quietly for Sandra to change.

It was pretty damn cold outside, and a cool breeze swept over the field, causing your nipples to harden. You still had no idea what the hell was going on. Literally ten minutes ago you didn't have to worry about a humongous pair of breasts, and now, you did. You still had no idea what had caused this, nor how everyone still saw you as Jason, despite having Sandra's petite female form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to distract yourself and talk with Sean for some time. Soon, the principal walks out and states that it was a false alarm, but that everyone should head home for the day. He tells the PE students that they should get their things quickly and leave, as the fire department is doing a sweep of the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone heads back inside, you included, to get their things. </span></div></div>",

It was only the first day after winter break and already you had a backbreaking amount of homework to tend to. Otherwise, the day had flown by without major incident. You could hardly remember your wish from that morning, but the feeling that spurred it still lingered as you took off your jeans and t-shirt, falling into bed with only your boxers on. College was just around the corner--you'd applied to a handful of schools. Most of them hadn't gotten back to you yet, and the two that did put you on their waiting list. Everything about your life felt uncertain. Your sister had just entered her freshman year of high school, and already, she seemed primed to succeed in every field she applied herself to. When Mom talked about her prospects, she mentioned Harvard and Yale, Brown and Princeton. Around you, Mom didn't talk about college. Whatever she said around your father or Jill, you doubted it amounted to much more than, \"Jason will end up wherever he will end up.\" Perhaps she thought that you'd go to community college and muck around for two years, before getting your shit together and getting into a halfway-decent school. And maybe she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut damn it, it'd be hard when all of your friends were going off to different parts of the country. You could keep in touch through Facebook, but somehow, you knew that as soon as they left, their lives would travel in different directions from yours and you'd never be able to recreate the brotherhood and camaraderie that carried you through high school. And where would you be? At the end of summer, would you be attending a university? Or would you be stuck in your hometown, working at a gas station and taking beginning math courses at the nearest community college, with no friends except the classmates you worked on projects with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the fear that stuck with you as you fell asleep... for a second, you also thought of Sandra Wong, who had announced in first period class that she'd been accepted into UCLA. \"Lucky bitch,\" you'd thought. The anger you felt toward her surprised you, but then again, she was a cheerleader. She had scholarships to do dance routines and cheer on footballers--she didn't even need to worry about her high school GPA. Who wouldn't envy her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no dreams that night. You slept restfully, from 2 AM until your alarm clock went off. Upon waking, you felt like something was different. Something about you had changed: physically, mentally, you couldn't say. But straightaway, you noticed how strong you felt, flexible, agile. You sprung from bed with a lithe step and crossed the room toward your closet, but halfway there you stopped yourself. \"What's going on?\" you thought. And then you looked down...</span></div></div>",

A few students look over at you for a moment. You wave your hand and mouth that \"It's nothing.\" You smile for a moment as your caressing of your arm has seemed to stop the sudden pain. You grasp your short sleeves to see if there is anything wrong with your shoulder but find yourself relapsing into the same spout of pain, this time corresponding to your sides. Your eyes have instinctively closed out of pain but one lid opening shows a few more students have turned towards you this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to wave it off as nothing but you take notice of your hand and arm and find that it seems to be a river in a sense. The skin is coursing but your hand is only trembling. It soon begins to almost bubble in a sense, your teeth clench from the pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H--hey are you O.K!?\" You hear. You try to answer but cannot get passed \"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Sorrack, something's wrong with Jason.\" A student broadcasts but you find that it nearly a waste of breath as full attention is quickly brought to your person as you scream out in agony. You slam your head to the desk, your arms wrapped tightly around your body. Every chip of your body stings with a fiery essence, no portion unchecked-- even your eyes. The questions and banter of the students all become undertones as your ears begin to ring very loudly. Your eyes begin to blur. You become too tired to even writhe in agony and just lay with your head on the desk, facing out. Your ragged breathing method continues even as the pain subsides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes begin to regain focus if only for a moment. You fail to see most of the students from your position but you wonder what girl is leaning her head so close to you that her hair is obscuring your view. The brown hair that falls in front of your eyes, you feel would tingle if you could feel any part of your body anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~  (\"What's happening to him?\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                        <font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">(\"Is he O.K.?\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~       (\"Call an Ambulance!\")</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                                                 <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">(\"D--did he change into a girl!?\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                                                                  (\"W--why does his face look like mine?\")</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                   <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">(\"Well that was...\")</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Opening your eyes to a bright white light, you look about and take in fairly quickly that you're in a hospital. '<i>A hospital eh? I guess that pain was real.</i>' You echo in your head. If you had the strength you would jump out of bed to ask questions or at least you assume you would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly strew your gaze over her but it wasn't until now that you begin to focus on the woman doctor who has been staring at you for as long as you have been conscious. She looks to be about 40, curly blond hair and a pretty large nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You awake this time or do you plan on just mumbling and falling back to sleep again?\" She asks, her hand already prompt to write down anything you say. Your voice cracks as you speak but unlike usual, it seems to stay at a higher level. \"Ah, yeah, I'm awake.\" You tell her through your haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?\" She asks. You find it a good question as you haven't even had time to think about it. You push yourself up a little bit on the bed and take a brief look at yourself but find no oddities that weren't hidden by the white blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry, tired and my whole body feels a bit... itchy or tingly rather I guess.\" You tell her, a small chuckle accompanying your abrupt ask for food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. And just to confirm your name is?\" She questions. You can only assume she is going down the usual book procedure and don't question the confirmation of your identity. \"Jason Farfield.\" Is your response. You notice she seems a bit intrigued in a way by your name which you find a bit odd. You bring a hand to your brow and begin rubbing a bit to try and force the small headache away. You become a bit entranced in the simplicity of your action, finding the skin texture a bit strange, even your eyebrows felt strange to you as you rubbed your head. Vis versa seems true as well, your hands felt different against your head and as you further the position of your hand you begin to notice why. Your hands seem small and by no means as pronounced as you are used to. They seem in a way dainty, even the nails seem to shine as if you had polished them. You shake your head in stupidity of the random inspection of your person but only find more oddities as long hair swiftly takes place in front of you-- even if only for a moment before receding. You grab it and feel it, it's soft and gentle and amazingly attached to your scalp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? How long have I been out?\" You abruptly ask the doctor. She takes a seat next to the bed. \"You were brought in earlier today at about 10 A.M. Your teacher and a student came with you on the ambulance and provided us with some... interesting descriptions.\" She replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earlier today? Then why is my hair-- what kind of descriptions?\" You ask, lifting yourself off the back of the bed. She flips through some of the pages of her notes before quoting your teacher...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He started screaming and I found him writhing in pain on his desk. His whole body was moving and eventually he started to look different. He looked like the principal's daughter, Mary Turner.\" Your mouth is gaping and you begin to feel a bit queasy. \"That's a joke right? You're telling me I look like Mary?\" You scoff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't get to talk to her much but the student who came with you was Mary. I must say, you do look just like her. If it wasn't for the hard evidence that the Turner family has no twin daughters, I would say this was all an elaborate joke. Couple that with your D.N.A matching exactly to Mary's and you have yourself a complete clone. That and leaving me speechless, I've never seen or heard of anything like this and I've been a doctor for 25 years.\" She tells you but only leaves you stunned. The lights flicker a little as you shake your head back and forth with an uncomfortable smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has to be a joke. Sure, I have long hair for some reason but there is no way I'm Mary's twin.\" You spout, more to try and convince yourself than her. However, the oddities all seem to be spiraling in on you as you take notice of the empty feeling between your legs. The feeling only furthers as you look into every metal object in the room to find distorted reflections of Mary. You try to get out of bed but cringe from the aches of your body and merely stumble back into the pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be...\" You say as you stare at the ceiling in a brief recollection. \"What about my parents?\" You ask suddenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are in the hospital. It took quite awhile to convince them that you are their son.\" She informs you. If you really look like Mary than you find it to no surprise that they would be skeptical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get something to eat? My stomach is killing me.\" You ask in your weak disposition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" She says, getting up. She leaves the room, hopefully to get your food, leaving you alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare up at the ceiling some more, hoping to blind yourself in the dim but numerous lights. \"Mary huh? I guess if I'm Mary than I have her cute face, melodic voice and her hair-- which always parts in the middle, arcing high to fall at either side of her face and drifting lovely to her shoulders. Yeah right!\" You dabble to yourself with a joking tone of both anger and fright. Fright that perhaps this is not as false as your common sense deems it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nurse eventually comes into the room and gives you some food which you happily devour. You feel as though you haven't eaten for weeks and the lingering hunger doesn't subside until your meal is almost finished. \"Ah, so this is what actually having an empty stomach is like.\" You say to yourself. You stretch your arms high and to the sides, taking notice of the slim and quite either boyish or girlish features. \"Not a spec of hair on them, let alone any muscle. Not that I was particularly hairy or jacked before but this is ridiculous.\" You observe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do wear a thin smile just from the relief of all the inner turmoil subsiding from your body's delight of having food to digest and energy to create. You decide to try your best to stand and find that the energy is there but the balance is not. You stumble and wobble about, grasping every medical object around you to steady yourself. You gaze down at yourself in disappointment and frustration. \"Well let's just see if this is real...\" You say as you bring a hand to your chest, surprisingly feeling a more plump version of your own chest. \"O--oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peer beneath your loose garment to see two breasts-- which to you, look enormous but you have seen Mary from a third person before, she is more about a double B than anything else. \"Still...\" You begin to say as you continue to gaze at the two foreign attachments to your being. \"They seem bigger in <i>person</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swings open and you quickly disperse both your hands behind your back but nearly fall in response from the sudden lack of support. You gather your standing and focus on the doctor who has returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better now that you have eaten?\" She asks with a delicate smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very much so.\" You respond with a dim-witted smile or so you assume. Not until now have you noticed but you do hear the melodic voice more and more as you speak. <i>'I guess I really do have her voice. Guess I just needed some water to hear it better.'</i> You assume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear. While we as medical enthusiasts would love to keep you here and run tests on your very unusual case. You're free to go home if you're feeling fine. We just ask that if you feel anything odd that you call us and let us know.\" She explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a bit pained by the response. \"Wait wait wait. I turn into my classmate apparently-- a girl no less and you're telling me to just go home? Live my life?\" You ask with a fiery tone. She shuffles her papers around a tad, perhaps her nervous inkling. \"I'm sorry. I would like to say we know how this happened but we've already run several tests while you were asleep. This is a medical mystery at the moment and the first case we've ever heard of. However, your parents are the ones who stressed that you be released today. I would of liked for you to at least stay for a week or so.\" She conveys to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds more like magic to me.\" You jest with a sour lip. She laughs and responds with \"I agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the room and then at yourself, finding your bare legs and open back gown a bit too revealing even if you are a girl now. \"So, I'm fine with going home but I don't suppose you have something that will fit me?\" You ask. She points to a pile of clothes on a shelf which you are a bit embarrassed about not noticing. \"Mr.Turner brought those in, I assume they are some of his daughter's clothing.\" She explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver at the thought of the principal being involved in this. His giant stature has always been a bit of an intimidating factor, you always found him to be a bit of a drill sergeant in his strict and direct mannerisms. \"So, Mary and the principal know about this? I wonder how that will go over...\" You say-- more to yourself than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and responds despite your dislocated gaze. \"Mr.Turner seemed a bit angry about it and Mary looked to be a bit more shocked than anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, goody...\" You grumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get yourself dressed in the clothing Mr.Turner brought, embarrassingly getting help from the doctor. \"T--this has to be a joke!\" You shout as you place the small pink hoodie over your head. \"Skin tight jeans and a shirt that fairs no better and a <i>pink</i> tiny hoodie? Mr.Turner did this on purpose to embarrass me!\" You rant. The woman laughs at your reaction and commends your good spirits. \"At least you're fine in personality.\" She says. You smile a bit embarrassingly and look away in a blush. \"Heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your parents are in the waiting room, they have been for a few hours.\" She tells you abruptly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright. I guess I'll be on my way then.\" You say as you begin to exit the room. You stop yourself for a moment and look at the woman. \"By the way, what's your name?\" You ask. She jumps a bit and scratches her head with a perplexed look. \"I can't believe I didn't tell you. Kimberly Louvcha.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, thanks for being such a nice doctor.\" You tell her. She reels her head forward a bit and wears a gentle smile. \"Well, well, you're quite mature for your age and you're welcome. Now run along.\" She teases. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a bit nervous as you close the distance between you and your parents. \"I wonder how this will go over...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking passed the doors of sickly individuals, you wonder if by someone's standards this is a lucky break. '<i>I'm not exactly in pain or dying. I guess if I look at things like that, this bizarre \"condition\" I have isn't as bad as it could be.</i>' You ponder. Despite your health, your stomach begins to swell from the nervous thoughts that foremost any sense of luck that some may say you have. \"How are my parents going to react to this? What about school-- my friends? I hope I turn back to normal soon.\" You voice to yourself as you walk along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>God these jeans are tight. I guess I should be thankful there is nothing in-between my legs anymore or it'd be squashed. Since there is nothing to discomfort it's not uncomfortable just... so tight. I want my freedom of movement back.</i>' You debate in your head about random feelings to amuse your free time as you find your way to the waiting room of the hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find the waiting room and spot your parents, even looking down the hallway, they don't seem to notice you. \"Guess they don't recognize me, makes sense. Who knows if they saw me in the hospital bed or anything.\" You assume as you take a deep breath to soothe (even if only slightly) the twirling knots in your stomach. You walk up to them, your mother and father finally seem to take notice of you as you situate yourself near them, staring at them. Your sister however seems to engrossed in a magazine and apparently bored out of her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you're Jason.\" Your father questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dad, it's me.\" You respond. He cradles his head in his hands, shaking it slightly. \"Good grief...\" He sighs. Your sister jumps out of her chair and begins eying you, her attention fully on you now that you have introduced yourself as her brother. She eventually begins laughing and grasps her arms around her stomach-- though you feel she is only doing it to add to the moment. \"This has got to be a joke. You're telling me this pretty girl is my brother? The principal's daughter no less if I remember correctly. I'll believe it when I get some proof.\" She blabbers out in a good example of why you don't get along too well with her. Regardless, you end up wearing a scowl towards her biased remarks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the school and hospital aren't enough proof?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for me.\" She responds bluntly. You feel yourself being pulled down as your mother grasps you hand rather tightly. \"Is that really you, sweetie?\" She asks. You have a feeling the next few days are going to be filled with that question, perhaps with a different name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me, mom.\" You tell her but you have cause to regret it as she bursts into tears almost instantly and hugs you. \"Oh sweetie, how horrible! W--we'll sue this hospital! This isn't right!\" She jabbers in a panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not the hospital's fault, mom. No one knows how this happened.\" You try to assure her but she is rather unreasonable in this state. '<i>Standing in a hospital waiting room with my mother hugging me as tightly as she can, how embarrassing.</i>' Your sense of shame tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little boy has turned into a girl, how could this happen!?\" Your mother screams. You can feel your face blushing red from embarrassment as you look around the room at the other waiting room participants who most likely think you're either fascinating or out of your mind. \"M--mom, that's enough.\" You exclaim as you try to pull her off. You take notice about this time that your mom is taller than you, by a few inches no less and she is only 5'7. \"Joy... I'm almost a midget.\" You mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we sort this out at home by chance?\" You ask. Your father, seeming to have the same sense of shame as you agrees to take the situation elsewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you're alright?\" Your father asks as everyone gets in the car. You seat yourself in the back with your sister, brushing your hair out of your face. \"Besides how bizarre I feel, I'm fine. I'm not in any pain or anything, at least not anything serious.\" You inform him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well that's good I suppose.\" He replies. Your mother furthers her annoyance by whining about how her son sounds like a girl. You let her repeated comments about your appearance or anything go without retorts. You find yourself looking in the rear view mirror quite a lot of the ride home, the first actual mirror that you have seen your reflection in clearly. It would seem that everyone in the world but you is not stupid as you most certainly look exactly like Mary. The only noticeable difference is that your hair is falling flat instead of having a very prominent and thick parting. You can't help but notice your sister eying you carefully. Any movement whether it be brushing your hair or rubbing your legs seems to arouse her intrigue of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the car and into your home you immediately vacate to the bathroom with realization that you have had to really go for a long time. You dismiss any curiosity you may have for now and do it as dignified as you can but do take not of the very interesting feeling even the small touch to your new primary sexual part gave you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe falling sun during the ride home should of been a good indicator but you only just now realized that it's 6 P.M. Your parents order pizza at your request as you really just want to eat and go to sleep. It's not until you're near ready to go to sleep that you think about how school will go, do you even have to go tomorrow? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide that skipping school at least for one day is a must as you are by no means prepared to go to school like this. You open the door to your parents room and find them a bit too close for your casual entrance. They play it off like they were doing nothing and ask what you need. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... can I skip school tomorrow? I'm not exactly ready to go like this.\" You ask. They don't seem to even bother thinking about it and respond. \"It's your decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, thanks. I'll be skipping tomorrow then.\" You inform them as you close the door to leave them to their deeds. You can't help but hear \"I wonder what being the opposite gender is like.\" from your mother's muffled voice. You shake your head with a smile as you walk away. \"It's something at the very least.\" You answer despite her absence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your room you discard of your clothing with the exception of the disgustingly cute panties Mr. Turner picked out. \"Does he dislike me or just the fact that I happened to turn into his daughter?\" You question with a dim smirk. You can't help but fondle if only briefly the new perky breasts that hang from your chest. \"These honestly feel better on myself.\" You state with a dirty mind. You grab a random T-shirt out of your mess of a closet and put it on. \"Guess this is the only way I can wear my old shirts now.\" You sigh. Though your mind dances on worries you find that you are more exhausted than you thought and fall asleep quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up the next morning and stammer yourself into the bathroom. You look unamused by your reflection but do believe this is the first time you have seen Mary look like such a mess. You undress and step into the shower. The water really brings emphasis back to the strange sensations of your new body as you find yourself blocking the waves of water from hitting your more sensitive areas. \"Gah, it's like a new layer of skin. Everything is really sensitive.\" You exclaim with your arms instinctively covering your breasts. Massaging your body and all it's contours you really can't help but literally feel that Mary is a beautiful girl. \"This feels good.\" You whisper. You feel a little hot but not just from the water and quickly finish up any business you have in the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wipe the bathroom mirror clear from the fog entirely so you can take full notice of Mary's beautiful reflection. You playfully bite your lip and toy with your nipples, if not the feelings itself, the vision of Mary looking so sexy is enough to make you hard. The feeling is more definitely different and you begin to wonder just how good it would feel to try out a woman's pleasure. You can't resist and take a finger to yourself. You moan with pleasure but quickly pull away with fright from the shocking experience. You want to continue but morals are all to good at badgering you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill dripping wet you grab a towel to cover yourself and begin drying yourself off. You find your long hair is not going to dry with just a towel and take out your mother's hair dryer. It works as the label says it would and soon your hair is silkier than it's ever been and clinging beautifully to your face. You poke your head in displeasure from the style though. \"I guess her hair doesn't naturally have that full part. She still looks good though.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou talk yourself back into your room and regretfully cloth yourself with the same tight outfit you had on yesterday. \"Not like I have any other clothes around the house and I'm not too keen on wearing anything my sister wears.\" You state. You scratch your head as you wonder what to do and end up bringing yourself downstairs to eat something. You are a bit alarmed to see that it's already 12:12 P.M. \"I guess I really slept.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making yourself something to eat the doorbell rings to your surprise. With both your parents at work and your sister at school, anyone who knows your family would know better than to show up now. That said, you assume it's someone looking for you. You open the front door and for a moment actually feel like you're staring into a mirror. So used to the surprise of seeing Mary's reflection you are more surprised by the presence of the real Mary who seems to be carrying a few large bags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" She says with a gaping mouth. She smiles a bit and lets herself into the house, looking you over in quite an enthusiastic method. \"I mean, wow. I saw you when you changed and stuff and in the hospital but... seeing you up and about and stuff is amazing. You really look just like me.\" She exclaims as she circles about you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... yeah. I'm a bit... surprised by it too.\" You say in a surprising loss for words. You'd think this kind of thing would trigger all sorts of conversation tidbits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, wait. What are you doing here? Isn't there school today?\" You ask. She smiles and says. \"Well daddy and I feel a bit responsible for this since you look <i>just</i> like me and stuff, so we decided to help out the best we can. I'm kind of glad this happened, I got daddy to buy me a whole new wardrobe while you get my old clothes.\" She explains. You look at the bags on the floor and wager that they are filled with clothing-- clothes you can't see yourself wanting to wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so where's your room?\" She asks. You take her to your room where she plants down all her bags and starts layering things out on your bed. You kind of stumble back as she starts pulling clothes out of the bags in rapid succession. \"Here's your skirts, pants, shorts, shirts, tops, sneakers, heels, a coat, lingerie, a few pairs of stockings, bras and stuff. Some of it is new, some of it is my old stuff. Since you look like me I can guarantee this will fit. You feel like your head is spinning as you look at all the clothing. She wastes no time as she begins to remove what little clothes you actually keep in your closet with her own. You rub your temples with a backwards grin. '<i>She's so nice but she's so... unstoppably weird.</i>' You voice to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're not angry or anything about me looking exactly like you?\" You ask. She doesn't turn around and just continues to navigate herself around your room with her clothing. \"Well, at first I was a little scared but I found I just couldn't be mad about it. You were writhing in pain and stuff, I'd be a total dummy if I was mad at you for something like this.\" She conveys to you which brings a delightful sense of relief. Truthfully, you were quite scared about how reactions could vary and end quite undesirable. She turns her head to you as she finishes up and smiles. \"I want to help as much as I can. You're a boy and stuff so I'm sure you are probably having a hard time. If I suddenly turned into a boy I'd be completely lost. So think of me as a sisterish kind of person, I know more about you than you do right now.\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true. Thanks Mary.\" You reply with a whole-hearted smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. Now have a seat.\" She says, pointing towards the chair near your desk. You shrug and sit down just to see as to why. She pulls out a mirror and places it onto your desk, along with that she pulls a bunch of things out of the bag that just make you cringe. \"Now this is your lip balm...\" She begins as she presses it against your lips. You instinctively press your lips together when she is finished and find the sweet taste of watermelon on your lips. \"Mmm. I love watermelon.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too! Anyways, I lick mine off because it tastes good but you probably only need to apply it a few times a day.\" She explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues more and more with both demonstrations of each individual piece of make-up. You would like to stop her and tell her that just because you look like a girl now by no means means you're going to dress and act like one but you feel it would hurt her nothing but helpful tangent so you keep quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now here's how you do my hair.\" She says as she grabs some of your hair and places it against her curling iron. \"Get it in a good position and then spray.\" She explains as she sprays your hair. \"Don't use too much or it'll be sticky. Now you do the other side. This really makes my bangs look good.\" She says. You regretfully comply and do the other side of your hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I feel a bit bad that your father bought all these clothes. He's doesn't even know me.\" You say. She continues to play with your hair and says \"Don't worry about it, my families not too bad off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With your hair made up in it's surprisingly simple method and your face complete with foreign substances you can't deny the uncanny likeness you have of Mary. Rather, you look exactly like her, the same way you have seen her for as long as you have known her. Which isn't that long-- quite frankly you haven't even talked to her much at all prior to this moment. \"I can't say I haven't wanted to...\" You whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She asks. You get out of the chair and turn towards her with a shaking hand. \"It's nothing.\" You assure her. She looks at you and with twitching fingers proclaims \"It's a bit creepy! You are really me from top to bottom.\" A bit guilt ridden due to your stolen appearance and her obsessive aid, you plea for forgiveness with a toppling head. She places her hands gently on your shoulders and shakes you violently. Surprised, you step back and shout \"W--what was that for!?\" She giggles a bit and tells you \"Sharon always does that to me whenever I'm feeling down. I thought since you look like me I'd try the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou contort your face in as best a way you can manage to convey your 'I dunno how to react to that' response. \"Uhh, I think I just <i>look</i> like you. I dunno if being shaken violently is going to make me giggle or something.\" You relay to her. She just smiles with a small chuckle. Her continual gentle stare is surprisingly strong enough to make you turn away in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, are you hungry or anything?\" She asks suddenly. You feel your stomach for some reason and reply that you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to go out for something to eat then?\" She asks. You realize it may be out of context but just the fact she is technically asking something that could qualify as a date makes you blush. \"Uh... s--sure. Where to?\" You stammer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to go to a restaurant and catch up on breakfast if that's O.K. I kind of skipped it.\" She suggests. You are pleased that she isn't just going to ask what you want and tell her \"That's fine with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel as though you are a bit overly enthusiastic as you step into her car. You can't say that you haven't thought of Mary as a potential partner so even being this close is a bit unexpected. As the car starts onto the road, Mary speaks up in a curious tone. \"So hey. What's it like being me and stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou twitch and look down at yourself, gently tugging on your small pink hoodie. \"Umm...\" You mumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>How am I supposed to respond to that!? I can't say anything bad or she'll think I think her body sucks!</i>' You rage. You brush your hair behind your ears and give a nervous smile. \"How do I describe it? I feel... I don't know. Different.\" You rattle out in probably one of your most uninformative attempts at answering a question to date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that but what's it feel like? I've been me forever, so I'm not sure how being me would feel to someone else or something like that. Tell me the differences and stuff.\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, let's see. Can I just say all the feelings I have as bluntly as I can?\" You query. She replies that \"Anything is fine.\" You take a deep breath with a bit of an anxious grin, as perhaps you have wanted to speak up about this for awhile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My whole body feels weird. I'm like 10 inches shorter, my hands are tiny and my fingers are too short. I can't touch any part of my body without questioning if it's mine or not. Smiling, frowning, every expression let's me feel how different my face is. It all contours differently. My body is so overly sensitive and these clothes are so tight. Every movement I make reminds me that I'm missing my... manhood. Being a girl is strange...\" You rattle out in an uproar of minuscule details. Mary seems a bit delighted by your tangent as her eyes are wide with a bright smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe. Sounds like fun.\" She teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My voice is too high and melodic and my hair is too long...\" You grumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk into the restaurant you get quite a few stares from both fellow customers and employees. While twins aren't really rare, it would seem Mary and you are too similar for your own good. Mary plays it off as such-- that you're her twin and regretfully you go along with it as you can't deny it's the only excuse that could work. \"I guess telling them that I'm a boy who turned into my classmate wouldn't go over well.\" You mumble. Mary agrees with a laugh, despite you not wanting anyone to hear your outspoken thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the table with Mary is a bit picturesque. To you, you feel as though you're on a date with her but as you look down at your small feminine hands both loosely holding utensils, you sigh. You look into the window and see your reflection and Mary's as well. '<i>I guess to everyone but me. This is just two twin sisters eating breakfast in the afternoon. Great...</i>' You whine. Though you regret that even Mary herself probably doesn't see this as anything, you are a bit grateful that you have no girlfriend at the moment. \"I wonder how a girlfriend would respond to this?\" You say in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a girlfriend?\" Mary asks with curious eyes. You pinch your legs through your tight jeans as punishment for speaking your thoughts but swiftly respond. \"No, just wondering how one would react if I had one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith eyes of serious thought and a smile of the opposite effect, she raises a finger to her face in thought. \"Well, if I was your girlfriend it would be particular awkward. I'm not sure if I could ever date myself and stuff. I think your typical girl would dump their boyfriend if he turned into a girl. Most high school couples just don't last anyway.\" She says. You find her opinion rather insightful and brutally honest. If you were dating a girl and she turned into a man, you can't say with a straight face that you would continue to date her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I guess I should be lucky I'm not in a relationship.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the evening with her is lovely and you find yourself really enjoying her presence. You can't describe how badly you wish you were a boy again so you could officially ask her out. Sadly, you enter your home only with her number and her sisterhood as she calls it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been?\" Your mother screams in a panic as you walk into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary came over and we went out for something to eat.\" You respond. Your sister finishes putting her really long blond hair up in a ponytail and says \"That's the principal's daughter right? The cutey you supposedly turned into right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did <i>she</i> want?\" Your mother demands with her arms folding with great ferocity the moment any mention of your change is spoken. You don't hide the anger you acquire from both your mother's accusing tone and your sister's constant irritating tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you stop being angry at everyone who was there?\" You request. Your mother moves her plump exterior around the kitchen table to confront you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fact you turned into this girl makes me think she has something to do with it.\" She states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is a nice girl, besides, how would she t-- why would she turn me into herself?\" You ask with little intent to hear an answer as you walk passed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn-closed in your room, you disperse a bit of your anger just by ranting to yourself. \"Yeah, sure. I guess it makes sense that she would suspect Mary but... how could she even do this? Guess it doesn't matter right now...\"</span></div></div>",

The shimmering variety of colors, sizes and shapes would make any man stumble. The rainbow of clothing is nothing that you are used to. Typically your clothes are just pushed into your dresser and some tossed into your closet without much thought. All the listed types of clothing that Mary said are present and you can't even comprehend wearing most of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeking no originality or vast change you grab a similar outfit to the one you have been wearing, though very consciously replacing the pink hoodie with a more tolerable green. \"At the very least I've gotten used to it.\" You grumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face blushes uncontrollably as you see all the panties that Mary so rudely forced into your dresser. You grab the plainest one you can find and throw it on. Grabbing a similar bra you can't help but notice that it's a size C. \"I was off by one, not bad.\" You say slyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your outfit on, you seat yourself reluctantly at the small mirror Mary placed in your room. \"Well, having her bangs up is more tolerable anyways... not that I want to do anything girlish.\" You grumble as you pick up her curling iron and copy the very simple procedure. \"This hairspray must be really strong.\" You say as you fluff your hair. Your hand sends a rolling lip balm off the table and you retrieve it and make use of it. \"I--I like the taste of watermelon is all. It makes her lips shine at the very least.\" You convince your reflection as she holds a uncertain expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl in the mirror stares back at you with a full set of make-up you can't help but feel disgusted with yourself. To think you would enjoy seeing yourself go from a pretty girl to an even prettier one. \"I am ashamed.\" You sigh as you get out of the chair. You look at the clock and are shocked to see it's already 6:40. \"Ack, the bus is going to be here any minute.\" You shout as you run about the house in preparation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're fine with going?\" Your mother asks as you grab a banana out of the kitchen to fend of starvation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, yeah.\" You say with uncertainty.

Thinking it over a bit you feel the relief is more from that than the comforting heat. \"Pretty much. I'm not sure how this day is going to go over.\" You reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I see you like that outfit.\" She says as she waves a finger over your attire. \"Ah, heh. Not in particular...\" You say as you stretch the tiny sweatshirt as best you can. \"It just happens to be the most ungirlish choice from your clothing. Which isn't saying much considering how ridiculously tight these jeans are.\" You continue as you cross your legs in displeasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sorry.

The continual white seems to offer no suggestions so you push yourself back against your seat in disappointment. \"Hey... won't everyone at school just think I'm you?\" You ask with your head fumbling with the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually. I got you so we could talk about that and stuff.\" She says.

I don't to make you uncomfortable by pretending to be you or anything.\" You answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, thank you.\" She says with a smile as you gets out of the car. You follow her like a pet, nervously looking to side to side. The people arriving to the school don't seem to notice the twins walking together but as you enter the school the stares begin to take place. Some of them do double takes. Your head sinks to the floor in embarrassment and you decide to split apart from Mary. \"I--I'm just gonna head straight to class.\" You say as you scurry off in a power walk. Normally you'd take your sweet time before going to your class but today is a race against being noticed-- you have a good feeling it will be harder than dodging rain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mary.\" A cute girl says to you with a wave who you recognize as Kimberly. \"Hey...\" You respond. \"I don't suppose you can let me borrow your math homework?\" She asks quite quickly. She tries to abuse puppy dog eyes as best she can you find it to be working as you stutter to respond. \"I uhh... I have to go.\" You blurt out as you zoom passed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drive into your classroom and place your head swiftly into your desk so no one can notice your face. \"I'll just leave my head buried in my arms for the whole day, people will just think I'm some girl instead Mary.\" You say into your shirt, muffling any hope of others hearing it. As you stare to your side you can see your brown hair falling gently, clinging loosely and moving smoothly to any movements you make. The similar scene from when this first happened flashes into your head and you smile out of stupidity. \"I guess that was my hair all along...\" You mutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear the footsteps of people as they enter the room so you shut your eyes in hope no one notices you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary?\" You hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammit...\" You grumble with an uncontrollable smile from your easily thwarted attempts to hide yourself. You lift your face from the comfort of your soft sleeves to reveal yourself to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" You hear once more. You turn your head and just smack yourself in the face in utter defeat as you see who it is. '<i>How did I forget that Sharon was in this class...? A.K.A. Mary's best friend to which I only learned yesterday!</i>' You scold your stupidity as your hand slides down your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you change your clothes so fast?\" She asks yet another question to which you're sure there are a hundred that could follow. Her tilting head and bewildered expression are distracting, both because it makes her look innocent and that it makes you stumble over how to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... how do I say this? You'll find out soon enough, so just take your seat.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell does that mean?\" She snaps back but quickly continues with \"Whateva...\" and turns towards her seat. As she sits back down she continues to wear a foul expression, her arms and legs folded. \"She's easily angered isn't she?\" You mumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class starts soon enough but it's only moments in that the announcements come on and regretfully, the end of the announcements are followed by the principal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a special announcement so pay attention and I stress that this is 100% true. I'm sure some of you may have noticed that there were 2 Mary Turners in school today...\" He begins. You grasp your head with your shaking hands, the smooth touch of Mary's hair doing little do distract you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While physically this may look to be the case, I can assure you I only have one daughter. The other is Jason Farfield who at approximately 10:24 A.M. went under a severe and unexplainable medical phenomena. The results are as shown, he is a striking resemblance to my daughter but don't mistake the fact that there is only one Mary Turner. Please treat him as you would before his perplexing medical condition. Thank you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammit, god dammit, god dammit. He sounds like a damn sergeant-- dammit-- dammit.\" You mumble with your eyes facing the desk, your hands nervously grasping your head. Humbly, you raise your head to the perplexed class who are staring at you so intently that you feel they could cut right through you. You give a nervous laugh but as it rings so lonely you feel embarrassed already. You begin to get a bit angry just from the sheer lack of communication and shout \"Stop staring at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... not... Mary?\" Sharon is the first to speak up, that is if you don't include the muffled \"Is this for real?\" or \"Is that some kind of joke?\" you hear from other classrooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure of the room really begins to get to you as you stand up to speak but almost begin to cry as you begin. \"I'm not...\" You stop to compose yourself if only a little. \"I'm Jason-- so what if I'm a girl! Now stop staring at me!\" You cry out and quickly re-immerse yourself into your arms. You feel pitiful as your tears soak into the dark green cloth. You feel that despite your coverage that any sensible human being could notice from your shivering body that you're crying and as a man, doing so in front of so many people you feel can never be redeemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence seems to stop and the students all begin asking you questions but you just ignore them and leave your head down. The teacher eventually tells them to leave you alone. The whole class you lay there as to not see any of the stares despite your awareness that they are staring at you even with your head down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell does eventually ring which forces you to get up from your solemn state. Of course the stares are still there you just continue to ignore them with an unchanging frown on your face. Even the packed hallways offer no relief as anyone who knows who Mary is, is gazing at you like you're some sort of walking science experiment.</span></div></div>",

Your feigned ignorance of the hindrance eventually leads to you being sharply pulled out of the aisles of fellow students. The big boned behind and long flowing blond hair-- done up in a ponytail, gives you a good indication on who is pulling you. \"What do you want, Sharon? I'm not Mary--\" You badger as she relinquishes her grip once her secluded section is reached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe that for a second. What is this some kind of crazy family April fools joke? I got news for you Mary, April is months away.\" She rages, pushing you against the wall with each nudge. \"I'm not Mary.\" You respond with the retained scowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.K. then. Jason, how exactly do you explain turning into Mary?\" She asks with a dramatic hue of sarcasm. You shrug your shoulders with a sigh. \"If I knew that I'd be myself right now. Look, I was too busy trying to keep my insides from falling out. Mary probably knows more about what happened than anyone since she was in the classroom when I started changing.\" You explain in detail as best you can but Sharon seems only mildly amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your father wasn't the principal I may actually believe you. Though I'll never understand how you got him to spout such gibberish.\" She says as if not hearing a word you said. Anger is all but too hard to hold back anymore as you push out from the wall and into her face. \"Look, I may look like Mary, I may sound like Mary but I'm not her. Go talk to the real one.\" You say in as serious a manner as you can manage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell begins to ring and you turn away from her with a spin that could cease flames. \"You may be Mary's best friend but you sure as hell aren't mine.\" You declare as you walk off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe firmness of your walk begins to shrivel as you near the classroom. Thinking preemptively this time, you know that two of your good friends are in your next class which would normally be a relief but with your current confounding situation you can't help but wish the situation could change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk into the already commenced class you are swiftly questioned by Mr.Hugh (Your science teacher)on why you are in the class. You take your seat in the middle of the class and point to the speaker at the corner of the room. \"You heard the announcement right?\" You ask. However, before the teacher could respond, one of your friends; Tim Waltly riles up. \"Wait, if you're telling me you're Jason I'm afraid I'm going to have to slap you.\" He says. Matt Wall quickly follows up his hype with his own take on your claim. \"Seriously, how are you supposed to be Jason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your many good times together you can't help but feel you wouldn't mind seeing both their heads mounted on your wall. \"If I could explain it, I would. Now just leave me alone.\" You retort as your lower your head into your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole class with the teacher included seems to demand further information.</span></div></div>",

The question is predictable and just knowing with great confidence that you will never hear the end of it infuriates you. \"Yes. The whole point of the principal announcing it was so I <i>wouldn't</i> have to explain it to every single person.\" You snap back in a heightened whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're a chick.\" He jokes with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm aware.\" You mumble. The teacher silences your whispers which you remarkably find enjoyable, as it is nice to see someone treat you normally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo distract yourself in some form, you pay close attention to the class. Taking strict notes that go overly into detail just so you don't stop writing. The trailing marks of your pencil deepen in intensity as you hear feint whispers from nearby students. The young girls sound like squeaking mice as they gawk back and forth behind your back in a most literal sense. You want to turn around and shout profanity at both of them but with the common knowledge that shouting obtains attention, you keep your mouth shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class nears it's end but you still feel the continual aching in your stomach. Your erratic breathing as you exhale is equivalent to your body's shaking. '<i>Why must I feel so nervous? I can't take this feeling anymore.</i>' You ask as you gently stroke your arms and take conscious strides to calm yourself down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerely taking a nonsensical look around the room brings attention to Tim and Matt who seem to be waiting eagerly for class to end. You know they may have all sorts of questions and things to ask you and while you know it's bound to happen eventually, you start to think of ways to get around their conversation.</span></div></div>",

You pick up your things and get ready to leave but find Tim and Matt around your desk but with them is about 5 other students who you aren't even very acquainted with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is it really true or is this some kind of joke?\" Asks a rather cute but small girl behind Tim. You reverse face and begin to walk away from them but with so many desks and several students blocking the way, it's impossible. Tim and Matt grin as they stand in your way. You scowl at them but it only seems to excite their forceful interrogation. \"Just leave me alone-- yes it's true.\" You plead with a sinking head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's really you then... give me some proof.\" Matt asks, scratching below his grin. \"Proof?\" You echo. You wonder what kind of proof you could possibly give, maybe a past experience or something else. \"Like what?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs his shoulders and states that anything is fine and that he would even settle for you letting him touch your breasts. You coincide with the girls who are also around you in an equal blush of awe and disgust at his perverted request. \"What the fuck!? I wouldn't let you touch my penis if you asked so what makes you think I'd let you touch my breasts!?\" You shout at them. Quick regret follows as you lower your head once more, touching your lips in awe that you just made Mary something so bizarre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim and Matt pass grins at each other and say \"Maybe it's really him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--If you want proof then come with me to my next class. Mary is in it and it's also where this stupid change happened.\" You inform them and push passed them. The following of all of the people who first gathered is proof enough that they want to see if this is really happened. In a lighter mood you feel you would have joined them in their scouting of information had one of them turned into a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the next class with a long awaited relief, knowing well that both Mary and the other students here all witnessed your transformation. You stop and point at Mary who is sitting up front. You notice her hair is up in a ponytail which is rather rare for her but find it quite sexy and enjoy the way she left some of her hair down around her cheeks as to still give a frame to her pretty face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary gets up and walks towards you and the students who followed. The other seated students who all witnessed your change are watching as well. \"Mary, can you please tell them I'm not you.\" You ask. She nods with a smile and stands next to you in perhaps an attempt to show the comparison. It seems to work as even Tim and Matt are impressed. \"Wow... you're really not Mary. Sorry dude.\" Says Tim. The atonement of their attitude is a nice first step you feel as you smile after a long time of frowning. \"Don't worry about it. I guess I can't blame you.\" You insure them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually glad you brought some people along.\" Mary says as she turns her head to the side, a hand lifting her ponytail. \"People were getting me confused too so I decided to put my hair up and stuff so people can tell us apart. Mind spreading word that the girl with her hair in a ponytail is the real Mary?\" She explains as she lowers her position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's actually a good idea, Mary. Thanks.\" You say. She wears a soft smile and blushes. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rings and the boys and girls who followed you quickly find themselves scurrying off in a haste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down in your seat, you are a bit delighted by all the curious questions that come from the students. Anyone else who asked seemed to infuriate you but you know everyone here has full knowledge of how you must feel. \"I'm fine thanks. I feel bizarre and all but I'm not in agonizing pain or anything.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, it's a bit amazing to think something like this could happen.\" Says Katrina (Your teacher), her hands perched on her hips and her eyes in a wide lift of astonishment just from your appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me.\" You quip with a chuckle. </span></div></div>",

Scratching your head once more in thought on the question of the day, you can't seem to come up with any accurate words to describe it. \"I can't explain it. So to be as clear as I can, doing anything at all, be it frowning or walking feels a lot different.\" Is your answer and it seems to pleasure their ears enough to sink the question away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral more minutes are burned with similar conversations and a smile is leaning it's way in on your face. \"You're taking this really well, Jason.\" The teacher comments which quickly erases your smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N--no... up until now I've been...crying.\" You admit, looking plainly down at your desk in shame and awe at what you said. She apologizes for her comment but you smile and say \"I'm over it, thanks.\" She takes it sincerely, despite it's limited truth and stands back with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't do this all class.

She looks at you, a discomforting melancholy glow around her. \"I didn't know you didn't like being me so much. Were you really crying?\" She asks. You brush your loosening hair out of your face and shake your head. \"It's not that, at least not mostly. I just couldn't take everyone thinking I was you and not believing me. I'm a little over it now.\" You tell her and discover how easy it is to get her to lighten up. '<i>Happiness sure seems to be her preferred emotion.</i>' You note jokingly in your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later she passes a note reading \"If you need ANYTHING, I'll help. XD\" You send the smiley back at her with a nod. You almost feel like crying from Mary's relentless aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunate is it that the class ends and you get shoved into the hallways and classrooms of ignorant people. However, it's only a class after the next that everyone is already carrying information that the girl with her hair up is the real Mary.

You didn't say anything, instead choosing to give her a look that screamed spill the beans. \"Ok\" she said, starting again. \"I was thinking that, since me wearing my hair differently today made both of our lives easier and people stopped mistaking us for the other, what if one of us got our hair cut so that we wouldn't get mistaken for the other anymore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it for a minute.

Why don't we head over there together, find a hairstyle that one of us wants, and bingo. We aren't mistaken for the other person anymore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't argue with her logic. It was a good idea, and while you had only looked like Mary for a couple days you really did miss your old shorter hair. So, once you told Mary that you agreed that her idea was a good one the two of you were off, with Mary more or less leading the way. And it wasn't long before the two of you were walking through the doors of the hair salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman working the front desk seemed nice enough when she greeted the two of you. And she seemed a little sympathetic when Mary explained that she and her \"twin sister\" were starting to grow tired of getting mistaken for one another, and we decided one of us would get a different haircut so it wouldn't happen anymore, but the problem was neither of us were sure if we wanted the different look or what we would want. \"Well, it's going to be at least a 20 minute wait before one of our stylists are available\" the receptionist explained. \"If you'd like, you can go through one of our samples magazines to maybe see if anything jumps out at either of you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's actually perfect\" Mary said as she accepted the magazine the receptionist was handing us. \"Thank you very much\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the two of you sat there. Waiting. Flipping through a magazine filled with different hairstyles. Except nothing was jumping out at either of you. It was almost 20 minutes later and the two of you had gone through almost the entire magazine, thinking about each look you saw. It wasn't until you were on almost the last page before something caught your eye. Mary was about to turn the page when you told her to hold on. \"What, you like this one\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't\" you asked in reply, unsure if it was a good choice or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, its not something I would go with. But if you like it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like which one\" the receptionist asked. You brought the magazine over to her and showed her the page. \"Oh that would look great for you. Especially in that color\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" you said, taking a deep breath and looking at Mary. \"I think I know what I want then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And right on time. Our best stylist is ready for you now. Just follow me this way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I come along\" Mary asked, obviously wanting to be supportive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" the receptionist said. \"That's not a problem at all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it you were in the back sitting in a chair as the receptionist explained your choice to the stylist. Once the stylists understood what you wanted, she leaned you back in the chair as she began washing your hair. As her hands messaged your scalp, you had to admit that it was kind of a nice experience. From the smell of the products being used to the smooth skin of the stylist running through your hair, you got very relaxed. So relaxed, in fact, that you couldn't stop yourself from falling asleep. As you drifted off, you listened to the conversation the stylist was having with Mary as it faded into the background. It seemed that the stylist also agreed with the receptionist, unlike Mary. The last thing you remembered as you drifted off was Mary noticing that you were falling asleep, and the stylist commenting that it happens from time to time.</span></div></div>",

It seemed to urge you to head outside. Exercise. Never had you craved it before, but for some reason you just needed to go. Without even changing your clothes, you opened the front door and started to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ran, you started to become more conscious of yourself. A distinct bounce on your chest became more and more apparent. A cool breeze tickled your bare, hairless legs and sending a shiver through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt clicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to my body? What am I wearing?\" You asked aloud still running. It looked very familiar, but the shock was preventing you from quite putting your finger on it. Then it hit you.

He wasn't able to sleep well last night, marathoning the 2nd season of <i>Breaking Bad</i> for more than 9 hours straight, into midnight. He discovered the show back in October when his friend recommended it to him, saying it was riveting and strange. Jason was hooked ever since, but only yesterday was he able to lazily finish torrenting every episode. His sister Jill wasn't all that happy having her brother stay up late like this, but she knew that he has been waiting for his chance to start downloading as soon as they return from their week-long visit to their grandparents' home. He barely survived all the talks about how America should have been like it was when JFK was president (\"Nowadays we have these crackpots who constantly take all our hard-earned cash for themselves. Look at how they made our economy bankrupt! When we were told that the US can handle the Soviets, we knew that we <i>can</i> handle the Soviets...\").<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As soon as the bell rang to signal lunchtime, Jason lifted his heavy head to see Mr. Miller telling the class to prepare... something... he didn't quite get what he said, still groggy from his nap. He picks up his navy blue backpack, lays the straps around his shoulders, then heads for the exit, when he noticed Mr. Miller glance at him; he looked annoyed, not irritated, but annoyed, as if he constantly has these types of students in his class. Jason nervously smiled back at him, continuing to do so as he leaves the room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Along the hallway, he sees his pal Wes, who was with him during Math class. He runs up to him, eager to ask a question.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, Wes,\" said Jason.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What did Mr. Miller say when Math was finished?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He said to bring a compass for drawing, since he'll start Trigonometry next meeting.

Humming \"<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkVPNos7V0\">Negro y Azul</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AkVPNos7V0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>\" under his breath, he heads towards his Honda Civic at the parking lot at the side of his school. Halfway through, he is suddenly greeted by a barrage of students walking along the lot, which he hadn't noticed while at the exit of the school. A flurry of whites, reds, yellows, greens, and blues from the students' clothes constantly crossed his line of vision. Jason tries to navigate through the crowd, trying to avoid the bags and shoulders of each student making their way, to no avail. He is continually nudged, pushed, and shoved by the stream of teens, so much so that he eventually forgot what direction he was headed. He scans his surroundings, and sees some of the faces of the crowd, a few he thought he recognized, but most of the others he didn't. He has now reached a point where he's just desperate to get to his car, trying to shove others out of the way to where he thinks his car is, until he notices a small yet heavy-looking brown duffel bag coming towards him. He barely glimpses its appearance until it blows him right at the side of his head, which knocks him out...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kaleidoscopic images appear before Jason in a chaotic yet beautiful manner: the duffel bag from earlier comes out of a hole in a tree at the forest, transforming into a green blob-like creature with a hand inside its body, a clown dressed as a lawyer appears out of the tree and starts singing \"Oh how I wish I could have taken up law,\" the grass reveals a red bowler hat out of which comes a rat dressed in a suit, running towards a dragon's skull which it made into a home, and an empty glass box which has an inscription reading \"Seize the day\". Looking at them all, he's just bewildered at what he is seeing. He then tries to run away from the forest to a plain white landscape, seeing many Rambo clones along the way. They are firing away their guns toward his direction, yet curiously he isn't hurt by any of their shots. As soon as he reaches the white landscape, he hears a voice which seems oddly familiar to him. It says repeatedly, with a tinny sort of sound like a cheap recording, \"I wish I was you.\" It's his own voice, he thinks, which isn't voluntarily coming from him. He is now starting to feel hysterical, running in distress from what he thinks is his dream towards a lone, plain-looking, blue door. As soon as he opens it, he is assaulted by a swarm of disembodied hands and feet rushing out of the door, piling on top of him until he is fully covered.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jason suddenly woke up from the dream, yelling from the shock for a bit, then breathing heavily, already sitting upright as if he wasn't even lying down while sleeping. He immediately scanned his surroundings, finding out that for some reason, he is at the cafeteria. He then notices some students who are looking at him funny, most likely from his shout. Jason slows his breath down, for his nightmare was over. As soon as he calms himself, he sees and stares at a meal that seems to have been barely eaten by someone. After seeing this, he feels a metallic object in his hand, which he sees is a red iPod Classic, but then he notices something off: his hands look different. It looks slender and very smooth, not at all like his own hand, as well as having fingernails with pink nail polish. He almost gets sick of the thought of having \"very girly\" nail polish, when he notices the rest of his body: he now has the slender body of a girl, and instead of his red shirt, he is wearing a cheerleader's uniform. Highly shocked at what he is seeing, he tries to keep his sanity intact by trying to convince himself it is all still a dream. \"No,\" Jason thinks to himself, \"this all feels too real. My previous dream was just insane, while this... feels like the real thing, just that I'm the only one who's changed. What's the word people used to describe something like this?\" The word Jason is trying to find is Kafkaesque.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jason gradually begins hyperventilating again. He couldn't grasp at how he transferred to the cafeteria and transformed into a girl. He doesn't know what to do next. All the sounds of squeaking shoes, clinking spoons and forks, and chatter blur together, numbness creeping all over him as he stumbles a bit while getting off the chair. While he lurches forward towards the exit, students are momentarily halting what they're doing to witness what was happening to the cheerleader freaking out and trying to walk fast yet stumbling to the door. As soon as Jason reaches the door, he notices two to three teachers now heading towards the cafeteria, most likely hearing from others that a student seems to be in distress. Jason <i>is</i> in distress, but he could as well find out what happened to himself on his own, for maybe as soon as he tells them what happened, they might think he's insane and dismiss the situation, or worse: send him to a mental hospital. Or help him get his body back, but what can they do? All he can do now is hope that everything will be fine. </span></div></div>",

You gently crawl down on your knees and make your way down to the edge of the roof. The experience is weird as you feel the sensation of your breasts hanging and slightly jiggling while you crawl. At the edge of the roof you take a look down. You're in luck as you spot an open window right below you. This is perfect, but now it comes to the action part of your plan. You climb down the edge of the roof and spot a ledge made of wood below you. It seems to have been used often so you let yourself down on it and before something else could happen you dive straight into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch.\" You mumble. You landed on your breasts and unlike in the past they really hurt. As you look around you judge it must be a girl's room. Probably Sandra's. As you want to check out the room, you suddenly hear fast footsteps coming up the stairs. You don't know if you could face the person coming up now, so you quickly run to the bed and dive straight in. You pull up the sheets over your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandra? Oh thank God, you're inside again.\" A female voice says. You can hear someone closing a door and then entering the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're still up, you can't fool me young lady.\" The female voice speaks again thought a bit angry this time. You just hold onto the sheets as you listen to the voice. It's probably Sandra's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things might be bad now, but they will be better soon. Trust me.\" You can feel a hand touching the sheets. \"We will talk about it in the morning. Good night Sandra.\" You hear Sandra's mother standing up and walking out of the room closing the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull up from underneath the sheets. Man, was it hot underneath there. Though you have managed to delay the meeting, you can't get away from meeting Sandra's mother. You will have to meet her sooner or later. But first you need to concentrate on the more important question. Are you really Sandra Wong? You step outside the bed and walk over to the full sized mirror in the corner of the room. Standing in front of the mirror you barely want to open your eyes, knowing what you will see will answer your question.  You slowly open your eyes and look at the reflection of Sandra Wong standing there in her nightgown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are so many questions going through your head? But the most important one is what you're going to do now.</span></div></div>",

Rolling off the bed, since you still have some trouble coping with the breasts disrupting your gravity, you carefully walk over to Betty's own personal bathroom within her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping down the pantie, you turn on the shower and step inside. The nice warm water of the shower made you quite comfortable as your long wavy brunette hair became densed and the water that ran down your breasts. The tingling sensation ran through your body as you cleaned your body with the soap as you enjoyed it quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the nice long shower, you felt quite comfortable and admired your new body. Looking at your skinny and nice thin body, you assumed that Betty must have had implants in her breasts for the nice look, which you personally did not mind at all. There you slipped on the nice warm and fuzzy nearby robe and slippers which were the most comfortable things you had every been in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to the nice comfortable plush bed, you lay with relaxation and thought about what to wear tomorrow. Should you wear something normal, girly, or something really weird? Heck this your body now, you start thinking this could be a lot of fun.</span></div></div>",

There it was, the slickest bright pink BMW you ever saw and dang you look cute driving it. As the garage door opens, you hear that nice beautiful sound of the car's engine and shift it in reverse. Pulling out, you fix a few strands of hair and drive off to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool was about ten or so minutes away, but suddenly you heard a strange noise inside the car. Figuring it was nothing, but when you heard it, again you realized it was your stomach and you were hungry! Damn it I knew I should have grabbed a Pop Tart or something, you thought. Just off to your right was a little fast food joint and boy just in time too! Figuring that you left a few minutes early and driving five or so MPH over the speed limit, you had some time to spare for food. Besides, without it, you figure you would not survive the day until lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling into the drive-through, you sat behind another car taking an order. Then you realize that you did not check her purse to see if she had any money. Quickly and panicking as you jump for the purse and opening it up, you had no issue about money! Letting off a little girly girl squeal at the sight of those green bills, you also saw credit and debit cards, and gift cards for every major shopping store in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the car ahead of you pulled away from the menu, you drove to the board and took the previous car\u2019s spot to place your order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi welcome to Foodilious. Please order when you are ready,\u201d said the man on the intercom who sounded to be in his mid-thirties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the board, there was a lot of variety of food to choose from as you been here quite a few times in your other body. Most of the time you ordered lunch food but luckily you had ordered breakfast before so you know what you like. Last time you had ordered a Bacon Egg Sandwich, small bowl of hash brown, and a small hot chocolate to drink. Warm foods are really your best friend in the morning, you needed extra since its Monday morning, and you were stuck in a hot rich girl\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi I would like to order two Bacon Egg Sandwiches, one medium bowl of hash browns, and a medium hot chocolate with whipped cream and caramel sauce on top.\u201d You enjoyed hearing your new cute voice talk which makes you feel very attractive. Normally you do not order this much food but you have done so before in your old body. Besides, if you could eat that much being a guy, there shouldn\u2019t be any reason why you couldn\u2019t do the same as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will be nine-fifty-six at the window\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving up to the window and paid the man in exchange for the food as you caught a whiff of the smell that turns on your hunger even more. Taking a nice couple long sips before setting it down, you continue on your way to school with enough time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at school, the parking lot of course was nearly full as everyone came early today for the best parking. Feeling disgusted you were lucky to manage to find a parking spot in the back but takes longer to walk to the building. Now parked, you decide this was the best time to eat as you scurry to grab and rip open your first sandwich. Indulging the nice warm sandwich, within minutes you were nearly finished, but was getting so full. You have only just eaten two sandwiches, half the hash brown bowl, and half the hot chocolate, but you just could not let it all go to waste. Pigging out, you forced yourself to finish it all before class started, resulting in a very bloated and an uncomfortable full feeling. Thankfully, for the sweats, the bloated stomach remained hidden, but you know it is under there as you sure can feel it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleaning up all the empty food containers, you scurry everything together as you just realized class is about to start very soon! Getting out of the car with your stuff, you get out of the car, but within moments, you had to stop. Something did not feel right as you felt a bit dizzy and pressure was building inside of you. Opening your mouth and out came the loudest burp you have ever made or a girl ever made. The pressure and dizziness went away with a few aftermath coughs, but boy that burp did smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing on your way to class, you thought you noticed\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You raise your hand in front of your face, flexing and unflexing the fingers, turning them over and over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and see your sister's average sized breasts pushing the front of your t-shirt.  Without thinking about who you are, you grab two handfuls and squeeze.  Then you realize you're actually touching your sister's tits and quickly let them go, cringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross!\" you exclaim, suddenly feeling claustrophobic about being in her body.  Fighting back a panic attack, you start pacing.  How did this happen?  Can you switch back?  What if you can't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwearing under your breath, you walk quickly to your own room.  You throw open the door and go straight to the closet, pushing your clothes out of the way and opening your secret compartment in the back.  Inside you see a half empty bourbon bottle, a couple playboys, a pack of cigarettes and a couple boxes of matches.  You grab the cigarettes and matches and close the compartment.  You usually don't smoke when your parents could be home at any time but at the moment you don't care.  You open your window a bit and sit heavily into the recliner in front of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one fluid motion you pull a cigarette from the pack, place it between your lips and light a match.  You begin taking a huge drag, shaking the flame off the match.  As you drop the match into your ashtray, you inhale deeply.  Suddenly you can't breathe!  You start gagging and coughing, fighting to take even a single breath!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... the.. fuck?\" you strain through watery eyes, your face turning a bright red.  Smoke is billowing out your nose and mouth.  Finally the coughing subsides and you feel a bit dizzy.  You look at the cigarette in your hand and shake your head.  Of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, she doesn't smoke.\" you mutter to yourself.  You look into a mirror across the room and see your little sister sitting spread-eagled in your personal recliner, a cigarette between her fingers.  It looks so odd since she's such a good two-shoes.  You still feel the mental need for the nicotine but you know she'll kill you if she finds out you were smoking in her body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou study your reflection for a moment then you.....  </span></div></div>",

You look around yourself and to your surprise you see your body lying down there. You try to move back towards it making powerful strokes, but you're not moving an inch. Instead you feel yourself being drawn to somewhere else. You move through the bedroom of your parents who are asleep. Your mother hugging your father while your father has his arm around your mother. That doesn't change your destination however you are still drawn away from your body. You end up in your sister's room; you hated the room because it doesn't look like any girl room. The walls are painted blue, the posters are of famous scientists and the only things have are books, a lot of them. She's smart you know it far too well, but a girl like her should have something else to focus her mind on sometimes. You do anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then that you notice something different in her room. Above her bed you can see a naked figure, she's tall and thin, shoulder length hair, small breasts. In an instant you realize it's Jill, your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jill.\" You try to say but your mouth is stuck shut. Jill notices you too her eyes wide open. Then all of a sudden you're drawn down to the figure lying in the bed. As you make contact you feel something like an explosion taking place. Like a million butterflies exploded in your stomach. It's then that you open your eyes, like waking up from some nightmare. You try to calm yourself down by looking at your room, making yourself think it was just a dream. But something is off: your bedroom looks different, the  playboy covers on the wall are gone, the walls are different and your room looks more foggy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around you decide to..</span></div></div>",

As you feet touch the ground you notice something else is off, your feet are way smaller. Instead of the usual big lanky feet, you now have small elegant feet. And what's more you're now wearing pink pajama bottom's. Pink?! Something is way off. You try to walk and feel something is off with your posture. The way you move, it's way too feminine. As you touch the light switch at the end of the wall, the light suddenly shines bright and your eyes can't take it yet. So you move away from the light switch and to the other wall. There you see Jill looking at you, rather sleepy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Jill, I'm not sure but I....\" You begin to mumble but your voice is off, it's way too high.

You're sure you entered her body and she must have entered your body, that must have been the case. But why? Why would the cosmic universe let such a thing happen?

That didn't exclude her from doing any side-activities. Taking advanced classes, tutoring and in her free time she would play the violin. And she still got amazing grades while doing all that stuff. All you ever did was goof off with your friends, jacking off and play video games and look at the results. Was that why this happened? To teach you a lesson?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, cosmic fate I learned my lesson I should focus more on my studies. Now change me back please!</i> You screamed in your mind. However when you opened your eyes you were still inside Jill's room. It didn't help anything, you were still stuck as Jill. <i>What to do now?</i> You think as you walk around in Jill's room. If you would go to your sister now your parents would certainly hear you. As Jill might react more freaked out than you. Looking at the alarm clock in the room reveals it's half past twelve. There were still a few more hours before everyone was awake. Better try to get some sleep. You step inside your sister's bed again as you try not to smell the girly smell around here. It's even worst that you can't sleep on your chest, your chest hurts when you try that. You try not to think about the fact that the things you were looking so forward to when you got your own girlfriend now belong to you. So you turn around and fall asleep on your back after an hour of twisting and turning.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You suddenly got really disoriented, but it passes just as fast as it came. Quite a few now things different to you. For one, you were now in a different seat. You had been sitting next to the windows, but you now were located around the middle. You look over and notice Sandra Wong in the seat where you had been previously, and she look just as confused as you now did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra was an attractive half-Chinese girl. She was pretty popular too, with being a cheerleader, as well as having good grades. And despite her popularity, she wasn't a bitch like that Betty Jackson, and was a nice person. You also had a crush on her since middle school, and she lived like ten blocks away from you with her mother. And although not often, you had talked with her on occasion, and she had always been nice to you. You had even been paired up with her for a project last year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking away from you thinking about how much you liked her, you then notice that she is no longer wearing what she had been moments before as she stood at the front of the class. Now she was wearing exactly the same stuff you were wearing, from the red shirt you were wearing to the jeans. Even the sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat then drew your attention to the other thing that felt different. Your own clothes now felt wired, and when you looked down, you found out exactly why. You were now dressed like a girl! You were wearing a short sleeve blouse and a skirt. You also saw that your fingernails were painted with pink nail polish. Now despite your odd appearance, no one was paying you any mind. They would see you as they looked around the room due to boredom from the lesson, but not even spare you a second glance as if your appearance was completely natural. Now you weren't the most rugged or masculine of men, but there was no way you could be mistaken for a girl. Fearing the worst, you reach down and feel your crotch and are relieved to find your little friend still present, but that only raises more questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is then that you realize that the clothes you are now wearing were the same ones that Sandra had been wearing until just a while ago. You then look over again to where Sandra was now sitting, remembering she is now dressed like you. You confirm that that not only is she now dressed like you, but that the clothes she is wearing <i>are</i> yours, after noticing a few minor specific details. You then look down at yourself, and wonder something. While you are not the biggest of guys, you are at least slightly bigger than Sandra, enough so that you wouldn't fit into her clothes, yet they seem to fit you perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are tapped on the shoulder, and some one asks \"Hey Sandra, are you okay? You don't look like you feel well.\" It was one of Sandra's friends, and for some reason she had addressed you as Sandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you let out, not hiding your confusion at the situation. 'Why did she just call me Sandra?' you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming to mistake the reason of your confusion, she said \"You've been looking worried for a while. Do you need to go to the nurse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding you wanted to get out of class to think about what was going on, you say \"Um, no, I'm alright. But I think I need to use the bathroom real quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but if somethings wrong, don't hide it girl.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are bit bothered by being referred to as a girl, you shrug it off and raise your hand. Your teacher Ms. Sorrack sees and asks \"Yes Sandra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Her too?' you thought. You glance over to see the real Sandra look at the teacher in confusion at hearing her name. \"Can I please use the bathroom?\" you ask. Sandra looks over at you, shock evident on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you may. Just don't take too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up to leave, and are relieved that you weren't wearing heels. You left, and as you made your way to the bathroom, you pass a few people in the hall. None of them acted as if anything was wrong with you, and one said hi to you. As you neared the bathroom, you were making you way to the boy's restroom out of habit, but before you passed the girl's restroom, another girl exited, and figuring you needed to use the bathroom, she held the door open for you. With everything that is going on, you decided to enter, and thank her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure that you were the only one in there, you looked into the mirror, and you saw your normal reflection, albeit in girl's clothes, and with make-up on your face. You then inspected yourself further, discovering your ears were now pierced and had earrings in them, your legs and everywhere else had been shaved, and you were even wearing a bra and panties. Like the rest of your clothes, these seemed to fit you perfectly, despite not even having breasts for the bra to support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door opened, and someone else walked in. \"Hey Sandra.\" the girl said. It was one of her friends, but you couldn't remember her name at the moment, so you just responded with a hi back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to check further, you ask the girl \"Hey, how does my hair look? I'm wondering if I should get a haircut soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks fine Sandra. You should grow your short hair out a bit more, and get some highlights that go great with your brown hair.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back to your own reflection, acting as if you're thinking about your hair. And while you were in a way, not for the reason the girl thought. Your own hair was short, while Sandra's hair was long and went down to her mid back. Not only that, but Sandra's own hair was black, much darker than you're own brown hair. \"Alright, I'll grow it out, but I don't think I need any highlights.\" you say. \"Anyway, I think I should head back to class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll see you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" you said. As you made your way back to your classroom, you thought about what was going on. You were in your own body, yet you were dressed like Sandra, and even though you still looked the same as you always did, everyone was treating you like her. As you got back to class, you saw Sandra look over at you. You also saw your best friend Alex lean over and say something to her. You caught a few words as you sat back down, and you guessed he was talking about your crush on her. You also heard her play along. So not only were you being treated like Sandra, but she was being treated as if she was you. It was almost as if you two had swapped lives or something. You then proceeded with class as normal, and decided to talk to Sandra about what was going on after class. You just hoped she was as nice as the times you had talked with her previously, and didn't freak out on you or start to hate you. That would really ruin your chances with her if everything went back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell rang, you exited the room and you were approached by...</span></div></div>",

But I think we've swapped lives.  Everyone seems to think I'm you!\"  You pull away from the classroom and walk with Sandra towards your next class together, Gym.  You both had so many questions, but neither one of you could answer them.  Suddenly, you hear someone call out Sandra's name behind you.  Still unused to being her, you don't turn around until someone grabs your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra's boyfriend was a muscular guy, with heavyset arms and a wide chest.  But he was short.  Not shorter than Sandra, but definitely a few inches below your 6'2\" frame.  But, with reality shifted, he reached up, grabbed your male head, and planted a big kiss on your lips before you could stop him.  \"Hey!\" you yell out, pushing yourself away, Sandra in your clothes watching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sandra's boyfriend, Tom, asks, \"You're not excited to see me babe?\"  You stutter and stumble before Sandra nudges you in the back and gives you a fierce look.  \"No, of course I'm happy to see you!  How have you been?\" you finally manage to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I can't wait for our date tonight,\" he wraps his large arms around your waist and coyly rubs your penis.  He whispers into your ear, \"It's your turn to ride shotgun tonight too.\"  He then turns around and leaves, quickly reaching up to plant a kiss on your stubble filled cheek.  Turning towards you, her face filled with shock, Sandra asks you what he whispered into your ear.  You tell her and she just shakes her head, \"We need to figure this out soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you part ways to go to gym, you turn into the boy's locker room instinctively.  Sandra pulls you away just before you enter, \"Hey, I'm supposed to go there remember?  Listen, let's get done with this class and then we'll finally be able to go home.  Want to meet at my, or, well, your house after school?\"  You say yes and enter into the girl's locker room, while Sandra goes into the boy's locker room.</span></div></div>",

She takes both out and puts them on the bench behind her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her, another guy undresses himself, pulling down his pants and throwing his shirt into the locker.  \"Hey Jason,\" he says to you, rolling a towel.  \"What?\" Sandra replied before being whipped by his towel.  \"Think fast!\" he says, before trying to whip her again.  His towel connected with her breast, and she began to cling to it in pain.  Her hands barely covered the girth of her boob, but immediately the boy that had been messing around ran to her.  \"Shit, I'm sorry dude, are your boobs ok?  I totally didn't mean to hit them, they're just so big, I didn't realize where I was aiming.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded in appreciation for his concern and move towards the locker again.  She removed your shirt, a weird feeling crawling up her spine as the experience of not having a bra on in public made her feel like she stood out.  But guys were walking past her not noticing a thing, some even threatening her with a purple nurple.  She quickly put on your shirt, which seemed to fit her smaller frame, and your shorts.  She then moved out to the obstacle course that was the beginning of every period in gym.</span></div></div>",

And in the morning you stay in bed, I'll ring the school and get you the day off.\" he says while going in for the kiss. You push him away thanking him, before heading upstairs to 'your' bedroom. You quickly strip off the blouse and skirt you had been wearing all day. Your left in nothing but a black bra and panty combo. You leave the panties on, but take off the bra before placing a blue silk nighty on. It feels amazingly comfortable and light against your skin. You climb in to the large double bed. Then Neil walks in, wearing only his boxers, and climbs in next to you. \"I love you\" he whispers into your ears as he wraps his arms around you.

Finally, you manage to drift off, eyes wavering shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have the strangest dreams, filled with images of Kathryn and yourself, swapping body parts and clothes again and again. When you wake up, you're disoriented enough that, for a moment, you don't know where you are. Then it all comes crashing down, and you collapse back into the bed, sighing in disappointment. You'd hoped that <i>this</i> was the dream, not the reality, but it doesn't look like you had much luck with that. You figure you should probably go find the real Kathryn and talk to her some more, to try to figure out what's happened. First though, something to eat--you're starving. You quickly use the bathroom, and wash your face before leaving the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pad downstairs, not bothering to get dressed, the silk nighty swishing around your thighs. You don't hear Neil, and that's a plus at least. So you head for the modern kitchen, all granite and glass. You peek into the fridge, rattle through the cabinets, and decide to have some cereal. It's some bran-oat monstrosity. You guess Kathryn was always a bit of a health nut. Just as you bend over, reaching across the counter to grab it, you hear something behind you.

You straighten up and twist your head to see Neil grinning down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, babe, you should know not to bend over around me! I can barely contain myself when you have an ass like that!\" He laughs, and kisses your neck, his hands sliding up from your hips to grasp your chest, right where your breasts <i>would</i> be if you were actually Kathryn. He plants a line of kisses up your neck, finally landing one on your lips. He pulls you closer against him and deepens the kiss. You freeze for a moment, thinking desperately. You can't let him know that anything's wrong. If he begins to suspect something, you might end up in a mental institution--who would really believe that you'd swapped lives with your teacher? And even if you swapped back, you'd have ruined the real Kathryn's life. That means, at least for now, you have to play the part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, reluctantly, you kiss back. You're hardly experienced, especially in situations like these, but if Neil notices, he doesn't say anything. After a few minutes that drag on and on, his wandering hands running over every inch of exposed skin, he finally breaks away, grinning. <br>\r\n\"Glad to see you're feeling better after last night. I was afraid you wouldn't be up for our celebrations this evening, but apparently you're as rowdy as ever. I made you breakfast, by the way. Your favourite, eggs ala Neil.\" He takes your hand and heads for the breakfast nook, where two plates sit. Both have a few slices of toast, a poached egg, and a cup of coffee--but there's something different about your eggs. Looks like there's some kind of white sauce on them. You shrug--you figure it's just hollandaise sauce, like eggs benedict or something, and sit down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut off a piece with your fork, making sure it has a generous helping of the white sauce, lifting it up to your mouth and flashing Neil a brief smile as you pop it into your mouth. He seems to be watching rather intently...wait. That taste isn't hollandaise. It's something else, something you don't think you've ever tasted before, salty, a little bitter and slightly greasy...oh no. It's cum. You don't know how you know, but you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, baby, I always love watching you eat.\" Neil says with a small chuckle \"Go on now, finish before it gets cold. I've called up the school and told them you're sick, so we've got the whole day together. Since today's only a half day anyway, they didn't seem to mind.\" <br>\r\nYour heart sinks, even as you force yourself to cut another piece and raise it to your mouth. The whole day? From what you've seen so far, Kathryn and Neil are normally fucking like rabbits. You're sure there's a way to get out of this. Once you've finished your egg, downing your piping hot coffee in a futile attempt to wash the taste of Neil's jizz out of your mouth, you get an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, baby, why don't we--\" </span></div></div>",

Neils feels it to and quickly flips you over so you are able to look at each other as he resumes his actions and you feel your impending orgasm and soon you shoot a humongous load, more than you\u2019ve ever come before, onto your stomach and chest a couple small drops even land on your face. Neils smiles and then starts wiping some up with his fingers and brings them to your mouth and makes you eat some of your own cum. Then he says he\u2019s glad you got yours because he\u2019s been waiting for you to cum first. He says are you ready for me to finish? And picks up his pace and you feel his cock grow harder in your butt then he quickly pulls out and moves up to your face! You\u2019re about to protest and are opening your mouth to say something and he shows his dick in your mouth to the back of your throat and starts coming! You can taste your own ass, your own cum and now have his dick unloading what feels like buckets into your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighs contentedly and lays down next to you as you wimper at the situation and how gross it is. He thinks you\u2019re wimpering in pleasure though and smiles, then he says he can\u2019t wait to get you in the shower later for round two!
