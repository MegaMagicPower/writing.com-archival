However, after putting the DVD away and putting back where it belonged you heard an odd noise from the TV. This prompted you to turn around though when you did you didn't see anything odd since the TV was still off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused you to shrug your shoulders as it most likely was just you hearing things or something. But when you got up to walk away from the TV you felt yourself starting to get light headed for some odd reason. And before you knew it found yourself blacking out and falling down onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself letting out a loud groan as you put a hand up to your head and muttered, \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then blinked a few times and found your eyes widening as you looked around and saw that you were no longer in your home anymore, or even in the real world anymore.

And for some reason when you and a character get closer it seems to cause that character to grow bigger in size. (muscle only) So here are the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Keep the interactions M/M.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Characters that grow are anthro only characters. So even though there are some animal based movie choices. Those animal characters must be anthros. Think of it as a alternate reality for those specific movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Use proper grammar and spacing please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No gore or any kind of toilet stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. The only people who will react to the growth are the grown anthro male and human. (aka you the reader) So the respective world MUST adapt to the character's new size and act like they were always at their increased size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Have fun.</td>",
