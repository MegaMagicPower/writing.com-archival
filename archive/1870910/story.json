She'd never had the slightest affection for the hyenas, none of them ever had, well, except for him. Normally she'd have guarded her feelings more carefully - open displays of anger and hatred rarely went unpunished - but today was different thankfully, today she'd be out alone, at least theoretically. This was a result of some unusual forcefulness on queen Sarabi's part, and a rare display of acquiescence from the hyenas' matriarch, though the young lioness didn't kid herself on the matter, there were plenty of stragglers out there that the matriarch wouldn't or couldn't control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for Nala's relative solitude today was that she was out on her first hunt, a time-honoured tradition to prove that she could catch food on her own rather than having to rely on the pride to do so. it would be harder today than it had been before or course, the profusion of hyenas had driven some herds away, and caused the others to be much more on their guard, which would make it that much harder for her. The young lioness was not unconfident of her chances though, she was a good hunter after all, it would just be a matter of getting lucky, of finding a herd not quite so on-its-guard, or of a lone beast that was fortunate enough to have eluded the hyenas up until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala didn't start to look for likely prey immediately though, but instead headed for the waterhole first to get a drink. Despite theoretically being alone, the young lioness was constantly on alert, constantly checking for signs which would signal the presence of either potential dangers or potential prey. Previously this would have been quite easy, but with the reduced number of herbivores, the grass these days was higher than when she was a cub, in places above her eyeline, which made spotting things that much harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala breathed a sigh of relief when she reached the waterhole, she'd made it without being spotted. She hadn't spotted anything herself either, but then, she hadn't really expected to that near to Pride Rock and the so many hungry mouths it now played home to. things weren't to remain peaceful for much longer though, because she'd just crouched to get a drink when she spotted...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...A passel of hyenas, great, just what she really didn't need right now. Fortunately for Nala, the hyenas didn't seem to have spotted her just yet, and so she slipped away from the waterhole into a patch of long grass, silently cursing. For a few moments she wondered is she should go back and complain to the matriarch, but quickly brushed the idea aside, of all the filthy mangy beast she was the worst, for she was not merely a hyena, she was in league with Scar as well. No, if she was going to prove her mettle she was going to have to return to Pride Rock with something to show for her time and effort. She probably wasn't going to get anything from nearby though, she thought sourly, from the sounds of it, the hyenas had settled down to joke, rather than just to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were of course other waterholes around, but none nearby, so she'd waste further time travelling to them, so Nala sat down to wait for the hyenas to depart. After a few minutes though, it seemed like they were determined to stay, and waiting was driving her crazy, and so, muttering invectives under her breath, she departed, determined not to let the hyenas keep her from success. She'd have to hurry though, the nearest waterhole was still some distance away, and was in the outer regions of the Pridelands, which wasn't a particularly safe area to be. Still, she thought, it was much closer than any other waterhole, and she was both good at hunting and at evading pursuit, so it shouldn't matter too much, she'd just have keep on her guard.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nThe scenery didn't improve much as Nala moved closer to the border, the same degradation was going on out here, and the potential prey became, if anything, even sparser. Nevertheless, the young lioness wasn't about to be put off by hardship, and so, spotting a rock pile nearby, climbed it so see if there was anything nearby. From atop her vantage point, she...</span></div></div>",

The object wasn't very large, about as round as a toe and as long as her paw was wide, and had a few feathers on the end. Sniffing at the object didn't tell her any more and in fact just deepened the mystery since she recognised absolutely none of the smells on it. Thoroughly confused now, the young lioness finally decided that the best course of action would probably be to take the thing along to Rafiki and see what the old mandrill shaman made of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she started off well, Nala would never reach Rafiki's baobab, because the tranquilliser soon began making itself felt. As the tranquillisers began to take effect, the young lioness found herself stumbling more and more, until finally she was so disorientated she couldn't even rise, much less try to continue. Soon after that she was out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nala awoke she felt pressure on her back and rear. Still muzzy, she tried to look around, but with her blurred vision and unresponsive muscles the best she could tell was that she was in something wooden, and that, rather disturbingly, it was bumping around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the effects of the tranquilliser diminished Nala was able to take better stock of her surroundings. She found herself in an angular, wooden, well cave wasn't right since there was no exit, so entrapment would have to do. The entrapment was quite small, only a length and a half long, a length wide, and less than a length high. The floor was split into two parts, the larger reed covered one, which was obviously a sleeping area, and a small one filled with a harsh grit that at first baffled the young lioness until she realised that it was a place to do her 'business' without having to sleep in it, which was a thoughtful touch. The only other thing in the entrapment was a largish round thing high on the wall, which after a bit of investigation, she found contained water, although actually drinking was a bit of a challenge given that she was far more used to lapping than sucking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd taken stock of her immediate surroundings, Nala's attention turned to other things, like an examination of her surroundings so that when she escaped she'd have a vague idea of where to go. Unfortunately, the only way to see out was a line of holes at the top of the top of the box which would have been difficult to see out of at the best of times, and with the bumping, the task proved futile. They did let in sound though, but that told her not much, most of what she heard was unintelligible voices and an unnaturally continuous low growl.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nThe bumping around continued for some time, till late afternoon in fact, and Nala was glad to see the back of it when it finally stopped. For a few moment, Nala hoped that she was going to be released, but all that happened was a small hole was opened in one end of the entrapment and a piece of meat was pushed in. The young lioness examined the meat critically for a few moments, and found that it had an unusual smell, but then her stomach rumbled, announcing its hunger. For a few moments, she was inclined not to eat the meat, but then she realised that there would probably be little harm in it, if whoever had put her in here in the first place wanted to hurt her he hadn't done so so far, despite a wealth of opportunities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just the smell of the meat that was unusual either, the taste was unlike anything Nala had come across before. This was partly because the meat was from a domestic cow rather than a wild beast, but mostly because the meat contained another round of tranquillisers, not as strong as the ones as she'd been darted with, but longer lasting, which ensured that, after the young lioness had a good long sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey continued for several days, and by the end of it Nala was thoroughly sick of being stuck in the crate. She didn't see the end of of her time in it though, as she was in a tranquiliser induced coma when the truck stopped for the final time, and the crate was unloaded.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nNala awoke to find herself in...</span></div></div>",

She rubbed and then clawed at it, but was unable to dislodge the constriction. She did find however that it was attached to a thin cord that disappeared off to her right. she attempted to sever the cord, but whatever the shiny material was that the cord was made of, was harder than her teeth or claws. However, aside from a gentle pressure, it seemed to do nothing else, and so Nala let it be and began to examine her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area she was in was larger than the crate had been, four lengths long by a length and a half wide, by two lengths high, but it was still far from spacious, and it was actually quite chilly, being made mostly of some sort of smooth rock, though at one end there was an area of some black, odd-smelling and rather grippy material that she'd never encountered before. The only other adornments in the place were two depressions at the other end, one filled with water, the other being empty at the moment, and on the other side, a tray filled with the same harsh grit as she'd had in the crate, and so presumably for the same purpose. And that was it, apart from a tall rectangular panel - a door, though she didn't know that - made of some smooth, shiny rock that stood between the water-depression and the waste area. And that was it, there was nothing else there, well apart from whatever it was overhead that was producing the harsh, heatless light that illuminated the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Nala felt herself begin to grow truly bored. It was an unusual feeling, quite unlike what she'd once called boredom back when she was living with the pride. Back then, boredom had been simply a time when nothing <i>needed</i> doing, but this was the boredom of having nothing to do. Eventually however, the boredom was broken when...</span></div></div>",

She tried to resist it, but might as well have tried to fly by jumping off a rock, and so she found herself pulled towards the odd, black material until she was standing more-or less in the middle of it. The young lioness was still puzzling over what was going on, when she felt the material start to move beneath her! For a moment she tried to move with it, but the cord prevented her, and so she had to effectively 'walk' in place. Well, it started out as a walk at least, but seen she was having to more-or-less sprint to keep up, what in the world was going on?! She couldn't sprint forever though, and soon found herself slowing down, but fortunately whatever mysterious force was driving the surface beneath her feet sensed it, and slowed down to match, though not enough that she could relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed, as the speed gradually dropped until eventually the surface stopped moving, and the cord loosened off to the gentle pressure it had before, allowing Nala to make a beeline for the water-filled depression, where she was quick to quench her thirst. There was also something in the other depression now, some chunks a material she'd never come across before, with a consistency not unlike that of rotten wood though the taste was more like dusty meat. She wasn't terribly hungry, but her past had told her not to refuse food either, and so she ate the chunks, a process made a little easier after she learned she could soften them by dropping them in water and letting them soak for a little while.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n\"Well, that's an exercise baseline established for subject 52,\" said the man looking at the screen, which showed Nala resting, cooling off from her exercise, \"how long do you think it'll take?\"<br>\r\n\"A couple of weeks probably,\" replied the other man in the room, \"eventually that formula will have the same effect on her as it did on all the other though.\"<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nNala soon lost track of time, the lights overhead were constantly on, and there was no other indication of time passed besides the increasing number of times she'd been dragged onto the moving surface. And each time was the same, they'd run her up to her maximum, then gradually slacken the pace off just enough for her to keep up, before eventually allowing her to go and have a drink and eat whatever had been deposited in the other depression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime, however, didn't lose track of Nala, and eventually time told, as she...</span></div></div>",

When she had first arrived, the young lioness had been lean but muscular, with hardly a spare ounce on her lithe frame, but thanks to a combination of - unknown to her - metabolic altering injections and meals not of raw meat but of heavily processed 'food cubes', high in carbohydrates, that soon changed. At first the change was subtle, the slight amount of extra flesh herely softening her appearance slightly, but eventually things began to build up.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n\"Well, she's starting to, uh, adapt,\" said the man looking at the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already,\" the other man replied, mildly suprised, \"that's quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not much at the moment,\" The first man replied, \"a dozen or so pounds, and a K or two off her top speed.\"<br>\r\n\"So about average, then,\" the other man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, about that,\" the first man replied, \"but, er...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something on your mind,\" the second man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" the first man said, \"I've been trying to work it out, and I can't see how we're supposed to make a profit on this, I mean yeah, chair-de-lion is expensive, but is it really enough to pay for the facility, our wages and all that cattle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ours not to reason why,\" the second man replied, \"just be glad you've got a job.\"<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nIt took Nala bit longer to realise what was happening, her self-awareness hadn't developed properly in a world where she had to worry not only about herself but about every other member of her pride as well. Eventually though, even she became aware of her increasing size, and was not happy with it. There was little she could do though, her entire life was now controlled by forces beyond her control, and so her weight continued to increase, her belly filling out and a ribbon and a progressively growing ribbon of flesh appeared along the lower length of her body, all of which had a noticeable affect on both her speed and endurance. The only possibly welcome thing about all of this was that lying down was less uncomfortable, though the young lioness would gladly have done without the comfort to retain her previous size.</span></div></div>",

However, before the now rather portly lioness could make a decision, a figure stepped through the opening, jabbed her in he thigh with a long object, and left, closing the door behind him, leving her confused and a little sore, what was going on?<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n\"How many have we done now,\" the man with the pole asked his companion as he replaced the tranquillizer syringe on his pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty four now, and still another twenty one to go,\" his companion replied, \"I don't like that it took so long to find out about this, but I'm glad we've managed to catch them now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope we can find a cure,\" the first man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As do I,\" the second man replied, \"no wild animal should ever have to be forced into these conditions.\"<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nFor two days, Nala was again bumped around in a crate, this one seeming even more claustrophobic than the last, though whether it was actually smaller or just seemed so because of her larger size, the rotund young lioness was unable to tell. Oh nor everything was the same, one entire end of the crate was covered in mesh, allowing her a good view out, though there was in fact little to see, half of what was visible was a wooden wall and the rest a canvas screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her lack of physical views was somewhat made up for by the descriptions offered by the other lionesses, of whom three more were with her on this one 'metalbeast', all telling similar tales to her own, away from their prides alone or in pairs in the case of one of her companions, Upesi who'd been captured along with her sister Haraka, though she'd hot heard from her since the start of this ordeal. All told of the same thing after their capture as well, the same basic quarters, the same routine, the same increase in weight. When she enquired about their fate, none of them could come up with an answer, though one of the others, Kubwa by name was certain they were to have been killed and eaten, in her view there was no other reason to make them as big as they had. This thought cast a pall over the group for a time, as each lioness silently contemplated her own potential demise.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nAt the end of the journey, Nala was only too glad to escape the confines of the crate, and so when the end of the crate opened, she left as quickly as she could, to find herself in...</span></div></div>",

This was the end of the line for the young lioness, unable to perform even basic functions she knew she had to do something, and so sought to cut down on her food intake.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n\"Looks like she's trying to starve herself,\" said the man looking at the screen, \"that's two days now she's only eaten a part of her meals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't have that,\" the other man said, \"fix her water with appetite enhancers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do,\" the first man replied.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nFor a short while, Nala was hopeful that her plan might work, but then the taste of the water changed, and she she suddenly found herself constantly hungry, unable to leave so much as a crumb of the food-chunks.

At the very center of it, once there, they lowered the platform down to roll her off. A lone scientist gave her an injection of a serum formula, a new one. This serum would help her keep her a hundred percent healthy no matter how much weight she gained, she would rapidly digest any and all food she eats into tons of pure flabby fat like one pound  digested would equal a ton gained, she'd gain weight all over her body even her tail, she would always be hungry during the day with a deep gluttonous hunger and the most important would be that she would become attracted, sexually attracted to the next human male that she see next time she wakes and want him to be her mate and feeder, even mating and during mating would make her rapidly fatten out all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lone scientist turned and left the room but not before letting a few people carry and deposit a lone young adult human male they had captured and brought to the place, they made sure that he didn't have any family, to them he was another person that had gone on an African Safari Tour but been an unwilling recruit for their secret project.

Until one day when she woke up instead of waking up to a chain she woke up to an opens door leading to sunlight. She sprinted towards the door but was stopped by her weight. So instead she more or less waddled to the door. The sun felt so good on her skin. She made her way to a watering whole about 2 hours later. Finally water. She thought. As she lapped at the pond she noticed her reflection. She gasped at her new form. Her stomachs was sagging emencly and her rump was VERY wide as well. She was not happy about her new look. Oh well nothing I can do about it now. She thought. So she started off in the direction of a nearby jungle.</span></div></div>",

How can you be hungry, she though. Well she was hungry and she had to eat so she decided to hunt. After waddling in the heat for awhile she saw a hog with its back turned. This is my chance, she thought. Except just as she was about to pounce a male lion attacked her. Clearly he wants the kill, she thought. Nala fought back. She scratched and tackled and finally she pinned the male lion. She noticed her flappy stomach sagging onto his belly. How humiliating, she thought. For a moment the male lion seemed crushed under her weight. Then a look of realization came across his face. \"Nala?\" He said. \"Simba?\" Nala said. She got off of him. No she was REALLY embarrassed about her weight. After the 2 had their little reunion she noticed Simba staring at her flab. It wasn't just Simba but his friends also stared. Thankfully though Simba didn't ask how it happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Simba and Nala walked through the jungle. \"Try this,\" he said as he swung from a vine and landed in a pond. Nala looked down. This will be embarrassing, she thought. She bit the vine and swung but in mid air the vine stabbed under her weight and she fell in the water with a gigantic splash. How mortifying, she thought. Simba laughed at her fall. I'm sure it did look funny, she thought, all that fat jiggleding in the air. She shoved Simba back in the pond. As they walked up the hill (well Nala waddled) even Simba could see that she was tired. </span></div></div>",
