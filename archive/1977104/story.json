Frankie noticed that her care packages she sent were being put to good use, especially with Sue. Each month Sue would receive a package full of clothes, school supplies and more importantly homemade snacks. It was obvious from the first sight of Sue that she was eating the brownies, cookies and cakes Frankie was feeding Mike at home.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you kids,\u201d Frankie excitingly said. \u201cYour father and I really missed you.\u201d<br>\r\nMike could barely move from his recliner after the huge meal Frankie fed him after work so he nodded acknowledging his two kids precence.<br>\r\nWhen Sue walked in the room it became clear that she had put on a good 15 pounds in just a few weeks. Her jeans looked painted on her frumpy body and looked as if they could burst at any moment. She wore a belt which she thought would help keep her Vicky secrets from being exposed. Also in the care package Frankie made sure to send Sue clean underpants. She would send her value packs of cheap panties until Sue told her that she would only wear them if they were from Victoria\u2019s Secret because she thought they were more cool for a girl her age. Frankie still bought her colorful prints and designs to wear secretly hoping that one day that she would one day expose them unexpectedly.<br>\r\n\u201cMom, what are we having for dinner,\u201d Sue said in an exasperated tone. \u201cI am starved and haven\u2019t had a good home cooked meal in what feels like a decade.\u201d<br>\r\nFrankie had just made a smorgasbord of a dinner. She had turkey, ham, mashed potatoes, stuffing, green bean casserole and that didn\u2019t even include what she whipped up for dessert. <br>\r\n\u201cHoney since you didn\u2019t have Thanksgiving with us I decided to make it for you tonight,\u201d Frankie said.<br>\r\nAxl made a break for his room when his cellphone rang. \u201cWelp gotta go he said. Important phone call,\u201d he said sarcastically. Frankie knew her best opportunity was Sue tonight. She would get Axl later, hoping to see the cute little briefs she had been sending him. She scoffed at the idea of him wandering around the house in boxers and decided to put an end to it. Unlike Sue, Axl didn\u2019t care what he wore underneath his clothing, so Frankie sent him value packs of briefs in all sorts of colors except for white. <br>\r\nHis time would come to be exposed. <br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Sue\u2019s stomach let out a growl and seemed to expand her belly. Frankie saw her long sleeve shirt begin to untuck itself from her jeans and knew she had to feed her fast if she wanted to embarrass her daughter. As Sue made a run for the kitchen table, Frankie noticed her faint panty line underneath her jeans. It was time to get her out of her pants. </span></div></div>",

Frankie said gleefully. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty more where that come from. I made your favorite brownies.\u201d<br>\r\nSue looked at her as if she saw a ghost. There was no way she could possibly eat another bite. She could feel her tummy cutting into her jeans. All she wanted to do is retreat to her room and change into a comfortable pair of sweat pants. She knew if she had seconds or dessert she would be in serious danger of bursting her favorite pair of jeans open. Not only that but she would expose her secrets to her Mom and Dad. While Sue had been caught in her undies before, she dreaded the thought of it happening again.<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll save desert for tomorrow,\u201d Sue said as she began to get up from the table but struggled to move from the chair. Her round hips had gotten stuck in the chair and without a budge she was stuck. <br>\r\n\u201cMom could you help me up, I can\u2019t seem to get up on my own, \u201cSue said with a bit of fear in her voice. <br>\r\nAt that moment she felt a ping from her jeans as the button had popped off, flying across the dinner table striking refrigerators door. A small \u201cV\u201d was beginning to form between her belt and zipper pushing her pants open just the slightest that you could make out the white scallloped waistband of her panties. <br>\r\nFrankie could see that her plan was working. She wanted to speed up the process so she asked Mike to grab the brownies.<br>\r\n\u201cMom I said I didn\u2019t want dessert, I\u2019m full as it is,\u201d Sue said. She tried to cover her crotch but was immediately caught off guard when two handcuffs shot out of the chair trapping her. She began to panic and try to slip out of the cuffs. <br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you doing this to me,\u201d Sue whimpered. \u201cIs it because I didn\u2019t come home earlier? I said I was sorry.\u201d<br>\r\nAs she thrashed around violently her zipper slowly pushed itself down revealing more of her panty waistband. The words \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret\u201d could clearly be seen as well as more of the white printed material of her panties. Sue noticed this and quickly stopped thrashing around as her brother and two of his friends entered the room.<br>\r\n\u201cNow are you going to eat dessert on your own  or am I going to have to force it down your throat myself,\u201d Frankie said.<br>\r\nOne way or another Sue found herself in a no win situation. Her pants were coming off sooner rather than later. </span></div></div>",

Sue\u2019s bra and panties both had little hearts on them. The panties were partially swallowed by her deep ass crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here food and get in my belly.\u201d said Sue as she dove into the pile of desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cramming doughnuts into her mouth. She took the round fried pastries four bites at a time, her chins wobbling as she chewed, her round cheeks full and puffy. She was still fidgeting with bliss, causing the chair below her bottom to creak. Though it was growing more slowly now, Sue's enormous ass was still taking on new fat, and over the past few days it had widened, spreading itself further across the cushions of her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue ate and ate and ate and ate and ate. Frankie brought over the fifth box of doughnuts, which contained an assorted dozen. At the end of the fourth box, Sue started feeling full. She was overwhelmed with greed and gluttony, however, so the moment she saw the last box she forgot her limitations. She crammed each doughnut into her mouth, breathing harder every passing moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the last cinnamon sugar doughnut slid past her lips and down her neck. \"URRRPP!!\" she let out a deep belch. She had eaten five dozen doughnuts, more lard and fat and grease than most people consumed in a week. Her belly was round and hard and full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue decided she was tired and went to bed.</span></div></div>",

Mountains of dishes were piled high \u2013 so high it seemed like the table must give out under the immense load it was being asked to support. Amongst the platters and servers stacked with potatoes, vegetables, great boats of gravy, and endless little pots of cranberry sauce, Sue could spot three vast, golden, shining turkeys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three took their seats and waited for Frankie to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell come on, everyone, the food\u2019s not just for decoration!\u201d cried Frankie with a smile, gesturing to the table and nodding encouragingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue stuffed herself with reckless abandon, slurping and sucking down everything that her constantly busy mother could throw at her. Frankie\u2019s powers of culinary mass production were tested to the limit. It wasn\u2019t long before the stock of food on the table was running low, the titanic feast being destroyed by the remarkable gluttony of Mike, Axl and Sue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three were feasting the door opened and Brick came in from his friends. Brick had been eating the same fatty foods his dad had, so he was a bit bigger than Axl but still smaller than his dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie was the only one to notice him and went over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, why are they eating without me and why is Sue and Axl fat?\u201d Brick asked feeling really hungry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were all so hungry and couldn\u2019t wait for you to get home.

I would love to get fat with you,\" Frankie said with a big smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Frankie got up early so she could eat a lot without the rest of the family stealing her food. She kicked off her preparations by turning on the stove and flinging the refrigerator door wide open. Anything she could get her hands on became apart of her meal. Eggs, pancake mix, chocolate flavored pop tarts, cinnamon for french toast, lots of butter, orange juice, etc. Thirty minutes of constant cooking, turning from the toast to the skillet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started off taking her sweet time, cutting slices of waffle and stabbing them with her fork, lifting it up to her mouth and chewing the buttery, syrupy delight. Her spine tingled positively taking in the alluring flavor. But, as the meal went on, Frankie\u2019s appetite steamrolled over the cuisine. Pancakes only lasted half a minute to have Frankie\u2019s attention to turn to the pop tarts that satisfied her chocolate sweet tooth, then the french toast that joined the bacon wrapped pork sausages. Frankie managed to diminish the gallons of milk and orange juice into empty cartons over the course of the meal to compliment other tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much time passed until Frankie finished everything. Her desire to make sure she was full drove her to lick the pancake plate clean. No syrup drenched crumb is safe from her gluttony.

The family was soon outgrowing their wardrobes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo months passed in a blur of food. Frankie was getting everyone's measurements before going back to school clothes shopping.  Frankie pulled the 60\" tape measure around Axl's belly and the ends don't meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie smiles slightly, she didn't know why she had bothered. Sue's hips had just passed 60\", her own were even bigger and her belly had recently passed the point where she was bigger around than her 63\" height. Mike's belly was in the 80s now, why would her son be any different? She pulled out the 120\" tape measure and slipped it around Axl's belly, 64\" looks like she wasn't the only round one in the family. She slipped it down to his hips, 63\" she wondered if men's pants would still fit right. Axl steps up onto the scale, it flashes for a moment and displays 304 pounds. \"Wow! You're over 300, you're getting big like your Dad. Now can you help me check my weight?\" Axl agreed and stepped back, Frankie stepped up onto the scale, her belly blocking her view of the scale completely. Axl looked up \"You're 412 pounds,\" he patted her belly and left to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir shopping trip was surprisingly unsuccessful. Sure they found clothes that fit Sue, Axl and Brick, but they couldn't find the pieces of the school's uniform. Much to Axl, Sue and Brick's chagrin the jeans they found that fit were the same Super Pear brand their Mom wears, the progressive sizes they bought started fitting them and ended quite a bit larger than what Frankie needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout uniforms they would need to change to homeschooling, but given how they'd gotten used to eating Frankie doubted they would complain. But would Frankie's belly let her focus on teaching her kids or would they stuff themselves even more?</span></div></div>",

However since today was a big day Frankie made a special breakfast and by the time everyone could get up and move to the sofas in the living room they had missed most of the time she had allowed for the first class. The next class was supposed to be P.E. but it was raining so they couldn't swim in their pool, so Frankie had to fall back to her exercise tapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several options available. Belly Busters, Thunder Thigh Thinner, Hyper Aerobics, they all sounded too intense for a first class. Then she spotted the perfect one, The Couch Potato Workout, it was a basic workout designed to be done on the couch. She popped it in and joined her kids on the sofa. A slightly tubby lady in 80s workout gear came on the screen and started them slowly with some stretches. Within minutes all four had fallen asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumbling bellies woke them up, Frankie didn't want to cook so she ordered a massive feast from local delivery places. Within 30 minutes food started arriving. Mexican, Chinese, Italian, Pizza, Burgers, they all flowed into hungry bellies until they were stuffed absolutely full. This lead to another round of food comas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mike got home he was greeted by a view of Axl, Sue and Brick's stuffed bellies while they napped on the sofa. He could hardly believe they had eaten so much before dinner. Mike went to find Frankie. He found her cooking up a storm in the kitchen and having to work around her stuffed belly. Mike was shocked by how big she was and how sexy she looked. She looked over and smiled at him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I hope you're hungry, I've got big plans for dinner tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike helped her move the dining room table into the living room so Axl, Sue and Brick wouldn't have to get up, then loaded it with food. Frankie made sure Mike was absolutely stuffed that night. While he was normally good for thirds or occasionally fourths under Frankie's care he got to sixths and only stopped there because they had cleared the table. Mike tried to stand to clear off the dishes but found himself pinned by his full belly. He wasn't alone though, it looked like everyone else shared his predicament.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter an hour Frankie was finally able to get up, she cleared the dishes and started bringing in dessert. There were pies, cakes, cookies, and brownies, and even in their stuffed states his kids moved to get more food. Frankie placed a whole cake on his belly and handed him a fork. She sat down next to him with her own cake. An hour later everyone was waddling off to bed, Frankie helped Mike get up, it took a couple tries since their bellies kept getting in the way. They had one of the greatest nights of their marriage, they couldn't keep their hands off their stuffed bellies.<br>\r\nThis was the start of a new routine.</span></div></div>",

Frankie laid on her back with her legs apart allowing her belly rest between them while her doughy arms rested under her large meaty breasts. Despite the cool bedroom air Frankie still sweated continually and felt very warm to the touch. She slept with very little cover, only a small blanket that hid her torso from the base of her chest down just barely reaching her thighs, leaving her arms and legs fully exposed. Frankie's weight made her sink into the memory foam mattress, while also putting much stress on the wooden bed frame. Frankie rested there peacefully and motionless until the aroma of food enters through the doorway awaking Frankie's senses. Frankie, still in a sleepful daze, could make out the scent of bacon, pancakes and other breakfast foods coming from the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie's bedroom was filled with the scent of an all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet making her mouth watered as she licked her lips. Frankie's mind was set on food, but her body said otherwise. Her desire for food was equal to her desire of wanting to stay in her comfy bed. Contemplating whether to leave her comfortable bed or partake in a delicious meal. Eventually, Frankie turns to look at her clock, 9:26 a.m, take a deep breath and sighs, she knew at some point she would have to get out of bed. Frankie takes another deep breath and mentally prepares herself to leave her bed. She pulls her belly from between her thighs and with a grunt she attempts to throw her right leg over the left one to turn over. Moving her fat leg was more strainful then she'd imagine. Her right leg comes crashing back down beside the left causing all the fat in the lower half of her body to shake. Her body had sunk into the mattress, making it more difficult to remove herself from the bed, so she decides to try a different method. Frankie begins to shift all her weight left and right hoping to wiggle her way out of the indent. With every twist and turn all the fat in her body, mostly her barrel-like legs, would sway side to side in a wave-like motion. Frankie was not just rocking her body, but the entire bedframe itself. The sounds of her fat thighs slapping against one another and the creaking of the wooden bed frame, grow louder, filling the bedroom and before Frankie has the chance to make a second attempt the sound splitting wood stuns her! Both legs on the right side of the bed frame had snapped, soon followed by the left legs and the crashing sound of the entire bed frame hitting the floor! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the collapsing bed frame could be heard all throughout the house. Frankie lays there on the mattress in a slight panic, still trying to rape her mind around the experience. Soon Frankie could hear the heavy footsteps and the panting breath of her daughter Sue outside the bedroom. Sue enters the bedroom, eyes widen, mouth dropped and sweaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, MY GOD! Mom are you, *huff* OKAY!?\" asked a startled Sue, holding onto the doorframe and wiping sweat from her forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Frankie answer her daughter she collects her thoughts. \"Yes!\" huffed, Frankie breathing heavily, trying to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her mother unharmed Sue clams down but was still sweating from dashing to her mother's room. \"What happened?\" asked Sue<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie looks down at her blubber bloated body and the destroyed bed frame, not wanting to admit what she has done. \"I'm not sure, I guess this bed has reached its peak. Your father and I have had this bed for years, it even older than you.\" Frankie replied trying to choose her words carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue knows exactly what had happened but decides not to interrogate her mother any further. \"Yay, this bed has always looked like a death trap. Well don't worry, just stay in bed and I'll bring you your breakfast then clean up this mess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Frankie let out in a sigh of relief, believing that she had fooled her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue wabbles slowly to the kitchen, still exhausted from dashing to her mother's room earlier. As Sue makes her way back to the kitchen a sense of pride overtakes her. Seeing her mother destroy a bed gives Sue the impression that her plan to fatten up her mother was coming along perfectly and that this situation has also given her the opportunity she had only dreamed of. Sue enters the kitchen where she had already prepared enough food for a large group of people to eat and some more. Sue pulls out a large tray from a cabinet and stacks it with bacon, pancakes, muffins, fried eggs, hash browns, and other breakfast foods with a liter of orange-flavored soda on the side. Sue treks to her mother's room with a heavy tray of food in her arms. Sue finds her mother still in bed and places the tray below her mother's breasts, Sue could the hunger in her eyes. Frankie focused on nothing but food, grab handfuls of food ignoring the utensils on the side of the tray. Sue smiles as she watched her mother shovel down mounds of food. In what seemed like seconds Frankie has eaten all the food on the tray. Sue takes the tray away from her mother, so she can retrieve more food for her glutton mommy. Sue repeats this action until she cleans the debris from around the bed. Sue starts preparing feast like this for every meal, but with different foods and more of them, and it soon becomes a daily routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-One Week Later-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old bed had been replaced with a modern/lower model bed. In just one week Frankie had gained a tremendous amount of weight in a short amount of time due to new slothish lifestyle and new eating habits. Frankie now weighed 582 pounds and was closing in on 600 fast. With her recent gain, Frankie was nearly bedbound, only leaving the comfort of her bed to use the bathroom. Most of the weight still journeyed to her already massive hips and ass, making more difficult to walk with every pound gained. Unless something changes, Frankie was the right track to being bedbound and immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne month later and the Hecks are huge and\u2026</span></div></div>",

'Damn! I never felt this hungry before! God, I got to get something to eat!' Frankie thought as she got up and headed for the kitchen. Within minutes, Frankie began digging through the refrigerator. Pretty soon, she had a huge array of food on the table. Frankie licked her lips and began digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stuffed food down her throat, Frankie's belly slowly started to swell. 'Mmm! This is so good!' she thought happily as she took a bite out of a large slab of ham. Eventually, she had eaten all of the food in the refrigerator. Frankie's belly, once small and flat, had pushed out from under her shirt and became a round, fat pot belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie rubbed her stuffed tummy and let out a groan. \"Oh man...\" she whined, \"My belly...and my thighs...have gotten big...oh...\" Licking her lips, Frankie lifted herself up and felt her swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, I ate a lot! Now I need to sleep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly lifting herself up, Frankie waddled her way over to the couch, her entire body jiggling a bit every now and then. Once she sat down, Frankie examined the results of her stuffing. Her new round bloated belly had pushed up her shirt a lot as it hung a few inches over her pants. Frankie's shirt was having a tough time keeping in the girl's new, larger breasts as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs had even expanded quite a bit, leaving two big rips on the sides of her pants were soft fleshy flabs of fat lightly hung out. Letting out another blech, Frankie laid down and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie would eat like this everyday and one month later...</span></div></div>",

Her hips swelled against the confines of her white pants almost like she wore a hoop skirt, but her obese ass was even bigger, so big now they could see it from the front. Her breasts swelled like watermelons, bulging through the hot pink polo shirt she wore, but her belly stuck out much further. That belly jutted in front of her, the first thing of hers to enter a room, sagging in pale rolls past mid-thigh; her drawstring pants worked hard to contain it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie decided to go out for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie pulled the car into the parking lot of a fast food joint that she particularly liked. The Happy Tomato was a colorful restaurant that served giant burgers. Breakfast was always her favorite meal of the day, and she liked nothing more than a big plate of burgers and fries, washed down by a couple of milkshakes to start the day with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie went up to order, and feeling a bit hungry ordered a breakfast platter for herself. As she waited for the food, Frankie looked around the restaurant. There were several mothers with their kids. Quite a few of the young kids were chubby, and some were downright fat. Frankie turned around a saw her friend Nancy Donahue come up to order more food. \"Morning\" said Nancy as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy\u2019s breasts had swelled outwards, as she had been forced to buy a new set of bras, after they broke her last one due to her exhaling after a large mouthful of sushi. They were like volleyballs in size, though they jiggled like water balloons when she attempted anything faster than a walk. Her butt had also expanded too, causing her pants to become dangerously tight around her butt, and resulting in an earthquake of jiggling flesh whenever she walked quickly. Her stomach, on the other hand, was noticeably bigger, forming a rounded mass which refused to be fully covered by any of Nancy's clothing, and which led to her displaying slight peeks of flesh when she walked out on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" said Frankie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, I love this place, they do really nice food here. And it's so healthy - all the food is organic and not that processed junk you see people eating. Have you been before?\" asked Nancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, many times! I love getting a good breakfast\". Frankie said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, when you get your food, why don't you come over and join me?\" replied Nancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing\" said Frankie, and turned to pay the cashier and pick up their massive breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie put the tray of food down on the table in front of Nancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we eat?\" said Frankie, indicating her own breakfast platter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let's eat!\" said Nancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, the two Moms fell to chatting. Frankie ate her own breakfast platter quickly, and finished a little before Nancy. Nancy ate from the big bowl of nachos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Frankie went back up to the cashier to order the food, the other mother by her side to do the same. Frankie made sure she ordered more than Nancy had. Both soon had their food and rushed to their table to eat the meal.</span></div></div>",

Frankie opened the front door. \u201cThere you are, right on time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two hefty Moms go and get changed. Both had changed into leotards for their workout. It was clear that both women had bought their work out clothes years ago when they had had much slimmer figures. \u201cGosh, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d gotton so big\u201d said Frankie, squirming slightly in her tight leotard, and placing her hands on her meaty backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean\u201d said Nancy, staring down at her sagging tummy and bulging love handles, all prominently outlined by a leotard that was even more strained than Frankie\u2019s. Frankie bent over to put the tape in the machine, displaying her enormous bum and thick thighs to the room. \u201cOomph\u201d said Frankie, standing up, \u201cthat should start in a moment\u201d. Nancy nodded, shifting slightly out of the way to give Frankie room as she walked back from the TV. Nancy\u2019s big belly quivered as she moved, shaking flabbily with each tiny movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV burst into life as the video started to play. Loud, blaring music filled the room, and a sport young woman dressed in a sleek leotard that showed off her toned body leapt onto the screen. The girl sported a manic smile and blindingly white teeth, and almost at once started shouting enthusiastic advice to her televisual audience, whilst leaping madly around the screen. \u201cOk, girls, let\u2019s hit the max burn with hi-five power!!!\u201d she exclaimed, and promptly sprang into a series of energetic star jumps. Giggling slightly, and looking nervous, the two Moms tried to follow the hyper aerobics instructor. Throwing themselves into the air as far as they could manage, Frankie and Nancy started to do star jumps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor shook with the impact of the heavy Moms, and their lycra-clad flesh wobbled madly. Frankie\u2019s portly derriere was out of control, bouncing up and down with each movement. Nancy\u2019s heavy belly wobbled erratically, threatening to throw her off balance. Puffing furiously, the unfit women did about five star jumps in the time it had taken the presenter to do twenty. But now the music had changed, and the brightly-smiling youth had started doing a whole new exercise. \u201cOk ladies, let\u2019s do some step-up work! Feel the burn, yeah! Yeah, Yeah!\u201d she shouted, pumping the air with her fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear, we don\u2019t have steppers\u201d said Frankie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.....*puff*....matter...*wheeze*...\u201d gasped Nancy \u201cwe can just lift our legs in rhythm\u201d. As the perky instructor bobbed up and down on her stepper, Nancy and Frankie lifted one leg up and then the other. Frankie found her chunky legs hard to hold up, they were so heavy. Nancy had thinner legs, but her big tummy kept getting in the way of her attempts to lift up her legs. As they wore out, the women took a brief break sweating heavily and breathing hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntending to finish the whole tape, the two women in fact managed only a further ten minutes of exercise before they gave up. The energetic young aerobics presenter had introduced sit-ups as an exercise. Doing thirty in quick succession, her perky voice had shouted inane slogans and encouragements to her audience. But, try as they might, neither Nancy nor Frankie could manage to perform a single sit up. Nancy\u2019s belly was just too big to let her struggle upright. Frankie had a much smaller tummy, but her abdominal muscles had long since turned to fat, and she was too out of shape to complete a sit-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter groaning and straining for the five minute exercise, Frankie said with a puff \u201cRight, I think we should take a little break\u201d. \u201cAgreed!\u201d said a relieved Nancy. Leaning on each other for support, the two well-fed women pulled themselves upright and walked into the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019d both like a drink \u2013 what can I get you, Nancy? Water, juice, or an ice-cold soda?\u201d asked Frankie, opening the door of the massive refrigerator. \u201cOooh, a soda sounds good!\u201d said Nancy, who was glowing red. A big sweat-stain stood out on her leotard. Frankie bent over, leaning into the bottom of the fridge to get a big bottle of coke. As she did so, another few stitches snapped on the seat of her leotard, adding to the small hole forming in the over-stretched fabric. Plodding over to the other side of the kitchen, Frankie took down a couple of tall pint glasses from a shelf. She brimmed both glasses, draining the bottle of cola. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s sit down \u2013 take the weight off our feet\u201d said Frankie, indicating the small chairs around the little kitchen table. Putting the towering glasses of coke on the table, Frankie moved over to the table and sat down with Nancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two bulky Moms lowered their hefty bodies onto the tiny wooden chairs carefully, each self-conscious about the strain their hundreds of pounds would put on the fragile furniture. The chairs creaked and groaned under the load, but held firm. Sighing with relief at getting off her feet, Frankie said \u201cI don\u2019t know why we have these itty bitty chairs, really. I\u2019m far too big for them, I\u2019m afraid\u201d. Frankie\u2019s wide bottom hung far over the edge of the seat on both sides. She would need to use at least two of the narrow seats to support the full breadth of her broad bum. \u201cOh nonsense!\u201d said Nancy, \u201cYou\u2019re barely able to fill that chair as it is! Besides, we\u2019ve both probably lost 10lbs in that workout!\u201d. They both laughed, genuinely believing that their 40 minute attempt at exercise would have made up for years of slothful laziness and over-eating. \u201cYes, you\u2019re probably right \u2013 I think I can feel my thighs toning up already!\u201d said Frankie, imagining herself as the sleek athletic girl she had been back in her teens. \u201cWell I\u2019m sure that after a whole afternoon of working out, I\u2019ll have lost at least an inch from my waistline!\u201d, said Nancy. \u201cOh, almost undoubtedly \u2013 if not more than an inch. I actually think you look a little slimmer already, no kidding\u201d said Frankie in a serious voice. \u201cI know\u201d, she said in a mischievous tone, \u201cwe should both have a little treat for working so hard! How would you like a slice of the triple-chocolate cake I\u2019ve made for the school\u2019s bake sale? I can always bake another\u201d she said. \u201cOh yes! We deserve it! Got to keep our strength up, and there\u2019s no point doing exercise if you can\u2019t indulge a little bit afterwards\u201d said Nancy eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from the table, Frankie walked over to the refrigerator again, her meaty thighs rubbing together and giving her a pronounced waddle. Opening the fridge, she pulled out an enormous cake on a plate. It was a rich brown color, with thick chocolate icing dripping from the top and a deep layer of mouth-watering chocolate cream in the middle. Placing it on the table, Frankie got plates and knives, and sat back down on the chair, which made further protests as the obese woman wiggled her heavy rump around to get comfortable. \u201cHere, let me cut you a slice\u201d, said Frankie, wielding the knife and cutting an enormous slice of cake for Nancy. \u201cMmm, thanks, it looks delicious!\u201d said Nancy. Frankie cut herself a similar sized piece, and both women took dainty little bites from their slices, not wanting to appear greedy in front of the other. \u201cWow, that\u2019s great! So moist and rich!\u201d exclaimed Nancy, and she took a bigger second bite. \u201cWhy thank you! I can easily give you the recipe\u201d said Frankie, flushed with pride. \u201cMmmmmm, you must! This is divine!\u201d said Nancy, swallowing another large mouthful. Soon, both had finished their slices. \u201cMore?\u201d inquired Frankie, pointing the knife at the cake. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t....\u201d said Nancy, sheepishly, \u201coh, but go on! Just one more slice won\u2019t hurt!\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d, said Frankie, cutting another two large slices. Taking deep draughts of their soda, the women washed down mouthful after mouthful of chocolate cake. All the while, they chatted about their weight problems, comforting one another and reassuring themselves that there was no fair reason that they had both gained so much weight. \u201cI eat SO carefully\u201d said Frankie, cutting herself another slice of cake, \u201cbut I just can\u2019t seem to keep the pounds off. I have no idea why\u201d. \u201cOh I know what you mean\u201d, sympathised Nancy as she refilled her glass with cola, \u201cI just get heavier and heavier each year, and no one can explain why!\u201d \u201cIt is a mystery, isn\u2019t it?\u201d mumbled Frankie through a mouthful of cake. \u201cSay, you know what goes great with my chocolate cake? My home-baked Apple Pie! I just made one yesterday, you\u2019ve got to try it! Let me go get it!\u201d exclaimed Frankie, standing up. \u201cWhat a good idea! If it\u2019s as great as this cake, i\u2019ll need the recipe for the pie too!\u201d replied Nancy cheerfully. Plopping the pie tin down next to the cake, Frankie sat back down. Munching away on cake and pie, the two women continued to chat enthusiastically about their high hopes for weight loss now that they were exercising together.</span></div></div>",

After all, they had both been working so hard, didn't they deserve a break? It was Frankie who had offered to meet them at Greasy Burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreasy Burger was a fast food restaurant known best for its extremely unhealthy food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nancy got there, Frankie already had one of the tables around the huge jungle gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a shame we can\u2019t work out today \u2013 I\u2019m so sorry that this knee of mine prevents me,\u201d apologized Nancy. \u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2013 it\u2019s nice to get a break sometimes,\u201d said Frankie, secretly glad to get out of aerobics for a week. Although both women had indeed been meeting regularly to workout, they had continued to steadily gain weight throughout. Since they snacked together so heavily after their aerobics sessions, they cancelled out all their efforts to lose weight. Bulging out of their outfits, both house moms looked positively porcine as they munched away at some giant triple deck burgers they\u2019d ordered for themselves. Frankie\u2019s big bum bulged far out over the edge of the wooden chair she was sitting on. Nancy continued to add inches to her massive belly, and her heavy tummy reached out far over her lap. Both of them together were a veritable portrait for the obesity epidemic. Guzzling their way through thousands of calories-worth of food, the quartet was quite oblivious to their expanding waist-lines. Frankie and Nancy were both in a state of denial about their seemingly unstoppable weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChatting away, Frankie and Nancy wondered what to do with the afternoon. Normally they\u2019d have been happy to get some more snacks and go to their respective homes and spend the day watching TV and lazing around. But Frankie, who felt a little adventurous, suggested something quite unusual. \u201cI know, let\u2019s go to the park! There\u2019s a nice walk to the top of the hill overlooking the town \u2013 it\u2019d be a great thing to do on such a nice day!\u201d Nancy wasn\u2019t so sure about the walk. \u201cSounds like a plan, Frankie, let\u2019s get some desserts here and then drive on. A gentle walk is just the kind of exercise that will help us slim down!\u201d said Nancy as she ordered a triple chocolate fudge cake with whipped cream and hot chocolate sauce.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After finishing dessert at Greasy Burger the quartet was ready to set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving a little later at the park the sun was shining brightly and the day looked perfect. The park was busy, and all around families were enjoying the nice weather. Folks were having picnics and playing sports. Two trim women dressed in lycra jogged past, clearly keeping their bodies in excellent shape through exercise. Frankie and Nancy sat on a park bench after a short walk, feeling a little winded. \u201cWow, what a great day!\u201d said Nancy, sounding surprised. Nancy wasn\u2019t very keen on the outdoors, and spent most everyday indoors. Frankie was quite different and liked being outside. Back in her younger days, Frankie had been a keen hiker and had done a little bit of mountain climbing whilst in college. \u201cThere\u2019s the hill,\u201d said Frankie, pointing at a gentle rise ahead of them, \u201cyou get a great view over the town from the top. Let\u2019s get going!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the hill Frankie and Nancy were chatting on the bench. They were eating hot dogs. They also had cups of ice cold soda. They ate and drank for a little while. Then an ice cream cart came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ice cream?\" Frankie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, why not?\" Nancy smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got up and requested large ice creams. They were given jumbo sundaes. They paid the lady behind the cart and went to sit down on the bench again. They immediately began eating the ice cream, cramming it down their throats with much haste. Frankie's rear began to stretch outwards over the edge of the bench, and Nancy's stomach was beginning to stretch forwards even more. They ate and ate, oblivious to this. Soon the bowls were empty and they tossed them in the trashcan next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext a cart selling giant hot pretzels came up. Frankie and Nancy immediately bought a few of them, and they sat on the bench, stuffing the pretzels into their mouths, washing them down with fresh sodas. They were enjoying it so much they failed to notice they were still stretching their bodies outwards and forwards. They were laughing and talking and stuffing and gorging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a cart selling pizza slices. It brought out the inner pigs in the two moms. They both bought four slices and two more sodas. They sat at the bench and slide the slices into their mouths, still swapping stories between bites and through mouthfuls of cheese and bread. It seemed as though they were unaware of how large they were growing. They were consuming thousands of calories with each swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, all the paper plates and cups were in the nearby trashcan, which was now filled to the brim. It was not unlike Frankie and Nancy, who were both leaning back on the bench. Frankie's rear and hips were a bit more spread, and she was clutching her also growing belly. Nancy was leaning back and with both hands placed on top of her potbelly, which stretched out ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the ice cream cart came by again. Frankie looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ice cream?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding down a burp, Nancy looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again? Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both struggled to their feet and ordered more ice cream, asking for it to be piled on high. Once that was paid for, they carried their ice cream back to the bench. Forgetting to use their spoons, they dove in face-first, swallowing the ice cream whole as it slid down their throats. Eating, slurping, munching, licking, gorging, stuffing... You know, taking on food, pretty much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they were placing the bowls in the trash can. They leaned back again. They were GLAD they weren't exercising today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a *beautiful* day!\" Nancy groaned, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, isn't it?\" Frankie sighed, wiping her face with a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to get dinner now?\" Nancy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie smiled at the idea. \"Sure, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie and Nancy heaved themselves off the bench. They both waddled with ease down the hill. The moms were trying to keep back hiccups and burps as they struggled to digest their indulgent. Finally, they reached the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie found her seat a little tight around the rear, so she adjusted the seat a little and buckled up. Nancy sat in the passenger's side and attempted to buckle up, but her bulging potbelly blocked the seat belt from reaching its proper place. She had to back the seat up and lean back a little to finally buckle up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you suppose we can't lose weight?\" Frankie wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a mystery to me,\" Nancy replied, unbuttoning her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey drove out of the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey might just have both stuffed themselves full of a week\u2019s worth of calories, but Frankie and Nancy were still feeling hungry enough to want to gorge themselves even more. Rolling out of the park in the car, Frankie rubbed her flabby belly and wondered where they should go to get dinner. \u201cWhat d\u2019you think you\u2019d like to eat, Nancy,\u201d asked Frankie, \u201cI think I could go from some more burgers and cheese fries, how\u2019d you feel about that?\u201d \u201cMmmmm, sounds delicious, I liked those burgers at lunch, but we had so few I didn\u2019t really get to satisfy my appetite!\u201d replied Nancy, licking her plump lips in anticipation. \u201cRight, back to Greasy Burger!\u201d said Frankie, pulling out onto the highway.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Driving to the restaurant, Frankie and Nancy chatted about how much fun they were having today. \u201cYou know, Nancy, I\u2019m actually glad you weren\u2019t able to do aerobics today. It\u2019s been great to get a break and spoil ourselves just a little. Too much dieting and exercise can get boring!\u201d said Frankie. \u201cI know what you mean \u2013 I feel like we totally deserve a break from our fitness regime. We\u2019ve been so good that we owe ourselves a timeout from starving ourselves\u201d agreed Nancy. Giggling about how \u201cgood\u201d they\u2019d been, the two Mom\u2019s didn\u2019t seem to remember that neither of them had ever got around to going on a diet at all, and in fact each of them had been eating steadily more since they\u2019d started trying to work out together. Any outside observer would also have found it odd that Frankie and Nancy didn\u2019t seem to think it bad that in fact they were still both piling on the pounds in spite of their so-called fitness regime. Each time they met to work out the tubby duo would weigh themselves and remark on how happy they were to have \u201conly\u201d put on a little more since last week. Congratulating themselves on their imaginary self-discipline, the moms had already forgotten their gluttonous binge in the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the Greasy Burger, Frankie and Nancy were already salivating at the thought of indulging themselves with every fatty treat they could eat. \u201cAfter all,\u201d as Frankie had said, \u201cwe should have a little splurge now and again to enjoy ourselves!\u201d Nancy couldn\u2019t agree more, and she struggled to do up her pants before getting out of the car. Her belly had grown quite a bit after the enormous over-feeding it had received in the park, but Nancy was just about able to get the button to close. Fortunately for Frankie, her extra poundage was going increasingly onto her rump and thighs, and her clothes were able to take the strain of her expanding figure \u2013 at least for the moment. Waddling towards the door of the Greasy Burger, Frankie felt that her thighs were chafing more than before, and her broad hips wriggled in exaggerated motions. \u2018Hmm, I\u2019ll have to park closer to the entrance next time\u2019 thought Frankie as she paused to rearrange her pants in an effort to ease the rubbing of her meaty legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting inside, the waitress who\u2019d served them at lunch recognised the obese duo. Putting on a big smile and sashaying over to where they were standing, the chirpy teen directed the full glare of her lip gloss on Frankie and Nancy as she said \u201cHi Guys \u2013 you folks coming back for more today? It\u2019s great to see y\u2019all again so soon! Let me show you to a table and get some menus for you guys!\u201d The slim teen had a trim figure in stark contrast to most of the patrons of the Greasy Burger \u2013 clearly she didn\u2019t eat much of the restaurant\u2019s produce herself. As the waitress led on, Frankie could see that Nancy was probably three times the weight of the skinny girl. The Greasy Burger clearly understood what its customers wanted, and the large, armless chairs were a godsend for a woman of Frankie\u2019s proportions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just go nuts, shall we?\u201d asked Frankie, grinning at Nancy and patting her big tummy. \u201cYeah \u2013 I really feel like indulging myself tonight!\u201d replied Nancy, undoing her pants button again and smiling conspiratorially at Frankie. When the slender waitress came back, Frankie ran off a huge order \u2013 naming nearly every item on the menu. Although she was used to seeing porkers overeat here, the waitress whistled in amazement at the size of this order. \u201cWoah, you guys must really be hungry today!\u201d she said once Frankie finally finished their order. \u201cYes, we\u2019re celebrating making so much progress on our diet and exercise regime \u2013 we thought we\u2019d spoil ourselves for a change!\u201d said Nancy. \u201cGood for you!\u201d said the waitress, trying to hide her amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, their giant order was arriving. Piling up the dishes on the table, the waitress was amazed at how fast the food was vanishing into the gullets of the bloated duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir stomachs stretched out by their afternoon binge in the park, the two Moms had powerful appetites. Since they\u2019d decided to really enjoy themselves, neither woman felt any need to restrain her greed for food. Usually Frankie would have felt bad about overeating quite so much, but since Nancy was with her she felt no guilt at all. Chomping and guzzling down an appetizer bucket of nachos meant for a family of four, Frankie poured the cheesy chips into her mouth as fast as she could, licking the sour cream and guacamole off her plump fingers with relish. \u201cSooooo good!\u201d she muttered blissfully, closing her eyes and delighting in the sensation as she swallowed each mouthful. Although her belly was not nearly as big as Nancy\u2019s, Frankie still felt the need to undo her pants to give herself more room. As they feasted on the mountain of food, Frankie and Nancy kept on calling the waitress over to order more and more to keep their table fully stacked with dishes. As Nancy finished off her fourth triple-deck burger, she drained a whole 16oz soda to wash it down, burping happily as she slurped up the last of the calorific beverage. Both women were enjoying themselves more than they could ever have imagined. They were both used to overeating and filling themselves up, but that was normally at home. Here there was a special kind of bliss, since they were really going for broke and eating everything they wanted to excess, without feeling the least bit of guilt. Eating in each other\u2019s company was just amazing, and the effect of their happiness massively increased their already immense appetites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she\u2019d eaten her way through yet another basket of cheese fries, Nancy\u2019s vast belly had swollen up tremendously. Consumed by her gluttony, Nancy was practically oblivious to how big she was getting. But the other diners could almost see both women growing steadily fatter before their very eyes. The amazing consumption of food by Frankie and Nancy was having a surprising effect on the other patrons. Many of the other Moms and parents started doing the same. Across the other side of the restaurant, an obese mom was ordering dinner for herself and her two very fat daughters. She was about to order only one burger for herself, but after seeing Frankie inhale three burgers in short order, she said \u201cDammit, I\u2019m going to have four burgers tonight \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t have to deny myself!\u201d Just next to Nancy, a slightly plump woman decided to copy Nancy\u2019s order for two platters of surf-n-turf, inspired by seeing Nancy\u2019s rapturous expression as she chomped the first one down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen of the Greasy Burger, the staff was working at full-speed to keep up with the orders. \u201cGeez! What\u2019s happening out there? Did a whole football team come in or something?!\u201d shouted the head chef. \u201cNo. It\u2019s amazing, everyone just started ordering more and more food!\u201d yelled one of the waitresses as she collected yet another tray loaded with super-sized dishes. \u201cWell let\u2019s hope it keeps going! We\u2019re making double our money tonight!\u201d said the manager, helping out in the kitchen to keep the food coming. Sure enough, the effect continued. Before long, everyone in the restaurant was ordering seconds, then thirds and then extra fries with that. Everywhere you looked you could see kids and parents chomping on gigantic burgers, shovelling down fries, and slurping up endless sodas before ordering yet more food. Bellies bulged, belts were loosened, pants were unbuttoned and shirts drew taut over swelling waistlines. Kids of all ages chewed and guzzled to their hearts\u2019 content, adding pounds to their already flabby bodies. Obese moms forgot their diets and ate like they were skinny again, gulping down the calories and fat without a care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all the time it was Frankie and Nancy who were eating more than anyone else. After stuffing themselves to the point of near immobility, they were all just about ready to start ordering some desserts. Frankie had never been so full in all her life \u2013 her stomach was drum-tight and swelled out far over her enormous thighs, covering up much of her lap. Massaging her paunch, Frankie\u2019s mouth watered as she thought of all the delicious desserts she\u2019d eat soon. \u201cHow\u2019s it going, Frankie?\u201d asked Nancy, patting her own much bigger belly and giving a little burp. \u201cYou ready from some dessert?\u201d \u201cSure am, Nancy!\u201d Nancy waved at the waitress to get her attention. The dazed girl came over \u2013 she had been stunned by what she\u2019d seen tonight. Never before had she seen so many people eat so much. As she looked at Nancy, she could see that her tummy had blown up like a balloon since lunchtime. Even more amazingly, Frankie\u2019s already generous backside seemed to have expanded quite a lot over the day, and her globular derriere was hanging far over the edges of her seat. In fact, Frankie would have asked for an extra chair to support her broad bottom, but she was so stuffed that she doubted she could stand up to reseat herself. Nancy ordered almost every dessert on the menu for herself. Frankie followed suite but asked for another burger to be served with her desserts, since she liked them so much. The waitress was about to go when Nancy asked \u201cCan we see the specials?\u201d \u201cSure\u201d said the waitress. \u201cWhat\u2019s the Ice Cream Mega Trough?\u201d asked Nancy, scanning the specials list. \u201cThat\u2019s our super-special dessert\u201d, answered the waitress \u201cit\u2019s a giant trough filled with every flavor of ice cream we have, covered in whipped cream and hot fudge sauce and topped with sprinkles and chocolate chunks \u2013 it serves a family of four\u201d. \u201cGreat, I\u2019ll have one of those!\u201d said Nancy, hefting her belly in both hands and smacking her lips. \u201cMe too!\u201d said Frankie. Gasping in amazement and horror, the waitress took the order and hurried away before the huge women could order even more food to fill their bottomless tummies.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The crotch of Frankie's pants had been a problem since she sat down. It was tight down there and the layers of fat, heavy meat were tugging in all directions across her crotch through to her inner thighs. In fact, the entire crotch area of her pants was filled with her lower stomach fat, she wore her pants over her stomach and so when she sat her lower belly fat completely covered her crotch and most of her thighs. The strain was hard to ignore, especially with her lower stomach pushing out farther and harder with each bite consumed. Her thighs smacked like waves crashing with eat heaving bite, Frankie was a pig. A fat consuming machine. Each roll, each fat slab that populated her body was growing, thickening with no end in site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though they had both undone their pants, Frankie and Nancy were feeling uncomfortably constrained by their tight clothes. Squirming in her seat to get more comfortable, Frankie shifted her vast bulk, sending ripples through her jello-like flesh and causing a few stitches to burst along the seams of her pants. \u201cOoof, I think I need to go up a size or two!\u201d said Frankie, listening to her strained pants creaking and groaning. \u201cTell me about it\u201d replied Nancy, undoing the buttons of her shirt that were stretched to bursting-point across her belly. Letting the soft flesh ooze out, Nancy breathed a happy sigh of relief as the pressure was eased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone passing by would have worn a look of astonishment but the two proud woman thought nothing of it, they disrobed, button after button, as if growing out of clothes was a course in a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloated and swollen though they were, Frankie and Nancy finally scaled the height of gluttony with their desserts. Nancy and Frankie, forgetting all about good manners, buried their fat faces into the enormous family-sized troughs of ice cream they had ordered for themselves. Eating like pigs, the two women stuffed and gorged themselves to the point of extreme overindulgence, revelling in their gluttonous excess. The ice cream was served in a truly massive container, shaped like a trough for feeding animals. Burying their faces in the calorific super bomb, Nancy and Frankie scaled new heights of ecstasy as they consumed the final part of their tremendous feast. Fudge sauce dripped from Frankie\u2019s plump chin, dribbling down her double chin and plopping onto her bulging bosom. \u201cDeeeelicious!\u201d she said, breathing heavily and belching. Soon, Nancy had finished too. Clutching her vast, orb-like paunch in both hands, she smiled broadly at Frankie and giggled. \u201cWoah, that was FUN!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more than a hour before the duo was ready to leave. Frankie and Nancy were far too full to even think of moving. Fortunately, the manager had realised that the massive boost to business that evening was entirely because of the example being set by the two obese women. Serving them some coffee whilst the two ridiculously overfed women regained some of their strength and eased their digestion, he was happy to wait until they were quite ready to leave. Once Frankie finally managed to stagger unsteadily to her feet, swaying dangerously as she got used to her new center of gravity, several of the restaurant staff rushed over to help. \u201cOmph...thank you!\u201d said Frankie as the skinny waitress supported her on one side whilst the manager propped her up on the other. A couple of chefs performed the same service for Nancy, who was finding it very hard to get up under her own steam. Finally, with a further help from the Greasy Burger staff, the stuffed two were able to get into their car. The bill was enormous, but the manager insisted that they only pay half the total cost, since they\u2019d generated so much extra business among the other patrons. \u201cYou all come back real soon now!\u201d he said, waving as Frankie started up the engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy was totally unable to get the seatbelt over her belly this time. No matter what Frankie did, she couldn\u2019t get her butt comfortable in her seat, and her hips brushed painfully against the door and the air con control panel located between the driver's seat and the passenger side. \u201cWell, we really had a great time, didn\u2019t we!\u201d said Frankie, feeling deliciously warm and full from her colossal meal. \u201cMmmmm, sure did!\u201d replied Nancy, massaging her fully exposed belly gently to ease her digestion. They were all too full to talk, and Frankie drove Nancy back to her house. Nancy had recovered enough to waddle slowly and ponderously without assistance. \u201cThat was great, Frankie \u2013 what an amazing day!\u201d \u201cYeah, let\u2019s meet for aerobics next week \u2013 hopefully your ankle will be better by then and we can get back to losing more weight!\u201d said Frankie. \u201cSure thing \u2013see you in a week!\u201d said Nancy cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving home, Frankie wondered casually how long it would be until her exercise regime would start to take effect and her weight would start coming down. \u201cOh well, no hurry. The main thing is that I\u2019m trying so hard and being so good!\u201d thought Frankie. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good to see Nancy again next week \u2013 we have such fun together. But for now, I\u2019ll be glad to get home and go to sleep. Gosh, I\u2019m so full! But it was all so delicious! Maybe we should have more little treats like that in the future!\u201d</span></div></div>",

She waddled through the double-glass-doors and looked around. The place was empty, aside from the cashier. Knowing she was low on funds, she quickly used the nearby ATM and started to scope the place out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie quickly started loading things into a small cart. She got chocolate donuts, powdered mini-doughnuts, Chips Ahoy, Reese's Pieces, Crunch, Hershey's Bar, and about four Ice Cream Sandwiches. Then she bought about three bottles of Pepsi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been a good girl lately,\" she thought to herself. \"This won't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought them all to the cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This all for you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm bringing some for my family in the car,\" she said absently, putting them all down on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn minutes, the cashier rang them all up, and Frankie scurried back to the car. After she managed to squeeze herself back into her seat, she immediately tucked in. She ripped open all her packages and started to munch on junk food and sweets and such. She crammed the ice cream sandwiches into her mouth and swallowed them, managing to avoid brain freeze. She crammed the chocolate bars into her body, and then gorged on each doughnut, smearing chocolate, powder and sprinkles all over her face. Then she downed all the Pepsies as quickly as she could manage. She could feel the car seat getting tighter, and her clothes were beginning to get uncomfortable around her now stuffed gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her gluttony quenched, Frankie leaned back in her seat and pat her belly, which seemed to have caught up with her rear. Finally feeling full and satisfied, she started the car up and drove home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got there, she struggled out of the tiny compartment that was her driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the car and went to bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frankie and Nancy dutifully met up to work out together in Frankie\u2019s basement gym one week later. However, Nancy had called ahead to say that her knee still felt quite sore, and she didn\u2019t want to risk hurting it by doing any exercise just yet. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, Nancy! We don\u2019t want you to strain your knee just as it is getting better\u201d, Frankie had said, trying to hide her satisfaction at having an excuse to get out of doing aerobics for another week. So instead of putting on their leotards, the two flabby house moms put on some nice (but tight-fitting) outfits and went out to treat themselves to another enormous feast at the Greasy Burger. As before, they ate until they could barely move, and left the restaurant supported by the staff who helped them heave their bloated bodies into their car. And like last time Nancy and Frankie agreed to work out together the following week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the next week came, Nancy was still concerned about her knee, and once again they went out to spoil themselves. This time, Nancy suggested going to the food court at the mall for lunch. They sampled dishes from all of the different stands, eating fajitas, southern fried chicken, pizza and burgers until they were full up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome the third week since their last \u201cwork-out\u201d, Nancy said she felt she\u2019d probably be OK, but wanted to give it one more week of rest just to be sure that her knee was fully recovered. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea, Nancy! We don\u2019t want to rush back into exercise before you\u2019re completely recovered\u201d said Frankie, chewing on a jumbo cookie and holding a bear claw in her other hand. Instead, they agreed to go clothes shopping together, since both of them had noticed that very few of their outfits were still comfortable. After stopping off for an enormous lunch at McDonalds, the two of them spent the afternoon in the mall, going from store to store looking for clothes that would fit. Between each store, Frankie or Nancy would buy snacks from the cookie store, or krispy kreme, or the food court to help keep their strength up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough they both grazed happily on the sugary snacks, Frankie and Nancy had each been shocked by how many sizes up they\u2019d had to go to get clothes that fit them. Frankie had found it nearly impossible to get pants to fit her colossal backside, and was shocked when a store clerk measured her hips and reported that they were a whopping 64\u201d around. Fortunately, a plus-size store was able to provide Frankie with a whole range of pants that were specially designed to fit the biggest of derrieres. Nancy had also gasped when her waist size turned out to be 52\u201d. She\u2019d been sucking in her gut as hard as she could at the time the skinny store clerk had taken her measurement, so she dreaded to think what the true figure was. Up until now, Frankie and Nancy had been somehow oblivious to the effects of their guzzling and gorging. But they each felt rather self-conscious as they waddled through the mall munching on a box of Danish pastries. \u201cWoah, guess we\u2019d better make sure and work out next week!\u201d said Nancy, catching sight of her reflection in the shiny glass of a store front. \u201cYeah, I think so\u201d muttered Frankie, noting how uncomfortable she felt as her thunder thighs rolled over one another as she walked. \u201cStill, let\u2019s stop off at that Chinese place on the way back \u2013 I\u2019m starving\u201d said Nancy, licking her plump lips greedily. \u201cSure \u2013 we deserve one last treat before we get back on track with our exercise regime!\u201d said Frankie, smiling at the thought of topping up her stomach once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, after a month\u2019s break, Frankie and Nancy met up to restart their workout sessions. After they\u2019d parted last week, the two moms had promised each other that start their diets the moment they finished their blow-out meal at the all-you-can-eat Chinese restaurant. As she waited for Nancy, Frankie felt nervous since she\u2019d not really started her diet at all. In fact, even though she\u2019d tried to restrain herself, Frankie couldn\u2019t control her cravings to snack, and she munched her way through the days like never before. When the doorbell rang, and Frankie went to the door, she felt sheepish about admitting to Nancy that she\u2019d broken their promise. But when she opened the door, it was clear that Nancy hadn\u2019t exactly managed to stick to her pledge to stop snacking either. She was half-way through a Hershey bar as she stood on the porch in front of her. \u201cNancy! Good to see you! But what\u2019s that in your hands!?\u201d tutted Frankie, smiling with relief that she wasn\u2019t the only one who couldn\u2019t resist chocolate. \u201cOh I know, I know!\u201d said Nancy, \u201cit looked sooooo good that I had to have one!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s ok, I haven\u2019t exactly been completely strict about my diet either\u201d said Frankie with a cheeky grin, \u201ccome on inside!\u201d Nancy waddled heavily through the door, Nancy\u2019s prominent belly brushing against Frankie\u2019s voluminous hips as she squeezed past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy and Frankie were both wearing their workout leotards, which had clearly been designed to cover smaller figures than those possessed by either woman. The stretchy material clung to every roll, fold and bulge on their bloated bodies. Since they\u2019d really started to overindulge, neither Frankie nor Nancy had seen each other in such revealing outfits. Frankie was surprised to see just how big Nancy\u2019s belly was becoming. It bulged out far in front of her, and was beginning to form into two layers of fat, with a shelf of flab forming an upper belly running over as a fold of fat at Nancy\u2019s naval. Frankie could also see that Nancy\u2019s love handles had taken a fair share of her increased poundage, making a thick tire of fat around her middle. Frankie was going to say something, but noticed that Nancy was looking just as surprised as she took in Frankie\u2019s appearance.</span></div></div>",

It stretched so far ahead and was so big around she couldn't even see her own feet. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess we haven't exactly been keeping up with our dieting as well as we thought,\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie nodded sheepishly. \"We really need to start working out again,\" she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey struggled hard to do sit-ups, but they couldn't bend past their bellies, which when squeezed, they grew larger, and caused their guts nearly ripped out of the leotards. Deciding not risk it, they immediately stopped, and waited until the next routine that wouldn't involved bending. In other words, they spent a full twenty-five minutes lying on their backs, talking while their stomachs stuck straight up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it came to jumping-jacks. They reluctantly got to their feet and tried to keep up with the instructor. But as they jumped, the furniture shook and rattled. Pictures fell to the floor. A recliner tipped over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's stop this!\" Frankie gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy merely panted for air in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both stopped, bent over and gasping and panting. They both knew they weren't going to get all the way though this work out alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie promptly switched the tape off and went into the living room. Frankie had a tray laden with food! It looked like perhaps Frankie had planned this in advance, as there seemed to be fast food upon the tray as well as offerings from her cupboard and fridge. The tray and its contents came into clear view and a rumble let loose from Nancy's stomach. Her eyes lit up greedily as she stared at a mountain of burgers, fries, pretzels, chips, candies, chocolates, cake, and two huge frosty root beers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie and Nancy sat back on the couch and spread the food out on the table in front of them. They leaned in and immediately both grabbed two big juicy cheeseburgers that were dripping grease and loaded with four different cheeses. They had devoured them in minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey the two bags of chips, practically pouring the contents of the bags into their mouths. This was followed by a cascade of pretzels and fries that slithered their way into their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverytime either one started to feel full, they'd glance at the TV and see the cooking shows. They'd get hungry just looking at them, and then they'd go back in with more gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took a knife, cut the cake in half, and put both halves on plates. They didn't even use forks. They just buried their faces in the chocolate icing and devoured them. Ten minutes later, they were grinning dopily at each other, faces smeared with chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie then got down on the floor and took her giant root beer. Nancy took her's and spread out on the couch. They both leaned back, opened their mouths and slurped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow both were on the floor, leaning against the couch. They'd pushed the table out of the way and were both now eating candies and chocolates from a giant bowl. They spoke casually between each other, slowly but surely losing their grip with reality. They were in a strange area between sugar rush and energy crash, so it was hard to say how they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd eat and jiggle and pat their bellies, giggling dopily, almost drunk from the sugar and salt, bloating more and more.</span></div></div>",

It was almost 6:00.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Nancy said at last. \"I think we need to get going. This was...interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Frankie. \"I'd show you to the door, but I'm not sure I remember where the door is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning and gurgling, Nancy rolled and shifted until she was finally off her back and onto her rear. She winced at the sound of the stitches in her elastic clothes snapping and tearing, but it didn't rip yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whimpered slightly. Her stomach was so stuffed and overfilled that she could just barely keep herself from letting out a full out moan. Writhing and struggling, Nancy was just able to get up onto her feet, but she was in squat, which resulting in more seams bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie watched, one hand still on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy now found that straightening her legs out and lifting to her full height would be a real task. Struggling and wincing, she started to go up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy, in squatting position, lost her balance thanks to her new girth, and she ended up tumbling forward onto her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding on her full stomach, she groaned slightly. Her rear end and back fat jiggled and moved around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie managed to speak, but the way she said it, it was almost a grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" she called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof... Ooh...,\" moaned Nancy. \"I...hic...I think so....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to give in, Nancy dragged herself across the floor, pushing against the floor with her feet and clawing herself ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie poked her bulging stomach, feeling too stuffed and bloated to know what she did. She decided to follow in suit. Rolling, struggling, moaning and complaining, Frankie managed to struggle until she too was in a similar position and dragging herself across the kitchen towards the living room. Her full stomach was gurgling and sloshing as it rubbed against the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached her destination at the sofa. Pausing for a few minutes to catch her breath, Frankie reached up and grabbed the side of the couch, and with all her might, she managed to get push herself up and onto her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Nancy had arrived, and now that she was standing up, Frankie was able to help her onto her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth woman stood there, gasping for breath and leaning against the sofa. There was a long pause that was only interrupted by Nancy suddenly letting a giant, \"BBBRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPP!!\" Followed by this, the stitching on her leotard finally gave way, ripping entirely and allowing her stomach to slide out. This was followed by yet another awkward pause, as Nancy stared at her stomach and Frankie tried not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Nancy let out a resigned, \"What's the point?\"</span></div></div>",

Her belly had always been pretty big but the last 100 pounds had all settled into her belly and now it was sticking out further then when she was pregnant and hung low enough to hide her panties.

Frankie's belly hung down far enough to hide the bottoms from the front and the sides were wedged between her hips and love handles. Not that Nancy could say anything, her own bottoms were equally hidden. But while she was front heavy Frankie was wide. Mike had significantly widened the doors and she was still wider than the door frame.<br>\r\nThe two hugged as best they could, they had to maneuver around bellies to even get close. Frankie lead the way in giving Nancy a good view of her ass. It wobbled from side to side with every step and her thighs jiggled along with it. Her thick thighs had gained more cellulite since she last saw them when they went swimsuit shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got out to the pool she spotted Sue, Axl and Brick by the side of the pool. All the kids had plopped themselves in the shallows, Nancy loved that they had a pool you could wade into so she didn't have to pull herself out. She had to smile seeing Sue, Axl and Brick in swimsuits. Sue had really taken to their no longer holding back their appetites. Her gains had taken after Mike making her belly heavy, the rest of her frame looked pudgy but if her belly didn't jiggle she would look absolutely pregnant. Axl and Brick on the other hand had taken after their mom and were getting quite pear shaped. Frankie had somewhere found them Speedo-style swimsuits, she suspected that they were actually women's bikini bottoms. <br>\r\nNancy took off the shirt and shorts she had worn for the drive over.<br>\r\nThe 2 moms settled into a couple extra wide lounge chairs with their pale bellies raising into the air. Frankie had already prepared several trays of cookies on a low table between their chairs, about every 15 minutes one of the teens would stop by with a new tray of snacks for each of the gluttonous moms.</span></div></div>",

It's not like she ever let herself go hungry--if her tummy rumbled, she happily fed it--but was she really stuffing herself when Frankie wasn't around? <i>I suppose not... but why?</i> Then it clicked with her. Her twins, Dotty and Shelly. With Frankie, she could focus single-mindedly on making a pig of herself, but when she was alone with the twins, all of her energy was focused on keeping his own growing belly happy, leaving much less time for Nancy to fill her own. But wait, Brick wasn't exactly showing signs of slowing down his growth either! If anything, he had started growing faster than Dotty and Shelly, so how could Frankie still be eating so much?! Nancy had to know the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't it take a lot of energy to keep your family so well-fed? How do you find the time to eat even more than before?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie chuckled, sending a jiggling wave through her belly, and responded, \"Well, Axl and Sue have the instacart password and are old enough to fend for themselves. As for Brick, he's with me almost all of the time but I've actually managed to increase my intake by taking advantage of both of our growing appetites!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how does that work?\" Nancy inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I seem to recall that your trips to Greasy Burger tend to involve several trips to the counter, while Dotty and Shelly tell you exactly what they want and you think about how much you ate last time, and then when Dotty and Shelly finish their share, they realize they're still hungry and make you get up to get them more while you haven't even finished your first portion. Are they still going that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they're a real handful, often they even eat my portions while I'm up, and all that walking is soooo tiring\" she said with no hint of irony even though she always snags the table closest to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for example, I know my own and Brick's appetites pretty well, so when we go to Greasy Burger, I listen to his order, then think about how much I think I want, and then order <b>five times</b> all of that. Sometimes one of us really can't finish our portions that way, but I'm always happy to finish his and he's always happy to finish mine. The only time I need to get up a second time is if we want ice cream for dessert, which is often but I can't very well order ten sundaes and let them all melt while we eat our fifty burgers each, right? And he's a smart guy, when his appetite increases he knows to ask for more, so that factor of five has continued to be enough for now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's really smart, Frankie. No wonder it looks like Brick's grown so well. Dotty and Shelly\u2019s up to 300 now\"--a preposterous weight for a 10-year-old if she had thought about it at all--\"how big is your Brick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he's gotten excited to weigh in daily recently so as of this morning he was 350 pounds! Kind of surprised he's kept any mobility at his normal 10-year-old height of 4'4\". He's got a BMI almost double mine! He'll definitely need a mobility scooter soon, and I'll have to homeschool Him when he reaches middle school age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy knew she'd be homeschooling Dotty and Shelly too when school started in late August but didn't feel it was worth bringing up. A mobility scooter, though? Her twins, she still insisted to herself even after accepting her own future of fat, was clearly big and strong, she couldn't imagine them losing their mobility no matter how much more they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for what they did next....</span></div></div>",

The bedroom door, not fully shut in the first place, was pushed open, and the mothers were greeted by a unified chorus,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommyyyyy, we're hungryyyyy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDotty and Shelly was panting after just this exertion, their faces red and their huge bellies heaving up and down, jiggling a bit with each breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Frankie gave Nancy a \"look\", which was easily understood as \"Ready to try out what you just learned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, both the kids and moms still hadn't gone more than half an hour since they were stuffing those plates of brownies by the pool, but that was enough time to make room, not to mention the \"exertion\" of moving their bodies from pool to the bedroom! So Nancy responded,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, kids, how about we go eat everything we can at Greasy Burger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAAAAAAY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, even getting to the car was an ordeal at this point, especially for Brick. It took another 5 minutes, during which every single one of the porcine quartet needed another tray of brownies for sustenance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon they were on their way, and by the time they were driving into the parking lot, over 1500 pounds crammed into one minivan for \"fuel efficiency\", all of their tummies were grumbling and ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie upped their starting order to 120 double cheeseburgers, 20 jumbo fries, 20 shakes, and two super-sized sodas (\"they're free refills and our table is in reaching distance of the machine!\"), with the intent of splitting it evenly with Brick. Nancy saw this but knew she and the twins weren't quite up for matching it so she got 100 double cheeseburgers, 10 jumbo fries, and three super-sized sodas for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreasy Burger was used to enormous orders for enormous patrons, so they managed to get all of their food to the table (which was also large enough for the five of them to sit, for now, comfortably on each side, their bellies skillfully hidden by the somewhat-elevated tabletop) at around the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quinte dug in instantly, to the point that onlookers might think they hadn't eaten in days--and even they felt like they hadn't eaten in hours! Frankie and Brick had clearly gotten this type of gorging down to a science, stuffing each burger into their greedy mouths with as few bites as possible. Dotty, Shelly and Nancy were no slouches, though, the prospect and excitement of 50 burgers in front of them at once causing them to eat at a speed they never had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubconsciously, Nancy was worried about the twin's greed causing them to make some kind of remark, but they had more than enough food for themselves, for now. When they did speak up, around burger 25, Nancy was shocked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We like that you're eating like us, mommy.... Now you can get big and strong, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that she realized that all of her previous altercations with them weren't because of an intrinsic greed, but because she just didn't understand the true needs of their appetites. When you're hungry, you're just not yourself! She vowed to be a better mom, like Frankie was being to Brick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quintet was approaching finishing their order, and....</span></div></div>",

Even more so than wanting to feel stuffed, she didn't want to fall behind Frankie too much in their gaining journeys!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were in line, Frankie yelled over to Brick, \"How many sundaes do you want today?\" Brick said... \"three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy was surprised. \"I thought she was full? And she had all those milkshakes too....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahah, the milkshakes we basically drink like water at this point, and when a kid says they're full, it just means they don't want more of what they were just eating. She'll be good on savory food for the next couple hours but that doesn't mean she doesn't want dessert!\" Frankie replied. Nancy was beginning to understand how Mary had started growing so much faster than Dotty and Shelly, who originally had her beaten in not just the weight but the BMI department for most of the time they had known each other. Nancy had always taken \"full\" at face value, but she didn't want Dotty and Shelly to feel left out.... As she saw Dotty and Shelly get up for another refill of their super-sized soda, she knew that Frankie was right, they needed more sweets to be content!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how many for you, Dotty and Shelly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We was hoping you'd ask, mommy! We... want the same number as Brick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they have the same competitive streak that I'm having with Frankie, huh, thought Nancy. Although Brick had asked for 3, she knew that meant Frankie would be ordering 15, so she resolved to not leave Dotty and Shelly behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Frankie's turn to order. \"Let's see, 10 double cheeseburgers... actually make those all triple bacon cheeseburgers. 5 Jumbo fries. Thirty sundaes... Actually, I'm feeling a bit peckish, make it forty Sundaes, extra fudge on each of course. Oh, and add 10 slices of apple pie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will that be all ma'am?\" The cashier was a fairly fat teenager herself, so while she sounded bored, she wasn't being sarcastic. The total amount Frankie had ordered today was quite large even for Greasy Burger standards, but the food was so addicting that it wasn't entirely beyond the scope of what the teen could imagine eating in her own fat future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Frankie cheerfully responded, \"For today, I think!\" and went back to their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy was up. She knew she couldn't match Frankie bite-for-bite yet but she was determined to give it her best. \"Ten double bacon cheeseburgers for me, 5 jumbo fries, and thirty sundaes.\" \"Will that be all?\" \"Yes, thank you.\" Nancy wasn't quite so used to ordering this much in one sitting so she still felt a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food arrived and Frankie once again began mechanically digging in, this time alternating among her savory and sweet foods. Nancy tried to match her pace, her belly starting to feel quite taut after just a couple more burgers and sundaes. Despite the whole five-minute wait for their desserts to arrive, Brick, Dotty and Shelly had slowed down the most, slowly but unwaveringly making it through their sundaes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the end of their second gigantic order....</span></div></div>",

They leaned back, gave big, contented sighs, and started patting the top of their decidedly stuffed, round bellies for relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrick, finishing the last bite of his 15th sundae, recognized the signs of true fullness when he saw it, so he reached over, his huge belly pushing like a marshmallow into the table as he leaned, and grabbed their remaining two, starting to slowly spoon them into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDotty and Shelly wanted to object but realized that, this time, they just couldn't. Brick had won, he deserved the spoils of victory. They'd have to do better to eat even more next time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie watched this display of Brick's hunger and the twins' reserved emotion with amusement, while continuing to mechanically shove food down her own greedy throat. Nancy, on the other hand, was far more focused on the food in front of her, starting to realize how daunting of a task it was to suddenly increase her intake by this much. 6 burgers, 3 orders of fries, and 7 sundaes in, she began to realize that the kids were right about when to give up the savory food. She continued spooning in ice cream for now but pushed the remaining 4 burgers and 2 orders of fries further away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie saw this as a clear sign to follow her son's lead. Even she was surprised at how much capacity she seemed to have, but she was just finishing the last of her own monumental order as her son was finishing her 16th sundae (from Dotty and Shelly) and moving onto her 17th sundae (also from Dotty and Shelly), now moving far more slowly than her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy had lost her competitive spirit and so was grateful to see Frankie avoid the wasting of any food, but she hadn't quite lost her gluttonous spirit as she continued to slowly crawl through her ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrick finished first and would've been happy to leave this full, but couldn't help buy eye Nancy's remaining sundaes. Nancy, at the end of shoving two more into her mouth, finally gave in and took the same resting position as Dotty and Shelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith 6 more sundaes in front of Nancy, Frankie (who was only finally starting to slow after finishing Nancy's savory food) quickly scooped them towards her with one arm; ending on a savory note would be disappointing so she was frankly hoping for Nancy to tire of dessert as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching Brick's glances, Frankie pushed just one sundae towards her son, greedily believing she needed the five more for herself after already eating 25 sundaes earlier. Regardless, Brick was happy to receive any more food at all, and Frankie was eating much faster than him still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrick and Frankie finished their final desserts and, finally content with no more food on the table, leaned back to start rubbing their engorged bellies as Dotty, Shelly and Nancy had been doing for a few minutes now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the five fatties found the energy to get up and leave, they parted ways after going back to the Heck household, with Dotty, Shelly and Nancy resolved to increase their food capacity to properly match the Heck duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there....</span></div></div>",

He spent the vast majority of his time in the kitchen, nowadays, perhaps even more than Frankie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie looked at her giant butterball of a preteen. She wasn't entirely sure if Brick was trying to make a joke or if he was actually oblivious to the fact that he was currently eating, since he was snacking on something at pretty much all times nowadays. Frankie decided to reach over to fill a plate for her ever-hungry son and realized she was actually holding a brownie in her own hand. <i>Oh... probably oblivious, then,</i> she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome heavy footsteps were now heard marching towards them. Sue, still the lightest of the family, made it first, though that lightness could only be used comparatively--since abandoning control of her intake a couple months ago, she had grown into a respectable member of the Heck family at a hair over 300 lbs, following in Frankie's footsteps and having the majority go to her ass; she still had a respectable belly thanks to having it stuffed to the brim by her mother repeatedly like this, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you made way too much again, mom!\" she said while greedily eyeing the truly enormous spread of food that was on the table. Every dinner was approximately a thanksgiving meal for 20+ people of late, replete with meat, bread, and desserts anywhere you looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know how it is, one day it suddenly won't be too much, and then I'll have to make even more!\" Frankie replied, patting her tightly-stuffed yet still incredibly hungry belly and then subsequently returning to filling plates to the brim for herself and Brick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Mike made it to the kitchen. Once the behemoth of the family, Frankie had long since eclipsed him and continued to grow much faster. Nonetheless, the much larger portions Frankie had been offering at family dinners lately had been taken in stride and he was now up to 500 lbs. In truth he was able to eat as much as Frankie at meal time, he just didn't need the constant snacks that she did in between and at night. \"Thank you honey, it looks lovely as always,\" he said calmly but kindly as he sat down and began filling up his own plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxl was the last to make it down. His breathing was the most labored, being the least used to hauling around this much weight, and not having the muscle to back it up while being fairly short still and only having just started puberty recently. At 450 lbs he had gotten much rounder than his father thanks to his short stature. Gasping for air in his \"hurry\" (he was trying to run to dinner because of his love for food but ended his journey at the slowest walk of all of them), he practically slid into his chair, mumbled a \"thank god\", and started piling food onto his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Axl's rapid growth wasn't due merely to gluttony like his mother's and younger brother's, but to a competitive side he didn't quite know he had. Brick had been growing at a rapid rate, and had actually passed his weight last month at his young age of ten. Rather than be horrified at Brick's weight like an ordinary parent might, Frankie had taken the opportunity to make a light jab at Axl for being too thin, which had lit a fire under him. The end result was... he was barely able to keep up with his little brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right, sitting at a corner of the table, in his usual spot, now in an adjustable mobility scooter, was Brick Heck, a 450-pound blob of a preteen. The scooter was designed for up to 1000-pound adults and had a ton of room dedicated to belly space, where his belly apron sagged multiple feet in front of him, dwarfing the rest of his form. Most of the adjustability was dedicated to where the handlebars were, so he could control the scooter well both at his current small height and as he continued to grow, both taller and wider. But more importantly... he had just run out of cookies on the tray attached to he scooter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed it as he mindlessly swiped his hands towards another one. With a mysterious empty feeling in his hand, he looked down and finally, truly realized that he didn't have any food in front of him. What a travesty! \"MOOOM, I'M HUNGRY!!\" yelled the boy who had just robotically eaten about 60 fairly large chocolate chip cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, here you go!\" said Frankie who had luckily just finished filling up both of their plates, taking so long simply because she was still snacking on brownies the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it was Frankie's own constant snacking that even gave her the energy to make and prepare all of this food. She had just reached 600 lbs herself, dwarfing Mike, and completely beating everyone in the family in \"roundness\" except for Brick. At 4'6\" (he had grown 2 inches in the last month, a bit of a fast growth spurt, but not making her unusually tall for his age and not surprising considering how many calories were involved), Brick had a BMI of 179.4, a number that would beat the fattest people in the world if he were scaled up in height. But for Frankie, who was still incredibly fat, it would still be incredibly hard to move around and cook as she did if not for her constant stream of sugar. Of course, even then, she did it from a rolling chair. She couldn't even imagine being forced to stand up for the whole hour it took to prepare a meal of this size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the family were all ready to settle down and dig in. The dinner table was truly gigantic but could still only barely hold all of the food Frankie taxed it with. However, slowly but surely, the family ate through the massive meal one overstuffed plate at a time, and the table could almost be seen to sigh in relief as its burden migrated into the family's gigantic bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue tapped out first, rubbing her engorged belly to alleviate the pain from her stuffing session. None of the other family members could be said to be \"soon to follow\"--Frankie and Mike finished off what they felt like eating a full fifteen minutes later, when Sue was already plopped on the couch snacking on popcorn, m&amp;ms, and soda while watching a tv movie. Axl was feeling full by this point but Brick was still going strong--his appetite had finally passed his own mother's last week and he seemed determined to be the fattest person in the world. At least, that's how Axl read the situation, so he continued forcing food down his throat to match his brother, as had become recent tradition. The truth was, Axl really did love eating, and didn't have a problem snacking in between meals like Brick did, but when it came down to \"meal time\", his capacity was just unbelievable to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after another five minutes, Brick took his last swig of coke and declared himself \"full\". Axl sighed in relief, and tried to get up, but... he was pinned by his own stomach. <i>Ah well, this has happened before,</i> he thought, as this was the third time since he started being competitive with Brick that he couldn't move after eating. So he began to cradle his belly while weaning himself lightly on his soda to prepare himself for departure in another ten or so minutes, while Brick zoomed away on his scooter to watch the movie with Sue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*burb* Hey mom, when can I get a scooter like that?\" he asked Frankie, who was now cleaning dishes and packing up the small but extant leftovers to be snacked on by herself and Brick later tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, your BMI isn't even as high as mine yet! We'll each get one when we hit a BMI of 100, that's when the insurance will cover it for free\", she replied empathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxl knew with such a rational explanation he wasn't going to get any farther, so he simply leaned back and relaxed while vaguely picking off small amounts of food from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater when all of the Heck's were watching movies and snacking together (their weight had been bringing them together via laziness more than ever before), Mike brought up \"Hey Frankie, isn't Brick's birthday tomorrow? I have work, but what are you planning to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well besides the extra-jumbo cake we'll be having as part of our desserts with dinner tomorrow, I figured I'd set up a play date with Nancy, Dotty and Shelly! It's been about a month since we saw them. Nancy is so funnily competitive; I thought for sure that when we were working out she would try extra hard to be \"the thin one\" but once it was clear that our weights were going in the opposite direction, she seems intent on outgrowing us! So she wanted the month away to focus her efforts, but what better time than Brick's eleventh birthday than for him to hang out with his best friends and to eat as much as possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrick giggled quietly to himself. Best friends? He didn't dislike Dotty and Shelly at all but they were just kids who gorged together. Brick knew that his mommy just wanted to hang out with Nancy, but he didn't mind. In fact, he actually liked Nancy more than Dotty and Shelly, since Nancy is the one that convinced Frankie to feed Brick everything he ever wanted! But no, Brick's one and only friend was food. Maybe also Frankie? Could a mommy be considered a friend? Brick didn't care about such philosophical (to him) questions, and went back to snacking on movie treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Brick's birthday, arrived, and the extremely fat pair arrived at Greasy Burger at 9am sharp, after a morning already full of as much gorging on breakfast food and snacks as they could fit. Nancy, Dotty and Shelly had arrived a couple minutes earlier, and were already sitting down at a table, with it clear that two sides of a booth would not fit the quartet anymore. Frankie took the opportunity to size the pair up, and....</span></div></div>",

Frankie then spoke up and said, \"why don't you take the boys somewhere for the summer, Mike, and I'll do something with Sue?\" Mike thought it over and replied, \"that sounds like a great idea, Frankie, that's our plan\". Sue overheard this and stopped texting to say, \"what, that sounds like a dumb idea, I don't want to spend the entire summer with my mom!\" Frankie looked disappointed but then thought of something, \"I have something planned out for us that I think you will enjoy\". \"What is it then?\", asked Sue. \"I'll tell you when they leave\", whispered Frankie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike, Axl, and Brick were just about to leave for their summer trip. \"Bye everybody\", said Mike as he started to pull out of the driveway, \"don't do anything I wouldn't do\". Frankie and Sue stood there as the boys drove out of sight. They then went back into the house and the first thing Sue said was, \"so what was your special and fun idea, where are we going?\" Frankie replied, \"nowhere, I just said that so Mike would agree to getting out of the house for 3 months\". Sue looked confused, \"so what are we supposed to do for the next 3 months?\" Frankie then said, \"I planned for you and me to gain weight and get fat together, what do you think of that idea?\" \"What are you crazy?\" Sue replied, \"I'm not going to ruin my figure over 3 months\". \"Why not?\", asked Frankie, \"It'll be fun, and you have no choice, I told all your friends that you were out of town for the summer, so you might as well\". Frankie then grabbed a box of cookies and offered one to Sue. She hesitated, but grabbed it and said while munching on it, \"I guess I have no choice, maybe it'll be fun later.\".</span></div></div>",

She had started wearing very small tops, and they revealed a lot of jiggly cleavage. Her belly was always exposed with the shirts she was wearing as it slightly hung over her waistband. Her butt was 8 feet across, but it still was always jiggling when she walked. Sue had put on a lot of weight already as well. Her boobs had gone up 3 sizes, and strained her green top, which revealed a lot of cleavage. Her belly was completely exposed under her green top, and she also gained some love handles. Her butt had taken most of the weight, as it was 10 feet across and was constantly jiggling. This was a very productive month but they still had 2 to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie was preparing some food in the kitchen while Sue was munching on some potato chips in the living room while watching TV. Her butt was taking up the whole couch, and it was built for 2 people. \"Mom, I'm really glad you talked me into this\", said Sue, \"I'm really enjoying it\", as she shoved some more chips into her mouth. Frankie replied from the kitchen, \"That's good to hear\", as she waddled out of the kitchen with a cake in each hand and two 2 liter bottles of Pepsi in her cleavage. She put one of the bottles of Pepsi into Sue's cleavage. \"Thanks mom, but I could have done it myself\", said Sue. Then Frankie shoved an entire piece of cake into Sue's mouth. \"What are you doing?\", asked Sue as she wiped some frosting from her mouth and sucked it off her finger. Frankie replied, \"I'm feeding you so you can become fatter than me\", as she shoved another piece in, \"I need you bigger, I need you fatter\". Frankie continued to feed Sue the cakes piece by piece, and when all the cakes were gone, Sue spoke up, \"if your going to feed me and make me bigger than you, I'm going to need some pizza, doughnuts, and some more cake...BBBBBBBUUUUUURRRRPPPPP\". \"Alight then, I'll prepare some right now\", Frankie replied, as she patted Sue's belly, \"but I get some too, you're gonna be bigger than me, but I still get to get fat\".</span></div></div>",

Mike and the boys had returned in the late afternoon, and were walking up the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't wait to see my darling wife and my daughter\", said Mike, as Axl and Brick followed. They then stepped in the doorway and there was Frankie sitting on the couch in front of the TV, and the boys were at utter disbelief at what they saw. Frankie was utterly colossal. Her boobs were probably a JJJ size and were barely containable in what was left of her white tank top, and revealed cleavage that was about 2 miles long. Her belly was almost hanging down to her knees as it hung over the waistband of her sweatpants. Her butt was probably 35 feet across of pure blubber, as it jiggled and wobbled. \"Hey boys, did you enjoy your summer?\", as she got up to go into the kitchen, where Mike and the boys caught a good glimpse of her 35 foot butt sway, wobble, and jiggle like crazy. \"So Frankie, where's Sue, she ditch you?\", asked Mike. \"Actually\", said Frankie, as she came back to the living room with a whole cake and a gallon of milk, \"she didn't leave my side for the entire summer, it was like she was my little girl again\". Then the ground started to shake as everyone looked upstairs, \"here she comes now...BBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPP\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue then came down the stairs, and thanks to Frankie constantly feeding her, she was indeed a lot larger than her. Her boobs were about a PPP size and was barely containable in her Hooters top, and revealed cleavage that was probably 4 miles long. But her boobs didn't hide her belly at all, as it was completely exposed. It hung over the waistband of her short-shorts and almost down to her feet. Her short-shorts also showed off her thighs, which were very flabby and as thick as the trees of the Redwood Forest. Her very jiggly butt was probably 55 feet across and were barely containable in her short-shorts, as her panties were being stretched to their limit. She had a doughnut around each pudgy finger and was slurping down two 2 liter bottles of Dr. Pepper in her very large, jiggly cleavage. Sue landed next to Frankie with a lot of jiggling, and that was all her panties could handle, as they burst and hung at her sides. \"Hello dad\", she said as she then said to her mom while patting her bellowing belly, \"mom, could you feed me some more food, I'm starting to get kinda hungry...BBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP\". \"Okay my Buddha princess, open wide.\", said Frankie, as she waddled into the kitchen and came back with a wheelbarrow of food for her to feed Sue with. After seeing the wheelbarrow full of food, Sue started to jump in place, as her butt was so big that that is was acting like she was sitting on 2 huge bean bag chairs packed to the max. She then shoved every piece of food that was in the wheelbarrow, with foods such as cakes, pizza, cupcakes, and other fatty foods, into her awaiting mouth. Halfway through, Frankie actually had trouble reaching over Sue's humongous belly to feed her, so she went to the side. \"Don't worry, my little cream puff, there are plenty more wheelbarrows of food waiting\", said Frankie, as she shoved two pieces of pizza into her gargantuan daughter's mouth. Sue replied while taking a slurp of her drink, \"Oh good, I was beginning to worry, don't worry belly, there's more coming...BBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPP\", as she patted and rubbed her jiggly belly while continually awaiting the food being fed to her. She then finished off that wheelbarrow and went on to the next one, where Frankie was able to get some of the food as well.</span></div></div>",

Frankie came in and was huge. Her boobs were now a MMM size and was barely containable in her tank-top, as it revealed cleavage that was almost a mile long. Her belly was pouring over her pants, and her love handles were causing her shirt to rise up. Her hips were very wide and her butt had grown to be 55 feet across. She was munching on a couple of large pretzels and slurping on some Pepsi, which she was carrying in her cleavage. She made her way over to her spot at the table, with her butt jiggling and wobbling with each step. \"Alright, all my favorites, BBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPP.\" She then lowered her jiggly butt on the ground because she broke her chair a long time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Sue?\", said Mike. \"Oh, here she comes right now\", said Frankie, as the ground began to shake as Sue walked into the kitchen. Her boobs were an SSS size, and had a buttoned shirt that was barely containing them, as she showed off cleavage that was almost 3 miles long. Her belly was utterly humongous as it was completely exposed. Her hips were triple her arm length, as her butt reached a length of 75 feet across. As she made her way into the kitchen, everyone watched her butt wobble, jiggle, and sway like crazy. \"Feed me, feed me, feed me, feed me, feed me\", she said while munching on some doughnuts around each pudgy finger, and was chugging a whole gallon of milk, being held in her large cleavage. \"What's my daddy got for lunch for me today?\" said Sue, as she sat down at the table. Mike replied, \"your favorite, everything that's not green colored.\" Sue replied, \"you know it, BBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP.\" Just then the buttoned shirt she was wearing finally gave away, as buttons flew and cleavage poured out.

Her neighbor Nancy tried to give Frankie as much advice on what to do with the money as possible (most of the advice was articles that Nancy read in the past).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike gave it a lot of thought, but he decided to quit his job. Wanting to be private, he gave his reason as 'he received a large inheritance that would allow him retire early.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxl, by comparison, was quite boisterous about the lottery winnings, informing anyone and everyone about it, and being given a large amount of praise from all of his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue initially only wanted to tell her friends about the info (who gave her screams of joy), but after Axl had basically shouted to the whole school about it, she had many popular girls try to get close to her and invite her to parties, obviously only trying to get close to her for her money (much to the oblivion of Sue).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrick was just attending class with out much difference, he simply wanted to do work and didn't feel it mattered if he mentioned the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer joy that could be felt be the family as they accepted the money was immeasurable. They wanted to celebrate, and after Nancy had suggested the idea, Frankie knew she had to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Frankie are you sure that we can eat all of this?!\" Mike asked to his wife, as their kids looked in amazement at all the food that was on top their brand new and much larger table. \"I've never seen so much good looking food in one place, it's beautiful.\" Sue said in wonder. Axl was practically drooling, and Brick could stare at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie responded to her husband's concerns, \"Don't worry Mike, if there's any food left, we can just put it in our brand new fridge.\" Frankie pointed at the family's gigantic fridge. The house in general was remodeled a day in advance, mostly because Frankie wanted the feast to go as smoothly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family sat themselves and began stuffing their faces in what could only be described as a mini buffet. Mike &amp; Axl went straight into the meat, ripping through it like starving wolves. Brick tried a bit of everything, but still went through the food as well as a boy of his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Frankie &amp; Sue went primarily through all the sweets and baked goods they could find. Sue had a small amount of doubt, thinking about how having dessert before the rest of the food wasn't right, how she had worry about her braces not getting damaged, and how this could have a negative effect on her health, but after that first bite into that chocolate cake, she just couldn't stop stuffing her face with that food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie probably had the least self restraint out of everyone, she scarfed down pies to cupcakes to even an entire cake. She wanted this more than anyone, having raised a family may have brought her a lot of joy, something she missed when she had more money was just eating sweets, something Frankie had to do less if it meant feeding her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end, although there were left overs, the family had pigged out to the max. Axl and Brick may of had the least complaints (Axl because he was an athlete and had to eat bigger portions before, and Brick because of his smaller size), but the rest could not say they were as lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike had to unbuckle his pants half way through the meal, and when he was done, his stomach was slightly swollen, almost spherical looking, and he was groaning in pain. After finishing, he immediately when to his bedroom and crashed into bed, falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the family got ready to go to bed, wanting to sleep away the food. The boys went through the motions with out much trouble, going to sleep quite quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue, on the other hand, was voicing her concerns to her mother, \"I loved the food, but what if I get cavities? That could seriously hurt my teeth for years. What if I get stuffed in my digestive system? Sitting on the toilet for too long is bad for you. OH GOD! What if I get fat after all this? I ate so much junk food and no vegi-\" Frankie finally interrupted her daughter, \"Honey, don't worry about all that. If you brush you teeth, you'll be fine. If you make sure to push it out fast, you'll be fine. And you won't get fat, this won't be every day, it was just a celebration for winning the lottery, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie had successfully comforted her daughter's worries. Said daughter was the third hardest in terms of pigging out (behind her parents), her stomach was swollen, but it didn't stick out as much as her father. Frankie gave Sue a kiss on the forehead and said goodnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered her bedroom to see her husband snoring. She went up to a mirror and inspected herself, and it was obvious that if who ever ate the most in the family was a contest, she would of won. Frankie's stomach kind of reminded her of when she was 4, 5, possibly even 6 months pregnant with anyone of the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went into bed next to her husband and found her mind wandering, mostly to what Sue had asked. Would they get fat, it was something kept her thinking, that maybe this money wasn't a good thing, that maybe the power would get everyone's head the family would get fatter and lazier. Frankie found it so difficult to imagine herself at Nancy's weight, or even bigger. A giant belly hanging in front of her knees with extra wide hips and thighs, not to mention how her face would pudge up and grow extra chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this type of pig out would only be this one time, it was for celebration, no more... but it felt so good, not just the food, but Frankie actually enjoyed the feeling of being stuffed to the max, there was something so good about it. OK, she thought to herself, we can have a extra big breakfast in the morning, and that would be it. Frankie just had to tell herself, this money would only bring good things to her family, nothing else.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frankie woke up early (unusual considering she preferred sleeping in and letting the alarm clock annoy her to wake up). Frankie took her night gown off, looking into the mirror reminded her of her lingering thoughts from the previous night. Her food baby bump of a belly had finally disappeared, leaving the feast she had consumed digested. Frankie checked herself out to see any immediate damage from calories, but it seemed that her body was more or less the exact same as last night (what she didn't know was she had put on an entire pound from a single meal).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting on some comfortable clothes, she went into the kitchen, remembering the idea she had the previous evening. She pulled out of the fridge many of the half-eaten cakes/pastries from the family's feast. Frankie also got out ingredients to whip up some pancakes with bacon, but these weren't your standard pancakes with bacon. Winning the lottery had let the Heck Family being able to afford some of highest quality food the town had available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bacon was enormously fatty, at a price that Frankie never thought she would be ever able to buy. The pancakes were made with whole, creamy milk and butter that was unbelievably good to Frankie when she gave it a taste test (it was also unbelievably calorie ridden, unbeknownst to Frankie). Frankie had to admit, she wasn't the most fond of cooking, especial this early in the morning, but there something fun about it this time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was getting out the high quality maple syrup, Frankie gave it some more thought on why cooking was fun now. Maybe it was the fact that cooking before always left her frustrated because it always felt like the family was losing money when they ate, it always felt like Frankie had to choose between making nice meals for her family or have money for more important issues like college and health. But now, they had more money than they knew what to do with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie was preparing the kids' lunches around 7:00 am when the rest of the family finally woke up. What Mike and the kids didn't expect when they got of their beds was alluring smells of fluffy pancakes, sizzling bacon, and the pastries of last night. No one even bothered to put on their regular clothes, the rest of the family walked into the kitchen in their pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frankie, what is that wonderful smell?\" Mike was pleasantly surprised by all of the delicious looking food the table was covered with. Frankie gave a smile, \"Oh this? I woke up early, so I decided make the family an extra special breakfast.\" Mike walked over to his much shorter wife gave her a small kiss on the forehead to show his gratitude, even if it was with his trademark stone-cold face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxl walked past his parents and started to dig into pancakes. \"Holy Crap, Mom! When did you learn to cook?!\" Axl said to his mother, all while having his face stuffed with simmering bacon. \"I've always known how to cook, I just never had the time or money to really show off my skills.\" Frankie replied. She took a seat at the table, deciding she too wanted to start devouring some left over cake with bacon. Brick simple said morning and began to eat, not really questioning anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue gave an excited squeal and when she saw all of the tasty looking food, but then, for a second, she remembered the feast from last night and her worries on growing fat and unhealthy from pig-outs began to creep up again. That was until Mike gave a hearty pat on the back. \"Come on, honey, don't you want to have this breakfast your mom made for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue took a seat next to her father, and after taking a bite of her pancake, her worries completely vanished. After a speedy scarf down, all the food from the table was inside of the stuffed stomachs of the Heck family. The kids were driven to school, all them having lunch bags that looked quite a bit bigger than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mike may have driven the kids to school, Frankie stayed home. As she was the person who did win the lottery, it was decided she would have the majority of control over the money (although the rest of family did have some sort of say over the 300 million dollars). She wanted to spend some of it on something, but was puzzled on what, that's when it hit her:</span></div></div>",

That was until a knock could be heard from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming, give me a second.\" Frankie shouted, walking over to the front door in her pajamas. She was expecting Nancy or another one of their neighbors to be there when she opened the door. Instead, she was greeted by a young woman with a few camera men at her side, and a van behind them with a satellite on the top. Needless to say, Frankie was confused by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.... and who might you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Madeline Bow, and I'm here to announce you were selected for our show!\" Her voice was full of an infectious enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I'm confused. Why were we selected for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone in your family submitted you and everyone else for the chance to be the stars of our show, and we decided you would be the best! Did they not inform you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie looked behind her, the rest of her family looking at the door in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, which one of you put us down for some 'chance for a tv show?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike just shook his head, obviously not being the one. Brick also gave it no thought and said he wasn't the one. That left Axl and Sue, who were both in deep thought. That was when Axl snapped his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I saw something about stardom, filled out the form online, and pressed send. I guess I'm about to be nationally famous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the family were in disbelief about Axl's relaxed manner about this, but they knew the teenager didn't really care about anything but his own personal image, so they accepted it. Frankie looked back to Madeline and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, I suppose. We can talk about this whole show deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Madeline was sitting at the Hecks' messy table, looking over some contracts and papers that she brought with her. Frankie brought over cups of coffee for the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you mind me asking what this show is about?\" Sue asked, growing a little excited about the prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did your brother not tell you? This show will follow a lower to middle class family, like your's and millions all over America, and show them the effects of an unbalanced diet has on their bodies over the course of a year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? Does that mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you'll be gaining weight essentially. Won't it be great?! We believe this could lead to a large awareness being spotlighted on the dangers of unhealthy eating!\" Madeline's bubbly continued, even when telling the family this revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looked at his oldest son in bewilderment. \"Why did you apply us for something like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, their website said nothing about getting fat!\" Axl defended himself, only for Madeline to quickly retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it did. Multiple times in fact. Did you skip through all of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't surprise the rest of the Heck family in the slightest if Axl had overlooked that glaring detail and focused on the stardom part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we had a few other families apply, so I won't mind if you decline. But I should mention the benefits of doing the show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed a paper to Frankie and Mike. It detailed how much money they would receive for doing this. They were in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? How can it be this much?\" Frankie asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The network is expecting this to be a big success, myself included. By the end of the year, if your family have met or exceeded our plans, this will all be yours. We will also cover all food expenses you have for the year, and cover any expenses involving your growing size. This includes clothes and even furniture if that becomes an issue.\" Madeline cheerfully explained to the parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is good, but what about the kids? What do they think about this?\" Frank asked out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do my research before scouting. Let me talk to them real quick!\" Madeline walked over to Axl first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You play football, correct? Besides fame, you can consider this as 'bulking up'. You don't have to stop being on the football team, just a change of practice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxl seemed to get the memo. \"Right. That doesn't sound too bad! Mom, dad, sign the papers already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline then faced Sue. \"Sue, I've heard you deeply care about others, and want to make a change. By doing this program, you'll be making the whole country learn of the evils of an unhealthy lifestyle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about this.\" Sue still looked extremely worried. \"I don't feel like this is a good idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline put a hand to Sue's shoulder. \"Sue, by doing this show, you can potentially save lives. And when it's all over, we can help you lose the weight if you so want. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenage girl still didn't look 100% assured, but seemed better about the idea. \"Okay.... I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally was Brick, who immediately told her, \"I don't really care about getting fat. As long as I can keep going to school and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline gave him a thumbs up and looked at the parents. \"They all seem fine with it. All that's left is you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looked conflicted before facing Frankie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure what to say. This money would be life saving. It would let us retire at a good age and leave the kids well. Frankie, I'll let you have the final say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. If you're okay with this whole thing, I'll get as fat as they want with you and the kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie thought about the idea of putting on weight. Not just winter weight, but from the sounds of it, getting seriously obese. She thought about the kids, and how this would effect them. In the end, she said...</span></div></div>",

This show should capture realism. If this is how you live on Sundays, then this how we shall record you! Just give me a second to get things ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes were dedicated to contracts being signed, phone calls Madeline had to make, and camera being set up all through out the house. After everything was ready, Madeline got a microphone, and told the family to get ready. Filming would begin any second now. The family were nervous, but some were a little excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my name is Madeline Bow, and I'm your host for 'Fattened Family'. This show will follow your average American family. Although, they may not be so average now a'days. 35% of Americans are obese, and that number continues to grow every single day. This family are primarily healthy, many can be described as fit. But what if we changed their life styles? What if made them, potentially, more like you? For the next year, this family of 5 will be given a specialized diet more comparable to what you may be eating. We shall watch them grow unhealthy, unfit, and just get down right fat. Why? To give America the wake up call it needs with its obesity epidemic! Now, let us meet the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline seemed much more calm and professional when in front of a camera, when compared to the nearly hyper woman from before. First, came out Mike. He seemed a little awkward about being in front of camera, but kept up his stoic expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my name is Mike Heck. I'm a middle aged father of 3 and I work at a quarry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was obviously followed up by Frankie, walking with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Frances Heck, but you can call me Frankie. I'm Mike's wife, and the mom of our 3 kids. I work as a dentist assistant, and I hope you enjoy the joy.\" She tried her best to be positive, but she was still finding the idea of getting fat off putting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxl was next, having all of his usual swagger and ego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo America, the name's Axl Heck. I'm in my last year of highschool, and yeah. You'll get to know me great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue stiffly made her way, choking up in front of a camera that show her to the whole country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi. My n-name is Sue H-Heck. I'm in my second year of highschool. I hope that the weight I put on makes you realize that e-eating bad f-food isn't g-g-good for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast was Brick, who walked nonchalantly into the room. \"Hi, I'm Brick Heck. I'm in middleschool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline walked back in front of the camera. \"Looks like their all here. To begin, we shall take photos of them along with taking their current weight and height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cameraman walked away. Madeline approached the family. \"Hey there, good job so far! I love your different personalities, the audience will need different styles of people to gravitate to. Sue, your awkwardness was adorable! I can already tell you'll be a fan favorite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! Wow, that sounds cool...\" Sue seemed to enjoy the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll take your measurements and whatnot off screen, that will be given to the audience in editing. But before that, I wanted to talk about something. Most shows need a main character, someone we can focus on most of the time in between other characters. I was thinking it should be one of the parents of the family. Don't get me wrong, teenage obesity is a massive issue, but adults have it even worse. After seeing you two do your introductions, I have decided it will be-\"</span></div></div>",

Now, let's get those darn photos and measurements. Staff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show's crew walked in, taking each family member to a private area. Each family member changed into clothes that showed off their bodies. This meant grey shorts and grey exercise crop tops. The men looked a bit more awkward in them, being much more fitting on Sue and Frankie. That said, they all understood why the choice. They would probably wear these again, now showing off their fattened waists. Sue felt extra uncomfortable about showing herself in the outfit, but after some encouraging words from Madeline, she did the poses needed for the photographer. Next was the measurements, which would be showed on the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie: Height-1.58 meters (5'1\")/Weight-105 pounds (47 kg)<br>\r\nMike: Height-1.96 meters (6'4\")/Weight-202 pounds (92 kg)<br>\r\nAxl: Height-1.71 meters (5'6\")/Weight-148 pounds (67 kg)<br>\r\nSue: Height-1.60 meters (5'2\")/Weight-112 pounds (51 kg)<br>\r\nBrick: Height-1.42 meters (4'6\")/Weight-99 pounds(45 kg)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Madeline exclaimed. \"That's your current info.

But this food looks much higher in quality than what the 'average American' would normally have.

Now, there is a catch....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue became worried. \"A catch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You're sort of contractually obligated to finish everything we give you per meal. And we mean EVERYTHING.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Heck family was stunned by this revelation. The amount of food on the table at that very second was like their usual lunch and dinner combined. And now, they were expected to not just finish it, but assumingly also have a dinner just as big in a few hours. It was daunting, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's to ensure peak calories intake, along with no food going to waste. I would recommend beginning now, dinner is in 6 hours!\" Madeline's comment was somehow both cheerful yet ominous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe members of the Heck family didn't seem to have another option. They walked over to the table that was covered in what you would expect from a fast food place, only if they were made by a 6-star buffet. Chowing down on hamburgers and fries while slurping down soda. One thing was for certain, this food was delicious to the Heck family. No one could deny that the food was to die for, and a far increase in taste to what they were eating before. Axl was going into it fast at first, but as he grew more full he was slowing down. Sue and Brick were taking a slower approach, as they knew it would be best for digestion. Mike started slow just like his youngest children, but began to ramp up the pace as the meal continued, quickly being matched for the fastest and hungriest. Matched because Frankie began fast and kept it up the whole time. As the supposed lead, she felt the obligation was on her shoulders to gain the most. It was hard to describe, she still wasn't a fan on gaining weight, but as this was for her family, she felt that it was in her best nature to do her absolute best for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took around half an hour, but the family had finished the large first meal. Madeline walked over and began clapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was absolutely amazing! You all did fantastic! The shots we got were great. Make sure you get some rest, let that food digest because soon, dinner will be followed up. Normally, I would tell you to walk it off, but that might burn some fat, and we don't want that. Do we?\" She let out a giddy laugh and made her way back to the crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family could barely move, but eventually they walked over to some more comfortable places, specifically their beds. There were burps and groans from everyone in the Heck family. Mike and Frankie laid together, staring at the new installed cameras in their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mike. What have we gotten ourselves into?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frankie, don't worry.\" He cuddled his wife and her swollen stomach. \"We're doing this for the best. And who knows, maybe dinner will be easier.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dinner was not easier. In fact, it was worse. The portions were bigger than lunch, leading the whole family to practically pass out after their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, everyone slowly got out of their beds. Even if they were being filmed at all times and eating unhealthy, enormous meals, they still had their lives. As such, school and work were now on their minds. Once they were changed, Madeline gathered them to the central room of the small house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning! I hope you all slept well!\" Madeline's cheerfulness didn't end, even in the morning. \"How are you all feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sluggish...\" Frankie groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tired....\" Sue yawned out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we please have 5 more minutes in bed?\" Axl complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline quickly ignored Axl's question. \"Glad to see everyone is starting to get used to the effects of eating such a diet. Trust me though, sooner than later you'll be used to it. Anyways, I've got a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrick raised his hand. \"Do we get a prize for answering correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline pondered this. \"I guess you could say you're getting a prize. Though the question might be a bit too simple.\" She revealed even more food on the table. \"Who's ready for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got a groan out of the family. They sat themselves down and began eating, all of which was at a bit of a faster rate thanks to the fact they have work/school to get to. While they ate, Madeline spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, before you ask. We called into your places of school and work. They know all about what's going on and are 100% okay with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Frankie spoke up, mid chewing a pancake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, we simply had to explain to them that it would be good advertising, being featured on national television and what not. We'll also be breaking up our crew somewhat to your locations, so make sure to play nice with them. I might even make a visit to your locations every once and a while to say hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing the taxing breakfast, the family all got up and made their way to their car. Frankie and Mike made notice of how some mini cameras had been placed in their the night prior. The kids were dropped off at their schools, Frankie was dropped at her dental office, and Mike parked the car to head into the quarry. It was a unique experience for the family, considering they were now being followed by camera operators from now on. Some places were even fitted with mini cameras, like Sue and Axl's lockers or the dental office's place of work. On Mike's end, his co-workers were curious about this whole tv show, but once Mike explained it, they all moved on and acted professional. The case was also true on Frankie's end, though occasionally it was odd talking about it to a waiting customer. The kids had it especially odd. Brick's classmates were all eager to ask about the people following him, but he simply answered in quite nonchalant ways in his usual Brick style. Sue wasn't taking the new found attention the best in her quite awkward way of handling problems. Her friends at least were there for her, even they themselves were confused by why Sue was doing this whole fattening up premise. Axl was relishing in the glory of being followed around by a tv crew. His pals were all on board, getting him hyped up. The first day outside of the cameras might be considered normal.... until lunch break came around for all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tv crew handed each of them a large box containing another massive, fattening meal. They each knew they didn't have a whole lot of time to eat in their respective locations, so they all hurried. After an agonizing 30 minutes to an hour (depending on the family member), they were done. These lunches made them sluggish in their work for the rest of the day. Some more hours past, Mike picked up Frankie, they picked up the kids, and they all got back home. They all seemed to generally recover slightly from the lunch, though it was still taking a tole on their bodies. Madeline was waiting for them indoors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....\" She asked in her perky voice. \"...how was lunch? I hope you enjoyed it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue let out a groan. \"I couldn't focus on math class afterwards....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline let out a chuckle, giving Sue a pat on the back. \"No worries. You'll get used to it sooner than later. Speaking of which, dinner will be hot and ready in 2 hours, so get mentally pumped for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family collectively groaned. It was too hard to believe this was real. Frankie could only pray that her and the family would 'get used to it' like Madeline put it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>2 weeks had passed, and the shock of being followed by a tv staff all day was beginning to fade. Everyone in the Heck family's life had accepted this as reality and the world went on as normal. The struggle continued to be the meals, with their large quantities. That said, it slowly began to get better. The constant influx of burgers, sausages, pizza, and just general meat and carbs began to sit better and better with the family, even if was still daunting for their bodies to handle. By the end of the first week, the sluggishness of their bodies after meals began to wear off and they could keep working on their responsibilities with much more keen focus. And by the end of the second week, it was now routine. The Heck family would wake up, finish their massive breakfasts, lunches, and dinners with as much ease as the old days before the change in diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family returned from school and work, Madeline waiting for them as usual. Her cheerful attitude occasional got on some of the family member's nerves at the start, but most of if not all of them had grown to be okay with Madeline in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone! I've got exciting news for you all. Want to guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike spoke up. \"Let me guess. You're increasing the amount of food we have to eat now?\" He spoke with a dry sarcasm, still not being a huge fan of this show's premise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no. Not one bit!\" Madeline held up the grey crop tops and shorts they wore at the start of the show. \"It has now been half a month since we began coverage of the show! Every 15 days or so, we check in on your progress. So let us begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family knew it would happen sooner than later. They all went into their private areas and got changed. They all came out, looking a bit fuller each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go in the order from last time. First, Brick!\" Madeline did some jazz hands, much to the amusement of no one, not even her fellow staff. Her never ending joy seemed very much like her own personality trait, nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrick came up to the scale and stood on it. He came out at 108 pounds, and increase of 9. Being the youngest, he was destined to gain the slowest. He didn't look too different from last weigh-in, except just looking a little less like skin and bones. \"Welp,\" The young teen said. \"that was an expected result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline let out a clap. \"Glad to see you taking it well. Now, our next weigh-in is Axl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man got on the scale. He was shown to now be 156 pounds, thus an increase of 8. His legs looked skinny as usual, but mid-section and arms looked just a tad bit fluffier. \"Woooo! Let's go! Bigger the better, right?\" Axl let out a cocky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed so, Axl! Finally for the kids, we have Sue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue slowly got onto the scale, looking somewhat nervous. She was shown to be 124, an entire 12 pound increase from last time. Sue's limbs saw no difference, but her chest and stomach certainly looked quite a bit more plush. It's hard to tell if her chest had officially gone up a size or not, though that could change. \"Oh wow. I wasn't expecting it to put so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries.\" Madeline walked over. \"It just means you're doing a better job than your brothers, that's all!\" The woman gave Sue's mini belly a light tap, which caused Sue to blush a little before walking away. Madeline looked back to the family. \"Now, Mike!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man walked onto the scale. It displayed he was now 214, a 12 pound increase like his daughter. The weight didn't look too bad on him compared to his fellow family members, thanks to his massive height advantage. That said, it was clear where it all went, his mid-section. Mike had a certified gut now, some might even call it a beer belly. It was noticeably plusher, and could lead to a decent grab of it. \"Well, I guessed as much. I've got to make my belt less tight just so I can fit into my pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike got off, meaning there was only one left, Frankie. Madeline didn't need to say anything, only give her a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie got on the scale, less so than her daughter but still noticeably nervous. The displayed number came as a shock to most in the room, as it displayed her as 119, meaning the middle aged woman was now 14 pounds heavier than she was at the start. Thanks to her short stature, it was quite easy to see where it had gone. Her mid-section was a bit fluffier, now she could pinch her stomach with the fat there, but most of it was from the waist down. He legs now rubbed against each other when she walked, and her butt was chunkier, making it a very tight squeeze on the grey shorts from last weigh in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Frankie. Excellent job!\" Madeline gave a fist bump to the air. \"You're doing amazingly as our lead role, keep it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, Frankie was disgusted with herself for letting herself go this much. On the other hand, she felt oddly proud of how she was taking the job. She wasn't normally congratulated on most things, so being told she being a great sport made her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie: Height-1.58 meters (5'1\")/Weight-119 pounds (53 kg)<br>\r\nMike: Height-1.96 meters (6'4\")/Weight-214 pounds (97 kg)<br>\r\nAxl: Height-1.71 meters (5'6\")/Weight-156 pounds (70 kg)<br>\r\nSue: Height-1.60 meters (5'2\")/Weight-124 pounds (56 kg)<br>\r\nBrick: Height-1.42 meters (4'6\")/Weight-108 pounds(48 kg)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Madeline. I'll keep it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great to hear. Because you'll want to keep it up.\" Madeline let out a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what do you mean?\" Sue asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, Sue. You might of noticed how your clothes might be getting too tight for you, and if not then sooner than later it will begin to happen. As such, we'll be paying for new clothes you might need. Sounds great, right? Well, that's not all we're paying for you guys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxl let curious. \"And what might that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Between each weigh-in, I'm going to give you fellas a challenge. Some might be cooperative, some might be competitive. When won, our studio will provide wonderful prizes for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides Mike, this got the family a little excited. Madeline continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This week will be cooperative. You have 15 days for the next weigh-in. All you have to do is collectively put on.....\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wait, 60?!\" Frankie exclaimed. \"How do we do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline gave a comical wag of her finger. \"Collectively, you guys gained 55 pounds. All I'm asking is you literally do what you did these past 2 weeks.... but more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike spoke up. \"But assuming you aren't increasing portions, how will we do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline gave a fast response. \"Simple! Just eat more, do less. Whenever you can take the lazy way out, like taking an elevator over the stairs, for instance. Your stomachs are getting used to the food as well, right? That means snacking between meals is also viable! Just make sure to always do your best!\" Madeline attempted to pump the Heck family up, give them some much needed motivation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Heck family gave each other some looks, unsure if this would be for the best. Even if no words were said, they all knew that a new TV would be amazing to have. Frankie simply gave a nod to Madeline, who looked ecstatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner is in 1 hour, have fun!\" She walked of the room, leaving the family to begin the next 2 weeks of gaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, the Heck family began their next major step into inevitable obesity. They had all be avoiding dessert after dinner considering how large the meal was, but this time it was different. After their large stuffing (that night it was spaghetti and meatballs), Frankie went over to the fridge and pulled out cookie dough and a tub of ice cream. They began eating through it as well, passing around the sweet and cold treats. Not long passed before that too was finished, the Heck family collectively rubbing their bloated guts before heading to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause the Heck family no longer had to buy their main meals, this gave them an extra sum of money. The following day, Frankie used this surplus of cash to buy a metaphorical ton of snacks and possible dessert options. This was cut between family members, some opting to have large stashes than others. After the weekend, it was noticeable how the Heck family was eating even more than before to their co-workers and classmates. Whenever they had the chance, a Heck family member would open a bag of chips or chew on a chocolate bar or just generally be chomping on something at all day. This even began to annoy some of the people around them, as they simply wanted some peace and quiet from the constant wrapper noises. When they got back home, the snacking would stop, but something new was added. After dinner, the family would gather around the TV with all of their sweets and begin some more eating. It was a constant cycle of eating at all times. Naturally, this lead to something they were all expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothes began to rip and tear. First was of course Frankie, who casually while at work at the dentist office heard a large ripping noise. She checked a mirror and saw that her pants now had a hole, showing off a portion of her panties. She was dying of embarrassment the rest of the day. It wasn't long before Mike had his own incident, having a button from his shirt pop off, showing off his growing gut. He couldn't feel luckier that none of his co-workers were there to see him, as it was the end of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids didn't fair much better with their own wardrobe malfunctions. After football practice, Axl had found that his shoulder pads and jeresy thanks to his growing waist and hips, leading to his teammates to get a good laugh out of his discomfort. It became ever so common for Brick to show off the edge of his tummy when he stood up as his shirts got ever so smaller. And Sue almost had a social break down when she had to stretch for gym class, only for her bra to snap off, falling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the Heck family's wardrobe was getting smaller by the minute. Luckily, Madeline and the TV crew were there to help. Anytime they needed larger clothing, they always had an exact replacement of the clothing in a bigger size, or multiple sizes larger if requested. At first, many of them were quite ashamed of themselves for asking for bigger clothes, but ultimately even the most stubborn family members recognized that this would be needed if they were going to continue on the show.</span></div></div>",

Their bellies were hanging over the waistband of their pants and almost to their calves, as they were very flabby. Their asses were 30 feet across. They were devouring an entire chocolate cake each. Their bellies wobbled, jiggled, and swayed with every bite they took. \"Where are the girls, they're missing all this great food.\" Axl asked while getting up with some difficulty and waddled over to the table of food. As he walked away, the others caught a glimpse of his near 30 foot ass, which swayed, wobbled, and jiggled with each step. His hips and thighs were so big that they tripled in size since last month and made his ass look bigger and wider that they really were. He grabbed a whole chocolate cake and milk off of the table and waddled back and landed with a lot of jiggling on what was left of the family couch. \"Sorry about the couch\", he said, \"I'm still not used to all this weight\", and patted his bellowing belly, which made him burp, \"BBBBUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPPPP\". Mike patted his bellowing belly and was going to answer, but all that came out was, \"bbbuuuuurrrrrrpppppppp\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m in the kitchen getting food.\" Frankie said as her head was in the fridge looking for something to chow down on, and all they saw was her now 40 foot ass blocking the view of her face. She then turned around, saw them, and said, \"Hey you guys what's up\". Her boobs were now a MMM size, and were barely containable in her too-small tank top, which showed off nearly a mile of cleavage. Her bulging belly now completely hung over the waistband of her pants and caused her shirt to rise up over it. As she made her way back to the couch, everything was jiggling uncontrollably, especially her ass, which jiggled and swayed like crazy. She then sat down with a lot of jiggling and enjoyed her snack and chugged her Pepsi, which was settled into her jiggly cleavage.\"Hey Mike, do you like my ass?\" Frankie said as she slapped her huge ass, and it jiggled like Jell-O. Mike then replied, \"Ya, almost as much as I love my huge gut.\", looking down at it and slapping it slightly and watching it jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the ground began to shake as they heard, \"Hey guys I'm on my way, you better have saved me some food\", as Sue came into view. Her boobs were now around a PPP size, as the shirt she wore revealed 2 and a half cleavage, and the buttons were barely holding together. Her colossal belly was hanging over the waistband of her pants and almost to her knees. Her love handles were also a lot of love to handle, and her ass was around 50 feet across, and was tightly packed into some sweatpants that said \"juicy\" on the backside. \"Hello guy, is there any food left?\", she asked as she struggled to see all of them over her sea of jiggly cleavage while munching on one of the many doughnuts around her pudgy fingers while chugging down a gallon of milk, which was lodged into her very large and jiggly cleavage. \"Well mom, looks like my boobs are bigger than yours BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP\", as the buttons burst, and more cleavage then flowed out.</span></div></div>",
