Your mother looks like she's having a conniption fit in the corner. Sam and Bill are busy apologizing to your enraged mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry Ms. Johnson...T-there was a skunk in the middle o-of the road and I had to swerve to m-miss it...T-then one thing led to another.\" Said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom's gonna kill me Sammy.\" Said Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it seems the wish worked, though certainly not in the manner you expected. Maybe trying another wish would prevent your mom from not blowing her stack on your two best friends, you whispered under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish my mom wouldn't freak out about the hole in the wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike magic, your mom did a complete one eighty in her personality. \"Oh don't worry you two! I've been meaning to add a window there anyway! Come to the kitchen, I'll call a tow truck. You can have some lemonade. Where's Saun? Oh, there he is! Your friends are here Saun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill and Sam had amusing looks on their faces. Clearly they had no idea what in the world was going on. You snickered under your breath and waved hello to them. Eventually you all found yourselves sitting at the kitchen table, enjoying a nice drink. Sam was still visibly shaking at having driven a car through your house while Bill seemed more interested in discussing the latest video game. Your mom hummed merrily while dusting around the old red pick-up truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you tell your friends about the bracelet?</span></div></div>",

Her bare-midriff, pink tank-top barely contained her DD-cup breasts while her miniskirt showed off her legs. It was evident that she took pride in her look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As you wondered what to do with her, the doorbell rang. You sister got up and walked to the front door with a seductive sway to her hips. Opening the door, she discovered her 20-year-old boyfriend, Austin. <br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Austin!\" she giggled.<br>\r\n\"May I come in?\" smiled Austin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    They started chatting as you came up with an idea. <br>\r\n\"Ashlind, come here!\" you shouted at her.<br>\r\n\"No, you twerp!\" she snapped back but she lost control of her body and walked over to you, shouting all the time.<br>\r\n\"Shut up and listen!\" you tell her. Her mouth is sealed but she seems to be struggling. You silently wish that your family was submissive to you, rather than controlled. Ashlind eased.<br>\r\n\"I want you to embarrass yourself and then dump Austin!\" you tell her. Standing 6'7\", Austin was on the local College's basketball team. Ashlind was a proud girlfriend, but that would soon change.</span></div></div>",
