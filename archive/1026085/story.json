He was having a normal moring, besides the fact that he's the American Dragon. He went to Grandpa's house to get his books that he had left the other day and he had some time to kill. So Grandpa told Jake to take Phu dog and deliver a vial of what looked like water to Jake, in a duffel bag to the Pixie Fairy delivery building. Jake didn't want to be late so after some grumbling he ran out of the house and after looking around and seeing no one, he \"DRAGON UP\" ed. While flying over the rooftops he noticed something green out of the corner of his eye. It was the Huntsclan Staff!!! And sure enough, there was the Huntsmaster about to capture a Unicorn. jake swooped into action and after a brief but intense struggle, Jake won. The fight had gotten Jake hot and dried out so he took his water bottle out of his bag and began to drink it. Phu dog ran up and shouted \"No Jake thats the potion!\" but it was too late. Jake had already drinken the whole thing, and he geard his stomach rumbling and asked what the ption did. Phu dog said \"Well kid, the pixies are small and they some wnat to be human size and well thats what it was for.\" Jake felt his knees shake and suddenly the ground started getting farther away! Jake jumped into the street so as not to crush the house he was on top of and kept growing. He noticed that the cars were getting so tiny. At normal size he could pick them up with his dragon strenght, but now he could crush them with his foot. But he was still growing, where does he stop?</span></div></div>",

He had already changed back into human form and he looked down to see that his feet had completely ripped through his shoes, leaving him barefoot. His foot had crushed a car completely flat during his growth spurt and already the people had begun to panic and run away. He looked around for Phu dog but he was nowhere to be found. He panicked and feared that he had crushed him like he did that car! But he sighed in relief when he found him unconcious underneath a pile of rubble that was once a small 1 floor house which his foot had smashed through. The family had luckily gotten out in time. He reached down and carefully picked up Phu dog and put him in his pocket. ''Man, i'm huge! Now what am i gonna do!? Grandpa is gonna kill me!'' Then it dawned on him, he saw what he had done to the car and the house and realized the power he now had. He thought changing into a dragon was cool, But this was even better!

The other titans had gone out for pizza and when they asked if he wanted to go he said he had to train. He had been lifting weights and wailing on the punching bag all day. And he had gotten super sweaty. His armpits were soaked, and frankly he stunk. But when you're an athlete like him, you get used to getting sweaty and a little stinky. He decided it was time to quit and take a shower. He put the bar back, and stood up and stretched. As soon as he stretched he got a wiff of his underarm. He stuck his head under there and took a big sniff. He quickly retreated it and waved his arm to wave the stench away, ''Pee-u! Man i gotta take a shower!'' He said as he walked out of the gym. He stripped naked and turned the water on. He stepped into the shower and started washing himself off. He made sure to use extra soap on his armpits and scrub his hair real good. And especially, his ballsack. His nuts were sticky and sweaty from working out, and he made sure to clean his manhood real good. As he got out of the shower he decided to take a nap. He went into his bedroom, not bothering to get dressed, and got comfortable. He didnt mind being naked in his room, especially since he was the only one home. And soon he fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

He quickly brought them back down and looked puzzled. He was feeling very strange, he flung the bedcovers aside and swung his legs over the side of the bed. To his surprise his feet touched the ground alot sooner than usual. ''Huh?'' was all he could say. As he began to stand up, and before he could stand to his ''full height'' he bumped his head on the ceiling. ''Ow! What the!?'' he said rubbing his head. He looked up and his nose brushed up against the ceiling, he quickly crouched down. He saw the door, which was now smaller than usual. So was everything else in his room. And he suddenly realized, HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET OUT! He quickly rushed to the door and carefully opened it. His body was obviously too large to fit through. But he realized he had to try or else he'd be stuck in his room forever! He then began squeezing himself through the tiny doorframe. He managed to get his head through but his body still remained on the other side. He struggled and strained to get through, causing cracks in the wall as his body strained the small doorframe. Then with a final strain his body burst through the doorframe, causing it to be reduced to rubble. As he panted and tried to catch his breath. He realized how big he really was. He stood up to his full height, now only his hair brushing up against the ceiling in the hallway. He turned around and saw the big hole in the wall where his door used to be. ''uh...this is gonna be pretty hard to explain to the guys'' he said to himself. Then he realized, that all of this would be pretty hard to explain. He looked down, and saw his bare legs and manhood. ''Oh yeah this is just great, not only am i big, i'm naked too!'' He thought, and knowing full well that none of his clothes would fit him. He walked down the hall, towards the living room. As he walked, he began to think his situation over. He estimated he was over 9 ft. tall! ''oh yeah, this is wonderful'' he said as he stomped nude down the hallway.</span></div></div>",

The boys in the school got so big the buildings were reduced to rubble. Now every boy 15 and younger were Macs and Terrances height. Who grew us said the boys. We did said Mac and Terrance. Wow thanks said the boys. One of the boys named Adam said Hey why do I feel so tingly. Yea us too said the other boys. Mac and Terrance also felt it and knew what was happening. We're growing again the boys said. Their cocks got so long and big the boys cocks were all longer than a bridge. The boys height increased to 3 million light years.

Max thought if he maybe tried again it wouldn\u2019t back fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax shot the ball and it rolled off the rim and it bounced into the bushes. \u201cNo Fair, I\u2019ve missed so many times, I\u2019ll never get a ball in!\u201d Max picked up the ball and sighed.  \u201cMaybe I should wish to be bigger again, maybe this time it won\u2019t back fire.\u201d  Max thought about this for a moment and decided he would do it, however his stomach growled. So he decided to go to Dragon Land after he ate lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax finished his lunch and went to the playroom and got out the dragon scale. Nobody was home, his parents were at work and Emmy went to play with her friends next door, so nobody would know he was gone. Max also got out a map, which showed all of dragon land.  \u201cOk here we go!\u201d Max said the rhyme and he was instantly transported to Dragon land. His dragon friends were also busy and doing their own thing so max had to walk. Max followed the map and soon arrived at a well.  However, this well looked a little different then the first one, it was near a dark spooky cave and surrounded by leaves. The Well also had a sign on it, which was blocked by the leaves.  The sign said \u201cDO NOT WISH ON WELL, THIS WELL IS USED FOR EVIL.\u201d This meant that if someone wished on the well, the wish could be used only for their benefit, the power could go to the wishers head, or the wish would be used for evil purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax tossed in his coin and said \u201cI wish I was bigger!\u201d Max\u2019s body glowed and is if luck had it he began to grow! He expanded to six feet. His shoes and socks tore off exposing some huge feet! \u201cWow I got some big feet, but what will I do when my parents find out?!\u201d Max said freaking out, \u201cHow will I return to normal size. Suddenly, Max\u2019s body shrunk back to his normal size of around 3.5 feet! \u201cHuh that\u2019s weird, I wonder what happens if I say grow to 10 feet.\u201d Of course Max\u2019s body then expanded to 10 feet tall! \u201cWow, I can control my size, This\u2019ll be so much fun!\u201d Max said. The power was beginning to crush max. However, Max\u2019s parents still might find out about his abilities. \u201cDarn it, I wish there was someone where I could go with out my parents finding out about this.\u201d Suddenly max felt a power surge threw him. Max was confused and looked at the map, which stated that the well allowed 3 wishes.  \u201cWow this is perfect, maybe I can teleport now!\u201d Max said with a tone of excitement! Max wished to go anywhere, but his home town and he began to warp out of his dimension and he couldn\u2019t see for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Max\u2019s vision cleared, max realized he wasn\u2019t in his hometown, in fact it looked like he was in a different dimension.  He noticed he was the outskirts of another city and smirked. Max thought about all he could do would this new found power, which was corrupting him even more, making more cruel, evil and ruthless!</span></div></div>",

Then max was alone. Even though max was home alone he was still upset because he was still short. Then Max's stomach growled. \"Wow I'm hungry\" said Max I think I'll have some cookies. But max saw the cookies were on the top shelf and that all he could reach were veggies. \"Aww I hate veggies\" sad Max, \"I wish I was taller\". Max decided to forget about the cookies and go back to his room. He tried his best to forget about the cookies. But growling stomach wouldn't let him. He decided to read a book which was about magic spells and stuff. He then saw a well which granted wishes that only costed a nickel.\"Cool\" said Max, maybe I can make a wish on the well to make myself bigger. He found a nickel and followed the clues to the well. When he found it, he realized that it was in a forest not to far from his house. \"Cool\" said Max. I can come here whenever I want. He examined the well took of the weeds and took away the rocks. Max took his nickel and tossed it in and said \"I wish I was bigger\". Nothing happened at first, but then the well started to shake and all of a sudden a huge green light engulfed Max. Max opened his eyes and saw he was still the same height. \"Rats\" said Max \"This well was a lie\" Max decided to just walk away still hungry as his stomach continued to growl with hunger.

Even though last time he wished to be big it got out of control. \"I'm sick of being so little, I wanna get big and be a giant again\", Max said. Max decided to read a book about the magic things in Dragon Land to try and take his mind off being upset over his short stature. Max got the book out of his drawer and began to read. The things in the book were pretty standard, magic tees, magic holes, (ect). Max was about to close the book out of boredom when a certain page caught his attention <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe page was about a magical growth potion that was meant to make plants in dragon land grow bigger, it said nothing about the results for a human child. Max was curious at this.  \"A growth potion wow that's cool, I wonder what will happen if I try\", said Max.  He continued to read the page, the book said the ingredients for the potion were in Dragon Land. \"That's so cool, I gotta make that potion so I can get bigger\", Max said excitedly. Max took out the magic spell and said the rhyme to teleport to dragon land. Max quickly arrived in Dragon Land with the book in his hands, so he could follow the clues to find the ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Max gathered all the necessary ingredients he took a empty bottle from Ketzel, without him knowing, dropped them in and began to mix the ingredients. The ingredients mixed together to form a Purple liquid. Max looked at the book and the recommended dosage was only one drop. Max frowned and said \"What one drop, forget that I'm gonna drink the whole thing!\" Max drank the potion down to the last drop and let out a belch. Max blushed, covered his mouth and said \"Well excuse me\", he said quietly. Max waited for the potion to take effect, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair it didn't work, I should have never undone the wishing spell to be big\", Max grumbled. Max sadly held the book in his hand and said the rhyme to go back home. He was home in a flash and tossed his book to the side and went back to sulking. Soon, Max fell asleep completely unaware that the potion actually worked and was also unaware of the upcoming events!</span></div></div>",

Their parents, Barb and Hank, are retried super hero\u2019s and they like to poke fun about it, even if it gets them in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax and Billy had some things in common, they didn\u2019t like school and relatively low grades, they didn\u2019t like following the rules either and it felt good to them whenever they broke the rules, even if it was something small, like eating snacks before dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of eating, Max and Billy have been doing that quite a lot lately, but everyone, including them, shook it off as a growth spurt. Max and Billy usually are junk like pizza, hot dogs, ice cream, and burritos, especially burritos, burritos were their favorite food to eat, they enjoyed how it made their bellies feel and how it made farts come out, despite their relatives constant disgusted glances.  While everyone thought this was a growth spurt, they could not be more wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a quiet winter afternoon,  Max and Billy were home alone, even though their parents didn\u2019t trust max, they had no choice, phoebe was doing super hero training, Nora was with friends, and they had to step out, so they prayed that max would be good and their would be no accidents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax was in his bed, enjoying the quiet and alone time, he was about to doze off, when of course his stomach growled, he was hungry again!  \u201cReally again, I just ate 5 slices of pizza, how am I still- Urrrrp- hungry?!\u201d Max said with a belch. Max sighed as he went up to the kitchen, since his hunger was very strong. As if it was fate, Billy\u2019s stomach growled as well and he ate 7 slices of pizza! \u201cWhy am I hungry, shouldn\u2019t I be- Urrrrp- full?!\u201d He said with a belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey met in the kitchen and at the same time, they said, \u201cLet Me guess, Hunger?!\u201d They nodded at each other and chuckled. They both wanted a burrito, so max just prepared some burritos, about 5 for the each of them and he got some soda! They licked their lips at the food and just decided to dig in!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Max and Billy, both starving,  just dug into their food like a pack of wolves.  They were also pretty messy eaters. The table and their fingers became covered in beans and burrito sauce, but they didn\u2019t care as they licked it up, they even licked up the crumbs on the plates and chugged all of their sodas.  However, as the boys were eating, their bodies began to expand and grow taller, but they were too busy eating to notice.  Their shirts grew snug around their firm flat stomachs, their belts began to strain more and more as it was struggling to hold up the pants, which were also shrinking on the growing boys, due to their expanding torsos. Their feet began to outgrow their socks and peak out of their shoes.  Speaking of feet, max and Billy\u2019s feet almost always REEKED of dirt, soot, odor, and sweat. Especially Billy\u2019s, even with super speed and rarely running out of breath, his feet were like a fungus and mushroom farm as well as sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax\u2019s feet reeked in its own way, while they weren\u2019t as smelly, they could definitely knock someone out cold.  Max\u2019s feet stunk so bad because he simply refused to wash them. Max\u2019s band mates also very smelly feet but max definitely had the worst smelling feet by far. Same when came to bodily functions. Max\u2019s belches and farts still dominated in the group. Billy had max beat in the smell and volume of his farts, meaning how long and loud they were, but his burps weren\u2019t was good, but very impressive for a kid his age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax and billy continued to expand but relatively slowly, soon they were 6 feet and 5 inches tall and didn\u2019t even notice it.  Max and Billy finished up their food, including the scraps, and rubbed their engorged guts, strangely max and Billy were hungry for at least one more cookie, so max simply used his telekinesis to get a cookie for them and he still didn\u2019t notice that his arm was bigger. Max finished his cookie and burped loudly, followed by a very loud wet smelly fart.  \u201cBeat that Billy!\u201d Max said laughing. Billy took the challenge and loud out a much louder, smellier, wetter, and longer fart. When he tried to beat the burp, he came very close but was bested by Max.  \u201cHa, I beat your fart Max!\u201d  Billy said in a cocky tone!  \u201cYeah, but you still couldn\u2019t beat my burps and you probably never will!\u201d Max laughed. Both boys chuckled, enjoying having some fun.  \u201cWell I\u2019m gonna go back to my room and release more \u201cbombs\u201d, Max said.  \u201cMe too, maybe I\u2019ll leave Nora a little surprise...\u201d  Billy said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as max and Billy got up, their pressure was too much for their belts and they snapped and their pants fell around their ankles, their shirts tore off too, leaving the boys in spandex undies, which had wet stains from the farts. Both boys noticed this were shocked and embarrassed as their faces turned bright red.  \u201cWhat happened to us, \u201cWe\u2019re huge and taller then our whole family!\u201d Billy said.  \u201cI don\u2019t know, but..... I like this!\u201d Max said suddenly getting excited.  \u201cMe too, too bad about your clothes max!\u201d Billy said with a chuckle. Max blushed and said \u201cWhatever I like being my undies and you\u2019re in just undies too, don\u2019t you like it?!\u201d   Billy just blushed and said \u201cYeah you\u2019re right!\u201d \u201cYou know what Billy, come to my lair, let\u2019s release some bombs together! Max opened his slide and slid down and Billy followed. Though it was sort of hard to slide down, since both boys were much bigger now.  The boys landed at the bottom of the slide and farted and burped away.  Billy said \u201cLet\u2019s do the same to Nora\u2019s and my room, she hates it when I fart during the night!\u201d  Max chuckled and they went to billy and Nora\u2019s room to release more bombs, it seemed like they would never run out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs max and billy returned to Max\u2019s lair, Max asked \u201cHey billy, do you think we got bigger just because we ate A lot?\u201d Billy wasn\u2019t shore and decided to test it out, he grabbed a cookie max had lying around and split it. With max. Sure enough, Billy and Max\u2019s  body grew again, soon they were 7 feet tall and their underwear grew even tighter, but it was surprisingly stubborn and refused to rip. Since their undies were so tight, if the boys had an erection, it would be extremely hard not to notice.  \u201cWow we do grow by eating!\u201d Max said. \u201cThis is awesome!\u201d Billy said.  After being amazed by the growth again, billy wanted to ask max a question, \u201cHey max would it be cool if I moved in with you and became you\u2019re roommate?\u201d is what billy asked.  Max was surprised by the offer, but smiled and said \u201cOf course and this is perfect cause mom and dad will call it family bonding and won\u2019t even care!\u201d Billy smiled and was happy that he said yes. They had to move some stuff around but it was easy, since the boys height came with a huge increase in strength.  They were even able to move down Billy\u2019s stuff with ease. Soon, Max and Billy\u2019s stuff were in the same room, even though dr collaso wasn\u2019t happy with this, but they didn\u2019t care. Max and Billy decided to sit on their beds and fart and burp some more, since it was really fun! Billy was following in Max\u2019s footsteps, which made max happy because he was sure that he could make billy become evil like him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Also shrinking is only used in this to return to normal size so hope that doesn't violate a rule.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the ban on superheroes was lifted a few months ago, the city of Metroville has become a city of safety and peace. All crime was wiped out of the city, with the combined efforts of Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Frozone, and a few out heroes that have come out of hiding like Voyd. With all the good news, you'd think there wouldn't be anyone who was displeased with all the peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell then you haven't met Dash Parr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond boy groaned in annoyance while constant giggles echoed all around him. After crime was wiped out of Metroville, other villains and crooks have been terrorizing other nearby cites and towns, thinking it'd be easier to get their way there with less heroes residing there. Unfortunately for them, Winston Deavor was immediately notified of any illegal activity and contacted Dash's parents right away, since he trusted them the most to handle any dire situation. To his credit, he was right to due so, as no petty crook or super-villain could stop the two, as Frozone and other superheroes also accompanied them most of the time. You'd think Dash would be happy, and to a certain extent he was, about his parents being famous for their heroics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash sighed, as he got a cookie from the jar and waved it in the air, thinking about how he got into this situation to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week earlier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean I have to watch Jack-Jack!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Incredible looked at his son with a raised eyebrow, as he stared back with a 'Are you crazy!?' sort of look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be like that Dash. You know your mother and I are busy nowadays with the crime wave going on in other cities and towns nearby. And your sister is still trying to get closer with that Tony kid.\" Bob had a slight grimace on his face saying that, some guilt about what he caused months ago lingering in his mind. \"Besides, you're going to have to learn to take care of him eventually when you and your younger brother get older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash loved his brother, he really did, but after how poorly last time went on that ship, he didn't want to try again out of fear of having Jack-Jack hate him, and because it was so dull of a task to him. \"No way! Last time I couldn't calm him down and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why you're going to take care of him, You won't improve in taking care of him unless you try.\" Bob could certainly empathize with Dash though, having a little taste of how hard it can be to take care of Jack-Jack months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine, but what did you mean about me taking care of my brother when I get older?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like your father said Dash...\" Both males turned to see Elastigirl enter the room in uniform. \"Jack-Jack is going to start relying on you as your get older. Little brothers tend to look up to their older sibling, more so if they are the same gender, and Jack-Jack seems to like being around you a lot. You feel the same way right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash frequently plays with his baby brother in the yard, specifically with Jack-Jack's eye laser-power, and they both laugh while doing so. The boy would be lying if he said he didn't know what her point was and conceded with a grimace, \"Alright fine, I'll give it another shot. But I wanna fight crime with you two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen had a gentle smile only a mother can give their children, \"I know sweetie, but your father and I told you, we don't want you or your sister involved in crime-fighting just yet. You're still young and I can't bare the thought of something happening to my first-born son...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bleh! Quit being so mushy and sad mom! I'll babysit him if you just stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen laughed and nodded, before turning to her husband with a serious expression. \"Winston called. Couple of villains showed up a few cities over. Poisonous gases already enveloping a quarter of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound good. Alright, let's go to the car! What city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell you more details on the way! Bye Dash, we love you!\" Dash waved them goodbye as both parents ran downstairs,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash mused to himself out loud while seeing his brother teleport in front of him to eat the cookie, \"I miss the action. What good are superpowers if you can't use them? Right Jack-Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youngest sibling garbled in agreement, before going back to eating his cookie. Dash looked at his brother and thought on how well he improved in taking care of him. The first time, the house was left a scorched mess. Dash quickly learned that heavy music was something Jack despised, as it brought out his worst side, his fire powers and demon form. He was found with scratches and scorch marks all over, leading to them wearing their superhero uniforms when Dash babysat Jack-Jack to control the situation a bit more. The next time wasn't as bad, but a few things were still left destroyed due to mozart music being something Bob recommended. The third time, Dash succeeded in kept Jack-Jack behaved by having him play tag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not something I'm doing again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack-Jack tagged him every time by hitting him with his eye lasers to make him flinch from the slight pain, and then teleport out out the dimension, making it take more than 10 minutes for him to return, much to Dash's frustration. Though, Dash did enjoy his newest method to keep him and his brother entertained. He got Jack-Jack to make a few tiny buildings with his new creation power he developed a few weeks ago and using Dash's old toys, they'd play Godzilla with the city, lasers and all. It was certainly fun to pretend to be the bad guy for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got Dash thinking about something. \"It'd be fun to be a giant and rampage throughout the city. I could do anything I wanted and no one could stop me...\" Dash grinned at the thought, but shook his head and dismissed it when he thought about his family. Not only could they possibly stop him, but he didn't want to hurt them or worse due to his bond with him. \"Maybe if they couldn't get involved somehow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash thought had a thought. Jack-Jack could manipulate his own size, like he did on Deavor's cruise ship. That made Dash wonder if he could use it to change other people's sizes too. \"And without the fat...\" Dash added with a grimace. Some people liked being bulky, as some students in school pointed out to him, but he couldn't imagine himself being plump. He was also curious if Jack-Jack could alter his size without becoming bulky either. He also knew that his brother listened to him a lot more now, possibly as thanks for keeping him entertained and because he liked Dash more. That in mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say little brother, can you make yourself giant without making yourself fat?\" The baby giggled and nodded, as he began to concentrate and Dash's eyes widened in realization, quickly dashing out to the yard and place the super-baby down just as he grew larger than their house, with no increased in body fat, his giggles rumbling like thunder. Covering his ears with a wince, the blond yelled up, \"Okay, you can shrink down now!\" After doing so, Dash was looking at him in awe, before asking him to try to do the same to him. Nodding while giggling, the baby concentrated and the 10-year-old looked around in amazement, seeing everything become smaller until the house came up to his knee. He was tempted to have some fun at the size right there and then, but quickly remember his parents and how he might make the news in a few seconds if anyone saw him like that, so he whispered for Jack-Jack to shrink him and the baby did so, going back down to his normal size with mixed disappointment and slight relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only there was a place I could rampage as a giant without my mom, dad and sister getting in the way...\" As if understanding his brother's wishes and wanting to please him like he's done for him, the infant concentrated and Dash yelped seeing them both started to warp out of their own dimension. When space stopped distorting around him, Dash took a look at his surroundings and saw that they were no longer in Metroville, but on the outskirts of another city entirely! Wanting to know what world they were in, Dash used his power to zoom inside the city and steal a few newspapers before going back to his brother, who laughed joyfully at his return. The newspapers told him nothing about the world he was in other than the fact that their were no superheroes in it, as nothing in the news talked about them, not even a mention. Glancing between his brother and the newspaper, a grin slowly formed on Dash's freckled face before he picked up his brother and hugged him in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jack-Jack! You're the best baby brother ever!\" The baby giggled in joy and returned the hug with a delighted smile, before Dash placed him down and grinned, thinking about all the fun he was gonna have with this helpless city. He looked at his brother and the thought of his sibling joining him entered his mind. After a bit, Dash came to a conclusion and said to his brother with a mischievous smirk...</span></div></div>",

Dash knew the feeling when tried it up and it so happens when he\u2019s starting to grow even bigger more than he was the last time.  He feels like he\u2019s shooting up like an elevator from his point of view, but more when seeing the city had started to get smaller more and more as he grew from his baby brother\u2019s control<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash is able to whiteness this moment on, and it proved evident when he eventually managed to grow up to 150 feet tall, with his superhero suit grew with him as well.  He looked around the city, looking gigantically big, and even with that smile says it all in regard.  He could immediately hear those voices which are all shocked and terrified of a giant kid.  So much so, everyone seems to start screaming and scattered away from Dash and his newly size gigantic frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could chuckle that the people reacted in a very horrified way, but not Jack-Jack when Dash can hear the laughter of the youngest sibling.  He looked down and saw the baby looking so excited and smiles as seeing his giant brother shot up in frame and he seems to be loving it as well as Dash is at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dash immediately regretted his choice in words. His baby brother made an excited garble and immediately started shooting lasers all of the city. It was fun to watch for Dash, watching the tiny people flee from the deadly lasers coming from the giant baby's eyes, but those lasers were cutting through multiple buildings at once each time Jack-Jack fired them. At this point, Dash would have very little left to toy with if Jack-Jack burnt everything to ashes right off the bat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet...It occurred to the ten-year-old that the city they were in wasn't the only city. Heck, even if it was the only one on this version of Earth, Dash figured Jack-Jack could simply take them to another universe and they could have some more fun there. The excited giggles and clapping his brother did from his fun also made it hard for the older sibling to deny him for Dash's own selfishness. So, he stood there and watched for now, encouraging his little brother with an interested grin. \"Good job little brother! Now aim for those ones!\" Seeing where his older brother was pointing, the baby nodded and fired them right at the skyscraper, both giants watching debris fall and people fleeing not to get crushed to no avail, some blood visible from the wreckage, as both young boys laughed from their fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dash did a glance around and saw the city almost completely destroyed by this point, Jack-Jack felt something firing at his leg, curiously glancing down to see some police officers shooting at him in desperation. The bullets didn't hurt Jack that much, but after a while, the area he was being shot at began to sting, similar to the discomfort some would have of being bit by a bug. Jack-Jack got annoyed and leered down at them while making some angered garble noises. The officers should've back down upon seeing this gigantic baby getting nothing more than annoyed by their constant shooting. Instead, they panicked and fired closer to his face, one nearly hitting him in the eye. Understandably, Jack-Jack lost patience and shook a bit before his entire body set on fire, something that made his older brother jump slightly in shock, now paying attention to what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash saw the officers firing rounds of bullets at Jack-Jack and leered down annoyed. \"Hey! Stop shooting at my baby brother you annoying pests!\" As a response to now angering the much bigger giant of the two, some of them changed focus and shot towards Dash, hitting his legs, stomach and some each reached his chin, while some kept focus on the raging fire baby, who began stomping around in blind fury. Now even more annoyed, Dash simply use his powers and in the next second, all of the officers found themselves in the grip of the blond giant, some gulping in fear at the sheer size difference. The massive blue irises of the giant glaring down at their tiny, helpless forms didn't help either. Dash tightened his grip slightly and the tiny officers screamed in pain, their weapons crumbling from the severe pressure. Opening his fist to see their destroyed weapons, Dash grinned in satisfaction, while the tiny officers whimpered or shook with intense fear knowing they were now completely defenseless. \"Now what to do with you little bugs? Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash didn't get much time to think of a punishment before his brothers enraged screams of anger brought his attention back to the flaming infant, who was jumping around as the demon-like form he had, setting fire to undestroyed sections of the city, as well as sections that were destroyed, where some survivors or people who fled earlier met a slow, agonizing end. Deciding his priority was to calm down his enraged brother, Dash glanced back down the tiny officers and said with a smirk, \"I'll deal with you ants later. Try not to move too much in your prison in the meantime!\" They didn't know what Dash meant until he opened the waistband of his speedo, giving them a glimpse of the boy's gigantic moons before dropping them in and closing the waistband, giggling slightly from them movement he felt back there. \"Sorry bugs~ Not much places to carry you since I only have my mask and speedos left!\" And Dash didn't feel like confining them in his front side either, fearing their movements might tickle him and that wouldn't help when trying to soothe his little brother, (though that would prove to be a mute point in a minute). Not wasting any more time on them for now, Dash sped back to his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing the city set ablaze though, Dash realized he should put out the fire first, as he didn't want to test if he had immunity to fire at his size at the moment, and he felt his captives possibly dying from the heat would be no fun. He also didn't have that special controller or the suit to simply put out the flames, adding a mental note to remind Edna to make new sets of both upon getting back home later. So, he remembered a scene he saw from the news one point when growing up, involving another hero with speed powers using it to put out a fire by running enough circles around it to create a mini cyclone that extinguished the flames. Grinning in excitement of being able to recreate that, Dash wasted no time and created a cyclone in a matter of seconds, his brother also extinguished with the flames, but sent flying in the air from the strong gust of the cyclone, giggling from the fun he was having. Dash paled a bit seeing his brother being sent flying and stood out to catch him when he began falling back down. However, Jack-Jack simply used his levitating powers to avoid possible injury, floating to his brother and giggling happily in his brother's arms. Dash sighed in relief and gently smiled at his younger brother, patting his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun so far Jack-Jack?\" The baby giggled and nodded, enjoying the comfort from his older sibling. Dash smiled, glad to be able to entertain his troublesome little brother without as much difficulty this time. He also slightly felt a pang of joy in seeing his little brother slowly liking him more and more as they spent time together. Thinking back to the foolish officers that dared mess with him and his little brother, Dash frowned slightly and glanced down at Jack-Jack, \"Sorry little bro. I've should've made sure you didn't get to that point of anger in the first place.\" The baby made some sort of garble that Dash somehow felt said not to worry about it. At the thought of the tiny officers, Dash glanced back to his rump and grinned. \"But don't worry little brother, Your big brother took care of those meanies for you~\" He patted his butt saying that and couldn't help giggling from their struggles, his brother joining in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash then noticed the debris scattered everything from his cyclone, which dispersed by now, and got an idea. Grinning, he lifted his brother on his shoulder and said while glancing at the destroyed city,\"Well this city's done for. Let's move onto the next! I've got a fun idea I want to test out! Hold on tight Jack-Jack!\" The baby nodded and held on, as the giants reached the next city within the span of a minute. In Dash's hurry, he unknowingly sped through a couple of villages, footprints and an immensely strong gale of wind being all that was left of them. Upon reaching the next city, Dash put his brother down and explained his idea to him, ignoring the faint screams of panic coming from said city nearby, \"Jack-Jack, do you think you could use your powers to send my cyclone towards the city?\" The baby nodded and Dash grinned in excitement, patting his little brother once more and then getting started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter creating the cyclone, Jack-Jack's eyes narrowed in concentration, his blue eyes glowing slightly as he used telekinesis to grab the cyclone and then sent it towards the city, letting go off his hold and giggling as he and his older brother watched the chaos unfold. The citizens themselves were already panicking from just the sight of the two massive giants, but their hysterics increased upon seeing the cyclone now going towards them. Many panicked and fled, while some few were frozen in fear, as the cyclone began ripping buildings and parts of the street off the ground, people getting hit by flying debris and dying upon impact. Those swept up were later flung into buildings or destroyed sections from the cyclones path, nothing but blood and corpses left upon impact. Dash and Jack-Jack just laughed from the fun of being able to do all of this without much effort, (Well less than usual when fighting criminals). \"Awesome! Now make it move around in a circle Jack-Jack!\" The baby giggled and complied, moving it around while laughing at the show he was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the faint sounds of destruction and screams of people rang through the air in the background, Dash began thinking to himself about how they were going about this. This was certainly fun messing around with their powers at this size, but a part of him was curious about doing something he'd otherwise hate doing: taking things slow. All of his life, he hated going slow at anything, be it gymnastics, schoolwork, or eating for that matter. However, like Television, Dash could see the value in taking his time with his new size. After all, he could do anything he wanted without his parents or sister here to stop him or his brother, if the slightly wriggling against his cheeks were anything to go by. He now felt like deciding if he should continue using them powers and destroying everything in a rapid, yet fun matter, or take it slowly and just enjoy messing with the tiny people at their size. After thinking about it long enough for the city to be utterly destroyed by the cyclone, he decided to...</span></div></div>",

You could have some butt toys of your own~\" Dash quickly turned around and let Jack-Jack see the outlines of the poor tiny officers trapped in his speedo, making Jack-Jack giggle. The thought of it excited him and the baby nodded eagerly, want to try everything his brother was telling him, (everything he understood anyhow). Having successfully convinced his brother to dial down the destruction, Dash picked up his brother and carried him on his shoulders once more, running towards the next metropolis he could find, running through the ocean in doing so and on another continent entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo everyone in the next the two were now standing yards away from, it was initially an odd sight. They saw a flesh-colored blur at first that was rapidly getting closer until a few seconds later and the two part-naked giant youths were standing outside their city, a strong windstorm following from the speed Dash carried. Now, the citizens didn't know what to make of it, some thought they had to be imagining things, as there was no logical way this was possible. But they were about to find out that it was indeed real, and they were powerless to stop either two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash noticed the windstorm his speed gave and looked amazed by it, as debris flew all over the city, somehow with no casualties so far, though there were injuries. \"Cool! I can even cause that much damage by just using my speed alone!\" That sentence immediately caused panic for all of the citizens of the metropolis, now terrified of the 10-year-old giant's interest in their suffering caused by him. The smirk he sent their way only increased that wariness and police were immediately sent to keep them out, (or attempt anyway), Meanwhile, Dash placed his brother down and decided to give his little brother an example of what he meant by taking things slow. \"Alright Jack-Jack, watch your big brother give an example!\" With a nod and giggle as a response, the mischievous giant boy stomped over to the city, looking down curiously at the barricade of police officers just outside the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention giant kid! Stop your advancement towards our city and tell us your purpose on coming here!\" Curious as to how these officers weren't terrified of him like the ones he had confined, Dash decided to play along for a moment or two. \"Oh really? Well what if I don't want to? How are you bugs gonna stop me?\" In response, the faint sound (to him) of multiple guns cocking at him filled the air.\"Then we will stop your advancements by force!\" Dash laughed at that, his thunderous laughter making them cover their ears. The ten-year-old could think of multiple ways to deal with these tiny officers, but decided to simply crush them underneath his foot to send a message to the thousands of remaining citizens: Don't fuck with me, or else! With a toothy grin, Dash lifted his foot, which terrified the police officers and made them shoot at the lowering gigantic sole, only succeeding in stinging the boy slightly. The feeling of them going splat underneath his foot with a thunderous boom and blood soaking underneath it more than made up for the minor discomfort to Dash, feeling his ego swell from the power-trip he was now starting of have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny citizen nearby who saw the carnage immediately shrieked in fear and ran away from him, as Dash laughed at the gory mess. \"Seriously, that was your best? What a shame...Oh well, first of many!\" With that, the giant took his first step into the city, flattening a couple of buildings with his step and crushing a few unlucky citizens inside of them that were either paralyzed with fear, or heavy sleepers. Dash laughed from the carnage he caused, loving the feeling of being bad for a change! Seeing a group of nearby citizens that were frozen in fear, Dash deciding to try that worshiping idea he had, glancing over to his brother and calling him over. \"Hey Jack-Jack, come closer!\" Making a happy garble, the baby nodded as his slowly walked towards his brother, stepping over a few buildings on his way and giggling from the feeling of crushing such puny structures underneath his pudgy feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear me tiny people! Me and my baby brother have come here to crush your puny little city underneath us, along with each and every single one of you pathetic bugs!\" The demeaning from the giant boy and fear of his intentions made some of those cowering piss their pants in terror, as Jack-Jack listened to his brother with curiosity.\"However, we might be willing to let some of you live if you please us well enough! Any one of you that fails to listen or please us will either be punished or crush beneath us!\" Paling at the grinning giant's terms, the majority of the tiny people plead to be spared, while a few began to flee, only to end up in Dash's fist a millisecond later. \"Alright, those that what to be spared can start be rubbing our feet! Oh, and for you bugs that just tried to escape...\" Dash smirked at them and then glanced at his curious brother.\"Hey little brother, want those butt toys of your now?\" The baby's smile widened and the terrified people in Dash's fist paled at their sentencing, inwardly cursing themselves for not joining the rest in pleasing these two if it meant freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giants sat down, Dash more gently as to not crushed his own prisoners just yet. Jack-Jack just plopped down and crushed multiple small apartment complexes underneath his tush, giggling from the strange feeling of liquid soaking through his speedo and onto his tush. Dash ended up crushing more buildings underneath his butt due to him being older and bigger, giggling as well from the feeling, while the spectators in front just watched in horror, some feeling sick from the sight. Dash then leaned closer to his brother's backside and opened the waistband of his speedo, dangling the screaming people in his giant fist over the gigantic cheeks before dropping them in and closing the waistband with a grin, one that was immediately wiped off once Jack-Jack grunted and the sound of wind breaking filled the air follow by a horrendous stench, one that quickly entered Dash's nose and make him recoil in disgust.\"Ugh! Jack-Jack, did you have to let one rip right when I was there!? God, mom's beans don't help with that either!\" The baby just laughed and pointed at his brother, having a bit of fun messing with him and also from feeling the tiny people thrash against his buttcheeks, no doubt suffering some horrible form of hell in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting over it rather quickly, Dash momentarily thought of how rank his might be from last night's beans and grinned, deciding to try that out later just of the sake of it, maybe get even with Jack-Jack if he could. He then turned his attention to the coughing tiny people in front of him, as the smell still lingered in the air faintly.\"Well what are you bugs waiting for? You still have some feet to rub!\" The tiny people saw Dash frowning at them and gulped, not wanting to suffer what just happened to those unfortunate neighbors of theirs. They immediately began rubbing the blood-soaked and rubble-littered soles of the giant youths, groaning from the stench coming off from them. They only found some sort of solace in the fact that it didn't stink as bad as Jack-Jack's toot, the stench slowly faded as there continued to rub, making both giant boys smile and Dash even groaned in pleasure from the massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the two got bored from the massages and Dash got up slowly, making those worshiping run away a bit to avoid being crushed. Jack-Jack followed his brother's lead and his worshipers also fled a bit. Dash then felt his stomach growl, and it wasn't for release. He glanced at the tiny people below him and a toothy grin plastered onto his face, as he picked them up and shrugged.\"Sorry, I know I said I'd let you live, but I feel a bit peckish and I'm curious to see what you guys taste like!\" lifting his hand holding them, he brought the screaming and pleading group to his mouth and opened, throwing them in unannounced and swish them around a bit while tasting them. They didn't all taste awful he had to admit, though those that pissed their pants made him wince and he didn't to see if their blood might wash out that slight unpleasant taste. So, he began to chew them to bits and those muffled shrieks got louder for a second before slowly dying down to just the sound of chewing. To his relief, the blood did wash out that bad taste and he swallowed with a sigh, let out a burp afterwards. Jack-Jack deciding to do the same, but ended up swallowing them whole due to his lack of teeth, feeling content about the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash now was wondering if he should continue making them worship him and his brother, or if they could maybe try crushing them in unique, cruel and possibly gross ways. He quickly decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Continue destroying the city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that was the plan at first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city did end up destroyed, quite brutally if the wide-eyed ten-year-old had to admit. Dash was honestly a bit frightened by Jack-Jack's potential at times. The sight of him telekinetically making the tiny people's heads explode and moving their corpses around like puppets made Dash shudder at the thought of his baby brother doing that to him or the rest of the family one day from his temper tantrums. It was even more scary when he realized that Jack-Jack is too young to properly understand the concept of death, despite his abnormal intellect. The ten-year old himself recently learned about it. That didn't stop him from snuffing out the poor tiny people underneath them like bugs though, the power-trip alone was <i>far</i> too enjoyable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash mused to himself while travelling through dimensions of what he did to them. He gave them quite a lot of scares before putting them out of their misery, weather it was swishing them around in his mouth, sitting on them with not enough force to crush them completely (though enough to break every bone in their body), squishing them against his stinky armpits (Jack-Jack's reeked of soot), or just making them beg for mercy underneath his toe. And then there were those poor little villages that had been force to endure the full aftermath of their mom's beans, the only form of mercy shown from the laughing children being they didn't ended up 'wasted'. Each moment of their torment and the haunting shrieks that rang upon ending their lives made a dark grin form on the child's face, one he quickly dismissed whenever Jack-Jack looked towards his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it had something to do with school bullies making Dash feel pathetic, not being to use his powers due to his mom and dad forbid it. They always found out if he did. Maybe it was because of his built-up boredom from a combination of that ban on his powers, and the recent era of peace throughout Metroville. Either way, being able to inflict that same feeling of helplessness and humiliation on the tiny people made him happy. He was somewhat aware of his recent thoughts being those of a super-villain or other form of evil, but he reasoned that those people weren't part of their universe, so it shouldn't matter if they live or not right? What did he care? What did his family care? Besides, he was only keeping his little brother entertained...That's goodwill, surely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of home, the two were soon about to reach it, since his brother started missing mommy and nearly cried about it. Figuring they have been gone for a bit and they could continue their fun tomorrow, (and also slightly scared of the baby's newly mentioned abilities), the older boy told the baby that they could go home for now and see mommy, making sure to also play with another world tomorrow provided that Jack-Jack agreed to not blow up their minds, even when he gets mad. Of course, Jack-Jack mostly understood and giggled innocently at the promise of more fun tomorrow with his brother. \"Oh yeah, we also need to come up with an excuse as to why our suits got destroyed. Useless material...\" Dash muttered underneath his breath. That wasn't gonna be fun to explain to their parents or Edna...Although, now that he thought of it. \"I could just tell them a half-truth!\" Dash grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving home and changing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dash, Jack-Jack, we're home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing his mother's voice, the eager ten-year old ran there in a millisecond with his little brother, who reached out towards his mommy that immediately picked him up into her arms and rocked him gently. \"Aw, did Jack-Jack miss us?~\" Jack-Jack giggled happily, as Bob looked around and whistled. \"I'm impressed son! You managed to keep the house clean this time!\" Dash smirked and stood proudly at the praise, before remembering the suits and laughing nervously, which made both of them raise an eyebrow at him, as Violet groaned. \"What did you do this time?\" \"Hey, I didn't do it! Jack-Jack did!\" Dash immediately got the torn clothing in question, as Helen and Bob gasped in alarm. \"How did this happen honey!?\" \"Were you attacked while we gone!?\" Putting his hands up in surrender, the freckled blond explained in a rush, \"Whoa, calm down! It's nothing like that! I was out playing with Jack-Jack in the yard and he suddenly grew us both, destroying the suits! I got him to change us back before any damage was done or anyone noticed though!\" All three older family members blinked and looked at one another, then at the youngest family member who giggled at the memories, before Bob sighed and picked up the phone. \"I'll give Edna a call...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that was handled and Edna promised to give him new suits by tomorrow morning, (adding to make sure they can stretch and slim down at any height), the super family had dinner. Helen and Bob droned on in excitement about the crime wave and super-villain of the week they got to stop (which the kids tuned out except Jack-Jack, who was entranced by the tale), while Violet looked a bit more happier than usual, leading Dash to assume things were going well with her boyfriend, (making him feel happy for her, but nearly retch at the thought of his older sister getting all mushy with that Tony fellow). As he quickly ate up all the beans, Helen stopped her rambling in notice and shock. \"Dash, you ate all of your beans willing today? I thought you hated them.\" Dash grinned innocently at her as he got up and turned to leave to his room. \"What can I say, your cooking improved since last time~ Night Everyone!\" As he left the next second, Helen pouted a bit and shouted up towards his room,\"Hey, what's that supposed to mean!?\" Bob chuckled and comforted his wife, \"Don't worry Helen. I think your cooking is just fine!\" Helen smiled gently and the two began to compliment one another before getting lost in their story-sharing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Dash laid in his bed staring at the ceiling, lost in thought. \"Man, today was so much fun! I got to make Jack-Jack happy, and toy with another world with him! Oh, I just can't wait for tomorrow! Maybe I'll let Jack-Jack eat the planet this time when we finish with them!\" At the mention of it, the boy grinned and blissfully thought back about eating the earth they were on when Jack-Jack grew him so big, the earth looked like a gumball to him. So, he ate it like one and chewed, surprised at first that the magma core only tasted spicy instead of burning his taste buds off, (something he guessed was a side effect from the growth), He relished in hearing the world's inhabitants shriek near at once for him to listen once placing it in his mouth, the taste not being anything too special, but the power-trip making him moan blissfully in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting his stomach at the memory, the smirking ten-year-old couldn't help but think to himself, \"<i>I wonder how bad my gas will be tomorrow from eating a planet, and from mom's cooking!~</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna quickly stopped by and delivered the new suits, (taking a bit more time to act a bit like her new title 'Auntie Edna' to Jack-Jack, much to the baby's delight), before heading back in her car. After having breakfast, the phone ran again and the next city Winston Deavor wanted Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl to help was detailed to them, prompting them to leave once again, but not before Bob added to Dash, \"And make sure to keep the suits intact this time!\" \"Okay dad!\" After they left, Violet walked happily to the door with some nice clothes, as Dash asked curiously, \"Where are you going?\" \"To hang out with Tony at the mall~\" As she left, Dash rolled his eyes and snarked underneath his breath, \"Yeah, cause that's a place boys <i>love</i> to go to...\" Seeing as they had the rest of the day to themselves basically, Dash glanced towards his fellow masked brother, who glanced back curiously at him. \"So Jack-Jack! Ready to have some more fun with those other worlds today?~\" Giggling at the idea of squishing more tiny people underneath him or playing puppets with them, the baby nodded, as Dash cheeky grinned and nodded back, ready to travel with him...until his stomach rumbled in hunger, Jack-Jack's following suit a second later. \"...Right after we have lunch.\" Jack-Jack garbled in agreement as Dash got some food Mom and Dad left them in the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they finish, what happens next?</span></div></div>",

Jack jack let out a happy garble and began to concentrate. They disappeared in an instant. Seconds later they arrived at a new world. Dash got a good look from where they landed. This time it looked like a small village. \u201cThis should be fun\u201d, Dash said. \u201cAlright Jack Jack you know the drill make us big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack jack laughed and began to concentrate once more, the two boys started growing very quickly, soon in a matter of seconds they were 600 feet tall. Even though the super suit didn\u2019t tear to shreds, the super suits still exposed the boys belly\u2019s and legs. \u201cAlright Jack Jack lets go show these wimps who\u2019s boss. Dash picked up how brother and ran quickly to the village. The village people stood their in shock at the sight of the two boys. Dash smirked and said \u201cLittle slaves your world is ours!!\u201d Dash picked up a few tinies and tried crushing them in his hands, it worked like a charm. His brother also tried it and was successful. Dash thought for a moment as the village people continued to scream. He decided to stomp on a few tinies by taking a walk in the city. Dash started to walk and he crushed people under his huge feet. Jack jack tried crawling which was surprisingly just as, if not more effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Dash walked through the city, he saw two huge figures, but they were far away so it was hard to see. Jack jack crawled over and let out a curios garble. \u201cI wonder what that is\u201d, Dash thought to himself. \u201cHey Jack Jack lets go check it out. Dash picked up his brother and sped over. Soon, he was able to make out the details of the figures. The figures were two boys, both who looked a little older than dash. They also looked very similar, besides their hair color. One had yellow hair and the other bad orange. Both of them looked around to be their size and destroying another part of the village. Dash got curious and picked his brother up and walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two figures noticed him and turned around, it was silent for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash quickly broke the silence with asking the two boys, \u201cWho the heck are you two !\u201d</span></div></div>",

But whether would come back r not afterwards was all dependent on Lucas' heart. His friends believed he had enough hope left to make the world a beautiful place, where Porky's influence didn't affect their lives. A world free from money, chimeras, and other inconveniences introduced by King P, a more expansive world as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, due to all of the sadness Lucas built up in his heart during his adventure, from his neighbors and friends being brainwashed, to losing his mother, and later his brainwashed brother who took his own life upon snapping out of it, that happy ending never came for anyone. The world was reset and every bit of land from Lucas' memory materialized, along with the entirety of Onett that Lucas saw from Porky's movie theater with his friends at one point only because he was slightly interested about that Ness person, (who he later met in person from the three smash tournaments he participated in with the kid), but no one came back with him. All of the humans that came into the new world were brand new. No one he was familiar with, and no one he met from said smash tournaments. He was completely alien to the new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe supposed he should count his blessings that life got to continue at all after the end of the world, but no matter how much or how far he searched, having no one from his past come back made him feel so lonely. Another thing that he guessed was a blessing of some sorts was having some of the dark dragon's power in him, allowing him to not only no longer require certain body functions to live, but also recreate people from his memories. That's how he got Kumatora and Boney included in his final smash during the most recent tournament, but they lacked the original personalities. And no matter how much the poor desperate kid tried, he couldn't reach out to their souls and truly bring back his friends. The expressions of those soulless copies wore a smile, but they looked empty. The whole situation reminded Lucas of his chimera brother, the very thought making his chest hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of this, Lucas grew numb to the pain he constantly carried inside of him, now frequently seen with a emotionless stare by any passerby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the present day, the boy slowly walked through the streets of New Pork City, traversing his way down to where the final needle use to rest and stared at the resting place with some degree of controlled anger. \"So this is what you've made huh? A world distant to me, yet filled of painful reminders of my journey...Never would've pegged a creature like you to have a sick form of humor like this...\" The chilling empty tone that left the boy's mouth would've made anyone nearby flinch in uneasiness. \"To top it off, you gave me enough of your power to be unable to die...I'm not even sure if you exist anymore, but if you do, I promise to make you <i>wish</i> you killed me off with the rest of those I held dear.\" A surge of powerful psi slowly escaped the boy's body from his rage, but he took a deep breathe and let it diminish for now, lost in his thoughts about what he should do at this point. As if to answer, he turned around and saw a sight that made him flinch slightly, before sighing. \"Funny, I thought I left my brother's copy at our old home...\" As he turned around, the supposed copy said something that made the blond boy flinch once more in shock, \"That's funny, I think I'm the real Claus, since I remember everything that happened up to this point~\" Upon turning around and seeing that cheeky smile of his chimera brother's face, Lucas was overcome by both sadness and another emotion he hadn't felt in quite some time, joy. Tears left his eyes as he ran forward and embraced his brother with a hug, letting out all the grief and regret he kept bottled up over the last few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter recovering from his emotional outburst, Lucas once again put on his stoic expression, with his brother caught up about the aftermath of waking the Dark Dragon. \"Wow...This sounds like a bleak world we entered. No one from our past is around anymore...\" At the statement, Lucas clicked his tongue and glanced towards the familiar grey capsule with a look of great disdain. \"Not everyone...\" Seeing the Capsule in question, Claus sighed with just as much discomfort at the fact that Porky was still alive in there. \"Of course his capsule protected him from the end of the world...\" The red-haired kid harbored great hatred towards that short, fat, decayed husk of a man, but knew it was pointless to even try to beat his frustrations on the pig king with him locked in the capsule. So he settled for kicking the capsule away a few ridges before forgetting about his rage in favor of showing his brother something cool. \"Hey, check this out little brother~\" His wings suddenly folded into his back and his mechanical arm and eye shapeshifted into real ones instead of synthetic, giving him the appearance of what he use to look like before turning into a chimera, as he stood there with a proud grin. \"Some of the Dark Dragon's power flowed into me as well, so now I can do cool stuff like this! Feels good having a normal eye and arm again! Though maybe I should keep the wings, I enjoyed flying around...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his brother's stoic expression not budge, Claus got worried and gave his brother a gentle, comforting look. \"You okay Lucas? You don't seem like your usual self.\" At this, the boy slightly smiled briefly, before sighing and looking at the caverns with a blank stare. \"Claus...I feel happy for you, but after everything's transpired, I'm not the same person I was from 3 years ago, or even who I was when you died. I feel nothing but resentment about the whole thing; the Pigmask, Porky, and especially the Dark Dragon for put us in this kind of position...\" After hearing about what his brother went though during his emotional outburst, Claus could tell why and pondered on how to lift his brother's spirits. Once he thought of one, he spoke his mind. \"Well, then why not destroy this world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the confused stare he got, the 'older' twin, (Lucas use to say it was only by a few seconds), explained with a calm expression, \"You clearly don't value this world. Sure, everything looks the same, but there's nothing here that holds any meaning to you right?\" The blond nodded, adding in coldly, \"It's like some sick form of irony and it hurts to even look at it.\" Nodding with a mischievous grin, the red-haired 13-year-old asked in a coy tone, \"So, wouldn't you like to destroy it to get back at that stupid dragon? I say we show him exactly how we feel about his world!\" At that statement, the blond teen smirked and nodded back in agreement, psi sparking in his fingertips already. \"Whoa, slow down a bit! I have a fun way we can start destroying stuff~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas didn't see what Claus meant by that, adding in, \"So you're saying destroying everything with psychic abilities isn't fun?...\" His twin laughed, making Lucas pout slightly. \"Oh Lucas, where has your imagination gone? Sure, we could, but I was thinking along the lines of taping into the power we got from that stupid beast! Come on, I'll show you on the surface~\" Without warning, Claus changed back to his chimera form and activated his jet wings, practically tackling his brother upon boosting forward and catching the startled boy on his back with ease, flying through the entryway above ground and leaving New Pork City behind, landing at Tazmily Village (still having the appearance of a modern town), onlookers staring at the two children with fascination, especially at Claus. After getting off of his brother, Lucas asked curiously, \"Why'd you bring us here?\" \"Oh... just felt like it'd be better to do this outside where more pedestrians are located~\" In the next second, Claus paused and focused with closed eyes, as a bright light enveloped his body and caused everyone to cover their eyes from the intense shine. When it dimmed and Lucas adjusted his sight, he gaped in amazement at the sight of his massive grinning brother, glancing down at the frightened locals by his now gigantic feet, his clothes also grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's what I think of your technology by the way!\" The giant teen raised his foot in one second and then stomped down on some nearby buildings the next, crushing a group of people underneath the shadow in that time-frame, as everyone else started to panic and flee while screaming in terror. Claus giggled from his actions, rather enjoying the feeling of destroying so many lives with just his size alone. He then glanced at his brother with a smirk, who was still in shock by what just happened. \"Well bro? Do you wanna try it out?~\" After a few more seconds, the shocked expression slowly shifted into a dark grin, as Lucas copied his brother and grew just as big as him a few seconds later, kicking a few buildings with his feet and watch with glee at the flying debris falling onto some of the fleeing people and squashing them into a vicious red paste on the streets. \"Yeah, you're right, this is more fun! I say we...\"</span></div></div>",

Lucas felt so happy and powerful now that he was back with his brother and was now at a huge size, being able to destroy a whole bunch of things. \u201cSo what should we do first?\u201d Lucas asked his brother. Claus thought for a moment, but was disturbed by a pinch from his leg. Lucas felt the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys looked down in annoyance and saw some military trying to stop their fun. Lucas and Claus looked at each other and laughed. The laughter from these big boys was shaking the ground. \u201cOh silly stupid bugs you\u2019ll never stop our fun!\u201d Lucas said as he lifted his giant foot and crushed them. \u201cGood job bro, show those little pests whose boss.\u201d Lucas and Claus both smiled and started to have some more fun by stomping through the city.  Suddenly Lucas had an idea and called his brother over, \u201cLet\u2019s make these bugs worship our smelly feet\u201d, Lucas said. \u201cMine will be really stinky considering i rarely change my socks\u201d, Lucas said. \u201cGreat idea bro\u201d, Claus said.  Both boys removed their sneakers and sweaty socks. As soon as they exposed their feet, the tinies coughed and gagged. The smell from both boys feet smelled gross. It smelled of rotten eggs and sweaty teen boy body odor. While Lucas was a little quiet about this, Claus spoke in a demanding voice, \u201cLittle slaves you will now worship my feet and my brothers feet or else!\u201d Both boys sat down, crushing some buildings in the process and Claus ordered them to rub. The tinies scared out of their mind listened and began to rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon both boys got tired of this and stood up and thought about what to do next...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucas had to admit, the feeling of being so huge reminded him of how much power he now wielded. He had his Psi attacks, along with the ones the famous Ness showed him how to use in that tournament, he had no need for human body functions, (though he could still use them if he felt like it), he could make moving replicas of his deceased friends, and alter sizes of others or himself. On top of all of that, he didn't even tap into all of the power the Dark Dragon gave him and his brother. The prospect intrigued him and he wanted to try that out sometime later, one idea in particular coming to mind after they destroyed this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching with cold eyes and a smile to match at the fleeing tiny people by his feet, the blond teen used his Psi to pick up a building nearby and throw it down in front of the crowd, blocking their escape route. They shrieked and screamed as the boy's foot loomed over them for a second before they were carelessly crushed underneath his smelly bare foot, laughing from his newfound power-trip. Lucas never thought to try this out during the smash tournaments when he got a mushroom or rarely zapped even bigger by a lightening screw up. Then again, he didn't have the heart to try anything with it and he was fairly certain his shyness would've also interfered with such thoughts. (Didn't help that Master Hand and Crazy Hand were also watching over them in the background should any of the fighters do anything shifty or rule-breaking). This was first time Lucas enjoyed being huge and part of him wanted to go back in time at this size to show that stupid Porky Statue how it feels like being chased. His musings were interrupted by his brother, \"Hey bro, come here! I just thought of something we should try!\" Curious, the blond absentmindedly stomped through more of the village, destruction and cries of help following each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas was greeted to the sight of his brother's chimera form, toying with his cannon's fire on a few buildings, those in range of the blast incinerated to ashes. Seeing his brother, the grinning teen changed form to his normal look. \"So, don't you think it's about time we get a bit more creative with our toying?\" Lucas immediately thought of his psi powers, but doubted Claus meant creative in that form. \"What do you mean by creative then?...\" With a cheeky grin, the elder twin sat down on a couple of nearby buildings, pedestrians fleeing for their lives as the massive butt and building debris fell down. Only a few were lucky enough to not end up crushed by either, but they were now pinned underneath the boy's clothed rump, struggling to get free.\"Oh, something like this...\" Those trapped people thought it couldn't smell any worse, but they were proven wrong as the last thing they heard and felt was a booming thunder sound and a strong gale of hot, putrid air that killed them a few seconds after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas watched with a blush of embarrassment from what his giggling brother did, as the horrible smell infiltrated his nose and the blond immediately began coughing and waving the air away. \"Agh!...\" *cough* \"Claus, t-that's not creative!\" *Cough* \"That's just gross! Oh god, i-it's smells like death!\" Unashamed, the red-haired teen stuck out his tongue before standing up and glancing at his work with a smirk, before addressing his brother. \"Well first off, I'm basically an undead zombie. What did you expect it to smell like? And it's more creative than just simply stomping on stuff.\" Looking unconvinced, the blond scoffed. \"Creative is one way to put it...\" \"Aw come on Luke~ Just try it out! Maybe you'll enjoy it~\" Lucas blushed and meekly looked away, the very thing of doing something so gross and mean making him feel shy about it, like his old self 3 years ago. Then his brother egged him on. \"Heh, what's the matter? Too chicken?~\" Feeling annoyed, Lucas defended himself with crossed arms. \"I'm not, but there's no way I'm doing that, no matter what size I am!\" Toothily grinning, Claus wrapped an arm around his brother and ruffled his hair. \"Maybe you're just too shy to do it! Thought everything you've been through got rid of that shyness, but I guess you'll always be my scaredy cat little brother~\" That got to Lucas and made him pout. \"First, it was by all of 5 seconds and second, I'm not that timid boy anymore!\" \"Oh really? Then why don't you prove it?~\" \"Okay fine, I will!\" Claus watched with a victorious smile as his fuming brother stomped away to a section they didn't touch yet. \"<i>I always was good at playing him~</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsentmindedly fixing his hair while stomping through the industrialized town, Lucas thought to himself with a look of annoyance, \"<i>That insensitive jerk! Doesn't he know part of that hell was mourning his and our mother's death!? And I can bold!</i>\" Finding a couple of small apartment buildings clustered together and people fleeing nearby, the angry blond scooped them up and momentarily blushed at what he was about to do, before glancing at his cheeky brother and forgetting all about that shyness, surprising his brother by opening his waistband and depositing them backside while they screamed, snapping it shut once they were all in. Lucas shuddered a bit from the weird feeling. He had a bunch of people trapping against his colossal buttcheeks. It felt weird, but some part of him liked the experience, humiliating the tiny people in such a demeaning way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering what he was dared to do, the blond teen turned around and sat down on the buildings, slowly crushing them and the unfortunate people who were too slow in evacuating the area. Upon feeling his butt touched the ground, the blue-eyed teen felt that weird feeling again, as some survivors were now wriggling underneath his clothed cheeks, trying desperately to escape, much like with Claus a few minutes ago. Lucas felt a small smile form on his face from the dominance and then glanced at his brother. \"You watching this Claus!?~\" \"Oh don't worry, I am!\" Nodding to himself and much like his brother, the blond giant gave those poor squirming tinies no warning before they experienced the same hell of a thunder-like boom, a strong gale that sent those who were not trapped but in range flying, and a horrible odor caused most of those nearby to lose their lunch, while those in range died from lack of fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas stood up a minute later, as his brother stomped over while laughing, shutting up and groaning as soon as he caught whiff of the stench. \"Oh man, and you said mine was bad! Yours is like rotten eggs mixed with skunk!\" Lucas blushed slightly, but said with a look of boldness, \"Well, the food I did eat on my journey wasn't exactly what my stomach was use to. Anyway, told you I wasn't afraid to do it!~\" Grinning, the red-haired teen nodded excitedly. \"Yeah you did, and I didn't expect you to just pick up that nearby group and shove them inside your underwear like that. Those poor tiny bastards probably got the worse of it!~\" Lucas couldn't help the blush on his face. That sentence just sounded embarrassing. \"So, how did it feel?\" Looking at his brother, Lucas answered with a smirk, \"It felt embarrassing at first, but I enjoyed humiliating those tiny specks like that. Made me feel superior, you know?\" Laughing, the elder twin nodded in agreement. \"Told you that it was fun!\" \"Still not very creative though...\" \"Oh you spoil sport!\" The two laughed with each other, missing these sort of brotherly moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter calming down, Claus thought of something and said with a sly smirk, \"Well then, maybe we should hold a stink contest to see who's smell's worse? Doesn't just have to be with our butts either~ How's that for creative?~\" Lucas shrugged. \"Eh, kinda better, but for some reason, I can't help but think other duo thought of this before...\" Claus looked at his brother with a skeptical look before the blond shrugged. \"I dunno, maybe it has to do with my psychic abilities.\" \"I guess...Anyway, should we do the contest now, or later?\" Lucas thought about it decided...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just gonna mimic me?\" Shooting his brother a glare, Claus quickly changed to his chimera form and drew his sword. \"I wasn't going to, but if this doesn't bring up bad memories at all for you, why not?...\" Upon raising his sword, a jolt of lightening shot up to the sky and the thunderstorms got worse in seconds, lightening bolts raining down on the town, destroying everything and everyone left, making Lucas go wide eyed for a second, before he chuckled. \"Wow...Kinda forgot how strong you were as the commander.\" Sticking out his tongue, Claus sheathed the sword with a content look. \"You mean are, I'm pretty sure I could kick your ass anytime of the day little brother. I did one shot your friends last time~\" Muttering 'by a few seconds' under his breathe, the blond looked at him with a determined expression. \"Maybe, but if you remember, you had a handicap in our last fight. I kicked your ass every other time we crossed paths.\" Taking that as a challenge, the elder twin got a competitive look. \"Oh really? Fine then. Let's prove who's stronger with a mock fight. Winner gets to eat this planet~\" Feeling just as competitive, the younger twin nodded. \"You're on! I was done with this world anyhow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, the two stood a yard (to them) away from each other, Lucas looking forward with a determined glare at his grinning chimera brother. \"Alright, let's set a few restrictions. No using any powers the dark dragon gave us, our size stays this way for our fight! Since I'm not holding back as the commander, you can use those tricks you got from those smash tournaments, along with the Psi you learned from your time there.\" Hearing all that made Lucas smirk. \"Heh, you sure you're not stocking the odds against you too much?~\" Chuckling from the cheek his formally shy brother was currently gave him, Claus put on his helmet and gave a creepy grin, his red synthetic eye glowing to add to the creep factor that made Lucas shudder. \"Oh, you'll need those tricks little bro~ Ready? Go!\" Without warning, the elder twin lunged forward with his sword in hand, Lucas immediately dodging to the left out of instinct and backing up, not expecting the fight to begin so suddenly. That hesitation cost him a bit, as Claus mercilessly swung again at him, Lucas hissing a bit in pain when his sword stuck against his arm, using his Psi to nullify the damage greatly. Now knowing just how aggressive his brother was going to be in this fight, Lucas kicked him back a couple of countries, (feet to them), and shot his PK Fire at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus dodged a few but one nicked him and pushed him back a bit, the remaining shots setting a few country ablaze, which got worse once the elder twin used his jet boosters in his wings to try and tackle his brother. Having experience some many fighters lunging themselves at him before, the younger twin simply dodged to the side and just as Claus passed next to him, hit him hard with his stick, sending him flying towards Onett. Hitting the ground face-first, Claus groaned and shook the debris off him, glancing towards his brother's direction only to see a sphere of ice heading towards him. He couldn't get out of the way before getting hit by PK Freeze, his body encased in ice as Lucas then shot PK Thunder towards him from the distance, knocking him around a bit, while the town's people below fled as best as they could from all the chaos. Claus eventually broke out and when he did, he looked annoyed. \"<i>Let's see how he deals with this...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas carefully watched his brother, as said chimera took to the sky momentarily, before quickly pointing his cannon at Lucas and rapidly firing shots at him, the blond boy dodging as much as he could but getting hit a couple of times. Now equally annoyed, Lucas took out his stick once more and knocked one of the shots at the commander, making him flinch and seemingly short out, which took the chance to use Pk Thunder to knock himself into the paralyzed teen. As he came towards him though, the commander flashed a malicious grin and struck him with his sword, making Lucas gasp and cough up some blood, before blasting him in the back and sending the blond shooting towards New Pork City, crashing into the tower and killing hundreds of residents to the city. Lucas coughed and slowly got up as Claus grinned above him in the air. \"Give up yet little bro?~\" \"I'll say this much, had you been alive, I think you could've been a fighter in one of those tournaments I participated in!\" Laughing in agreement, Claus began to proudly boast about himself with closed eyes, which Lucas took as a chance to slowly get underneath him, the sound of destruction not even fazing Claus out of his boasting. When he did open them and noticed Lucas wasn't there, Claus looked down with widen eyes just before Lucas shouted, \"Pk Love!\", and sent a flurry of powerful hexagon-shaped Psi at him, sending Claus flying in the air. Lucas went after him, using his Psi to jump high and hit him with a few more Psi attacks before the chimera counterattacked and shot him with as much power in his cannon as he had, both exhausted by this point and falling down, crashing into another continent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the two got up and panted, looking at each other and saying at the exact same time, \"I give up!\" The two shared a laugh as Lucas healed them both. Dusting the debris off their clothes, not even sparing another glance at the destroyed nations below, the blond asked with confusion, \"So if we both won...who gets to eat the planet?\" Shrugging, the chimera turned back to human form. \"We could share it I guess.\" Lucas shrugged and nodded, before adding with a smirk, \"Sounds good, but I get to eat the next world whole.\" Sticking out his tongue, the elder twin shot back, \"In your dreams! Next time I will because next time, I won't get distracted by dirty tricks!\" \"You did that to yourself and because, you did it first with that fake out~\" Huffing, Claus looked away in embarrassment, not having a good argument against that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two grew themselves bigger than the planet itself, the earth as big as an apple to them. Evidently, they had no need to breathe in space with the Dark Dragon's power, Lucas looking down at the puny planet before him with a cold grin, feeling so superior to all the little microbes screaming down below. Claus sliced it in two a moment later, the very action causing what felt like the start of the apocalypse on both sides, volcanic activity and storms rising as the ground shook, everyone screaming and hoping that this was all just some bad dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claus took his piece that held New Porky City and Tazmily Village, he realized two things that made him a bit unsure, which Lucas noticed. \"What's up?\" \"Well it's just...On one hand, this side of earth is where we both farted on that embarrassment of what our town used to be like, but on the other hand, it also has New Pork City where that fat bastard is still locked away in that capsule...I want to make him at least spent an eternity in my stomach, but at the same time...\" \"...Yeah I get it...Well I'm definitely not trading so if you don't want it, don't eat it.\" Grimacing, Claus shook his head and said, \"Fuck it. The smell probably went away by now anyway and that old fatty needs to pay!\" Claus threw it in his mouth and chewed, the taste not the best, but not the worse he's had, the Earth's core not even fazing him due to his powers. Lucas did the same seemed to enjoy his a whole lot more than his brother, which Claus noticed with envy. \"Why does it taste better for you than it does for me? I know that our gas wasn't the issue!\" Swallowing with a content sigh, the blond teen turned to his brother with a smirk. \"Simple, used the Dark Dragon's power to make it taste amazing!\" Face-palming, Claus opened a portal to another world while Lucas giggled at him.\"Why didn't I think of that?...Whatever. I'll take pleasure in knowing that bastard's now stuck in my stomach for the rest of eternity...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Inside Claus's stomach...</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the bits of the Earth the teen ate that were currently dissolving, (survivors crying and scream in fear as their loved ones and homes burned away slowly), a lone capsule floated on the surface of the stomach acid, the elderly man inside faintly seeing the destruction taking place outside and laughing to himself, wheezing in between.\"Haha! Sucks to be you guys!~\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The boys traveled through the portal and decided to shrink themselves down to about the size they were before they ate the previous world. The boys then exited the portal and landed in a new landscape, this time the landscape seemed to be a small rural village that on one side and a nice average sized city on the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what do you know Luke, we have a village and a city to destroy!\u201d  \u201cYeah,boy are we lucky!\u201d, the blonde boy replied with a dark grin! \u201cOk, so what should we destroy first, we\u2019re already a good enough size to destroy, we just need to decide which land should go down first!\u201d Claus said, already stretching and preparing to destroy whichever one. \u201cLet\u2019s start with this rural village and than do the city!\u201d Lucas shouted already bored and ready to destroy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, let\u2019s do that!\u201d Claus replied as he turned into his chimera form.

Claus fired up his cannon and became shooting with a dark grin, the shots destroyed vast pieces of land, houses, and killed lots of people! Lucas was using his stick to completely obliterate buildings just by swinging it through them. \u201cHey Claus watch this!\u201d The blonde boy shouted and his brother looked over. Lucas froze a building into a ball, tossed it up, and smacked like a baseball with his stick! \u201cNice job Lucas!\u201d The red haired teen complimented, a little envious that he didn\u2019t think of that. \u201cThanks!\u201d Lucas replied.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey Lucas, freeze over another part of the city for me! I want to practice a bit with my sword!\" Smiling, the blonde obliged and froze around 5 different buildings at once, as Lucas picked it over the ground and threw it in the air. As it came back down, Claus quickly took out his sword and slashed at the ice ball with inhuman speed multiple times, ice shards, debris and some blood raining down. Lucas clapped in awe. \"Wow, nice skills!\" Grinning at the compliment, the teen turned his attention to a nearby village and gave his brother a smirk. \"Why don't we make sure that village over there isn't missing out on all of the fun?\" Nodding with a similar smirk, the two brothers casually walked through the city, destruction and death following their every step, which the two giggled at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing the two approaching, the villagers immediately panicked and ran around like a chicken with it's head cut off, unsure of what to do. Some tried running away, but they were shortly incinerated along with part of the village by an energy blast, the frightened villagers seeing the chimera grinning while his cannon faced them. \"Aww, what's the matter? We just got here! Don't you want to show a pair of young travelers around?\" Whimpering with immense fear, they all just stood in place, as the blonde giant added with a grin, \"I don't know bro, they don't seem to have anything of interest to us...\" \"Yeah, well that's okay. We'll just make it interesting!~\" The elder twin took his steps onto the village and crushed quite of number of pedestrians and their homes, some of villagers now fleeing for their lives while some were still too scared to move. As the giggling blonde teen stomped closer, they prayed for something to save them. They seemed to have gotten an answer to those prayers when a strange noise followed by a large rush of wind caught the giants' attention, both turning around to see another pair of giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas and Claus took in their appearance. One was a blonde boy who looked to be around the age of ten or possibly eleven, with some slight freckles showing on his face. The other was a baby, a small patch of blonde hair showing that they were related, along with the matching eye color and the fact that they were wearing red and black outfits along with masks. They looked like superheroes which immediately made the two distrustful of them. The older of the two heroes asked with a rude tone, \"Who the heck are you two?\" Annoyed now, Lucas decided to answer for them with crossed arms and an annoyed expression, tone matching, \"We should be asking you two that. You two some sort of superhero family?...\" The elder boy nodded with a cocky grin, his baby brother giggling in delight. \"Yeah, and pretty great ones at that.\" Equally annoyed by the boy's arrogance and answer, Claus shared a telepathic link with his brother. \"<i>I don't like that answer. You think these two are locals that were sent here to try to stop us?</i>\" \"<i>Yeah...Maybe we should just snuff them out now so we can get back to our fun without any distractions...</i>\" Grinning, Claus slowly began to unsheathe his sword, which the baby noticed. \"<i>Sounds like a plan! Allow me~</i>\" The blonde freckled boy heard his brother's garble and opened his eyes to see the helmet wearing giant charge at him with sword in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReacting quickly, Dash used his speed to dodge the slash, causing Claus to stumble and fall face-first onto a nearby rural town, groaning in annoyance and embarrassment as he slowly got up and wiped the debris and blood off of his face. Meanwhile, as Dash mocked him with a laugh, he soon found himself frozen entirely in a block of ice, as Lucas then knocked him around with PK Thunder, which made Jack-Jack worried and upset. With an angry garble, the super baby engulfed himself in flames and picked up buildings, throwing them at the blonde psychic. The buildings immediately caught fire when Jack-Jack picked them up, so Lucas felt like he was being pelted by Mario's Fireballs. It didn't hurt much, but it was annoying. Lacking any restraint now to hurt even a baby, the teen aimed a PK Freeze at him, only to get interrupted by a punch from an unfrozen Dash. \"Don't you dare hurt my brother!\" After saying that, the boy was ironically struck in the back as well by a cannon blast from Claus, the masked blonde getting flung back a short distance. \"Same to you speedy...\" Looking in his brother's direction, Lucas could tell Claus was pissed now, as said chimera raised his sword and pointed it at a stunned Dash, powerful lightning bolts striking down on him and the surrounding area in seconds, making the blonde scream from the pain. That in turn made Jack-Jack livid, as he started using his psychokinetic powers on the two, making both teens clutch their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Agh! What the hell is this!?...</i>\" \"<i>No clue, but my head feels like it's going to explode!</i>\" Looking around as best as he could, Lucas saw the super baby's narrowed eyes glowing and figured it was his doing. \"<i>Well apparently that super toddler over there can do more than throw fiery temper tantrums!</i>\" \"<i>Okay, then let's use our psychic powers to cancel his out!</i>\" The two took a deep breathe and focused, creating a mental barrier in their minds to block out Jack-Jack's mental high-jack, much to the baby's surprise when seeing the two recover. The downside to this was that they now couldn't telepathically communicate with each other while the barrier was in place, but that's what mouths were for. \"Oh, that feels so much better!\" \"Yeah...So, stab the baby?\" \"Stab the baby.\" Said baby understood their words and just as Claus lunged at him, Jack-Jack turned into a smoke form and giggled as the attack went right through him, as if he was mocking them. \"Alright then rugrat. Claus, you willing to take a PK Freeze?\" Shrugging, the ginger said calmly with a smirk, \"I've taken a few of those before. What's one more?\" Jack-Jack now started to become worried, as the teen in front of him kept slash at his smoke form while the blonde twin charged that move from earlier that froze his older brother. Not knowing if it'd work on smoke or not, he began to whimper in fear, something that caught his groaning brother's attention. The blonde knew what they were planning and quickly intercepted Lucas with a speedy uppercut, sending the startled psychic flying back a few feet and landing ass-first onto a small rural town nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash didn't give the blonde a chance to recover, using his powers to throw multiple jabs at the teen, who grunted from each punch. \"Stop targeting my baby brother! He's just a baby for god's sake!\" Not feeling any shame by that truth being pointed out, Lucas quickly threw a PK Fire to send the blond pre-teen back a bit while he got up and recovered, saying with a smirk to the masked child, \"Maybe so, but during my months in those smash tournaments, if there's one thing I learned from all my time spent there...\" He casually threw a PK Thunder, which Dash focused on to get ready to dodge it. He was caught off guard though, when the moving bolt of thunder moved behind the psychic, neither prepared for the psychic to blast forward towards him at a speed near his own when it struck Lucas in the back, the teen following up with multiple kicks and blows to the face using his stick. \"...It's to get rid of the bigger threat <i>first</i>.\" Jack watched from the sidelines with anger, seeing his brother getting beat up again while he was stuck by the elder psychic's slashes. Remembering his metal form, Jack-Jack instantly turned to it, making the chimera's strike bounce off his body with a klang, the ginger teen shaking a bit from the impact. With a cry of anger, the baby charged forward, his steps shaking the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt seeing the baby's charge, Claus activated his jet-wings and flew to the sky, seeing the baby continue his charge towards his brother, the lack of attention to property damage being something the chimera noticed. His brother also noticed it, seeing the destroyed cities from the baby's angry stomps and thought to himself, \"<i>Wait, if they don't care for protecting this world, then maybe they aren't from here either...If that's the case, then why are we fighting?</i>\" Seeing a chance to counterattack, Dash used his speed to build a cyclone while Lucas was distracted, the blonde shaken out from his musings and struggling against the wind currents. \"Wait a minute you two! I-I think there's-Oomf!!\" Dash cut him off with a quick jab, stating with an angry snarl, \"I'll teach you to undersell me punk!\" As the jabs continued, Claus immediate intervened with a blast to send Dash back a bit, stating with a metal link since both psychics knew the baby was too angry to try screwing with their minds at the moment, \"<i>PK Freeze them, quick!</i>\" Lucas nodded as his brother created a diversion of blasts from his arm cannon, blocking the supers' view of his brother, giving Lucas enough them to send a PK blast towards the both of them and freeze them solid in blocks of ice. Sighing from slight mental exhaustion, both teens approached the frozen scowling duo. \"I think we might have gotten off on the wrong foot. You don't care for this world do you?</span></div></div>",

Dash caught his breath first before saying \"Well duh, isn't that obvious, I don\u2019t care about these puny little shits!\u201d Jack Jack garbled to agree.  Lucas and Claus were then a bit confused, \u201cThen why are you in a super hero family!?\u201d The two psychics asked.  \u201cWell for one, I can\u2019t control who my parents are and two, I wanted to be the bad guy for once and I did it just yesterday and boy is it fun, my brother grew us by the way!\u201d  \u201cAnother thing is that I barley even use my powers because even though super hero\u2019s aren\u2019t banned where I\u2019m from, my parents won\u2019t even let me fight crime! Does that Answer your question?\u201d Dash asked with sort of a cocky tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two psychics thought for a moment and nodded.  \u201cDamn, dude that must suck ass, not being able to use your powers.\u201d Lucas said.  Dash nodded.  \u201cSo what was your name again?\u201d Claus asked.  \u201cI\u2019m Dash, and as you saw, I have super speed, and this is my baby brother jack jack!\u201d Jack Jack garbled a hello. \u201cAnd who are you two?\u201d Dash asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Lucas and this is my twin brother Claus, we used to save people, but we just went to the dark side.\u201d Lucas said. \u201cYeah and it was my idea!\u201d Clause said confidently! Lucas scoffed and said \u201cyeah yeah\u201d under his breath.  \u201cAnyway, this is actually our second world, we just ate a planet yesterday!\u201d Lucas said. \u201cYeah after farting on it!\u201d Claus added. Dash and jack jack were shocked,  in fact, Dash was a little jealous. Claus noticed this and said in a teasing tone \u201cAwww someone not get to eat a planet yet?\u201d Dash laughed and said \u201cOh fuck You....\u201d in a joking tone.  The boys chuckled, while they weren\u2019t al buddy buddy with each other, they felt bit at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you guys ever go home?\u201d Lucas asked, since he was curios because Dash was in a super hero family. Dash replied with, \u201cYeah this is actually our second world too, we left since my baby brother was missing mommy\u201d in a joking tone.  \u201cWe used to be in just speedos, since the first time they didn\u2019t grow with us, so I had to lie to my parents when they saw the suits, so now they are pretty much unbreakable.  Lucas and Claus nodded understanding his situation, since Jack Jack was just a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you guys wanna do now?\u201d Dash asked feeling a little more at ease with a psychic. Claus and Lucas, though a little hesitant, realized that the two supers didn\u2019t care about the world either and suggested.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, how about we try stink torturing those little specks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas rolled his eyes while Dash and Jack-Jack looked intrigued by the suggestion. Of course his brother would suggest that. He's always been the more outgoing and daring of the two. Despite finding enjoyment out of fart torturing the tiny people in his world, the blonde psychic wasn't sure he'd be comfortable doing it in front of strangers that they just tried to murder. Make things more awkward, great idea Claus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up for that! Right Jack-Jack?\" At his brother's excited giggle, the freckled boy ask what kinds of stink torture they would preform. The two heroes were suddenly taken back a bit by the ginger boy's near-instant change to his human form. Ignoring their surprised faces, (despite being amused by them), Claus casually scooped up a landscape holding a city for examples. \"Oh anything really. We could forced them to endure our rank pits...\" At this, the teen picked up half of the city in his other hand and slammed it against the underside of his armpit, teasingly rubbing the screaming micros into the rancid area, some fading into unconsciousness from the smell. \"Or dump them backside into our undergarments.\" The other part of the city experienced a worse hell, as Claus squished those against his armpit into red paste and rubble, using his hand to bring them to his backside and above his pasty white moons, dumping them without a shred of remorse and even giggling from the feeling and knowledge that he now had part of a city stuck between his buttcheeks. Those left inside were either gagging or passing out from the stench, desperately wanting fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Cool idea robo boy!\" Claus raised an eyebrow while his brother hid a snicker in the background. \"This 'robo boy' has a name. You just learned about it. Besides, alias is inaccurate. Try chimera.\" That caused both supers to look at him with weird looks, clearly not understanding the term, to which Claus sighed while mentally thinking to himself, \"<i>These are two we're gonna have tag along with our fun? Oh joy...</i>\" \"It's kinda like he's part human, part robot. Think of it like an android.\" \"Ah...\" Claus shook his head and decided to move along, glad his brother could explain it better. \"By the way Lucas, I didn't hear you say anything yet about joining us.\" Lucas simply replied with a calm expression, \"Someone's gotta be judge right? I don't trust that you guys will keep those specks alive so they could judge themselves...\" Dash and Jack-Jack murmured in agreement, having not thought about that part, while the elder twin rolled his eyes, guessing his brother wanted to avoid embarrassing himself in front of the other two. Well that was fine. just gives Claus the chance to show who had more guts out of the two psychics. Besides, his brother will join in later weather he wants to or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you'll start once Claus disposes of the city first. No cheating bro. That's not cool.\" Getting defensive, the ginger glared at his brother and said with a haughty expression, \"I know. I was just demonstrating after all.\" Without warning, the screaming tiny inhabitants wedged between the teen's buttocks were silenced in an instant when the boy clenched, crushing them in an instant, picking out the rubble afterwards to show them all the destroyed city. Satisfied, the super duo went to pick their cities to torment while Claus stayed put, already in front of another quivering metropolis. There was some faint screams cut off by the sound of an explosion, attracting the trio of participants' attention to Lucas, now sitting on a throne of ice he just made that encased a couple of neighboring towns and cities, along with part of a forest. Smirking, the boy announced for them to start, with Dash thinking about using their powers to mess around with the remaining cities they came across after this competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash and Claus, oddly enough, had the same idea of starting out small by hovering their dirty, grim-ridden feet over their selected cities, the stench alone having everyone in them groaning or gagging, desperately wishing they bathed more often. Jack-Jack on the other hand, having no restraint or patience due to being a baby, picked up some tiny cities and eagerly stuffed them into the back of his diaper, giggling at the muffled screams coming from his backside. Dash was almost as impatient, quickly losing interesting in torturing just one city with his feet stink and without warning, brought his foot down all the way, resulting in a loud satisfying crunch, as he moved to the next city with a grin. Claus however, had more patience and found it more fun to tormenting his victims enough until they begged for death, which he was more than willing to grant them. The citizens below were relieved once the massive foot enveloping them disappeared along with the stench that emitted from it, but their form of mercy only lasted seconds before the colossal teen scooped them up and squished them against his sweaty pit, a more horrendous odor assaulting everyone's noses and feel sick to their stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the competition's meaning became lost on Jack-Jack, as he was squishing towns and forests between his pudgy feet while giggling. His brother noticed this and sighed with a shrug. \"<i>I guess I should've seen that coming. He couldn't stay focused on a task unless I directed him to.</i>\" Drawing his attention back down to his next victims, he thought to himself with a smirk, \"<i>Well that's fine. I'll just have to win this thing for us!~</i>\" Feeling a bit peckish, the boy scooped up the neighboring towns and threw the screaming inhabitants and their homes inside his mouth, chewing on them a bit before swallowing with a content sigh. Deciding to be extra cruel, he bent down and scooped up a few cities, holding them in the palm of his hand. They all saw the grinning boy's mouth slowly approach them and feared they were about to suffer the same fate as those towns when the blonde's mouth opened. Instead, a loud burp left his mouth that had enough force to send the cities flying off, the putrid air assaulting the flung tinies' nostrils the whole way down until they lost consciousness upon impact with the ground. Dash laughed at the display before moving on to ruin more lives with his stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Claus, the teen grew tired of rubbing them against his pit, as fun as the feeling was and hearing them scream between their gagging. He was gonna torture them with his butt by this point, but as he opened his underwear, he thought of something. \"<i>Hmm, I wonder if it stinks less or more front side...</i>\" He quickly dismissed that foolish thought after a few seconds. Of course his butt was a worse hell to experience. Still, with that in mind...\"<i>Maybe I should start with the front just to make it feel that much worse when I do move them under my butt.</i>\" Grinning at that, the ginger gleefully brought the tiny city in his hand to his front and dangled them over his waistband. Then, he dropped them without warning and giggled once they landed, part of the city breaking and sliding down onto his balls while the other rested on his flaccid appendage. Then, he let go of the waistband and mocked them by teasingly rubbing the broken city against his privates, his grin fading a few seconds later as a new sensation formed from doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, given what's happened to him, Claus didn't really get to experience being a teenager and all of the awkward experimentation that came with it. His brother didn't either and that was also as understandable given what he was going through. However, now that they were past all of that, the ginger psychic couldn't help but wonder about this strange new feeling coming from his front. His penis tingled a bit and was slowly rising, forming a tent in his shorts. He gulped from anticipation and his hand automatically moved closer to rub it to see if he could get more out of this strange new sensation. He stopped though upon glancing to his sides to see his brother glancing over at him with a curious look, unable to see Claus' development from where he was sitting. The boy blushed a bit at the thought of getting caught in something his brother might deem gross. Besides, he didn't want to find out what it was with his brother watching, since he could totally teach his brother later after learning himself about the whole thing. Makes him seem wiser that way. That in mind, as much as his mind urged him to indulge himself in this newfound pleasure that had his breathing slow down slightly, the boy moved his hands away and gently picked both parts of the city off of his privates, the disgusted inhabitants never being more relieved in their lives. As if knowing they were feeling relieved, the boy flash them a dark smile while announcing, \"Oh trust me, you little termites are about to wish you stayed on my penis~\" The boy proved that by stuffing them into the backside, once again relishing having a tiny city underneath his butt, the inhabitants screaming from horror and sickness at the stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the other three, Lucas wasn't just sitting on his frozen seat watching. But how exactly was the psychic teen passing the time? Should we find out now, or continue with the other three?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The competition continued as Claus thought about what else to stink torture these tiny miserable pathetic powerless life forms! As he thought, he felt his belly rumble.... for release. \u201cAh Perfect timing I have gas and you\u2019re already near my ass, get ready you pint sized bitches!~\u201d Claus pushed and grinned as the tiny inhabitants were terrified, begging for mercy, or for something to stop this gassy giant powerful titan, but luck wasn\u2019t on their side as a putrid air, smelling like shit and rotten eggs, emitted from Claus\u2019s moons and filled the tinies noses, who were already suffering in Claus\u2019s sweaty undies. Claus just grinned a dark grin as tinies were killed, deciding to be extra cruel he rubbed his butt around to have the tinies suffer even more, which was also making his member rise, which he took care of by rubbing it for a bit, making him moan in pleasure, but it was taken care off. Claus just smiled as he saw more tinies and shoved more tinies into his smelly pits!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash, who was already impressed at Claus\u2019s power as he got a whiff of his smell but decided to just not say anything and focus on the competition. He thought about what he could do, when he instantly remembered that he beans last night and grinned. As if on cue his stomach rumbled, full of gas. Dash looked at a group of scared tiny inhabitants, scooped them up and said \u201cBe prepared for a world of hell, you miserable little specks!\u201d Dash shoved the tinies down his back side, near his gigantic moons and pushed. Like Claus\u2019s victims, there was no mercy as Dash pushed and more putrid smelly air, smelling like road kill and skunk, emitted from the 10 year olds ass. Some tinies were killed instantly, others weren\u2019t but we\u2019re still subjects to Dash\u2019s smelly ass bombs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack jack, crawled around with curiosity and a grin, looking for tinies to kill as he saw his brother kill some. Jack jack saw some tinies and garbled happily. He picked up the tinies and garbled something, the tinies weren\u2019t a hundred percent shore what this big baby just said, but when he opened the waist band of his diaper, their hearts sank. Jack jack just shoved them in and he pushed as hard as he could. A loud booming sound was quickly heard as the air got even more smelly, not that jack jack cared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas continued to sit on his ice throne, getting a little bored of waiting, so he decided to end the competition and see who the winner was.  \u201cAlright, times up, Judging Time!\u201d Lucas shouted. The other three, though a little disappointed that they had to stop, got up and walked over. Lucas got up from his throne and instantly got a whiff of the smell the other three had manage.  \u201cOh God, that is stinky!\u201d Lucas said gagging a bit at the smell. Lucas gathered with the other three and got another good whiff, all smelled really bad and it was hard to decide. Lucas thought for moment and he then decided the winner. \u201cOk the winner if the contest is.....,the other three held the breath hoping they would win. The winner is Claus!\u201d\u2019 Lucas announced. Claus smirked and cheered, thrilled that he won the competition. Though a little disappointed, dash and jack jack congratulated Claus for his victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, what should we do next?!\u201d Dash said. They all thought for a moment, they wondered  if they should make the tinies rub their feet, which were all very smelly, or maybe use their powers to cause More destruction? What do you think, is it time to power up or is it foot massage time?!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the competition started, Lucas took a minute or two to watch his brother and those two supers and needless to say, he was unimpressed. Claus and Dash started with the same idea, (which spoke a bit about how immature and uncreative his brother could be), while Jack-Jack was just having fun being a giant baby, the competition lost on him. The boy rolled his eyes as he thought what he could to better pass the time. He already knew who was gonna win and while some would call it nepotism, in his defense, you try suffering his brother's gas and see if it doesn't make your skin crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal psychic looked at the tiny frozen cities below him, idly using telekinesis to rip a few off the ground and bring them near his face to observe the damage. The ice covered entire buildings and streets in those cities, some people stuck in a kneeling position and hugging themselves. Lucas figured they were attempting to gain any sort of warmth before their entire body froze up. By now, he figured most would probably frozen to death, and only a few still had time left to be saved from their cruel fate. But Lucas choose to smirk instead and watch those shivering few slowly become encased in ice. He was not the same kind child from his journey anymore. He had no mercy left to give humans since it got him nowhere but pain. Out of curiosity, the blonde gently brushed his fingers against a nearby building and watched as it toppled over and shattered in ice shards that flew out in all directions around the surrounding area. Some impaled a few more buildings, looking like they could collapse with any further pressure, and some hit a few frozen people, causing them to shatter in a horrid mess of blood and flesh where they stood, all while Lucas watched with cold glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>They're missing out really. It's fun to see up close how helpless these little specks are against us.</i>\" He casually glanced towards the others and saw that his brother was still doing foot torture while Dash switched it up and let out a boisterous burp that he could hear from all the way over here, while Jack-Jack was still more of the same as he expected. Shrugging, he then turned his attention back to his collection of frozen civilizations. He gleefully stepped on part of one below near his ice throne and watched in fascination as the ice shreds of human organs and debris flew, some bouncing off his abnormally tough skin. Those still able to move in the subzero-metropolis couldn't even scream in fear or flee from the raining shards of ice, their only option being to silently pray it wouldn't hit them or in some cases, hoping it would for a quick, less painful death. \"<i>We could destroy them with such little effort on our parts~ Hm hm hm~</i>\" The more Lucas added to their fear, the more enjoyment he got out of those shiver survivors. To the point where he got to excited by it and felt a weird sensation in his lower region. When he glanced at the source, he looked confused by it and the reaction he drew out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike with his brother, he never had the chance or real desire to explore his more developed body. All he could focus on back then was stopping the Pigmasks from awaking that accursed dragon. It wasn't like he was entirely alone either and he didn't mind that fact. But here and now, after everything that's happened, he wasn't as shy as he previously was and was curious about this new sensation his cruelty brought out of him, his breathing slowed a bit. Out of instinct, he grasped his pitched tent with his fingers ever so gently and gasped, suppressing a moan from how good that just felt. He glanced at the others and looked at his brother in particular, who thankfully couldn't see the arousal of the hand grasping it from his current position. He saw his brother's back turned and looked curious why he was just sitting there for a few minutes. As if sensing Lucas staring, Claus turned his head and met his brother's gaze for several seconds before turning, making Lucas feel relieved. Okay so maybe he wasn't completely over his shyness, but now that he had his brother back, he valued his view of him and didn't want him to think he was gross, not like they were apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of him wanted to give in more to his teenage hormones, but he didn't want to do it in front of the others. Sighing in frustration, he left his aching erection alone, as it slowly softened back down. For a moment, he imagined placing those tiny civilizations in his underwear, on top of his penis just to feel what it was like and that thought made his boner grow back within seconds, making him feel more tempted to give in to his urges. Shaking his head, the blushing blonde sighed and picked up a frozen city, placing it on the bugle and let his resistance to temperature drop, instantly feeling how cold it was and covering his mouth to suppress the yelp, his erection dying down at a much faster pace. When it back down all the way, he took the frozen city off and flicked it away while raising his resistance back up, the sound of glass breaking in the distance as he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his mood killed now, he idly glanced to see how the competition was going and scowled at the sight. All three of them were now doing what he expected they were going to do: gas the cities beneath them. He mentally groaned as he now knew he now had to go up there and take a whiff around the areas they farted at to judge who's was more rancid, (which again, he knew was his brothers, hands down). \"<i>Why can't they just be a bit more mature? I wouldn't mind if they only used their feet. At least, I'm used to smelly feet thanks to growing up with my rowdy brother...</i>\" He was so going to wring his brother's neck for this. Maybe the other two as well depending if theirs are just as bad as his brothers. He waited until Jack-Jack finished before getting up to stop them. \"Alright, time's up. Judging Time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them wilted at the news but didn't voice any complaints, as Lucas stood and instantly got a whiff of the unclean air, his nose scrunching up in disgust, gagging to get it out of his mouth \"Oh god, that is stinky!\" Maybe he was underestimating how putrid a ten year-old's fart and his baby brother's fart could be. Now a bit unsure of who'd win, he begrudgingly stomped over to judge who's made him want to puke more, shooting a death glare at his snicking brother in the distance and sending him a telepathic message, \"<i>I will pay you back for this...</i>\" His twin brother's smug grin only widened as he shot back, \"<i>Oh will you now? Can't wait to see how~</i>\" Oh he was such a douche sometimes! He could've just declare Dash or Jack-Jack the winners, but that wouldn't feel like a good way at getting back at his brother, so he decided to continue judging fairly Now even more frustrated, he just kept walking, not even glancing at the other two just in case they equally enjoyed seeing him mad, focusing on the sound of people screaming for help before he stomped them and their homes out of existence under his colossal feet to feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe definitely underestimated the supers. Jack-Jack's side smelled like what you'd expect a baby's dirty diaper to smell like, only 5 times worse. Dash's side smelled like refried-black beans, (don't ask how Lucas knows what that smells like. Let's just say, there's a reason he doesn't share a room with Ness at night anymore at the Smash Mansion), and burnt meat, which really made Lucas feel sick and spiteful to both a certain chimera, and a raven psychic from who-knows how many years ago in their world. He was considering actually declaring either of the two the winner for a bit, before being reminded how awful his brother's rotten-flesh smelling gas was and decided. \"Okay, the winner of the contest is...\" He couldn't help leaving them in suspense for a moment or two, just for entertainment. \"The winner is Claus!\" He also thinks he's spent too much time attending those smash tournaments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother smirked and cheered upon winning while Dash and Jack-Jack congratulated him on his victory, obviously hiding their slight disappointment. It was just a game for them after all and none of them were gonna hold a grudge on who won. Lucas will certainly hold a grudge over smelling the polluted air they caused, but nothing too over the top. He glanced back to those frozen cities and thought back to his pitched tent, still wanting to explore more with that new feeling. Maybe he should discuss it with his brother later? He's the only he'd feel comfortable going over this with since they're both at that age. Who knows, maybe Claus experienced the same thing while they were having their competition? He wasn't paying them much attention after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about to the present, he wondered what they should do now that their stupid game was over. Maybe he could teach them to better enjoy watching the puny people below them cower from how powerful they were with a small demonstration with their powers? Or maybe they could part ways for the time being since he wanted some time alone with his brother to talk about that new sensation in his lower region. Which should he go with?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The psychic duo were a bit caught off guard when Jack-Jack suddenly started crying, saying the words 'Momma' and 'Dadda', which told the other three that he missed them, like all babies do. Sighing, the baby's older brother shrugged.\"Told you two he gets like this after a while. Guess I have to call it in for the day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins glanced at one another, a bit curious what this meant for the two supers. Would they come back, or be sent to another world altogether. The thought was a tiny bit disheartening. After all, they were just getting to know them and despite getting off on the wrong foot, it was nice to have other kids understand and join in on their fun. As if sensing their slight disappointment, Dash added with a grin, \"Don't worry, we'll be back tomorrow! Jack-Jack's more smart than you might think, he can bring us back here afterwards. Don't go completely destroying this world just yet, k?\" Claus also shrugged and cheekily stated,\"Sure, but when you return, there might not be much left for you two to have fun with!~\" \"Ha, yeah true! But it's okay, we'll just meet up and go to another one together! You guys are pretty cool to be around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins smiled in agreement, the three boys giving each other a bro fist before the two left using Jack-Jack's dimension-slipping ability. As the two were left alone, Lucas silently decided now would be a good time to ask his brother about his earlier feeling, not knowing Claus was thinking the same thing just now. After a few awkward moments of silence, the two simultaneously asked the same time, \"<b>Lucas/Claus, do you know what it means when your penis gets stiff?</b>\" The two stared at one another with shocked, blushing faces before laughing at their sync level. After calming down, the two shook their heads in denial. \"No sadly. I never got the experience being a Chimera and all...\" \"Yeah, and I was too focused to my journey to relax too much...\" Both teens were a bit disappointed that the other didn't have any experience, but Lucas suggested with a growing blush, \"...We could try exploring about it together if you want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder psychic was a bit surprised his brother was the first to suggest it but he was more than eager to say yes, desperately wanting to have a good brotherly moment with his younger brother. Just as he was gonna agree to it though, he saw a tiny flash from the corner of his eye that came from the front of Lucas's shorts. His eyes glanced down towards it before spotting someone clinging onto his brother's waistband, making him blush awkwardly. \"Uh, Luke? I think someone just appeared on your shorts...\" \"Huh?\" Blushing a bit from where his brother's eyes were looking, the teen glanced down and indeed saw someone real tiny clinging on his waistband, (Well tiny to them since all humans were flea-sized from their current perspective). He would've just casually brushed it off like any other kind of bug, but since his brother said it suddenly appeared there, he was a bit curious if anything was different about this human. Lucas concentrated a bit, his eyes and index finger glowing slightly, before the tiny human was covered with the same glow and using telekinesis, brought to the blonde's eyes, which widened in shock when he got a good look at who exactly it was. \"N...N-Ness!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired psychic was speechless at the sight before him. First he found himself on a strange ground, only to find out seconds later that he was a colossus's shorts. Then he was being lifted by what he recognized as telekinesis to the colossal boy's face and suppressed a yelp when seeing the colossus was his friend Lucas. \"H-Hey Lucas, why are you so huge!?\" Lucas could barely hear him at first, so he used the dark dragon's power to temporarily increased his hearing, asking him to repeat it, (also making sure his voice didn't burst Ness' eardrums due to the size difference), rubbing the back of his neck and looking away a bit sheepishly. \"Well, it's kinda of a long story...\" Still, he felt like the boy deserved it. No matter how dark his heart got, he remembers who was his first friend was when he was invited to that smash tournament and who protected him in the Subspace Emissary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Half an hour later...</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe normal-sized psychic casually sat on the colossal blonde boy's palm, his current expression hidden by his cap. \"...I see. So that's what happened...\" The two gigantic teens stared down at the tiny psychic with varying expressions. Claus was glaring defensively, prepared to make the boy pay if he rejected his brother's friendship after learning about their actions and made Lucas feel heartbroken, already knowing how much his brother valued their friendship from their interaction. Said blonde was staring down with a bit of guilty expression, hoping Ness wasn't about to do what he feared he might do. To both their shock and relief, the boy suddenly glanced up with his usual smile, \"That sounds like so much fun! Can I join in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got both boys gaping, Claus being the first to snap out of his shock and ask with a flustered smile, \"W-Whoa hang on, you...you realize what you're asking to do right?\" The boy's smile never left as he replied with the same amused tone, \"Of course I know, but I have no problems with it. Not like it's my home-world we'd be destroying~ Besides, I wanna have some fun with my best bud and his older brother! Good to see you alive now by the way, it's nice to meet you!\" Claus awkwardly smiled at the kind gesture while Lucas looked so beyond relieved and happy. He should've known he could count on his best friend not to judge him. They'd been so close for so long after all after 3 smash tournaments! One thing bothered him though. \"Ness, I'm glad you feel that way, like real happy, but do you mind if I ask why you're okay with it? And how you even got here in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger teen's smile faltered a bit, as he explained with a less cheery tone,\"Well, to answer how I got here, I was training with Ninten to use 4th-D Slip. I managed to finally get the hang of it and when I arrived at your time, nothing was left. Lucky that I have some of Giygus' powers after being to close to that monster when fighting him. Otherwise, I'd be dead.\" Lucas winced at that, feeling a bit ashamed that he nearly killed his best friend unintentionally.\"Guess I know why now and that's fine. Honestly, after the Giygus incident, things haven't been easy for me back home. Jeff's in hysterics after his father disappeared, Paula's disappeared as well, and Poo's gone back to Dalaam since there's no threat. Aside from them, everyone I come across back home looks at me weird and I'm not sure if it's because of my powers, or because Giygus was inside of me when I was being born. Either way, I've been isolated because of it. I dunno, I feel like destroying some cities at your size would take off some pent up aggression...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth twins couldn't help feeling sorry for Ness after hearing that, feeling a bit angry at humanity just because of that story, Lucas especially. The raven shook his head and tried to cheer himself back up, \"Anyway, let me see if I can grow myself to your size using Giygus' power!\" Lucas nodded and lifted the psychic field around his tiny friend, who kept levitating using his own PSI and concentrated, eyes flashing purple. Within seconds, the boy's body expanded at a rapid pace until he was the same size as the twins, landing with a huge boom, cities and towns crushed underneath his colossal shoes. Looking down in awe at the destruction his new size was already causing, Ness quickly smiled and muttered with near child-like amusement, \"Whoa! Awesome...\" Lucas grinned and was just about ready to go on a rampage with his best friend, but his brother stopped him by clearing his own throat to draw attention to him, giving his brother a raised eyebrow. \"Brother, aren't you forgetting something?\" After a few seconds of registering what he forgot, the blonde blushed and nodded, as Ness looked curiously at the two and asked what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>A few minutes later...</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh yeah, I know all about that!\" The twin psychics gazed at their companion with agape mouths in disbelief, which the raven noticed and to their further shocked, started blushing while rubbing the back of his neck. \"Uh..Heheh...Red showed me one night when I got a boner. He happened to pass by my room and noticed my confusion about it through my open door. Not much else to say...\" Claus, confused by who this 'Red' was, stealthily read his brother's mind and got his answer. One of Lucas's friends in Brawl who helped him fight against the Primids in Subspace, and get over some lingering fears since Lucas was still on his journey at the time. Said blonde was a bit surprised by Red's maturity. Then Ness surprised them even more when a look of realization flashed on his face and an excited grin formed on his face. \"Hey, why don't I teach you two about it? We could mess around with these puny people as we go along. It'll be more fun that way, I'm sure of it!~\" Both flustered teens glanced to one another, before deciding to go with it since it did sound fun. The raven smirked and then glanced down at the cities and towns scattered ahead, already thinking of one way to have some dirty fun with his new size.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wasting no time in having his fun, Ness eagerly lifted a city telekinetically and with a slightly movement of his finger, brought the tiny metropolis and all of it's struggling, screaming inhabitants towards his backside, Lucas already seeing where this was going and announcing with a groan, \"Oh come on, not you too...\" Still keeping the city suspended above the backside of his shorts, the boy turned around to his grimacing friend and curiously asked what had him bothered, \"What? You guys didn't try this before?\" Laughing a bit, Claus explained with a grin, \"It's not that. Trust me, we have. It's just that we had a stink competition moments ago with those supers we told you about and Lucas was the judge~\" Shooting his brother a spiteful glare that amused the elder twin even further, the blonde grumbled while looking away, \"Yeah, so I'd rather not smell any tainted air anytime soon please...\" Ness just smiled innocently which made Lucas groan some more, already knowing what his friend was about to say.\"Well no one's forcing you to be nearby for it. Besides, now you've got me curious to see who's worse~\" \"I already unfortunately know what yours smells like mister sleep-farter! I'll tell you right now, Claus' is by far the worst.\" \"Oh yeah, worse than you <i>sleep-farter</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas was shocked and beyond embarrassed at the information, even more so when he glanced at his brother who slowly nod in confirmation, as the boy looked down with an intense blush, muttering how deeply sorry he was for equally subjecting his friend to his gas. Ness just waved it off and then finally turned his attention back to the tiny city, dropping them into the backside of his underwear, as he sat down near a town, the tremors alone destroying a good portion of it and killing quite a good number of people from the falling building debris and flung cars. Unaware and uncaring of the damage he caused just by sitting down, the raven giggled and glanced at his behind before cheekily asking, \"I dunno, what do you little bugs think of my gas?~\" The next second, a boom louder than thunder assaulted the eardrums of every town and city nearby, as a foul stench slowly filled the air from the boy's clothed butt. The smell made everyone below the colossal boy nauseous or puke outright, but at least they were still alive for the moment. The town that was inside Ness' underwear was nothing but rubble, everyone disintegrated from the force of the fart alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven psychic just laughed at his antics and felt relieved, holding in that one in since he started training today with Ninten after lunch. Both twins waved the foul air away from them, Claus looking impressed by the size of it, and Lucas glaring in annoyance at his friend. \"Dude, nice one!\" \"Yeah, nice...You both disgust me sometimes. Tell me, how is being as gross as Wario suppose to help us out here with our uh...issues?\" Ness just grinned at his friend before standing up, the blonde gasping at the raven's boner. \"You're missing the bigger picture Lucas old pal! It's not the gross out humor that gets me excited, though it's certainly funny. It's the domination factor. I'm sure you understand a little of what I mean based on how you told me you and your brother got your erections~\" Both inexperienced twins thought over Ness' words and agreed with him. In that retrospective, Lucas could see why Claus enjoyed doing it so much to these worthless civilizations beneath them. He still wished he didn't have to deal with the smell though. Sighing, the blonde forced himself to get over it, as his friend stood up and took off his shoes, stating his reasoning, \"I kinda wanna feel what it's like to crush a tiny town underneath my bare foot~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next instance, Ness raised his right foot over a town nearby, it's people just getting over the horrible stench to see the boy's massive foot looming over them, encasing them in the dirty foot's shadow. They weren't given much time to really scream or panic before the boy quickly slammed it down, crushing the entire town in an instant and sending shockwaves from the impact that caused tremors to shake through a few surrounding towns and cities. The usually jovially teen hummed in satisfaction, twisting his foot on the remains just to make sure no one survived, while the twins watched in fascination at Ness's cruelty, their erections throbbing from the sight of power over the tiny specks. Ness himself could feel his boner twitching from his actions. He was already loving this new size and the power trip it came with. Feeling like he teased the two and himself long enough, and not wanting to make his friend wait any longer, the boy stripped off his clothes, save for his shirt and signature hat. Lucas blushed at seeing his best friend's naked butt in front of him, but also felt himself stiffen even harder from the image. Both twins felt like their erections were getting too painful in their pants so they stripped as well until only their shirt was left so their feet could get some fresh air as well, the stench from them already polluting the air of some nearby civilizations and making the inhabitants feel sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nervous pants at the heat he was feeling from his excitement and slight embarrassment from being naked in front of his best friend and brother, Lucas curiously asked, \"So w-what do we do next?...\" in response, Ness just turned to him and grinned while stroke his boner up and down, making both twins lustfully watch and mimic his movements. \"Well usually you'd jerk yourself off like this until you reach a state of bliss, thinking of the things that made you this hard in the first place. But since we're this size...\" The boy's eyes fell upon a nearby city, everyone in it paling at the titan's eyes stared at their home, already knowing they were next to be part of the giant's cruel sense of fun. Effortlessly lifting the city up to his penis using psychic energy, the boy wrapped his hand around it and practically squashed the entire thing against his hand and dick, the city breaking and crumbling while the people screamed and fought not to be crushed by the debris. Things were made worse for them when the boy started stroking and most of the people ended up squashed from the movement and pressure, those alive barely clinging onto life with debris from buildings surrounding them. \"Mmph!~ I T-thought why n-not use these t-tiny metropolises to m-make it feel even better?...Ooooh!~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins were more than eager to listen to the more experienced teen, already doing the same to a few nearby cities and towns and crushing them against their lengthy members, moaning in delight from how good the power trip felt. The next few minutes were spent repeating the same process: lifting a city or town towards them, smashing them against their erections and rubbing them to nothing but rubble and red paste, before repeating it the cycle, all three of them chuckling cruelly in between moans at the fact of what they were doing, all for the sake of pleasure and just because they felt like it. Claus gave them another idea when he brought a town to his waiting palm and lifted his blood-soaked penis above them with a toothy grin, before smashing it down and wiping them from existence, laughing after moaning. The other two smiled at the idea and copied it, also laughing afterwards. As they got closer to their limit, Ness thought of how to make this finish all of the more satisfying and went with it, using his free hand to move a couple cities over to one in firing range, placing them a couple meters apart so it was like one massive metropolis for them to paint white. Just thought of it, was enough to make him finish with a loud cry of euphoria, the twins following suit upon hearing it and seeing white sticky ropes of cum shoot out of Ness penis, their own shooting out alongside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor scared inhabitants in those joined cities and towns watched the lewd show that spelled their end happening above them and most decided to take refuge from the inevitable sticky finish inside their homes or nearby buildings, no one dare denying them entry. Some morbidly stood in place, either too scared to move, (too fascinated for some perverted individuals), or knew that nothing would change even if they did hide, knowing the cum shots from the gigantic teenagers would have enough force to plow straight through buildings. Sure enough, when the moment came with a chorus of loud moans from the teens, they were given only a second or two to see the meteor-sized globs of cum shoot towards them before it rained down all over them, every one of them plowing through buildings and sending those caught in the blast barreling towards the concrete below, dying from the impact. Some shots skipped several blocks like certain types of rock or shells would when thrown onto a water's surface, while others splattered all over the area on impact. By the end of the this fucked-up version of the apocalypse, the joined metropolis was in complete ruins, a few survivors lucky enough to not get hit struggling in the white goop flooding all over the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio of boys panted and marveled at their work with tired, lustful eyes with tired smiles on their faces, before they collapsed in exhaustion, the time of day finally catching up to them, as they fell asleep leaning against one another.</span></div></div>",

Having always been an early riser, Lucas woke up first with a yawn, rubbing his eyes and glancing around groggily, slowly recalling yesterday's events. The lingering stench from last night hit his nose and he grimaced, remembering who he was sleeping next too. He also caught a hint of his own and blushed, still embarrassed that he himself was just as guilty as Ness for that gross habit. He hoped that his lack of a need to poop due to being a god of sorts at this point would at least help, but it seems it didn't. The others slowly woke up themselves from Lucas' movements, Claus in the same manner as his brother while Ness just stretched. They all looked at one another and flushed in embarrassment for a moment, but then remembered what they did and got over it, using their psychic powers to clean themselves up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was so cool!\" \"I know right?\" Ness and Claus grinned with immense satisfaction, not showing a shred of regret at the fact that they committed genocide on thousands upon thousands of people. Lucas didn't feel bad at all either and was smiling as well. \"Yeah, it was nice to play with Ness.\" \"You wanna phrase it like that huh? Well I guess we did just masturbate next to each other, but take me out to dinner first Luke~\" \"Oh shut up!\" The blond blushed in embarrassment while his brother and friend laughed at his expense, before Ness stopped and grinning in delight. \"Actually that gives me an idea for next time...\" Claus stopped laughing as well and raised an eyebrow in confusion. \"Next time?\" \"Yeah, sorry...\" The raven psychic rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. \"I can't leave Ninten waiting any longer. He must be worried since I didn't show up last night. I'll come back soon though, so don't go missing me too much~\" Ness playfully stuck out his tongue at the twins with a wink, Lucas smiling a bit as the expression brought a good memory to mind, but flipping him off all the same in return, making the raven laugh. Claus playfully rolled his eyes. \"I'll think we'll manage, come back soon though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting properly dressed and cleaned up, Ness used his psychic powers to move debris out of the way, creating a small clear path ahead of him. He then shrunk himself back to normal size and used his 4th Dimension Slip, running at near the same speed as Sonic until he disappeared moments later. The blond titan looked a bit sad by his friend's departure, until his brother put a hand on his shoulder and gave a smile of reassurance, reminding Lucas that they'll see him again. A second later though, a tiny portal opened in front of them, and two familiar supers fell out, growing to the twins' size within moments. \"We're back!\" The flecked blond then took a good look around and smiled. \"Wow, you guys really did have fun without us.\" He then saw the cum pools that oozed all over the destroyed cities and frowned in confusion. \"What's this clear white stuff lying all around though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth psychics glanced at each other, as if silently asking if they should tell him what it was, as Jack-Jack noticed it too and curiously scooped part of it up, sniffing it before tasting it. The baby giggled a bit at the taste and scooped up a bit more, much to the twins embarrassment and Dash's curiosity. \"You enjoy that stuff Jack-Jack? Huh...Now I wonder what it taste like.\" Before making things anymore embarrassing for the twins and avoiding possible anger at the revelation later, Claus put on a stoic expression, (being an expert with the look for obvious reasons), and said with a collected tone, \"I wouldn't if I were you. We tried it when we left and it doesn't taste good. I can only assume your baby brother isn't bothered by it because he hasn't had real food yet.\" Dash felt like that was a challenge at first, until he got a glimpse at Lucas, who was looked like he was grimacing just remembering the taste. (In truth, he was just adding to the act). Dash thought about it being something that tasted too bitter and shared Lucas' look. \"Message received, thanks. Better not have anymore of that stuff Jack-Jack.\" The baby garbled a bit in frustration at that, but after the look Dash gave him, he relented and with a frown, started shooting his eyes lasers at the cum piles, vaporizing the sticky substance and anything or anyone in them. He at least found it enjoyable and started giggling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth twins had a mental sigh of relief, glad to avoid getting Jack-Jack addicted to their cum and cause multiple issues later from it.<br>\r\nDash immediately killed that relief by pressing both psychics again, \"You didn't tell me what that stuff is though. Come on, you can tell me!\" \"Uh, well...\" \"Just something that got stuck in my jet boosters. Think I got them all out...\" Dash glanced at Claus, who changed into chimera form, and saw some of the stuff leaking out of the machinery on his back, Lucas silently thankful they had the ability to basically create whatever, whenever they desired. Dash stuck his tongue out in disgust. \"Gross! And you were eating that Jack-Jack!?\" While Dash freaked out, Lucas telepathically asked his brother, \"<i>Did you really just-</i>\" \"<i>No of course not. i just made something that looks like it and had it drip from there to convince the nosy twerp.</i>\" \"<i>...It's ice cream isn't it?</i> \"<i>Yup, Vanilla to be precise~</i>\" Claus stuck his tongue at his brother, who smirked and rolled his eyes, as Dash calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around a bit more, the ten-year old decided they were done with this world. \"Let's move on to another world. There's not much left, unless you count those small islands across the sea and I don't feel like swimming towards them. I could run across the water to them, but I'd probably overshoot if I did...\" Claus smirked as he came up with an idea. \"Sure, but let me just leave them with a parting gift before we do.\" The other three titans watched as the chimera directed his gaze towards those islands and raised his sword to the sky, shooting a surge of lighting towards the clouds above the islands. Within seconds, massive bolts of lighting rained down onto the islands, reducing any life on them and their homes to nothing more than charred cinders and piles of ash. Dash and Jack-Jack laughed at the display, as Lucas grinned and decided to join in. Seeing a few more islands to the right of them, Lucas charged his Pk Freeze and sent it over towards them, releasing the energy once it was directly on top of them, causing a huge icy burst that created a frozen crater in their place, all life left on them encased in ice. The supers cheered on Lucas and Claus, as they kept destroying islands left and right until there was none left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they were absolutely there was no civilization left to toy with, Lucas asked Dash with a smirk, \"You wanna eat what's left so you can finally know what it feels like?\" Dash frown and corrected him, \"I did before, I just forgot. And nah, too boring. With no life except ocean animals left, there's no fun or enjoyment in it.\" \"Then how about letting you're little brother eat it?\" Lucas was gonna give his brother a look, but stopped as soon as Dash admitted with a hum, \"I mean, he could despite appearances. Hey Jack-Jack, wanna eat this planet?\" The baby garbled and shook his head. The elder super shrugged. \"I guess he's not interested in it.\" Claus shrugged as well. \"Well we're not eating it either for the same reasons. Let's just leave it as it is. Anyhow, how should we toy with the next world we come across?\" His brother smirked, as he had an idea already in mind. \"How about we...\"</span></div></div>",

Jack-Jack giggled at the fun suggestion, while the others wondered if the baby would be willing to sit still to actually enjoy it. Dash doubted it and shrugged, \"<i>As long as he's entertained.</i>\" He then glared as both psychics nodded in agreement. \"<i>And stop reading my mind you jerks...</i>\" The twins playfully stuck their tongues at Dash, making him huff and sulk. \"Whatever. Let's...wait, I just realized, should we really be this big for this?\" The psychics glanced at each other and nodded. \"Good point. No worries, easy fix.\" Lucas eyes flashed purple as Dash watched curiously. After seeing the destroyed ground getting closer, he realized what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he finished, Dash grinned. \"Dude that's cool! I didn't know you guys could change size like that!\" Claus raised an eyebrow and smirked, \"How do you think we got this big in the first place dummy?\" \"I meant other people's sizes idiot!\" The two glared a bit before shrugging and putting it behind them, as Lucas inquired curiously. \"How did you get so big in the first place anyway? Seems like you have only speed powers while your brothers has multiple.\" Dash rubbed the back of his head as he glanced at his giggling baby brother. \"Jack-Jack grew me to this size along with him. I'm not sure about it entirely, but my dad said he's a polymoth, or whatever...\" \"A Polymorph...\" \"Yeah that. We don't even know how many powers he has in total, but if you ask me, he just got a lucky draw.\" \"Jealous much?\" The blond super huffed and looked away. \"A bit, but it's fine. As long as he shares, I don't mind it too much.\" The twins nodded as Jack-Jack began the process, both psychics sending each other a grin, knowing exactly how they were gonna make their cities worship them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne trip through dimensions later, the group of four titans landed on their butts, some wildlife crushed underneath them. As he got up and dusted themselves off a bit, the group found themselves above a forest this time, a few cities far apart from each other in the distances, and one over the ocean. \"How unlucky. They all seem to be spaced out.\" \"Man, I wanted to play with them as a group!\" Dash then realized something and smirked. \"Wait, I could just take us to another city!\" \"Well, my brother and I could also use telekinesis to bring them all together.\" The 10 year old super groaned. \"No way! I need to stretch my legs every now and then!\" Lucas sighed in exasperation. \"Alright then, before we discuss anymore of this, let's decide. Should we do this as a group, or should we split up for now? I'd have no problems having my own city to mess with.\" The other three glanced curiously at one another, thinking it over a bit. After a while, Dash nodded and said,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claus nodded and immediately shouted, \"I call the city over there!\" \"Fine, I call the opposite one then!\" The two twins immediately ran off towards those cities, well Claus flew off, while the flecked blonde crossed his arms. He could easily out-speed them, but he didn't want to be a dick since they called those cities. He was about to head out to the city overseas, but found Jack-Jack already floating himself over there. \"Oh come on!\" Sighing, the blonde glanced around to search for any other city nearby before he just ran to one, but found something else near his boot instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say the sudden appearance of four titanic beings near their homes was frightening was an understatement. As they talked, the tribal people all yelled in pain, the loud voices sounding louder than those weird sirens they'd occasionally hear coming from the west and east side of the village. The village chief, while covering his ears, watched the titanic beings, wondering what their intent was. When the other three left, (two of them startling everyone by their method of traveling), they all felt immense relief and waited for the last titan to be on his way as well. Just as he looked like he was going to, the masked titan glanced down and saw the tiny village, the women screaming and rushing their children into their homes, and the men reading their spears. Some women also chose to stand and fight, spears in hand, as the titan grinned down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you know? It's a tiny village! I can work with this!\" Dash gleefully raised his boot over some houses and stomped down without a care, debris flying in all directions, the tribesmen shielding themselves, though not without injuries. The tribesmen also saw blood splattered, their wives and kids nothing more than a gory mess underneath the cruel giant's boot. Enraged more than scared, the tribesmen all yelled and charged towards the foot, only for the boot to raise once more, making them fall back to avoid being crushed next. The masked boy grinned down at the village folk, finding their reaction funny. \"Heh, that felt good, but it'd feel better with my boot getting in the way!\" He took his boot off and carelessly threw it, not caring where it landed as he did the same with his other foot, his smelly feet making the warriors a bit nauseous. Not too deterred though and still feeling vengeful above all else, they yelled and charged to the bare foot, plunging their sharp spears into it. Unfortunately, their spears instead bounced off to the side, unable to pierce, much to their mixture of confusion, anger and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the other three, when his brother grew them both, he also made their skin more durable. Not enough to nullify their ability to feel everything they crush, (that'd make things boring for Jack-Jack), but enough to make sure no normal-sized weapons would hurt them. Dash just figured it was a side-effect from growing to colossal size and laughed in excitement. \"Awesome! I'm so big that you ants can't even hurt me with your tiny weapons!\" As the tribesmen started slightly trembling, their only means of offense having no effect, the blonde raised his foot over a group of them and brought it down. Those encased in the shadow of the stinky foot looked up with dilated eyes for a moment before shutting them with a hard expression, refusing to show any trace of fear in their final moments. Their last thoughts were of sorrow for being unable to avenge their families, before their vision went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash smirked and sighed in delight, feeling the puny humans pop underneath him and loving the feeling. \"Being big is the best~\" He glanced down and watched the tiny people's expressions. He was a bit surprised to see them not scared, but glancing at the carnage with solemn looks, before glaring defiantly at the giant boy. \"Oh, you guys are tough aren't you?\" His response came in the form of throw spears at his knees, not at all bothered by the futile attacks. \"Cool! That makes things more fun!\" Before he continued any further with his toying though, he felt a weird feeling coming from his lower region, his grin turning to a confused frown, looking down to see his bulge throbbing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the twins, he yelped in surprise at the sight, thinking something was wrong with his body. \"W-Why is it throbbing like that?\" He then glanced down at the remaining tribesmen with a scowl. \"This is your fault isn't it!?\" Said warriors were confused but didn't dwell on it for long and kept attacking for their fallen brethren, hoping something would take down this monster. That just made Dash mad and effortlessly shake off their attacks, crushing more of them underneath his foot. \"Stupid bugs...\" The boy then winced as it got worse and his breathing became a bit more heavy. An unknown feeling welled up in him and his cheeks turned a tint more pink. \"What's happening to me?...\" It didn't hurt by any means, but it just felt weird. He never experienced anything like this before in his life. \"Unh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to ignore it to the best of his abilities for now, the boy brought his attention back down to the villagers below. He was having fun crushing them and scaring them, but he knew that wasn't today's objective. That would be to get these worthless primates to worship him, something that didn't seem possible, but he was sure with enough dead bodies and broken homes, that would swiftly change. Seeing that some were now looking less sure of being able to take him on, Dash lifted his feet above some of them with a grin, as they prepared to attack once more. To their confusion though, he stopped a short distance from crushing them and smugly commanded them, \"Think you bugs know what'd I do next. If you don't wanna join your friends and families underneath my foot, rub my feet bugs! I might spare you if you do~\" The villagers hesitated, seemingly unable to completely understand what the giant was asking. As he began to scowl and set another example, he felt some of them start to rub and sighed in delight. \"Yeah...Just like that bugs~ Aaahhh~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsentmindedly, the boy began to close his eyes and imagine all of the fun he had so far at this size, and what more he'll have later. He loved being so big and in charge! So much so, that he was a bit shocked when he opened them and found his hands rubbing his bulge, his blush worsening in slight embarrassment at touching his dick like that. He didn't remove his hand though, finding the act very pleasing to him. Unsure of what was happening, yet abandoning any reserve since he started doing it already, the blond kept rubbing his clothed erection, moaning slightly and sighing, liking the new feeling and the villagers hands rubs pleasing his foot at the same time. \"T-This feels <i>so</i> good!\" Dash then realized something and grinned, scooping the worshipers at his feet in a flash. \"But it'd probably feel better if you guys rubbed it from inside!\" Not caring about any sort of protest, the boy opened his waistband and dumped them onto his dick, moaning a bit and flashing them a smirk. \"Now <b>rub</b>...\" He then let go of the waistband, trapping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Dash was sitting down, legs spread out and multiple homes crushed underneath his clothed rear, moaning even louder in pleasure. The tribesmen inside were squirming for freedom, desperately wanting to out of the musky, damp prison they were confined in, some pre-cum coating most of them by this point. \"I was right! This feels a lot better! Hah...Aaahhh~\" He resisted touching his bulge any further up until now just to see how good they'd do, but he wanted more pleasure and he wanted it now! Roughly grabbed his dick, making him pant harder as the tribesmen yelled from being squished from outside by his hand, he began rubbing it up and down like before, sighing blissfully as more pre-cum leaked out, (though it was hard to notice from outside due to his black uniform). \"I-I feel l-like I'm gonna pee! I r-really should stop, but-aaahhh! It feels too g-good to stop now! Yeeeaahhh!~ Mmmmm~\" He knew they were going through hell in there and he relished in it, as he got closer and closer until he finally reached his peak with a loud cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time his deluge inside his underwear stopped, his hands fell back to keep him sitting up, panting with a heavy blush on his face. He grimaced for a few moments at the wet sticky feeling all around his penis, but got over it and peaked inside with hazy curious eyes, glancing over his cum-caked worshipers, some dead and nothing more than red paste, while others were still alive.and feeling beyond humiliated, also well as frightened. They were also confused by the foreign substances and were wiping most of it off with much difficultly. Dash just kept looking curiously at his cum. \"W-What the heck? T-That's not pee...\" He shut the waistband once more, scratching his head in confusion at what he just did.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hiding his hands behind his back, Lucas's finger tips began sparking with energy, moving a few things around. Claus caught their attention by clear his throat. \"So, I was kinda thinking about something. You know how some people think there are aliens out there?\" Dash nodded while Jack-Jack tilted his head and garbled in confusion, not hearing anything about aliens evidently. \"I'm sure one of these dimensions we keep messing with has to have alien life somewhere out there. Maybe we could look for some after ruining this Earth~\" \"Oh yeah totally!\" The super baby pouted, not understanding what they were talking about, which Dash noticed and patted his head gently with a smile. \"I'll explain a bit more later Jack-Jack.\" \"Jack-Jack, I made this for you.\" The two supers turned to the blond psychic as he present a round snow globe with a somewhat intact city inside, filled with people shivering from the cold air around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack-Jack's eyes widened in curiosity. As he was handed the item, the boy began to shake it a bit, giggling at the way buildings fell and the people inside panicked being flung all over. Dash frowned in a twinge of jealously. \"Man, I want one of those for my room when I get back home, but no way I could hide it from my family.\" Both psychics temporarily had their mouths twitch from the painful memories, both glancing at one another briefly before nodding and looking back at the flecked blonde. \"Actually, we wanted to have a chat with you real quick in private...\" Looking confused, the boy shrugged and agreed, following them a good distance away from the baby, who was too distracted to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I see that you had a bit too much fun with your city.\" The boy hummed in confusion. \"It was a village, but what you do you mean I had 'too' much fun?\" \"Well you have a wet spot on your tights near your dick.\" That made the boy flush in embarrassment and weakly try to defend himself. \"S-So? I just had to go and didn't make it is all!\" Lucas grimaced at the thought. \"That's something your brother would do maybe, but we know that's not pee.\" Still embarrassed and not bothering for excuses now, the boy huffed and glanced away in frustration. \"...Fine. W-What would you know a-about it?\" \"Not much, but we did the same thing earlier so we know what you experienced.\" \"Huh?\" Not feeling as embarrassed by their admission, the boy turned and was surprised to see the faint blushes on their cheeks as well. \"W-Well after you left...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Some time explaining later...</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross! You had that dripping down your-\" \"Calm down, it wasn't cum. That was just vanilla ice cream I made drip down to fool you and your brother, or did you want Jack-Jack eating the stuff and possibly getting addicted to it?\" Dash grimaced at the thought and crossed his arms. \"Good point...Well thanks for stopping that from happening at least. Wait...\" The two psychics curiously tilted their heads as Dash got lost in deep thought before blushing and addressing his concern. \"What's stopping Jack-Jack from doing the same thing and eating his own?\" \"That's a valid concern honestly...\" Claus hummed and shook his head. \"I don't know about that. Lucas and myself are 13 years old along with Ness, and we only now just got erections. I guess you usually get it when you hit puberty.\" The blonde super frowned in uncertainty. \"Well, I'm 11 and didn't hit puberty so why can I do it?\" The blond psychic shrugged. \"My best guess is that there are some early bloomers and you're one of them.\" \"That or you're just real lucky 'Super-hero'~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash frowned and mumbled that he wasn't so much a super-hero right now, not that he wanted to be at the current moment anyway. He then thought a bit more about it and glanced towards his baby brother, who was still shaking the makeshift snow globe and giggling at the mess he caused for the screaming people inside doing it. \"Alright, but if that's the case...Jack-Jack might be one of those early bloomers as well, as much as I don't wanna think that about my baby brother...\" \"What do you mean? He's like 2 or something!\" Lucas however caught on to what Dash meant. \"No, Dash is right to be concerned. Jack-Jack isn't a normal baby to begin with, and he's a polymorph. We don't know what his current limits are.\" \"Yeah, like my parents didn't think of him getting his powers until he was 5. That's when my powers kicked in. My sister's powers kicked in even later at 7. And yet at just nearly 2 years old, Jack-Jack got his and we didn't even find out until a few months ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus took that in and nodded in agreement, before saying with a smirk, \"Well then, guess you gotta be a good big bro and make sure he never find out about masturbation or cum. Wouldn't want your parents finding out about it whenever you two go back home for the day now would we?~\" The 11-year old blanched at the thought, only imagining the horrors he'd be put through from his family if that happened and they found out, especially with everything else they've been doing up until now. The elder psychic laughed at his reaction as the super sent him a spiteful glare. \"Think its funny huh? Well if you don't help with that, I'll make sure to have Jack-Jack bring us back here one last time so I can give you hell and tell Jack-Jack to add to that...\" Remembering how Jack-Jack nearly caused their heads to explode earlier made both twins shudder and nod in agreement. \"Okay, fair point. We'll help make sure he doesn't find out.\" \"I was gonna help with that anyway...\" The blond super smirked in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to change topics, Lucas looked up to the stars and wondered out-loud, \"I've been thinking...What if there are other lifeforms out there?\" Dash tilted his head, not following why he asked that. \"What, like aliens?\" \"It's certainly possible. Our world had one in particular that nearly spelled the end of us twice. I doubt these worlds have lifeforms as powerful as that one, but it'd certainly be fun to mess with them.\" \"I don't know. From what I was lead to believe, aliens speak a language we can't even understand. What's the point in messing with things we can't even understand?\" The elder psychic smirked. \"You underestimate our abilities. We can just make it so they understand us and we understand them.\" Lucas nodded in agreement, adding with his own vicious smirk, \"Besides, all I care to hear is the universal language of fear and panic...\" Now imagining that, Dash hummed in arousal and nodded with a grin.\"Yeah, guess your right. So when we finish with this planet, we move on and see if we can find any others with life on them.\" \"Yup.\" \"Sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three then glanced at Jack-Jack, who just lost interest in the snow globe and tossed it aside into the ocean, crawling towards the three kids. His brother smiled then asked with a unsure look, \"So what do we do now? For some reason I feel a bit too tired to keep doing 'that' sort of thing to every city we come across.\" Jack-Jack tilted his head curiously as the psychic twins shrugged. \"Probably having to do with what we just talked about. Me and Luke feel the same way.\" The blond sent his brother an annoyed glance before nodding in agreement and thinking on what to do next...</span></div></div>",

I never got to play them until my parents finally let me play after defeating our  first villain as a family, Syndrome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus: Interesting, but no time to talk about that. I\u2019m up for it too, I never got a chance to be a kid, Damn Porky, so this will be fun I can tell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas: Great, but what about your little brother Dash?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash: I\u2019m sure he does not mind just watching, right Jack Jack?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack jack just nodded as he was interested to see what the older trio had in store.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas: Ok good. What sport should we play?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash:Hmm not sure, I\u2019m a fan of all sports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus: Due to my screwed up past, I don\u2019t remember what sports I used to play or even if I did do sports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas: How about Baseball? My friend Ness taught me how to play. He also uses a bat in the smash tournaments we fight in together, as well as Home Run contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash: Oh yeah! I love baseball! Also, any chance we\u2019ll get to meet this Ness of yours? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas: Sooner or later you will. Does anyone need the rules of baseball explained?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus: I do, I never got to enjoy my childhood like that so I don\u2019t know what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas: Ok it\u2019s simple, there\u2019s 4 aspects to baseball, pitching, batting, running, and fielding. However, since there\u2019s only 4 of us and only 3 are playing. We are just gonna have pitching and running. The pitcher throws a ball, which we could probably use my ice powers to turn part of this area we are in to a ball of ice, and the batter tries to hit the ball, if they miss it\u2019s called a strike, three strikes and your out! Do you get it Claus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus: Seems simple enough, let\u2019s get started. First we need a ball. Lucas mind doing the honors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas: Definitely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas used his PK Freeze ability to freeze part of the land they towered over into an icy ball, some humans were even caught in it. Lucas, Dash, and Claus grinned at the site. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas: Next, we can add bases if you want, these are things you run around on when you get a hit. Although I don\u2019t think we need it because only 3 are playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash: Fair enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas: Ok, who wants to bat first? Oh we also need a catcher to catch the call in case the batter misses a swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus: Why don\u2019t you bat Lucas, after all it was your idea, I could pitch, maybe work on my throwing strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash: I don\u2019t mind being the catcher, let\u2019s get started!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio got into position as Jack Jack watched with curiosity. Dash stepped up ready to bat with his branch  from smash brothers, due to his big size, the branch would have much more damage. Dash got in catching position. Claus got ready to pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus: Ok here we go, tie score, 2 outs, final round, can little Luke-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas: Shut up and throw the ice ball already! You\u2019re not the smash announcer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus: Tsk. Whatever you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus threw the balk and it hurled toward Lucas, Lucas pulled the back swing and.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas got a perfect hit. The ice ball of the city soared far far away, never to be seen again. It went without saying the people trapped were dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas: Yeah! That\u2019s what we call a home run! Who wants to bat next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus: I\u2019ll go, what are we gonna use as a ball though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash: I got this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash quickly ran around tearing the area up. He crushed some parts into ball form, he made some extra just in case. Dash enjoyed hearing the screams of those being attacked and killed by his power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash: There we go! All set. Here\u2019s a ball for you to pitch Lucas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas: Fine with me, ready Claus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus stepped up as Lucas was ready to pitch. He decided to use his sword to bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus: I\u2019m ready! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas threw the ball and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother home run!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus:Boom! Another home run! This is awesome! It feels good to have so much fun and power too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash: Guess I\u2019m next. Who\u2019s gonna pitch to me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus: I\u2019ll do it. Hope you\u2019re ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash: Oh, I am! Jack jack, could you make a bat for me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack jack happily obliged and made a bat that was just the right size for Dash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash: Thank you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus got ready to pitch another city- like ball. He put the ball in his cannon and decided to make it harder for dash to hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus: Think you can hit this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas: You know I can!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus: Ok, you asked for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus shot the ball out from his cannon, it soared toward dash at a shocking pace. Dash took a hard swing and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRACK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third home run!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash:Oh yeah told you I could hit it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaus:Whatever <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, after some more home runs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas: Guys, I\u2019m getting bored. Plus I lost track of the points. I don\u2019t even know who\u2019s winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash and Claus nodded in agreement as they too were getting bored. Jack jack was still his happy self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas: So what do you wanna do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 4 of them thought. Maybe go to a new place to have some fun, like competition of power or have a bite to eat, well maybe just dash and jack jack, since they needed food, unlike Claus and Lucas. Maybe dash could learn about Ness during their lunch break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decided on..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Surely he wanted to become a giant and destroy as much as he can, but he couldn\u2019t help but imagine himself being a plump looking kid at the same time.  He was particularly unsure about this at first, but took a while to realised of this and maybe this wasn\u2019t such a bad idea after all.  So he would tell his little brother and grants it to make it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, how about you make me grow into a giant fat kid?  I wanna see how it feels being so massively huge in this.\u201d  Dash wondered as he almost look a bit nervous but put on a brave face to give this a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Jack Jack giggles as much of it, and is able to use control to make it happen.  That\u2019s when Dash felt it coming again and had started to get bigger once again.  This time he wanted it for real, so his height can be shoot up more than being taller than the house he was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with his height, Dash\u2019s body begins to swell out, started to get fatter instantly in the process.  He felt his belly pushing out and he even gets his butt and thighs getting larger and wider as it happens.  His body was starting to get thick and and had developing some fat rolls, including moons, an added chin to his face and so forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bigger he gets, the more he gets so massively huge, and it proved to be so when Dash has his growth stopped, now standing at about 150 feet tall, whilst his weight is now in a obese state.  He looked around all over his body, and he even had a chance to give his blubber body a feel and wobbled as he moves every time it happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!  I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m looking good in this.  This is so cool!\u201d  Dash says with excitement, whilst his high pitched voice echoes around the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would never thought this could happen, but with Jack Jack\u2019s control, it made things possible and Dash couldn\u2019t wait to give this a shot and rampage as much as he can.

Ravi sighed, got up, and decided to have Tony send them up. The elevator opened, Ravi payed for the pills and collapsed back on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke: Finally, the pills are here *cough cough*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRavi: Yeah Thank the gods, *cough, sneeze*  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRavi couldn\u2019t read the suggested amount and neither could Luke, so they just decided to down the whole thing with their drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, they passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While every other boy he knew was in the middle of puberty,getting growth spurts, muscles, and hormones, he had yet to hit puberty, this left him shorter than most kids in his class, which made him a pretty easy target for bullying, even sometimes by his own siblings. These thoughts ran around Nicky's mind everyday which made him upset. He was always told that he would grow one day, but Nicky was getting sick of waiting and wanted to grow. In the middle of his game, Nicky decided to pause and say \"I wish I pull finally hit puberty and get a growth spurt\".

Since he was so engrossed in the reading, he didn't pay attention to his surroundings, but he usually did that when he read anyway. Little did he know, a rare bug was flying around his area, Ricky saw a lot of bugs fly around his house, so he just thought it was a normal bug, But Ricky was wrong, the bug was very rare and its bite injects its victim with a growth serum and takes its normal blood in the process, The chance of getting bit by thus bug was very rare, at least a 0.00000001% chance of getting bit,so if anybody got bit by this bug, which hasn't happened in centuries, they were lucky. Ricky didn't know that he would be the bugs lucky victim. The bug stalked its prey by landing on a leaf behind him, while on the leaf the bug layed a few eggs, so its offspring could grow future victims, strangely how ever, the bugs bite only effects pre-pubescent males. After the bug layed its eggs, which take a few hours to hatch, it chose to bite Ricky on his neck, the bug opened his mouth and sunk his teeth into Ricky's neck,strangely Ricky didn't notice anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds passed as the bug continued to bite Ricky, finally after 1 minute, the bug finished injecting Ricky with its venom as it flew away, but it didn't leave a mark,so if Ricky felt his neck for bumps he wouldn't feel anything.  Even though Ricky didn't want to, he reluctantly put his book down and decided to feel his neck, but of course he didn't feel anything. \"Hmm that's odd. I thought I felt something on my neck, oh well it's probably nothing\" Ricky said as he went back to reading. But it wasn't nothing, the bugs venom was slowly making its way through Ricky's bloodstream, but would slowly speed up. Ricky's body also felt a little warm, but he just thought he was warm because he was outside. A few hours later, as the eggs were beginning to hatch, the clouds began to gather, Ricky sighed as he knew that he had to go back inside, Ricky reluctantly got up and went inside, where his parents told him, that he and his brothers would be home alone until tomorrow morning, since they were going out and Dawn was going to be at a sleepover with her freinds. They trusted Ricky, which didn't surprised him, since he was a mature and well behaved kid, but his behavior would soon change to a mischievous type, since the bugs bite makes the victims personally mischievous, but so far Ricky felt nothing. Ricky said good bye to his parents and sisters, while his bothers were upstairs, since they said good bye earlier. As Ricky went inside his room, which he shared with his brothers, he didn't notice that the bugs offspring had made it through their window waiting,there were 2 bugs waiting to strike it the unsuspecting victims,Ricky's two brothers, Nicky and Dicky.</span></div></div>",

Kevin was sent to his room since his whole family are full of assholes and he just wished that they would disappear. \"Man my life sucks\" said kevin I wish my family would just disappear abd if i was bigger nobody would tell me what to do.  Early next morning Kevins asshole parents realized they over slept again. So,they piled and rushed out of the house to make to the airport for their flight to new york without realizing they forgot their son Kevin again. Kevin woke up and realized his family left him home alone again. \"Awesome\" said Kevin as he looked out the window and saw the snow l.\"I can do whatever I want since their in New york and im home in Chicago. Kevin partied for hours until it was dinner time and he was watching tv when a commercial came on about winning a free pizza. Just the thought of having a free pizza made Kevins stomach growl. \"Growl Rumble\" went kevins empty stomach. \"Man im hungry\" said Kevin, maybe I'll order the free pizza. Kevin called the number and got his free pizza,but realized there was no drink. Kevin looked in the fridge and found a cup of white liquid,thinking it was milk kevin took the drink out of the fridge and had his free pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Kevin didn't know, that the white liquid he drank wasn't milk it was a growth potion,which had crazy results on young boys, that makes things grow and he wasn't supposed to take more than one drop. Kevin finished his free pizza and went in the living room to watch tv when 20 minutes later he began to feel strange.</span></div></div>",

He then looked down and saw a huge hole in his pants exposing his underwear. Even though he was alone Kevin blushed slightly. \"How do that happened\"  said Kevin. Just then Kevin realized he grew. \"Wow\" said Kevin did I Just grow? Kevin then heard another rip and saw his pants completely shredded off as he hit 5 feet tall. Kevin,though surprised, was amazed. \"I just outgrew my pants and my shirt feels tight .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Kevin finished his sentence, Kevin started to grow agaon. His shirt tore off instantly leavin Kevin growing in a pair of underwear covering a huge package. Kevin the smiled as he was 10 feet tall and almost completely nude. \"This is awesome\"  Kevin.  \"Finally Im big\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kevins body started to expand once more his underwear, unable to hold on, ripped leaving Kevin nude at 15 feet tall and still growing. Kevins head went through the ceiling of the living room and eventually crashed through the roof of his house at 30 feet tall and stopped. \"Wow said Kevin a I'm huge\": Kevin got up as the rest of his house crashed down to rubble. Even thouit was 20 degrees snowing and Kevin was naked, Kevin wasn't cold due to huge body reflecting the cold. \"Awesome said Kevin im hge and Naked.\" Kevin's stomach then growled loudly as he was starving. \"Man im hungry\" said Kevin. Kevin then looks out to the neighborhood and grins evilly </span></div></div>",

I'm finally really HUGE! I'm standing over everything! If only Buzz could see me now! I bet he wouldn't think twice of mocking me or calling me twerp or short-crap now!\" Kevin thought as he pondered what exactly to do then looking over into the next door neighbor's yard he saw their pet bulldog who was constantly chasing after the neighborhood kids him included,he remembered how scared to death of that dog he was when first moving here and dreaded walking past the house ever since due to the dog would repeatedly try and chase after him snarling but now that he was a heck of a lot bigger and practically towered over the mean pooch like the Statue of Liberty......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time to give that mean dog a taste of his own medicine!\" Kevin thought to himself as he without much thought stepped over the ruins of his parents' house where the dog was busy barking at a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Brutus! Try snarling and chasing after me now!\" Kevin yelled stomping hard on the ground close to the mutt's doghouse the dog took one look at the gigantic blond boy and let out a startled yelp racing back into his house while Kevin grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serves you right.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what's going on out there? Who's scaring my dog?\" Cried the man who was the Mcallisters' next door neighbor though he was fairly friendly to Kevin's mom and dad,he had a disliking to the boy for some odd reason and Kevin wasn't too fond of him either since he often yelled at him to stay out of his yard and not to invoke Brutus whenever he was passing by to and from school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what Th....... What the hell is this? A giant foot?\" As the man stood back gasping at the sight of the gigantic ten year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ke-Kevin? Kevin McCallister? Is that you? How in the hell did you get so darn BIG?\" He choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been drinking my milk Mr. Wilson!\" As Kevin gave his iconic grin shrugging his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu...but you..you're freaking huge! Do your parents know you're like this? And..and Christ you're buck naked! I....I.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been mean to me for years Mr. Wilson,constantly getting your dog to chase after me even when I'm doing nothing wrong!\" Kevin said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well y..you're nothing but a whiny,complaining brat! It's any wonder how your parents can even stand you! And now you think just because you turned into some freakish giant that makes you any better than anyone else? You'll always be a whiny little brat Kevin and stop scaring my dog before I call the cops!!\" The man snapped as he started to head back into his house to telephone the police but Kevin having a sudden idea quickly reached down with one massive hand,the size of Mr. Wilson's SUV and with two fingers picked him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey...hey you stupid big brat! P..put me down this instant!!\" The man shrieked at the top of his lungs but Kevin ignored him and much to the man's surprise placed him on top of a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There Mr. Wilson...so you know how it felt for me to look up at bigger people like you and constantly be called twerp or shrimpy all the time! Have fun in that tree!\" Kevin grinned as he began taking his first real steps ignoring the man's cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the young gigantic 30 Foot blond boy slowly continued his walk,his footsteps caused the very ground to wobble and vibrate and crack in places while a few neighbors looked out of their houses to their utter shock and several drew back their curtains or screamed in fear at the massive ten year old,retreating back into their houses but he paid no mind instead thinking hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy am I hungry! And plus there's absolutely nothing to eat at home,nothing good anyway since Buzz and his friends ate up all the ice cream and drank all the soda but since I'm this gigantic I might as well have a little fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Kevin Mcallister left the tiny neighborhood and came to the outskirts of the Windy City with all its shiny buildings already he could witness the stalling and crashing of automobiles as drivers stared shockingly up at him on the highway and there were multiple roadblocks and a few accidents but so focused on his famished,starving state he barely paid no mind as he slowly headed into the direction of the city itself once there amid the numerous screaming,panicking people running in the streets Kevin lifted one huge foot and CRUSH!! Went some guy's shiny new car under his foot luckily he didn't even feel a thing due to his now thick layer of rhino skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This is fun. I'm starting to like this new size! But I better be careful not to try and hurt anyone.\" Kevin thought to himself feeling empowered as for the first time in his young life,he was large and in charge with no one not Buzz or his parents to tell him what to do or where to go as he slowly lifted another foot he brought a nearby mailbox under his right foot while grinning at the terrified citizens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry folks I have no intention of hurting you,unless you try and call me shortie or something...\" He announced \"I just want...HEY...that's exactly what I'm looking for....\" He said suddenly distracted by the sight of a nearby.....</span></div></div>",

What he expected it to be was a nerf fun, (because those really hurt), but he accidentally dropped it when he bumped into a scientist on the sidewalk the other day, who conveniently dropped his growth ray for his presentation today at work, and the two picked up the wrong guns, (they had very similar color schemes), While testing the gun, he gets startled by the sound of them breaking in sooner than expected, (already saw them checking out the house earlier that day), and accidentally shoots himself with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and Marc heard the noise, and they knew it was Kevin. \u201cCrap, it\u2019s that kid again, how did this family do it again?!\u201d Harry groaned, \u201cYeah, I may be a criminal, but where the hell are child services?\u201d Marv added. \u201cI think we should come back later, maybe a neighbor will notice he\u2019s home alone again?\u201d Marv: That\u2019s never gonna happen. Harry: Well if you have a better idea I\u2019d love to hear it! Marv: fine you\u2019re right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Both of them left and planned to return later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was knocked out by the ray and woke up a few minutes later, however he remained the same size. \u201cOw, what the hell happened? That definitely wasn\u2019t my nerf gun. Suddenly, he remembered the robbers!<br>\r\nKevin stood up and screamed: Come and get me you big horses ass! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he heard nothing, Kevin peeked outside the room he was in and realized he was still the only one there. It was silent. Kevin: Well it looks like I scared them off again! Suddenly, Kevin\u2019s began to rumble. \u201cDamn I\u2019m hungry.\u201d Kevin said. But it wasn\u2019t hunger, Kevin just let out a loud fart. *Kevin blushes*  \u201cOr maybe it was that bean burrito I had earlier. Kevin decided to just walk downstairs and watch tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unbeknownst to him, he shot himself with the growth ray and it was gonna make him grow huge!</span></div></div>",

Speaking of eat, while Dash was playing his game, he heard a loud grumbling and growling. \"What's that noise\"? Dash said, he looked down and saw that his stomach was growling, \"oh it looks like the old gut is hungry\" said Dash, \"Time to get some junk food\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash walked downstairs, very hungry, \"What kind of junk food should I eat\" said Dash, he then saw some nachos and dipping sauce, \"Oh yummy, I love nachos\" said Dash,\"but what am going drink\", Dash thought to himself. He opened the fridge and looked for something to drink, he then found a glass which was filled with a green liquid, Dash thought it was a normal drink, like soda. \"I love soda\" said Dash as he took it out of the fridge, \"especially when it makes me burp\", chuckled dash.  Dash took up the Nachos and drink to his room and snacked happily, dash even drank the drink to the last drop, \"bottoms up\" said Dash, he also <br>\r\nate all the nachos and was completely stuffed when he finished and let out a mighty belch. \"Yum that was so good\" Dash said, as he let out a second burp, \"Wow I'm super gassy today\", chuckled Dash.  He then let out a yawn, \"man I'm tired\" said dash, he decided to strip down and sleep in his black super suit underwear, since he was home alone, it was a hot day, and he sometimes enjoys sleeping in his undies, Dash layed in his bed and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat dash didn't know was that the drink he had was a growth potion, which was made by syndrome, when dash and his family foiled him, they took the drink as evidence, but his family also forgot what the drink was. The potion only effected pre-pubescent or young boys and there was no reversing its effects the way syndrome made it. The potion was making its way through his body, it was going to target his brain last, to change him into a super villan, which is mainly why syndrome made it, to make himself more evil. The potion would soon enter his blood stream and stomach, which is when the growth will start. Dash was of course completely unaware of what was going to happen.</span></div></div>",

He didn't mind this, but it bothers him that he's always told what to do because of him being short. Anyway back to the training. Jimmy was practicing his sword and arm skills, when he swung his sword with so much force that he lost grip from the sword and it went flying near some bushes, which were filled of closed flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw Nuts it landed in the bushes\", Jimmy complained. Jimmy walked over to get his sword from near the bush with the flowers.  As he began to reach over for his sword, the flowers suddenly opened out of nowhere and sprayed him with a sticky pollen. \"Aw gross, yucky pollen\", complained Jimmy. \"Oh well, at least it's normal pollen\" Jimmy said as he picked up his sword and walked back to the village, since he had to go back soon. While Jimmy thought the pollen that sprayed him was just normal pollen, he was wrong, so wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plant that sprayed him with the pollen was actually a rare plant, which pollen, makes its unfortunate victims increase in size, with no chance of stopping the growth or reversing it. The pollen strangely only affects pre-pubescent males. Jimmy, of course didn't know this. He was completely unaware of what was going to happen to him.</span></div></div>",

At first it was small, possibly an inch in height as he got inside the kingdom growing slightly all the while. Though he did feel an itchy sensation going from his hands to his feet, Jimmy quickly found a bench as the sensation was driving him crazy as he took off his boots and scratched his now barefeet and sighed in relief at the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot realizing that there was a few staring at him confused as to what he was doing.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dewey just got pounced by his brothers Malcom and Reese for the thousandth time. He was getting sick of it. \u201cGod, I\u2019m so sick of being pushed on by my stupid brothers, I wish I could just get revenge on them and teach them a lesson\u201d, Dewey complained! What made matters worse was that Hal and Lois were not in the house, they were having an anniversary vacation, leaving him with his brothers to beat him up. Dewey decided to get a snack to try and help him calm down and because his stomach was growling *gurgle growl grumble*,but he had to be careful because when you\u2019re the youngest youngest in a family full of boys, getting any sort of food is a challenge, lucky for Dewey, both of his brothers ditched him, Reese went out to look for chicks and Malcolm went to Stevie\u2019s. They told Dewey if he told his parents, they would beat him up. \u201cFinally, I can get a snack without my stupid brothers pounding and beating me up for it\u201d!, Dewey exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way to the fridge and opened it. Unfortunately, most of the food had either gone bad or was eaten and put back on the fridge by his stupid brothers. Dewey looked and soon found a plate of cookies and a can with a red label on it with words that said \u201cDO NOT DRINK THIS\u201d! There was no name so Dewey could not tell who\u2019s it was. Dewey than saw another set of words hat said. This drink will put the drinker above the clouds.\u201d Dewey ignored the label and took out the cookies and drink. He sat down on the couch and turned on the tv, so he could watch something while he ate his snack. Dewey opened the can and it let out a hissing noise. Dewey ignored it and decided to drink the liquid, while he ate the cookies. The drink really helped wash the cookies down, soon the dish of cookies was empty and so was the can of liquid. Dewey let out a very satisfied *BURP*! \u201cThat was good\u201d, Dewey said. Dewey picked up the can and was about to crush it until he saw another word  that was covered by dust, so Dewey blew of the dust and the word said Growth potion, cause some nonstop and irreversible growth. Dewey rubbed his eyes and punched himself to see if he was dreaming, nothing happens: \u201cOh my God, this is real, I drank a growth potion, I\u2019m gonna grow nonstop\u201d, Dewey shouted happily. Just then, Dewey felt strange, he began to inch upward. \u201cIt\u2019s working, I hope I get bigger then Malcom and Reese\u201d, Dewey said. Dewey\u2019s clothes were not growing with him, his pants weren\u2019t getting tighter and tighter and so was his shirt, soon Dewey was the same size as Reese.  Dewey wasn\u2019t upset though he knew the growth would happen again, it would just take time, the unstoppable part of the growth potion mean he would never stop growing and it did not have a limit on size. \u201cAwesome, I\u2019m bigger then Malcom and I\u2019m as tall as Reese\u201d, Dewey said. Dewey was left in only a pair of underwear, his pants and shirt had given up quickly. \u201cIt feels so good just being in my underwear\u201d, Dewey said. \u201cNow I can get revenge on my brothers\u201d, Dewey said with a revengeful voice. Dewey got up and stormed into his room which he shared with all of his brothers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, what to do first to get revenge on my terrible  brothers\u201d. \u201cI know I\u2019ll destroy their stuff\u201d, Dewey exclaimed. Since Dewey was bigger, destroying his brothers stuff was easy and fun too. This even turned him on a bit. Dewey destroyed things from Resses action figures to Malcom\u2019s school work! Then Dewey heard a knock on the door, his brothers were home. \u201cPerfect, now I can get revenge on them personally\u201d. But first Dewey decided to let out a smelly fart to stink up the room form the bean burrito he ate earlier. He decided to hide from his brothers in the closet  and spook them once he head the door open and his brother insulting him and turning on the tv on the living room. He went into his closet and waited for his brothers</span></div></div>",

He wanted to fight back, but he really couldn\u2019t. He was way shorter then Malcolm and Reese. While he was able to outsmart Reese really easily, since his brain was basically the size of a peanut and even able to outsmart Malcolm, who was a genius, a few times, he was never able to beat them in terms of size. \u201cI always get the short end of the stick and my dumb ass brothers get more then I do, I\u2019m stuck with their hand me downs!\u201d \u201cI wish I could just get back at them somehow!\u201d, Dewey raged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey squirt get over here!\u201d, Malcolm shouted. \u201cMake me moron!\u201d, Dewey retailed. \u201cGet over here or you\u2019re ass is getting pounded again!\u201d, Malcolm shouted. Dewey sighed and reluctantly got up and went to see what his brother wanted. \u201cWhat do you want?!\u201d, Dewey asked angrily. \u201cI want to test my new experiment on you\u201d, Malcolm replied. He shows Dewey a strange looking ray device. He told Dewey it was an intelligence ray to make people smarter, when really it was a growth ray, which was supposed to be used on plants, but Malcolm wanted to see its effects on humans, he didn\u2019t even consider the consequences, but in his family, consequences were rarely considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy the hell would I do this for free?! Give me money or no deal!\u201d Dewey said angrily.   \u201cFine I\u2019ll give you ten bucks!\u201d,said Malcolm. Malcolm gave the money to Dewey. \u201cAlright Deal, test away!\u201d  Dewey said. Malcolm fired up the device and began to make a shifting noise. What Malcolm didn\u2019t know was that the setting on the growth machine, was the highest setting, which meant whoever was shot would grow nonstop. He thought he put it on the lowest setting. The day then shot out a blue ray right into Dewey. Strangely, Dewey didn\u2019t feel anything. The outline of Dewey\u2019s body glowed blue for a second but it went away. The strong force from the machine after the blast forced the dial back down to the lowest setting, but Dewey was still shot with full power! \u201cWell how do you feel?\u201d Malcolm asked. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any different, you\u2019re experiment sucks Malcolm.\u201d, Dewey said. \u201cOh shut up squirt!\u201d Malcolm said. Malcolm got rid of machine before his crazy bitch of a mom and his idiotic bother got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Dewey went to bed earlier then usual, but not before being mocked by his brothers. Dewey just scoffed, since he really didn\u2019t give a shit anyway. As he went to bed he felt a warm feeling in his body, but he shook it off and went to sleep. Soon everyone in the house was fast asleep. Malcolm thought his machine was a failure, boy was he wrong! The only reason it didn\u2019t work right away was that it would take a while to start. So Dewey\u2019s growth spurts could go from slow to super fast and stay that way after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day....</span></div></div>",

Old food and drinks were still in the fridge, his mother was still stressed and yelling and screaming a lot and his father was still a goofball but just as bad of a parent as the mom. However, things would soon turn in the three boys favor. Hal and Lois had won a couples cruise and they felt like they really needed it, so they decided to put Malcolm in charge, even though he\u2019s just as troublesome as his brothers, his intelligence may keep the house from burning to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalcom, being left in charge, left Reese in dismay, he was older, yet his little brother was still in charge of him, he was planning to go outside and have some fun, since he figured his brother couldn\u2019t tell him what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hal and Lois, hopped in the car, said their goodbyes, and drove off. Malcom, Dewey had went inside to watch some TV, Reese was already planning to go out. Suddenly an interesting ad for a new video game came on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalcolm: Reese get over here!

What is it!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReese sat down with his brothers to see what the commotion was. It was a video game ad, for a game known as the giant fighters, which happened to be on the boys home console. It showed players fighting as giants and having a great time. It was also only 30 dollars! Reese seemed Interested<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalcom: Doesn\u2019t that look cool, guys I want to get that game!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDewey: Me too, looks fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReese: well I want it too, but where are we gonna get the money for it?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDewey: Hello, birthday money?!

You begin struggling against the taut Yoyo strings...they can't keep you down, nothing can, you will be free!!  Yaaaargh!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several moments of you blindly squirming in the Yoyos, Bridget becomes impatient.  \"Geez, well suit yourself.  I can't be moving you around in this condition though...\"  you watch as he takes out a weird vial, poison?!  You desperately continue with the futile squirming, making sure to clamp your mouth shut, no way he's going to make you swallow anything!  Bridget calmly uncorks it and splashes the contents over your face.  To your horror, you can feel it seeping into your skin, is this it?  You turn to look up at Bridget, whose squatting down and smiling calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me?  I-\" he cuts you short by putting a finger to his mouth and thouroughly shushing you.  You'd like to protest further but a tingling sensation moves through your body, and then a weird feeling, as if a weight you always had is suddenly seeping out, leaving you lighter and lighter.  But...those big green eyes above you are getting bigger and bigger!  Holy crap!  You're shrinking!  It's a little hard to get your mind around, but with everything crazy that's been going on it's not as unbelievable as it would be another day.  Bridgets massive smile is cut off as his huge hand eclipses you, and in a moment you feel the surprisingly soft skin of his fingers scooping you off the ground and forcing you into the fabric of his glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't have tried anything little guy, I'll give you something think about while we go.\"  you struggle to lift your neck up, and past his fingers you can see him give a quick wink, geez, is there ANYTHING discerning this guy from a girl?  Well, anything besides the obvious...your question will have to wait however, as you feel the fingers stretching outwards, you still completely trapped between them of course, and your back pressed firmly up against a hard, plastic surface.  Bridget hums to himself as he straps you to the thing with a thin string, that embarrassingly enough seems completely capable of holding you down.  He stands up a moment later, fully towering above you now.  \"Alright, let's go!\"  His arm moves gracefully, and you suddenly find yourself shot like a bullet away from him, WHUH?!  Half a second later, your spun around wildly, ohgodohgodohgod!  Then shot back next to Bridget's hand, only to be immedietely propelled away again, gaaaaah!  Then it hits you, your on one of his stupid Yo-Yos!  Damn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't sure just how long the trip to the police station is, your brain mercifully conked out on you for  part of the trip.  But soon you feel those deceptively soft hands grip onto you, and the Yo-Yo action cease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need kid?\" well, this is it, you're about to be taken God-knows-where for a crime you didn't commit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got Krozer, wanted for the murder of a government official!\" Bridget beams, you're jostled slightly by his heels hopping up and down excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, let's see here...no, no-one by that name is currently wanted, and no officials have been murdered recently.\"  ...SAVED, you're free!  The system DOES work sometimes!  God's light filters around you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?  Can you check again?!\"  After a few moments of confirming things with the attendent, Bridget sadly heads out of the station.  Fearing another Yo-Yo session, you quickly speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I get to go now right?\"  Bridget sighs and tears you from the Yo-Yo with a simple motion from his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry little guy, I don't think there's a cure.\"  ...SCREWED!  What does fate have against you?!  Darkness...darkness everywhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaat?!  I'm stuck like this forever??  What the hell man?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, just...nnngh, man my muscles are sore from today, I wish I could get more manly.\"  How can he so casually change the subject?!  Outrage!  But, there's not much you can do about it at this juncture...he was able to beat you when you were oh, 30 times bigger then you are now!  Suddenly, his eyes light up with a sparkle.  \"Oh I know!  Hey, you can help me out!\"</span></div></div>",

Or more specifically, the hand with you over the hand with the glass of protein-shake in it!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you think it couldnt be worse, he opens the hand with you in it and 'ACCIDENTLY' drops you in the glass!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oops!\" Bridget says with a cute little smile before lifting that glass up and over his open mouth!</span></div></div>",

I dont think so, shrimp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Slap!* \"OW!\" the very tip of the tongue smacked you upside the face, causing you to lose your grip... and slide near that very darkness just behind the soft reddish cavern with a uvula dangling above as to wave goodbye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GULP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd down you went! Squeezed down the esophagus as individual muscle along the walls pulsate and push you downwards to your last destination! So this was your fate. The very end of Max Krozer... your past will forever be a mystery... and youre not gonna have much of a future, either!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"aaaAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!\"<br>\r\n*SPLASH!* The ride ended with a huge splash of that milk you landed in. You lifted your head out and got a good look at your new home... A big rounded pinkish chamber about the size of your bedroom (you THINK). The walls are warm and feel like rubber. Not to mention, the groaning and churning sounds echo throughout the room and strange thick vapors emit into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelcome... to Bridget's belly. Your final resting place and the very first step to making the girly-man all pumped up and mooscular wit nutrients.. YOUR nutrients!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp!\" you could overhear him let out a dainty burp like a woman! What? He can even BELCH like a man, either?! \"Mmm! That little convict sure hit the spot!\" he smiled as he patted his belly in satisfaction, \"I can feel my muscles growing stronger, already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion: Does hearing that punk comment about you like that flatter you or just piss you off? ...What's that? It pisses you off?<br>\r\n\"YOU SICK FREAK!!!\" you scream out as you beat on the walls, \"I CANT BELIEVE YOU JUST DID THIS TO ME!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Hey Roger, I think I hear him in there!\" he tells his teddy-bear as he looks down at his stomach, \"Hey Max! How's it feel being a part of the sneakiest bounty hunter out there?\"<br>\r\n\"LET ME OUT!!\" you shout to him, \"LET... ME... OUTTA HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, little guy!\" Bridget told you kindly smugly, \"It's like Roger told me. Survival of the fittest. The big fish eats the little fish!\" What a bastard!<br>\r\n\"But this is CANNIBALISM!\" you cry out, \"It's barbaric! Inhumane! How could a human being do this to another human being?!\"<br>\r\nHe immediately snapped back at ya, \"I bet that's what that one government official said before you murdered him in cold blood, huh?!\" That was enough to shut you up. Is it true? Are you really a murderer? Sure, that cop said you werent a wanted man... but then again, you cant remember your past very well..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I... but I couldnt... I could never....\"<br>\r\n\"Aw save it, Mr. Krozer!\" Bridget stopped you in your tracks, \"You should be lucky youre getting off so easy. I read somewhere it takes several hours before digestion starts, so that'll be plenty of time to think about what you done before your 'execution'!\"<br>\r\nBut that's the thing! What did you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Who is that?\" just then, you overheard Bridget's question, \"that girl looks kinda suspicious...\" you assume he's looking out a window or something.<br>\r\n\"You think we should check it out, Roger? .....Hmm? ...Uh huh... ok, let's go!\" Wonderful... he's gonna go after another innocent bystander. Maybe sometime after he figures out he screwed up again, you wont be alone in this horrible chamber before the acid kicks in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.... exuuuuuseee me, ma'am,\" Bridget exclaimed in that high-pitched girly voice that fooled you the first time around but now just sickens you, \"Can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away kid, Im a little busy here.\" You overheard the woman's voice reply to Bridget in an uncaring tone... the voice did sound a little familiar, though.<br>\r\n\"What's that you got there, ma'am?\" Bridget asked her, continuing his deception, \"That looks nice! Can I play with it? PLEEEEAASSEE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF IT!\" the woman shouted back at him, \"It's not a toy! Dont you dare lay a finger on it!\"<br>\r\n...Now you're starting to remember to her! You can start to make out a memory of someone... someone with that same voice...</span></div></div>",

The two keybladers had been travelling via gummi ship for over five days, thanks to a wrong turn by Sora...they'd found themselves hopelessly lost within the void of space on the third day. After this happened, Riku took over the piloting duties and kept a lookout for any signs of worlds they could land on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say their food had started to run out and both boys stomachs were growling. The inside of the gummi ship currently stank of boy musk being emitted from both males having been cooped up in here for days on end. Sora finally started to wake up and gave a big yawn and stretched his stiff limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the deal, Riku?\" Sora asked, bright blue eyes looking over at his friend curiously. \"We're approaching a world...FINALLY.\" Riku sighed and relaxed back in the pilot seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! Is it one we've been to before?! Like Agrabah?\" Sora inquired and pressed his face up against the cockpit window like a child. \"Nah, it says it's...Lilliput.\" Riku read the name of the world on the cockpit computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a weird name!\" Sora frowned, \"I hope they've got food there!\" Sora and Riku's stomachs growled in unison, causing the silver haired Riku to blush slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buckle up...we're coming in for landing.\" Riku said as he placed the ship on auto pilot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colorful gummi ship descended into the strangely named world's atmosphere. Sora looked out the window and yelped: \"Gaaah!\" comically flopping over from his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?!\" Riku yelled, Sora's sudden yell had startled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riku....it's..us!\" Sora pointed out the window at a golden statue...two of them in fact who were currently staring lifelessly into the ship from their pedestals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the....okay that's weird.\" Riku said as he recognized himself and Sora's faces immortalized in solid gold. Not only were these statues enormous, but they appeared to be flanking an expansive city which stretched on for miles. The statues' mouths were pouring out a constant flow of water which flowed through the middle of the apparently ancient city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vessel's landing gear came down as the ship was guided down to a suitable landing pad. \"Finally! We can get outta here!\" Sora cheered as the doors opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku and Sora groaned as they stretched their stiff limbs out in the hot midday sun of this city. The place was ancient and seemingly deserted, in comparison to the golden statues towering high above which looked to have been kept in pristine condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoaaah! Is that a palace?\" Sora said as he pointed to a huge marble structure overlooking the city. As Riku and Sora walked through the streets, it was eerily quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaan...I was hoping there'd be food!\" Sora pouted and crossed his arms. Riku crossed his own sleeveless arms across his chest as they walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwellings they passed appeared to be kept up at least, and Riku swore he saw a tiny figure hurry out of sight when he looked through a window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rikuuuu!\" Sora's voice called from up ahead. Thinking his friend was in trouble, he rushed to where Sora was...only to find Sora staring at a large temple that was the only way to reach the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the temple itself that Sora was staring at in awe however....but ancient hieroglyphs which adorned the outside and inside walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay this is getting creepy...\" Riku muttered as he recognized himself and Sora on the walls. Entering through the arched entrance, Riku saw that candles were burning...meaning someone HAD to be here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large hieroglyph depiction of Riku was shown on the left side of the room, one of Sora on the right side. The drawings depicted Riku and Sora sitting atop thrones and being prayed to and served by miniature people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riku...are those tiny people...worshiping us?\" Sora asked, eyes wide with wonder.</span></div></div>",

Not to mention the various holes littering these ratty socks that gave a preview of the teen's cute, pudgy soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tinies cringed a bit at the overwhelming cheesy aroma that billowed off from Sora's big feet.

Riku had a secret stinky weapon of his own after all, and as he felt sweat trickle down his sides and the dampness under his arms...he relished the thought that these tiny people would worship such a sweaty and dank area...that was also notorious for being rancid back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would he always wear sleeveless clothing otherwise?</span></div></div>",

That tickles!\" He held his stomach in laughter, trying not to kick the ant-men across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ant-men couldn't help but smile at the innocent laughter and behavior of this titan of a boy. It was much more charming than the toxic cheesy smell that was flowing into their noses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku smirked and nodded at the foot servicing tinies, \"Told ya...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Sora calmed down, though he still gave slight giggles when the ant-men touched particularly sensitive parts of his plump feet. Given how strong the tinies were, they were able to give a giant like Sora very good foot massages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spikey haired kid leaned back in his throne and groaned in approval, \"Yeaah...I've never had a foot rub before! But I think I'm gonna have these a lot from now on!\" Sora flexed his bulbous toes in joy, what he was saying caused some of the tiny people to shudder at the thought of being ordered to rub these very <b><i>cheesy</i></b> feet regularly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku noticed how green some of the tinies' faces were and chuckled devilishly, deciding not to inform Sora that his feet were grossing some of their servants out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...about these rival tribes and cities....if they keep bothering you or being a threat...we'll just use that thing you mentioned to grow gigantic and teach them a lesson.\" Riku grinned smugly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You won't have to worry anymore!\" Sora declared brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine stomping around with those big feet of yours Sora! Wheww!\" Riku teasingly fanned the air and laughed.</span></div></div>",

He was surfing the internet, to find some fanart of his adventures. But then he stumbled across a rather strange section of the internet, where he found some interesting fanfictions. It was the Giantess/Shrinking section; in which almost all of them, he usually ended up shrunk and at the mercy of the princess, or she or one of the other women in his life grow to gigantic size, take over the world, and keep him as some sort of slave or pet or something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reading so many of these stories for hours, Link actually started to get pissed off. He was initially confused; he didn't believe that any of the girls he knew were as megalomaniacle or power hungry as they were written in these stories. Nor did they seem as horny. (Though maybe Ruto and Zelda did from time to time.) Was this what they were thinking all the time though? Maybe he didn't know them as well as he thought; and these stories were clouding his judgement. But I think what really irritated him, was that the stories seemed to imply that he would be so easily dominated; like the girls owned him or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that given the true situation, not only would he very easily be able to beat all of them, but he'd actually be the one to take over the world. He actually began to get the idea of getting a little pay-back. I mean, he spent all those years rescuing and protecting those girls, and this is how they repaid him? By pretending that he doesn't respect them just because they're women, and then treating him like he's some sort of play-thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink got up from his chair and left the computer. He went into the storage-supply closet where he'd kept a few souvenirs from his journeys. He opened a chest of things he'd collected from Termina. Inside was the Giant's Mask. It had been used in a few of the stories he'd read, so maybe it would work for him now. He took it outside; knowing it was a bad idea to wear it inside of an enclosed building. After all he didn't want smash up his own stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood outside with the mask. He figured that with his Triforce piece, he had the power to make the mask work anywhere, just like in one of the stories. He put the mask to his face. Already he could feel it's magic taking hold; he was starting to work! Before long, he shot up into the air, growing into a 100 foot giant. He looked down at himself in awe; he hadn't used this mask since he fought Twinmold. And he was just a boy back then. Now as a full-grown man, he was even taller. He smiled; now he would surely get some payback for the humiliations they enacted on him in those stories. Now he'd be the one in charge; not just of them, but all of Hyrule. But where should he start?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link stood, admiring his incredible, gigantic form, knowing that he was a veritable Hylian God now. He wondered what he should do first; should he take over Hyrule? Or should he go show off his new size to the girls? He decided the latter would be more fun and easier. He thought back to the stories and Zelda seemed to be the main focus in those ones; he figured that the best action would be to pay her a visit. So he turned around and moved through Hyrule Fields and headed for Castle Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thundering footsteps alerted the people of the market to his presence long before he arrived. He threw his leg over the gate and hopped over. He looked down, making careful considerations to not crush all the tiny people of the town. He wasn't a monster...yet.<br>\r\nThe people on the one hand didn't know what to make of him. He was a giant and quite imposing but they still recognized him as their hero. \"Don't mind me, folks,\" Link said carefully stepping over the fountain as he passed through the square. \"Just visiting the princess.\" As Link watched the little folk below trying not to panic at the mere sight of him, he couldn't help but be a little bit enthralled at the amount of power he had over them. And part of him began to notice how tasty they looked...A thought for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon made it to the castle. The guards seeing him began throwing their spears. But he simply blocked them with his shield. \"Guys...cmon, really?\" he asked. Seeing as how their weapons were ineffective, the soldiers panicked and ran away. Soon he was completely unabated as he approached the castle walls. \"Time to see my little Princess,\" Link said. He approached the tower where he knew her bedroom was. \"Oh Zelda,\" he called in a sing-songy fashion. \"I've got a BIG surprise for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink soon saw Zelda appear from her room and walk out onto her balcony. Her eyes widened and her jaw dropped when she saw him standing there as an incredible giant. The tower she was in only came up to his chest. She was completely awe-stricken at the sight of her Hero as a gigantic God before her. Link slid the giant's mask up onto his forehead, revealing his face. He smirked seeing her stunned like this. It must've been a few minutes before she finally said something.<br>\r\n\"Link...what have you done to yourself?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon,\" Link said with a laugh. \"I'm just trying it out.\" He then gave a 360 degree turn, presenting himself completely. \"What do you think of the new me, Princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink could see it in Zelda's eyes; she was trying hard to suppress the aroused feeling the mere sight of him was giving her. \"It's uh...well...it's quite the big surprise alright...But why did you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's the weirdest thing; I did some searching for our names on the Internet, and I found a particular group of the fanbase that did strange artwork and stories about us. They usually involved you growing into a giantess or shrunk me down, and you'd end up playing with me. They were...interesting to say the least. But what I found puzzling was that, in all of these stories, I never once got to play the Giant. I was always small and helpless; which was odd. You know I don't like being type-cast, right princess? But more than just that, was the helpless part. In my opinion, I'm clever enough, equipped enough, and resourceful enough, that if I were to ever find myself in a situation like that, I'd certainly be able to find my way out of it...Wouldn't you agree, Princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda didn't quite like where his tone was going, nor the way he raised his eyebrow on that last question. But she knew better than to try and make him angry. \"Well- yes, of course you could, Link. I mean, reality IS stranger than fiction right? You've clearly been able to outsmart and kill monsters much larger than you...So yes, I'd trust that in the situation you'd...be fully capable.\" She kept trying to make sure she said things that would please him. It was the first time she ever seemed sycophantic. Was she scared of Link right now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my position on the issue is; if the situation were reversed, I'd fair off a lot easier than you would,\" Link said. That gave Zelda pause for a second. \"I bet that you'd be the one who was completely helpless.\" Zelda was a bit worried; Link was feeling jilted over something that technically didn't even happen. What he said made sense, but she was hoping that he didn't become fully irrational. However, as Link pondered for a moment he looked down at Zelda and raised his eyebrow again. And then he smiled. \"Hehe I almost hadn't noticed how cute you are from this size, Zelda,\" Link said. Zelda got nervous. \"You're like a little Princess Doll.\" Before Zelda could react, Link's enormous hand appeared over the balcony and wrapped around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda yelped and struggled as Link's fingers gripped her. She began shaking when he lifted her off the floor and she wrapped her arms around his wrist. \"L-Link!\" she shouted. \"Put me down, immediately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon Princess,\" Link said with a chuckle. \"I just want a closer look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda began to calm down once Link had finally stopped lifting her. She peered over his fingers. \"It's just...I'm terrified of heights. Now put me down! I am your Princess; and I order you to put me DOWN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink raised his eyebrow again. \"See? This is exactly my point,\" Link said. \"You're...really not in any position to demand anything of me. Your royal authority is...speculative at best. The guards, who would ordinarily enforce your will, have all run away. Your castle is little more than a toy-house to me...And you are practically a talking doll...I think I'm the one who is complete control of this situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was now more worried than ever. Link was clearly becoming more enamored with his power, as he began to realize the complete control he had over her. He began to glare at her, in a rather dominating fashion. \"Link...why are you staring at me like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time that I showed you exactly who is in charge here, Princess,\" Link said, giving her a rather sinister grin. \"A lesson I don't think you'll forget any time soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was starting to get very afraid. \"What are you going to do?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink slowly uncurled his fingers to where Zelda rested on his open palm. Zelda thought about escaping, but she was too frightened to move. Suddenly Link's other hand appeared and reached for her. Zelda tried to crawl away only to be backed against Link's fingers. And suddenly Link seized the hem of her dress. With a sudden tug, he ripped the skirt away to reveal Zelda's white stockings, garter belt, and light pink lace panties.<br>\r\n\"LINK!\" she suddenly yelped at being exposed to him. But before she could protest further, his fingers returned, this time gripping her purple blouse, tearing it to shreds, revealing her matching bra. \"What on earth are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you won't be needing clothes anymore,\" Link said, with that smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda did not like the sound of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do to her?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
