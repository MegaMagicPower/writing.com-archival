Like all normal people, you waited for the trade paperback.   There's a brand-new storyline in this volume--one that seems to revolve around large amounts of eating and weight gain.  You know about this because several forumgoers who shall remain nameless have been whining to each other to buy it and scan it for weeks upon weeks now so that they won't have to hand over their own money to those sickeningly wealthy fat-cat comics publishers.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you don't mind the thought of the Marvel-Disney-LucasArts-Pixar-Chuck E. Cheese's-Summer's Eve-Boeing-Blackwater-Burt's Bees megaconglomerate owning a little more of the world, so you decide to buy it.

She was embarassed to admit it, but she was lost.  Who got lost in their own house?   Little kids, that's who.  Even if their house <i>was</i> an abandoned supervillain lair under the La Brea Tar Pits.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-take my hand and we'll make it I sweah-herr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made her feel a little bit better to sing the same goofy old song she used to sing with her parents on the karaoke machine.   It reminded her of better times, even thought it was a little weird to think that all that time, they'd been bad guys.  She kept forgetting and thinking that they'd turned bad one day.  It was hard to remember that they'd always been that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ohh-ho... livin'... on a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her voice quivering.   If she didn't find her way out of the tunnels soon, she was going to start crying, and then it would be even <i>more</i> embarrassing when they found her, but at this point, she almost didn't care.   She wanted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"pray--<i>ow!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever she'd tripped over bounced down the stone tunnel with a loud clang.  Molly ran after it, feeling ahead of herself.  Maybe it was a lantern.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her hands close around the metal.  There didn't seem to be an on switch.  She felt her way further down the hallway, and came--sweet relief!--to the bottom of a dimly light flight of stairs that led up to what she hoped was their living quarters.  She sat down to compose herself (she could <i>not</i> be sniffling like a baby when she got back to the others) and took a look at what she'd found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked a  little like a metal egg.  Molly could swear she'd seen something like it somewhere before.  She wondered if it opened; there was a seam running around it, but twisting didn't seem to do anything.  Neither did pulling.   She tried turning it a little harder--not <i>that</i> much harder, she could have sworn, just maybe as strong as ten or fifteen regular people--and the top of the egg pulled right off with a nasty sounding squeal of tearing metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops,\" Molly said, staring down at the broken egg.  A few sparks and a weak-looking dribble of smoke drifted up, and a wobbly arm popped out of the opening, folding out into a screen which flickered to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gert...\" said the woman on the screen.  Now Molly recognized what the egg reminded her off; the style looked a lot like Gert's parents' time machine.  And the woman on the screen was none other than Heroine, future leader of the Avengers... not to mention Gert's future self.    Even though she'd grown taller and slimmed down, and didn't dye her hair <i>quite</i> that bright of a purple any more, the resemblance was unmistakable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..is a messa...have to be quick...\" Heroine said.  The video was half static, and stuttered so badly, Molly could barely hear every other word, but the woman sounded frantic.  She much have sent the pod off in a hurry, Molly realized, because she'd obviously miscalculated the destination and the arrival time. Who knew how long it had been lying down in this dusty tunnel?   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm not even supposed to be send...ut-ut-ut I have to risk it, even if it is for my own personal gain.\"  Heroine smiled wearily.  \"Maybe there's too much of Mom and Dad in me after all.  You spend your life trying not... ecome your parents, and here I...at's one part of the future I guess you <i>can't </i>avoid.  Sorry kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face took on a more serious expression.  \"But there <i>is</i> something you need to do.  Soon after you receive...ou'll meet this boy, he thinks you're hot, you think he's hot, and it will seem innocent enough at first, but...\"  She bit her lip.  \"Just... don't make the same mistake I did.   I know, I know, outdated norms of monogamy and all that--and I still believe that, intellectually--but Chase doesn't.  And call him unenlightened all you want, but it won't matt...nd result is the same.  You'll lose him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked away.  \"And take it from me.  You'll never meet another guy you'll love as much.   Maybe I'm just maudlin because he's getting married and...inking about the past, I guess.   Wishing I hadn't made such a stupid mistake.\"  She turned to the camera.  \"What I'm saying is--we've got a good brain in this melon head of ours, kid.   I didn't think with it.  I hope you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a burst of nasty-smelling fumes, and the screen sparked again and went out.   Molly sat for a second, holding the broken egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's not </i>really<i> my fault</i>, she told herself. <i> I mean, if I hadn't tripped over it, it just woulda sat down here forever.  Gert wouldn't have known about it.   So what if I...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nif I...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. <i> Broke it.</i>  It was a message from Gert, <i>to</i> Gert, and her whole happiness might depend on it, and Molly had wrecked it.  What kind of terrible friend did something like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't tell Gert, that was for sure.   Just the thought of having to confess to something like that made her stomach sink.   But if she didn't... if she didn't, then Gert wouldn't get the warning, and when she met this mystery boy, which might be any day now, she would do the unthinkable: she would go on a date with him.  Maybe even <i>kiss </i>him!  And flush her relationship with Chase right down the drain in the process!   That was infinitely worse.  Molly <i>had</i> to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she couldn't.  Molly just couldn't bear the thought.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nMaybe...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beginning of an idea was forming in the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I can make it so this guy doesn't like her in the first place.</i>   There were lots of reasons guys might not like girls, after all.  The magazines at the supermarket talked about it all the time.  She had to look quick because her mom got mad if she saw Molly reading them, but she was pretty sure she had the gist.  And one of the things guys didn't like at all was when girls got fat.  That's why there were always a jillion diets in those magazines.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Molly realized with excitement and relief, if Gert got fat, this new guy (who she was sure would be a shallow jerk, I mean, it just stood to reason) wouldn't want to go out with her, and she would stay with Chase (who was the sort of super cool, nice guy who wouldn't care about a girl being fat 'cause he saw what was on the inside).   It was simple.  It was easy as pie.   And best of all, Molly wouldn't get in trouble for screwing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbed with stairs, filled with a new resolve.  Molly Hayes was a girl on a mission.  She had a friend to save, and there was only one way to do it.</span></div></div>",

Or at least a participant trophy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd already read everything in the Hostel except for some of Nico's parents' old grimoires, which had started moaning eerily as soon as she'd cracked the covers.  The place had no internet hookup, and Chase was busy tuning up the Frog.   <br>\r\nGert let her hand drop off the side of the recliner and stroked Old Lace's scaly forehead.  \"Bored, girl?  Yeah, me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeeey, Gert!\" Molly chirped, popping her head into the room.   \"Guess what I made?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGert raised an eyebrow.   \"It's not in the bathroom, is it?  Because I swear the last time my boyfriend asked me that, he was just showing off a giant--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not <i>poop!</i>  Ew!\"   Molly laughed.   \"I made you a special lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Is it a special occasion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, uh,\" Molly gulped, \"no occasion.   I just...thought you might be hungry.  So I made some stuff for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGert's eyes narrowed.  \"In my experience, random acts of kindness usually involve a guilty conscience.  Did you do something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Molly said hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you <i>sure?</i>\"  Gert asked.  \"Don't worry, I won't narc you out to Nico.   I just want to make sure everything's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's really fine!  Seriously!\"  Molly nodded.   \"I just... kinda wanted to practice cooking on my own.   I know how to use the stove and everything, so I don't see why I can't make other people so food once in a while without getting the third degree and stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.  Sorry.\"  Gert shook her head.  \"I guess I shouldn't second-guess you for wanting to pull your own weight.   And for thinking of me.\"  She squeezed Molly's hand.  \"You're actually a pretty sweet kid, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly felt a stab of guilt.   <i>It's for her own good,</i> she reminded herself.   <i>I gotta do this so she'll stay together with Chase!</i>   But as much as a part of her knew that, another part knew that Gert would <i>not</i> be happy about what Molly was planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she's buttered her bread, and now she was going to have to eat it... or rather, feed it to Gert.   She dashed off to the kitchen and returned with the lunch she'd made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGert blinked.  \"Uh, Molly?  Exactly how many people do you think I am?\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly set the TV tray across Gert's lap.   \"Is it too much?\" she asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, you have two hot dogs here,<i> and </i>chips, <i>and </i>a banana, <i>and</i> spaghetti, <i>and </i>a sandwich,<i>and</i> milk, <i>and</i> two pudding cups.   It's <i>way</i> too much, it's a big waste of food, and you know we don't have a lot of extra money--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you don't like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that I don't like it, it's that it won't keep, so unless I eat <i>all </i>of it...\"   Gert sighed, seeing Molly's stricken face.  \"Oh, forget it.  I guess it won't kill me to pig out once in a while.   Just don't expect me to do any ballet anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe,\" Molly grinned.   Phase 1 looked like a success.

I mean, I'm not saying she's not worth it, but our budget... anyway, she said flowers weren't, I don't know, sustainable or something?\"  He scratched his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about chocolate?\"  Molly said brightly.  \"Girls totally love getting chocolate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know <i>you</i> would,\" Chase laughed, \"but that's cause you're sugar crazy.  You just want me to get 'em so you can eat half of 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly shook her head.  \"Not this time.  I won't eat a single piece of Gert's candy, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admit it,\" Gert said, eyeing the heavy tray of breakfast.  \"You're trying to butter me up for something.\"   She tucked a paper towel into the collar of her slightly threadbare purple PJs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just being nice,\" Molly insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pouring me some Cheerios would be 'nice'.\" Gert observed, spearing a forkful of slightly-burnt-but-still-yummy pancake.  \"<i>You've</i> spent the last two days stuffing me senseless with goodies.  I can't figure out what your angle is, yet, but I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-there's no--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just better not be--mmph--better not be what I think it is, because we've discussed it and we definitely can not keep a pony down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that!\" Molly protested.  \"Old Lace is better than a pony, anyway!   I just want to do something nice for you, 'cause you're my friend.   Is that... is that really so hard to believe?\"  She started sniffling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly...\" Gert said, frowning.  \"You're right.  I'm really sorry.  I know you're a good kid.\"  She squeezed Molly's hand.  \"That's one of the things I really like about you.  No bullshit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no... what you said,\" Molly agreed, feeling horrible.  She was Gert's friend, and her she was plotting to fatten her up like a Thanksgiving turkey.

Cookies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\"  The little girl nodded happily.  \"Fresh from the oven and full of yummy goodness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGert let out a groan.   \"Molly.  Honey.  I'm already full of yummy goodness.  I'm so full of yummy goodness I'm about to rupture like a cheap beanbag chair.  The thought of any more yummy goodness is making me physically illness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted uncomfortably in the chair, bringing her hand to her mouth to stifle a belch.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's always room for cookies,\" Molly urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGert groaned again.  \"There's no more room for cookies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even one little itty bitty cookie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even one little itty bitty freaking cookie, no.\"   Gert put a hand on her belly.  \"Oh, god.  This is not a happy stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you can't be full already.\"  Molly reached down and smoothed the fabric of Gert's T-shirt around the curve at her middle.  \"Your tummy is barely sticking out.  I mean, it is, but not more than usual or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a cartoon character, okay?  Just because my stomach isn't the size of a beach ball doesn't mean I have room left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try a bite,\" Molly said, holding a cookie.  Gert knocked it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, cut it out!  I'm freaking <i>stuffed</i>, okay?  I don't <i>want </i>it!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly drew back, looking wounded.  \"But I--but I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer conscience, pushed into the back of her mind, emerged to knaw at her again.   <i>You call yourself a friend?</i>   But apparently Gert's conscience had had something to say as well, because the purple-haired girl sighed and pushed a few lanks strands out of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.  I didn't mean to snap at you.  I--maybe I could manage ONE cookie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\"  Molly dashed to the corner and picked up the cookie.   \"Five second rule!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was more than--glmmph,\" Gert said.  She chewed resignedly, then swallowed.   \"Okay.  All gone.  I--I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth in a jaw-cracking lawn, giving Molly a great view of the cookie crumbs.  \"Oh, man, am I sleepy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a nap!\" Molly suggested.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't... shouldn't go to sleep on such a full stomach...\" Gert said.  \"But...I don't think I'm gonna...be able to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed off, and her eyelids fluttered shut.  Molly set the plate of cookies down next to her.  \"A little snack for when you wake up,\" she whispered.  \"Night night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGert half-snored, half-snorted in one of those uncomfortable respiratory events that only really happen when  a girl's a little chubby and more than a little full.<br>\r\nMolly grinned guiltily.   Maybe it wouldn't be so hard to pull this off after all.   </span></div></div>",

Nico was getting a bit of a pot.   <br>\r\nShe smoothed the fabric of her T-shirt over the bulge, frowning as the black-and-red checkerboard pattern distorted as it pulled tight over her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffed in disgust, blowing a stray lock of dark hair away from her face.  <i>It's my own fault.  I've been totally snacked out the past few weeks.    And it's not like I didn't notice my wardrobe getting tight.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that hadn't been a big deal.  She'd always been thin; filling out a little wasn't so bad.   And she'd been under so much stress lately -- guiding the group, keeping them safe from villains, and well-meaning \"heroes\" who would be happy to toss them into foster homes, and, oh yeah, each other, which wasn't easy when everyone was arguing with each other and you were fighting off an attraction to more than one of them.   She needed a little therapy chocolate--or sometimes a lot of therapy chocolate--just to cope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the comfort food.  She had to admit, she'd been hitting the comfort food pretty hard.   And there was all that cheap candy Chase had lugged back after Halloween.   Like they needed candy, when Gert was already overweight and Karolina freaked out if she gained half a pound and Molly was a hyperactive fit waiting to happen.   It wasn't that Nico had <i>wanted</i> to stuff herself with all that sugar, but somebody had to get rid of it.  To keep the peace.   And, as usual, that someone was Nico.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nAnd here's what I get for all my trouble</i>, she sighed, patting her muffiny middle.   She needed to hit the gym, bad.   It was too bad she didn't have one of those super quick metabolisms, the way many of the more active supers had.  Unfortunately, her parents' only genetic bequest had been a slight tendency towards lactose intolerance and the ability to command the Staff of One.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Staff could do some pretty amazing things.  Maybe it could make her thin--no, she quickly amended, it was better to fix the problem at the source.  Maybe it could change her metabolism so she wouldn't have to worry about getting fat no matter how much she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly slashed her palm--it was getting scary how quickly and unflinchingly she could do that now--and felt the familiar power well within her.  \"When blood is shed,\" she intoned, \"let the Staff of One emerge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt slipped free from inside her easily enough--plenty of room in there, after all, she thought glumly--and she felt the burgeoning magical forces lapping against her hand.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Nico, you about done in there?\"  Chase called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--I'll be out in a second!\" Nico sputtered.  \"Hold on, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're waiting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she shot back through the door, \"sometimes it takes girls a little longer because we're not throwing on the first stinky rag we pick up off the floor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'We' meant all of us, fashion plate,\" she heard Gert say.  \"Me and my stinky rags want to get to Albertson's before someone else buys all the good sushi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>See?  They don't even respect your leadership,</i> said her self-doubt.  It was a nasty, knawing little voice.   <i>And who could ask for respect for such a little porker, anyway?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shut up</i>, she told the voice curtly, and tapped the Staff against her stomach.  \"<i>Skinny genes</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly she felt her pants, which weren't exactly loose to begin with, contract by at least two sizes.  It was like a sudden and unexpected hug from the captain of the football team, which Nico wouldn't have minded under normal circumstances but now was <i>not </i>the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genes!  G-E-N-E-S!\" she hissed at the Staff.  \"I swear, sometimes I think you're <i>trying</i> to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened a crack.  \"Nico?  Are you all right?\" Karolina asked with concern, peeking through the crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--sure!  I'm fine!  All ready to go!\" Nico stammered.  She glanced down at herself.  <i>Oh, God.  Muffin city.  There's no way she's not noticing this mess.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late now, though.  She'd just have to go shopping with everyone and hope she didn't split her pants on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
