All this is possible because of you, writers and readers. Thanks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning with story, there are the options:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrunk again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGTS again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo need of explanations but there will be the option of an encounter with the time traveler James jr. who will try to save Blake and make him believe that he is really his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames' story: This one will happen alternatively, if James never went on a time travel (or if it didn't work). He'd try to live his life stuck in his time and he would get shrunk by Blaze, and after he darkened his skin and hair, he'd leave him at his sad mom's mercy, who would mistake him for his dead father (and get the same treatment). He also could get shrunk by other causes and left with his girlfriend who could be aware or unaware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last one is a story where the reader can do almost anything with the characters, even adding of his/her own (if adds regularly). I'll just edit grammar if necesary. Please don't make too short chapters (I've written short ones but I still try my best)</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, his loving girlfriend Joana took good care of him in the mean time and with her help they got that weirdo named Blaze to get Blake to normal. He told him that it wouldn't be the last time they met and he expected Blake to have improved his skills. In fact, he did, being shrunk gave him a lot of new more challenges and made his body to adapt to the new situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake knew he'd fight Blaze again, and he should be prepared. Joana worried a lot about him and she wasn't too happy with Blake training harder every day for a year, preparing to fight an enemy who left him nearly dead. But, Blake had a kind of bad feeling about that and that was he would train for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was over and the bell rang. Blake was with Joana the whole day but he suddenly left and went outside the school. His instincts were taking him to his destiny. Then, in a quiet place, where there was anyone else, Blake stopped and kept standing, he seemed to be waiting for something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Last time you barely escaped, don't forget it\"- Blake said defiantly. Blaze fixed his shirt and smiled, he showed the glowing of his red eyes and they both dashed towards each other, the hits flew and the punches and kicks were as fast as thunderbolts, Then Blaze punched Blake's stomach, which he stopped and counter attacked with a knee hit, that left Blaze stunned for a moment, the hit was pretty powerful itself, and Blake had gotten way stronger than before because of the serum and the fact he trained a lot a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze said -\"Impressive, it seems this is gonna be interesting\"- And he ran toward Blake but half o a second before he did an awesome kick which sent Blake against a wall...

He recovered also quickly and when Blake tried to make a finish off blow, he moved and used his elbow to hit Blake's back, then threw him to th ground and when he tried to crush his head with his fot, Blake performed a never seen upward double kick, standing on his hands while Blaze was stunned. Which gave him enough time to stand properly. Blake cleaned off the blood in the left of his lower lip and smiled, this time things were fair, or that's what he thought</span></div></div>",

After a while, Blake was able to stand up, but very damaged and hurt, while Blaze had barely some scratches, and as he revealed the glowing of his red eyes, mostly hidden by his long white hair. Blake took several more hits but he also connected many more than he did last time.

Then, Blaze brushed the dust off his shirt and walked threatening to Blake, Blake tried to punch him but there was no use and he threw him to the ground. Then, Blaze laughed and said, after removing the blood from his lower lip -\"Now I'll enjoy this...too bad you won't, and to not let you die in peace, I'm telling you that your so beloved girlfriend will share your fate...is that cute isn't it? hehehe!!\"- Blaze laughed as he lifted Blake up for the last hit, and then, Blaze's eyes went white, and felt a tremendous hit in the back of his neck, he dismayed, releasing Blake.

In fact, the way Blake had fought Blaze was just amazing, James himself nor even with Kyle's help were able to keep up that long, and James seemed to be the strongest of they both (Kyle was near his level, but he had a bit more brute strenght and a bit less stamina)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought -'So Blaze was right, my father was a strong guy'- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he remembered about what Karina and Ayrton (they were always like family to him and were neighbors, but to James they were more like his uncle and aunt) had told him. That he was a though boy who had a difficult life, and he survived both by being strong and being smart enough to not die by hunger. His mother told him that Blake's mother, indeed his grandmother was a bitch who always hated him, and the only person in his family ever cared about him was his father, who also died sacrificing his life for his son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-'Isn't a bit weird two generations die the same way?'- James thought to himself and remembered that his name was a reminder of that painful past, he had both the name of his grandfather but also a silver chain his mom gave him long ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had writted with golden manuscript letters \"James\" but once he alone discovered that turning around the silver tag of the chain it had written \"Blake\", the letters were written in the silver when it was molten and probably this was because THIS chain was originally his father's...and making more remembrance he could retrieve from his mind that his mom told him that it was a love gift. She was always in love with Blake and also gave him that chain when he became 13 (September 15th, 2006)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames then got out of all the memories told to him about Blake and looked that he had already come to school, the same himself would study on the future and Blake did (Grandfather James also but nobody knew, he died with no one knowing about his life, or that seemed to be), James had lifted Blake up a few minute ago and realized the fight wasn't that far from school, then he looked at familiar faces, in the distance he could see young Ayrton, Karina and...Joana</span></div></div>",

Then a question came to her mind <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where have I heard that name before?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know how to tell this, but...I...I am not from this time...\"- Joana was surprised but she said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You won't go far if you want people to believe such ridiculous excuses\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's for REAL!!\"- James protested <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's why I knew this place, I study here, but about 20 years the future...in fact, I began to study secondary here at 2012, and if I were at my current time I'd be at your same grade, actually 12th, just last year before university...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way he said that and the look in his eyes told Joana that he was telling the truth, no matter how amazing or stupid could sound, her female intuition detected it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Assuming you're from the future, why the heck did you come here?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...it happens that, my father used to study at this school in his young days...\"- Joana said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You just came here to see how was the world at 2009?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No!\"- James yelled and added <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My father died two months before I was born, I never knew him, I was born on September 15th, 2010\"- This began to sound quite familiar to Joana, this guy never knew his father, and his birthday is on September 15th...just like...Blake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He died on a fight where my mother and the unborn me were in danger, and he could save us but at the cost of his own life...I was intended to change the past and save him from death, but time traveling is still a new concept and there is only one working machine developed by a neighbor who helps me always, she told me it could fail and, indeed, it did, I should have come to year 2010\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was again surprised by the story and then she said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you almost arrived, this is 2009...can't you go back and get the right time?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope...This machine will take more than a year to recharge due to the excessive amount of energy needed to break space-time\"- James showed his \"watch\" which also had functions as a true watch, indicating year, place (better than GPS), level of charge and how long it would be ready again, the green letters could be read on the watch's screen: \"TIME LEFT FOR NEXT TRAVEL: 1 year, 9 months, 14 days and 22 hours...\" A date which if was calculated would place James to September 14th, 2010, at 10:00 p.m<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana gasped and after checking the watch, she said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you can still meet your father...who was he anyways?\"- James gulped at that question and his mind began to form a logical explanation that could get him out of the predicament <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"T-that's information someone of your time should not know\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aww c'mon, It'd be interesting to see how much you resemble your father being both the same age\"- That comment warned James who hoped she didn't notice it yet <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It is just that...I'm not sure if I should...anyway probably my father at this time won't believe me and probably I would get in trouble if people finds out my procedence\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll keep your secret but just at least tell me who is your father\"- Curiosity was killing Joana, then...</span></div></div>",

He must've mistaken this...' James released from Joana's hug and in that precise moment, a very strong punch hit his face from the left and behind, this stunned him for a moment and he felt a lot of punches hitting his stomach and a kick which threw him to the ground, he got up and looked it was Blake, who looked at him with a fury never seen before. Joana screamed and grabbed Blake's left arm <br>\r\n-\"Please, Blake, stop it!! You don't know...\"- <br>\r\n-\"Shut up!!\"- Blake said firmly, this surprised her since he had never shouted at her, Blake released himself roughly from Joana and he dashed toward James, punching him in stomach again and sending him against the walls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You bastard...You deserve only death...\"- This scared Joana since he had never been intended to kill anyone, no matter how angry he got, Joana wanted to tell Blake but he shut her up angrily, and James told her with a gesture that she shouldn't. Then Blake lifted James up and hit him with even more fury, and threw him down to the floor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't have any business with me anymore\"- Blake said to Joana when she tried to stop the fight <br>\r\n-\"You can go with this guy you have shown to prefer...but that doesn't mean I'll forgive this damn bastard\"- <br>\r\nJoana gasped at that phrase and Blake kept punching James, he decided to fight back but it was no use, even wounded Blake overpowered him and he learned why he was able to keep up with Blaze for long. The fight was violent but not equal, Blake was way stronger even being damaged while James, due to he hadn't the same lifestyle, was weaker, and was never exposed to so much dangerous situations, nor being shrunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both hit, punched and kicked each other, then, after several powerful hits, Blake left James thrown on the ground, and...</span></div></div>",

Then he recalled some little details he didn't see at their moment, he remembered the weird watch, and...a chain...identical to his own, and remembered the gold letters \"James\" written in manuscript, he grabbed his silver tag and looked its other side. The same letters. <br>\r\n'Why that guy...? Why it seems that this guy tried to imitate me?' Blake then felt that there was something else 'Why that guy could leave Blaze unconscious with one hit...I fought him and he's in fact weaker...there must be a connection between they both...' Blake kept walking and more thoughts crossed his mind <br>\r\n'Could be him a clone of me? Why Blaze would make him to look different? Or, what if it was a failed one' After having seen Blaze's abilities it was possible to believe anything coming from him, and that meant clonation was a solid hypothesis to Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe almost arrived to his apartment (Blake left his father's house when he turned 18) and, unknwon ti him, he was seen previously by Ayrton and Karina who were on a date while they looked and there was Blake, walking, very damaged, and their first thought was why Joana didn't heal him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey followed him to their aparment, Karina being the one who kept distances knowing if they got too close Blake would detect the steps near him, they kept just to a distance enough to see where he goes.

SHE WENT WITH THAT JAMES GUY!!\"- There was an almost imperceptible attempt to cry that only Karina felt in his voice, as a tough one who always depended n himself, Blake had never cried since he had conscience (3 years old and onward). Blake's eyes became slightly red both by anger and sadness<br>\r\n-\"Maybe you're exaggerating, I don't think Joana would do such a thing\"- Ayrton said<br>\r\n-\"She didn't dump me, but she was cheating on me since who-know-when...when I woke up she was hugging him and said she wouldn't tell anyone\"- <br>\r\n-\"Damn it!!\"- Ayrton said<br>\r\n-\"You better don't do anything...I know you and I know you'd try something but since now I tell you I'll never return to her, nor forgive her ever... anyway it seems she's happy with that 'James'\"-<br>\r\nAyrton and Karina bowed down, they knew something like this would turn Blake completely insensitive (He was ALMOST but with such a wound he'd become totally cold) Karina once told Joana to not hurt him because it was hard to get Blake to expose some of his feelings and if that was hurt, he probably would become totally cold and insensitive. But Karina also believed in Joana, she had shown that she truly loved Blake and the fact she betrayed him was still strange<br>\r\n-\"Even if you're right, don't you think it's a little inconsistent that after years being in love with you she'd leave you like that?\"-<br>\r\n-\"People is always the same...I don't believe in anyone anymore...She lied, everyone lies...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n-\"But, what about that James guy? Didn't you say he may be with Blaze and cooperating for some of his plans?\"-<br>\r\n-\"In fact, he imitated some of my appearance, even my chain... next time you see him you'll notice that...But, also, even when he had something in mind, Joana still hadn't to betray me like that, whatever, I don't care about her anymore, if that guy or Blaze do something with her it won't be my problem\"-<br>\r\n-\"What if they brainwashed her?\"- Ayrton suggested<br>\r\n-\"I don't think so, she was fully conscious, and she even pretended to be innocent\"-<br>\r\n-\"What if Blaze's plan was attack you from inside, destroying heart first, and leaving you without any will to live and stuff?\"- Karina tried to restore Blake's faith on Joana<br>\r\n-\"Joana still cooperated with them, so, she's just another enemy else to me, if she tries to do something I'll treat her as any other enemy I'm used to fight\"- Blake sounded colder, as he had lost the human essence<br>\r\n-\"D-Do you mean...t-that you co-could attack her?\"- Karina now was afraid of whatever it happened, that sentence was too serious even for Blake. Ayrton was speechless. Blake crossed his arms and closed his eyes angrily<br>\r\n-\"If she ever tries to bait me or to find me in a vulnerable state, I'll defend myself, I might spare her since she is a girl but that won't make me forgive her ever\"-<br>\r\nKarina couldn't believe it...

To make him hate everyone?\"- The mysterious one said<br>\r\n-\"Exactly, if he still had someone to love and protect, he wouldn't understand me, this is better than I thought, maybe I won't even have to kill him if I get him to work for me as an assassin\"-<br>\r\n-\"Why did you bother? He's a human like everyone else\"- The mysterious one asked<br>\r\n-\"He's a human with potential... he has even enhanced himself after I shrank him the first time... and has the potential to be a great killer, I'm the only one stronger than him\"-<br>\r\n-\"What if he turns against you?

May I come in?\"- Joana said yes while sobbing and Karina entered, she saw that Joana had been crying for a long time and she hugged her, then she sat on the couch next to her <br>\r\n-\"Jo, what happened?\"- Before she answered, a male voice said <br>\r\n-\"It's not what you believe\"- And James showed up. Karina stood up angrily, now believing in Blake and said <br>\r\n-\"You said that the first time and we believed you!! So Blake was right...I'm sorry Joana but I have to kick this guy's ass\"- Karina did a guard stance and James was surprised, he didn't know Karina was a fighter like Blake in her young days, Joana screamed <br>\r\n-\"No! Stop it!!\"- <br>\r\n-\"But how could you...?!!\"- Karina couldn't believe it, and she decided to finish her question <br>\r\n-\"...How could you betray Blake after all this time!!? I thought he had misunderstood you but it seems you know more this guy than you should\"-<br>\r\nJoana, after hearing that, cried harder, now knowing that, effectively, Blake believed she abandoned him, she couldn't do anything else but cry. Not having an answer, Karina, furious, asked James<br>\r\n-\"And you!! What is your connection to Blaze?!! Why did you appear like that?!! and WHY DO YOU IMITATE BLAKE?!!\"-<br>\r\n-\"What?!\"- James was now confused<br>\r\n-\"Don't try to fool me boy, It's obvious you try to look like Blake, look at yourself!! Same look, same hairstyle, same silver chain, same tag. Man, I'm surprised you haven't dyed your hair black and worn black contact lens already!!\"-<br>\r\nJames sighed<br>\r\n-\"What ARE you up to?!! This is one of that Blaze guy's plans?!!\"-<br>\r\nJoana, who stopped crying for a moment, said<br>\r\n-\"He has nothing to do with Blaze\"-<br>\r\n-\"Why are you so sure Joana? And I'm still waiting your answer, why did you cheat on Blake after all this? I mean, he could have done the same as most guys do but he showed to be different, he kept being loyal to you, why did you hurt him like that?\"-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ayrton left the previous day because he went with his father to a business trip. The day elapsed and there was no trace of Blake, until Joana and Karina went for lunch and Joana looked trying to find him, she found him, away from most people and standing against a wall, looking at the sky, when Cinthya appeared.<br>\r\n-\"Hi Blake\"- Cinthya said in a false nice tone<br>\r\n-\"I'm not in the mood today, Cinthya\"- Blake said roughly<br>\r\n-\"Aww, are we angry today aren't we?\"-<br>\r\nBlake stood properly and began to walk away, however Cinthya stood in his way and said<br>\r\n-\"I already know what happened\"-<br>\r\nBlake felt like a dagger pierced through his chest but he grunted and said<br>\r\n-\"It's none of your business\"- and Cinthya hugged him Blake inmediately pushed her off<br>\r\n-\"Joana is just stupid...don't worry I'm not like that bitch\"- Cinthya said (None of them knew Joana was looking at them and could hear their conversation)<br>\r\n-\"As I said before, Cinthya, leave me alone, I'm not in the mood for your games today\"-<br>\r\n-\"I'll make you feel better\"- Cinthya insisted and kissed him on his cheek, Blake moved away and said<br>\r\n-\"I'm serious, you can't just come after something like this and expect me to be your...\"- Blake cut off himself when he connected his eyes with Joana's, he knew that she was watching what he was doing, and, with the anger raging inside him, and the desire of a revenge, he decided to act as he would never, and an evil smile formed in his face, He looked back to Cinthya and said<br>\r\n-\"Sorry, I was wrong, you've been right all the time\"- That comment left her puzzled and then Blake said<br>\r\n-\"I should've been with you instead since ever\"- Cinthya was shocked when Blake said that and asked her question<br>\r\n-\"So...are you saying you will go out with me?\"-<br>\r\n-\"I love you\"- Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Joana heard that she spitted out her soda and also Karina did, and the people who heard it made the O.O face while Cinthya's eyes were like little stars like when a little girl gets candy<br>\r\nCinthya immediately kissed and hugged him, she just couldn't believe it. Since a while ago Blake had analyzed her behavior and discovered that even when she was shrewd and kind of evil, when she was after him she was totally naive and was easy to fool. Anyway, Blake had already taken his decision. Cinthya pulled his arm and they left... There was a long silence. Everyone in school knew Blake was a loyal boyfriend to Joana and that he would never go out with Cinthya...now, it looked like the Armageddon was coming. That was far the weirdest thing ever seen by guys in school (In relationship aspect). There were rumors they had trouble but this confirmed it all, and it seemed to be serious since Blake never acted like that before.<br>\r\nKarina, James and Joana were silent, and Karina noticed Joana's face was blank, like she had seen a ghost<br>\r\n-\"I-I... I just...just can't believe what I just saw\"-<br>\r\n-\"Neither can I\"- Karina was also super shocked, way more than when she learned about James, this was just unbelievable, why would Blake do such a thing?<br>\r\n-\"It's just...impossible...how could he?\"- Joana's voice was faltering, then she bowed down, and tried to not cry<br>\r\nKarina grabbed her shoulder, but wasn't able to say anything<br>\r\nJames didn't know what to say or to do, he felt already bad since he messed up everything, and until that day he wasn't sure how much he had screwed it up.<br>\r\n-\"H-He really hates me, doesn't he?\"- And with that, Joana couldn't help but to cry inconsolably<br>\r\nKarina and James tried to comfort her and James mentally said himself he was a total idiot<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at an unknown place...<br>\r\n-\"This is way better than I thought!!\"- Blaze said<br>\r\n-\"Hmph...\"- The mysterious one said<br>\r\n-\"Hey!! Get me a big popcorn bowl and a big coke glass!!\"- Blaze said<br>\r\n-\"I'm not your slave, I just watch\"- The voice said<br>\r\n-\"You're boring!! I'll do it myself\"- Blaze replied and his hands flashed before there appeared a huge popcorn bowl and a gallon of coke glass.<br>\r\n-\"Why did you?!\"-<br>\r\n-\"I don't want to miss any of the movie\"-<br>\r\n-\"So, you find this fun...\"-<br>\r\n-\"Hell, yeah!! Isn't it?...To see how revenge makes humans to go evil and hurt others?...That's what I like of them, when you get one of them angry and you do something serious to him, he'll look for revenge, and that will fuel all of his actions from now on, but also, if the subject is a smart one, he can cool down and apply even worse methods of vengeance\"-<br>\r\n-\"Why do you complicate more the things?\"-<br>\r\n-\"Because I have nothing better to do, and now, shut up!! This is gonna be good!!\"-</span></div></div>",

Joana thought  'He had never done that with me... Even for a revenge that was too much...' and felt her heart breaking to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to not look at Joana but he smiled in an evil way, like saying -\"I can play this game too\"- She gasped slightly and she left, followed by that guy James and Karina 'It seems Karina sided by her even after what she did to me... I'd expect that, girls help each other even when they're wrong' He thought, and was interruoted when Cinthya said <br>\r\n-\"What are you thinking about?\"- Blake couldn't believe it but Cinthya had a cute touch when being so dumb<br>\r\n-\"It's nothing\"- Blake said <br>\r\n-\"You still want to be with Joana, don't you?\"- Blake was surprised by this one, and by Cinthya's sadness<br>\r\n-\"Of course not!! She's nothing to me. I was fooled by her... What we had was false, and she never loved me... And...somehow I didn't love her that much... It seemed to be too good, and, it turned out to be...\"- Blake said in a kind of painful way the last, and couldn't continue<br>\r\n-\"I know, that stupid girl didn't appreciate what she had...\"- Cinthya calling Joana stupid lingered in Blake's mind for a moment, but he said to himself 'It doesn't matter what she says about her anymore, and what others see it's not my business' He knew Cinthya would \"show him off\" to brag about her \"victory\" over Joana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he didn't know was that Joana heard the whole thing and tears began to run down her face, Karina was also in shock but she said:<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry, he doesn't really believe that. I know him, if he never cared about yu, he would have never risked his life to save you from all those bullies\"-<br>\r\n-\"He loved me before, but I'm sure he hates me now\"- Joana said between sobs and then cried. James remained silent 'Damn!!! This is soooo my fault!!!'<br>\r\n-\"All that you have to do is getting him back to your side\"- Karina said in a firm tone<br>\r\n-\"That's actually impossible, Cinthya will never give him up and Blake's feelings to me aren't best right now\"- Joana said sadly<br>\r\n-\"Cinthya never, listen to me, NEVER will love Blake as much as you do, NEVER. Nobody else has known Blake that much and loved him the way you do\"- Joana's cries stopped slightly<br>\r\n-\"But Blake doesn't know it, and he won't believe it neither\"-<br>\r\n-\"He knows. In fact, I feel that turning to Cinthya was a kind of suicidal revenge move. But I'm sure he knows how much you love him, but he's wounded deep in his heart also.\"-<br>\r\n-\"But why on Earth would he go right into Cinthya's arms?\"-<br>\r\n-\"I believe that he did that because he's assuming you cheated on him, and you'd kind of tolerate him being with almost any girl EXCEPT Cinthya, who is your rival and enemy\"-<br>\r\n-\"Then he hates me more than I thought\"- Joana said and bowed down<br>\r\n-\"Blake knows you love him, it's just that, you have to demonstrate it to him. You have to win his heart again, and you know you can\"-<br>\r\n-\"Cinthya's a cheerleader, and very popular, Blake has no reasons to leave her\"- Joana was still sad<br>\r\n-\"He has, the reason is that you love him the most, more than Cinthya and any girl you can think of, and in fact Cinthya's the one in disadvantage\"-<br>\r\n-\"What do you mean? She's got all a boy would want\"- Joana said<br>\r\n-\"Blake's not the type of guy who cares about popularity, and you're cute while having a better body than Cinthya. And although you aren't a cheerleader, you play volleyball in school's team\"- Joana blushed with those comments<br>\r\n-\"I... I'm not sure, can I get him to fall in love with me again? It took me 3 years the first time!!\"- Joana replied<br>\r\n-\"But now is different, he knows the truth and what you have to do is both demonstrate your love to him and seduce him\"-<br>\r\n-\"How do I do that?\"-<br>\r\n-\"You now have to show Blake you love him and you're better than Cinthya, including physically\"-<br>\r\n-\"Ok.

But that triggered Blake's more vengeful behavior, and he joined the school official soccer team. He became part of the team and enjoyed all the glory he had.

He worked his whole life and when became 18 got a department on his own. His mother never cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were almost on the other side of the dining hall (or dining room, cafeteria, whatever, the place in school where people eats their lunch). Joana decided to talk to him. She knew Karina was right, she was the only one who understood Blake ever, although Karina understands quite much of him way of thinking because of the long time she knew him, knowing him since they were 9, and fought him several times mistaking him by another bad guy, then realized why he fought. She also learned that Blake behaved coldly and calculating most of time. Karina also found strange that the only time he ever attacked her was the first day they met*. The next encounters Blake just blocked her blows and even once he let her hit him. And surprisingly Blake was the first one to appear when Karina fought tough guys (like the ones from 5th and 6th grade, who are 11 and 12 years old, against them, at 9).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana knew Blake was a noble boy, she met him first day of secondary, saving her, though he acted in a cold way (7th to 9th grade, so it's called in my native country though I know in other places High school goes roughly from 7th to 12th grade, here Secondary and Preparatory, which consists in the three years before University. In this story, Blake and Joana are in the last year before University, the year of graduation also). Joana felt something different when Blake was with her and realized she loved him, more when she could gain his confidence and could learn more about his past (Karina told Joana that it would be best to get Blake himself to tell his story, though some details or hints were given by Karina that Blake could love her back, despite he had a conflict with himself because of that). Now, even if Blake didn't admit it, he was hurt. And being with Cinthya was too shallow. Karina, Joana and their friends realized first, then Blake's friends. When he was with Cinthya, Blake had a cold look, unlike when he was with Joana, he had a more human look and a warmer personality. Joana was the only one who could soften Blake's tough and aggressive character.

Then, he grabbed him by the throat with a strong grip and began to squeeze it, choking him. Joana felt it was too much and ran toward them.

He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why not? It's not like I cared pretty much about Cinthya, so I can dump her whenever I want\"- And he was answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No. You're wrong\"- As a casual Blake appeared, with a blue shirt and blue jeans<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up. Anyway... what does Cinthya have to keep me with her? I'm popular now and I won't lose my status\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And what does Claire have to get you going out with her?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess she's sexier...I know her for longer, and she's the closest to...forget it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why is she sexier...who does she look like?...and who is she closest to...?\"- The serious one remained silent, as the other added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh wait!! I know it!! She's sexier because she looks like JOANA... and Claire is the closest you've ever known to HER...Why did I know? Easy, I am you...\"- The serious one <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That doesn't make sense, I know Claire for longer and then Joana would remind me of her\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you never felt like going out with her, and you did when you met Joana and after letting her melt some of your cold heart\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't even mention her, and shut the hell up!!\"- The serious one replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why can't you just go back with Joana?. You know you like her the most. You can't feel the same with Cinthya, and you won't with Claire\"- The casual one said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She's a bitch, and she dumped me for that James guy who besides everything is a cheap clone made by Blaze, what do you have against that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm...Well...she's no bitch, no matter what you say, you know she'll always help you no matter what, no matter how, because she's the only girl who truly loves you...and about that James guy...maybe you're right, you're the brains anyway*. But I'll tell you something, you people always repress us, the instincts. But guess what, maybe you know a lot of stuff and can think coldly, maybe too coldly...whatever, but I know about this stuff and you don't, you're blinded by anger and can't see you're hurting the one who loves you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Argh!! Shut up!! Why are you here anyway? Weren't you enclosed somewhere deep in my mind?\"- The serious seemed to feel headache<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana freed me long ago... I woke up slowly since the first romantic moments you had with her, though you were too naive to see what was going on, and when she kissed you at your 13th birthday, she broke my chains. That's why you've found happiness with her, as soon as I was freed you began to live truly, to feel. Before me you weren't even human, at least in the psychological sense, you just were a cold boy who never knew about love or warmth. You should remember that your father advised about it you and didn't want you to turn in what you were.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't talk about him!! And what can you know?! You're just the most primitive things that couldn't be wiped out of my head, you're just what a caveman would use to think with\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know I'm right. And without me you would never be happy. That's the mankind failure, using their reasoning so much makes them go away from the basic and most important things. Look, the smart people most of time ends up lonely, and empty. Unless they realize about the simplicity of life and learn to enjoy it. Hell, we even read it at History class\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay... but what about the clone? Joana knew it and joined Blaze\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sincerely, I don't think Joana's dating that guy, and even you know that after all we went through Joana wouldn't betray you like that by joining Blaze\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*NOTE: From this chapter on, I'll call the serious (Blake-looking) Reason (Blake's reason), and the casual one (Ordinary looking)  Instincts...</span></div></div>",

Her hair was naturally green and her eyes were aqua, she gestured a \"No\" with her head. Someone else was next to her. Unknown silhouette, but he seemed to be a young adult man. The woman said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is getting too messy isn't it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess\"- The other one said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure you still want to let them solve this stuff by themselves?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. They have several lessons to learn...Specially Blake who doesn't know how to manage his life anymore\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Losing his girlfriend was a very hard hit to his whole life, and his spirit is broken...\"- The young man stared at him, like 'You can't say', the woman, noticing this, replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey! Don't look at me as I didn't know about humans, Of course I do, don't forget where you came from.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay then\"- The young man interrupted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, whatever...I mean, he's in a difficult moment, and doesn't even believe in us pretty much\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He does. I've heard him and you too. He just thinks you're too busy with the whole world to center on him\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh! That's right. Sorry, I guess I was mistaking him by another one\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When I was down there I wasn't much of a prayer also\"- The young man said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you knew something\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have vague memories about my mother talking me about you in Spanish, but I don't remember much from those times\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well I can't blame him, he's had a difficult life, and in difference of most people, you stated that I should help him just is it was extremely necessary. Most of people receives my help way more often, though not all are thankful but, well, that's the humanity\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And he's grown stronger thanks to that. He still needs to be stronger, to defeat the Fallen One\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I agree with that. But, don't you think it's been too much for Blake? He's just a human, and is only 17. The flesh and bone have their limits, though you're right, he has the Power.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll tell you when will it be enough, and I'll act in consequence. But, remind me, why the Fallen is still alive?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because he made himself semi-mortal to avoid being judged in here, as you know, mortals are to be on Earth, and he took advantage of this\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you've killed lots of mortals a lot of times!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, but that was long ago, and I promised to one of them to not do it again\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, what's with him becoming semi-immortal?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He used an ancient spell, which would grant him a never-aging human body, granted with immortality at some degree, preventing him from being killed by me or anyone from here. He thought he'd rule on Earth with that but he didn't read the price to do so\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What was it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"First, he lost most of his power. Currently, he's at less than 20% of his total power, and I still doubt I could defeat him even here, he was almost as powerful as me, now...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wha-what?! You're kidding me!! Then there's no way to defeat him\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There is. One of the reasons that old spell was never used except by him is because the one who summons it can only be killed by a mortal, a mortal with the Power, and according to the ancient prophecies, it's Blake\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm fully aware of that, but then, why did you say 'now...'?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He was already the third most powerful, and with all those years at that body, it's like he trained using additional weight. The real danger is his full power\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you said he lost it due to the spell\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But there's one capable to break it. Omega 17, the real Fallen One, who was sealed way long ago. The actual Fallen One has been seeking for the necessary objects to break the seal and get back his full power, to destroy all of us.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's just horrible, but why is he after Blake and why did he even let him to get stronger?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake is the one with the power to destroy the Fallen One, but also, that power inside him can be used as a key, a key to open Omega 17's seal and the Gate to our world. As you've seen, Blake has a slight tendency towards rage, and that reveals a part of his power. You saw how he's gotten so furious that even when severely damaged, can take a lot of hits and not even react to the pain. He used for the first time fighting Alexander, second time against Ivan the bully and after that he encountered with the Fallen One. The Fallen One is also aware of this and all the current events related to Blake have as purpose to unleash his rage at its most, its final state, and use it to release Omega 17, his full power, and use him to fight us. If he unleashes Blake's rage he'll be able to control him by using the newly formed darkness in his soul\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake's not evil\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know, but the following events have been killing the few human part in his heart. He's almost as cold as you were\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake still needs to learn much things about life and love... still needs to get stronger, and most important, he needs Joana the most\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her voice was heard in there<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Please. I don't know who else to ask, but God, if you're there, please help me. I lost my boyfriend and I can't tell him why, he thinks I cheated on him and I didn't *cries* Please, help me to be with him again\"- Her voice echoed through the place<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is going too far. And as I told you, I'm holding back my hand from helping Blake, but this girl is really sad and deserves help, anyway, consider yourself lucky since not everyone can be here and listen to this\"- The woman said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just give me some more time\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I will, but try to fix this soon, that poor girl is suffering down there, and it's all human technology's fault, that boy messed up the time\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know, but, forgive him, he just came to save his father and prevent his mother to be heartbroken for life. Would you accept an innocent woman suffering her whole life until the day of her death?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess no\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If Blake had the technology he'd have done the same, but he wouldn't have grown as strong as he is actually. In my case, after knowing who was my father, I'm thankful to not have been raised by him\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Go, but don't exceed, and don't mess it up more than what already is. And with that I mean, don't make other people suffer. As long as you are aware of that, you can proceed at your discretion\"-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though Blake's instincts were still reluctant, they were weakened enough for Blake to ignore them. Blake felt now deeply confused, Claire was his second longest female friend and she had never been clear about her feelings for him, maybe Joana realized because she's also a girl and her intuition and women stuff, but Blake knew Joana most of times wanted just to kill her* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake decided it was going too far, first because he didn't want to screw up his friendship with Claire (After the years Joana learned to tolerate her as Blake convinced her that she was the only girl he loved, and Claire stopped provocating her because she saw how much effort put Blake to calm her, and Blake was still her friend) Second, he'd find really difficult to end his relationship with her, and didn't feel like he could break her heart like that. Third, most deeply and though he would deny it, it was because he knew by his instinctive part that he'd end up with Joana again. Blake has to take a decision<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*(And they have had already several catfights, where either Blake, Karina or one of the guys had to stop it before it gets worse, and even when Claire doesn't practice any sport, she could still put up a fight, and Joana when angry can be VERY VERY violent, believe me...she's even tackled Claire, and though for most people something seems to be sexy in two girls fighting, Joana in angry state can be scary, as any angry girl, Claire also is scary, and Karina...er wait...no, Karina's not scary, let me remember...oh yeah, she is also...I come to the conclusion that 99.999% of girls are scary when angry. Lesson for life: Don't anger a woman, unless it's too old to run after you and isn't DRIVING. XD)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[SECOND NOTE: Originally, Claire was going to be new Blake's girlfriend because she's the closest looking and acting to Joana, but the fact of their friendship has prevented Blake from doing so. And Blake wouldn't be in peace with himself knowing he had screwed up a long relationship, despite being a tough guy, he appreciates the few friends he has. So, the main story will be taken to Blake keeping his false relationship with Cinthya, as he knew he didn't love her and after so much time and the tortures she subjected him to, he had no good feelings for her, I don't mean it's right, but that's the way Blake would act. And, by the way, Blake's decision doesn't mean Claire would stop wanting him for herself, maybe to the point that her friendship becomes as bad as Cinthya's torture when Blake was shrunk]</span></div></div>",

I can't believe that after so many adventures, so much time, so many fights against bullies and thieves, after what we've passed, and they sided against me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aw, c'mon!

She hugged him tightly and whispered to his ear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I won't, I'll stay at your side no matter what, no matter if everyone else has left you\"- Blake felt strange, it was an unknown feeling for him, well, almost, it was a very warm feeling that he felt when he was with Joana, but after the long time he hasn't been with her, he had already forgotten how it felt, but at the same time, it felt different, it felt like that but it had a different touch, Blake couldn't really tell how, but maybe it was because a friend's love would be more sincere and pure than ordinary love, and even more knowing that Claire already knew Blake wouldn't go out with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt guilty because he didn't act as he appreciated Claire as much as she deserved, and now that he needed someone the most, she was there. He also felt thankful for having her as a friend, and thanked the day he met her, not knowing until now the real value of their friendship. Or that's what he thought...</span></div></div>",

He decided to talk with his father, though he seemed to hate him. James tried to understand his situation 'Well...if a guy took away my girlfriend from me...I guess I'd hate him also...but I didn't!! He thinks I did...' James thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to encounter with Blake and fix all things at once. He felt that it was necessary, and Joana's crying hadn't ceased since Blake said he hadn't feelings for her anymore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...James walked in the streets, at night, thinking about what to do. He sighted Blake in the distance, and walked toward him. Blake was sitting alone in the park, looking down, at the fountain, with his eyes lost in his thoughts. Suddenly, Blake felt someone touching his shoulder, and quickly got up, turning around to see James<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you I wouldn't spare you next time!!\"- Blake said, angry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Listen to me!! This has to end once for all...\"- Blake interrupted at that right moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's was what I was thinking\"- And punched him in the face, James shook his head and looked at Blake, he was already in fighting stance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've wanted to kick your damn ass since you first appeared!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Background Music: System of a Down - B.Y.O.B</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake dashed and punched James again, this time connecting several punches in his stomach, chest and chin. Blake ended the combo with a kick and as soon as James fell to the ground Blake began to kick his ribs, and lifted him up, grabbing him by his jacket's collar. James kicked him and got up, and tried to speak again, but Blake hit him in stomach and hit him with his knee. Each punch and kick Blake connected was given with all his anger and desire for revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames punched him too but Blake was getting the upper hand in the whole fight. They both moved at an amazing speed and the kicks and punches clashed against each other. Blake noticed that his enemy's fighting style was somewhat like his own, but it was underdeveloped, and lacked both strength and skill. After kicking him, sending him away, Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least Blaze should have made a better clone...You're worthless to fight, and worthless at all...\"- James rose an eyebrow when heard him mentioning Blaze, and calling him a clone. He had no time to think and got up, he decided to fight Blake if that was necessary to knock him out and bring him to Joana. James put up a good fight though he couldn't damage Blake that much. James could connect good combos to Blake and after sending him against walls and the ground, he got to deal descent damage to him. Blake got up and spat out blood. Then, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe you're not that bad...\"- Blake wiped off the blood of his face and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll fight you to death\"- James couldn't believe he still wanted to fight to death<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a moment, a voice said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Awww...I wanted to fight YOU to death...\"- A white haired boy appeared, with red eyes...Blake muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blaze...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Long time no see you old pal, huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So you've come to finish the job...\"- Blaze nodded in agreement and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's right. My clone wasn't good enough\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I KNEW IT!!!\"- Blake shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the...?!! I'm not working for him!!\"- James exclaimed, and Blaze, mocking, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't have to lie anymore. Blake's smart...he knew from the beginning that I sent out a clone to destroy him by where it would hurt the most...his heart...\"- Blake growled in anger and clenched his fists, and dashed toward Blaze, who dodged him and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Eager already?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You bastard!!

Blake took that moment as an advantage and pummeled James with violent punches and kicks, most of them now were aimed at his ribs, until James spat out blood and fell down, still conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake walked toward him and grabbed him by the neck, he began to strangle him,  but released him to block a Blaze's punch, as Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"One down...one left to go...\"- Blaze smiled evilly, and engaged in fight with Blake again, this time Blake barely matched him, though he was already battered by his battle against James. Blake used several combos and mid air attacks to deal some damage to Blaze, but when he connected a kick to his stomach, Blaze grabbed his leg and punched him in stomach several times, then threw him away. He walked toward him and James tried to stop him, Blaze hit James with his elbow in stomach and he fell down, next to Blake. He aimed his hands at the unconscious guys, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now, what I came for...\"- Before doing anything else, a golden light illuminated the place and Blaze felt a sudden pain. A male voice said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Enough. I won't let you to get them...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Argh!! You...\"- Blaze shot a beam at them from his hands, then left, mumbling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It doesn't matter, Blake's not ready yet...\"-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake slowly woke up, just to find everything huge. He already knew that feeling, then, he heard James groaning in pain, he was next to him... shrunk as well... Blake didn't even wait for him to fully wake up, as he kicked his right side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You bastard!!\"- Blake then started to punch him in the face. James kicked him in the stomach and got up. He was limping, and quite damaged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I knew you were one of Blaze's lackeys!! You weakened me so Blaze shrunk me to die!!\"- Blake shouted, then charged at him and punched James in his already broken ribs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"T...then how come I'm shrunk too?\"- James asked with difficulty, spitting out bits of blood<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because you are a disposable cheap clone... You were wrong if you thought Blaze would cheer you for ruining my life\"- Blake said, and didn't notice that his last three words affected James<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn... I knew I messed up everything He thought, and he snapped out of his thoughts when Blake punched him more, but he stopped when they heard thunders, then , it started to rain. The sound was even stronger for them, and soon started to rain. Blake left him on the ground and walked away. James was struggling to get up, and when the water drops started to drop, he was kept on the ground, each drop felt like a punch on him. After some tries James gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had walked away little distance, due to their size, but his conscience was annoying him. For a single moment, Blake felt pity for James... Being born to obey someone... then he betrays you... Blake shook those thoughts off his mind. The name James just made things worse... being the name of Blake's father<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake turned around and saw that James gave up, and was awaiting death. Blake sighed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll hate myself for this...\"- He walked toward James, who looked at him blankly, expecting a finishing blow... a less sinister ending to his life than dying stepped on by someone. But, much to his surprise, Blake picked him up and carried him on his back. Almost reading his mind, Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know why am I doing this, so, shut up and don't push your luck\"- James smiled, for the first time in his life, he felt different, he almost knew what a father would be like. And this also told him that his father wasn't a bad guy after all. He wanted to say many things, he wanted to apologize, to tell him who he really is... But he knew he wouldn't be able to, so, he took Blake's word, and shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Joana's department (formerly, both hers and Blake's, but he left...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana had taken a bath to try to relax a bit, though her sadness couldn't be helped. She dressed in her room, cooked and called James for dinner. She got no answer and called a second time. She went to his room (A second room in the department, rarely used as a guest room, since Blake used to sleep with her... Now used by James) and found a note<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. I don't want you to cry anymore. In my time, you were just as heartbroken as here. I can't stand being the responsible for this. I'll fix everything once for all. I'm going to find my father, and bring him to you, by any means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana got very worried, and noticed that below in the sheet, it said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry mom. But I might need to fight him... If I don't come back, don't ask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana already knew what Blake thought of James, and that he said he wouldn't spare him a second time, she didn't even get a raincoat, but before she rushed out of her house, a light ball appeared before her. It spoke with a male voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll tell you where are Blake and James, but walk carefully. They were shrunk by Blaze...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blaze? Oh no!!\"- Joana said, knowing that it became much worse, she imagined that Blake engaged James in a fight, and after both got badly beaten, Blaze would appear to deliver the finishing blow. After a few blocks, she encountered with Karina, who had also been told by a mysterious golden light ball, said ball appeared before both of them, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They are at the park, shrunk to 1 inch\"- And it flew before the girls, guiding them, and preventing them from stepping on the guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Blake and James...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake got shelter below a marble bench. he placed James on the ground and stared at the rain outside. Then he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe I didn't judge you well... Maybe you don't understand what's good and what's evil...*sigh* If Blaze made you for this, I guess you had prety much no other choice than to do as he says...\"- James knew he shouldn't push much his luck, and simply smiled. Joana's worry about the last of Blake's heart had died had been proven wrong. Maybe his inner instincts were making him to act like this, unconsciously telling him not to kill that guy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sleep. Your wounds will heal a bit quicker. I'll stand guard for insects or anything dangerous...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You... you're wounded too...\"- James said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can take it. I'm used to fight. Everything has been against me since my birth...\"- This surprised James, he knew nothing about his father's past<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You must know... Blaze surely put my memories in you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He didn't...\"- James said, selecting carefully his words because if he insisted once more that he wasn't on Blaze's side maybe Blake would kill him for real<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ever since my birth, the world wants me dead... that's all you have to know...\"- Blake said, James gulped but decided to push his luck a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not everyone...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My friends abandoned me. All of them sided by YOU and that treacherous bitch...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She doesn't hate you... she's sad...\"- James answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It doesn't matter anymore, it's past history... as soon as I get to unshrink us, I'll leave. I'll start from scratch somewhere else...\"- Blake said, still, staring at the rain<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't like Blake's tone. He sounded like giving up, like recongnizing that Joana didn't want him anymore. Like recognizing James' victory over him. But their thoughts were interrupted when they heard and felt small quakes, Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Darn it!! Footsteps!! Who in the Earth would go to the park at this hour while raining?!!\"- Blake asked nobody in particular angrily, he picked up James and ran outside just to find himself before his now gigantic ex-girlfriend, and his former friend. They were looking down at them. Blake felt like a dagger stabbed him in the lungs, and threw James down violently, smashing his back against the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You spineless rat!! So, this was the plan?!! Delivering me?!! You're even worse than Blaze... I knew I shouldn't have spared your pitiful life!!\"- Blake started to punch him, but a golden light ball floated in front of him, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stop it. James did nothing. I brought them\"- Blake shouted in anger and clenched his fists<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, if what you want is to punch me, ok then...\"- The light ball said and changed its shape to an adult man in his early 30's (or late 20's). The man had a scar in the left eye, dark skin, black hair... and an unmistakable  brown leather jacket. Blake fell to his knees</span></div></div>",

Giving me to that unfaithful whore?!\"- Blake was still very angry, and Joana almost cried when heard Blake calling her like that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, watch your words. This girl has never cheated on you...\"- James said more seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh Really?!! Oh, I forgot about the new tendencies... how is it called?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"- James got slightly angry at Blake's sarcasm, and Blake added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When I was unconscious, she was with THIS rat!!\"- Blake punched James jr. in the stomach and kicked him, knocking him backwards -\"How can you say that's not cheating?! I was unconscious and she was with another guy?!!

I'm with Cinthya anyway...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Seriously, can you call that a relationship?!! The only thing she does is brag about you being her boyfriend, take you into the 'popular' people and hurt Joana whenever she can... And I've seen you... you don't like her, you don't like anything about that 'relationship'. you only did that as a desperate attempt to get vengeance...\"- James said, Joana was slightly relieved that Blake was not really liking that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There are other girls I can be with...\"- Blake replied, and James denied in disappointment <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"None of them truly loves you, none of them would suffer as Joana does...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I meant nothing to her...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You will learn...\"- James aimed his hand at him, and glowed in golden light. Blake was knocked unconscious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You better take him to your house before he wakes up...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"B... but... he'll escape...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He won't. The spell I placed on him will electrify whenever he goes more than 10 feet away from you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Isn't that a bit... cruel?\"- Karina wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm doing this for his own good. I haven't done many things as a father, but I can't let him ruin his life like this...\"- James said, and disappeared, vanishing into thin air. Joana and Karina heard his voice before he left<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana, you take care of Blake. He needs you now more than ever. Karina, please, take care of the other guy while Blake calms down...\"- The girls nodded and did so. James (From here, it'll refer to James jr) was badly hurt, so, When the girls arrived to their respective houses (or departments, it doesn't matter, does it?), Karina bandaged James and applied some medicines to help him heal. James didn't speak, and quickly fell asleep after being bandaged and taking a hot bath in a cup...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Blake and Joana's would be different...</span></div></div>",

Anyway... why do you care so much about a girl you don't know?\"- Blake dodged an incoming fist. He tried to counter with a kick, but his opponent blocked it. Blake dashed backwards to keep a distance from whoever he was fighting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Can't tell you that, but that guy is not a copy of you nor apart of blaze's plan.\"- the person charged again this time used the flash step to send blake flying a few feet in the air<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why can't you just listen to them?\"- he added as his body were engulfed in flames and started to make fireballs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I learned that listening to people only gives them confidence to lie to you... And I will never forgive those who have betrayed me...\"- Blake was starting to feel cornered, as his opponent was showing powers beyond what he would expect. His speed and raw strength were his only weapons...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have the power to see truth in people and this is only one of my powers.\"- the man said as he was walking to Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Has Joana lied to you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't tell anymore...\"- Blake still stood stubbornly in guard. The sole topic already angered him, and the fact that there was someone else on Joana's side further angered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"James, you had a good son, but now he is a sad fool.\"- the man said as he returned to normal and started to walk away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why did you care so much about this?!\"- Blake asked, he was confused, and for now, his confusion surpassed his anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because you should give the boy and Joana a chance to explain and maybe I can help you beat blaze.\"- the man stopped and he was smiling, but blake couldn't see it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe I'll consider it\"- Blake didn't want to sound so willing, but being honest, something inside him wanted to see Joana again. He told himself he would do it just because of beating Blaze once for all, then he added -\"But where am I? I remember Blaze shrunk me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We are in your mind... and keep this in mind: never forget who has been on your side.

I wasn't there for long enough to pass.\" She walked into her room and closed the door.  Zephyr looked around his abandoned house.  He snuck in and stole from a few camps and made this a home.  He thought about his usual things.  Food, the next match, and revenge.  10 years ago his parents were murdered in front of him by his only friend.  He carried his 2 year old sister out of the house and ran, getting slashed across the eye with the knife that stole his parents from him.  At 7, this left him hollow.  His friend was 12, the same age his sister is now.  He would be 22 today.  At 17, Zephyr is training to fight, so nothing will ever be taken from him again.  He found an underground fighting ring, $200 for a win, $50 for a loss.  He feeds himself and his sister with that money.  The next day.......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dank basement of a bar.  There sat a ring in which the fighters earned their money.  All ages, sizes, genders, anything, count.  Zephyr stood in the ring and watched his competitor come in.  He saw that she was a girl, but she didn't have the usual fighter's look and build.  She looked small compared to everyone, and was a head shorter than Zephyr.  Zephyr drops into fighting position and she follows suit, Zenn took a balanced approach, while she was taking more time to avoid blows than give them.  Into the fight, both have only landed minor blows.  Until Zephyr smashed his heel into her stomach hard and landed a powerful uppercut.  She stumbles back and Zephyr notices something, but ignores it.  At the end of the round, he lands a massive hit that sends her reeling.  The referee rings the bell and tells them to shake hands, being that the tradition of what to do between rounds before resting.  Zephyr noticed something different but doesn't say anything.  After about a minute of rest, they go back into the fight and she seems completely recovered.  Zephyr is nearly untouched, and is just as ready as she is.  They go into a few minor battles where both land hits that could be shrugged off.  Then, Zephyr lands a huge roundhouse kick and she stumbles crazily.  She manages to hold out the round without going down, and when they went to shake hands, Zephyr noticed that she was now taller than him, he came up to about mid-face level.  He gives her a look and returns to his spot.  His friend from earlier team fights says to him \"She's special.  Don't under-estimate her or you will have your first loss since Jonah.\" the bell dings and both stand and prepare for the battle.  Zephyr uses a more defensively focused way, while she began her more offensive approach.  Zephyr goes untouched for the first two-thirds of the round and has landed a few hits, but none of the powerful stuff he did before.  Near the end, he sends his fist deep into her gut causing a huge wheeze from her as the air rushes out.  A huge hook to the side of the head and a running kick send her towards the floor but she catches herself.  Zephyr runs over and kicks her in the ribs before she can get up.  She shoves him away and stands.  Zephyr's eye level is between her breasts and stomach.  At 5' 9\" he is by no means short , but she has gone from around 5' 2\" to a massive 7' 6\"!  \"What did I say?  She is almost unbeatable.\" His friend says.  \"That seems supportive.\" He looks to him and says \"You really shouldn't have chosen unconciousness as way of loss.  That was the mistake.\" **DING** Zeohyr stood once more for around with this now insanely tall girl.  When it starts, she puts him into a huge bear hug, crushing the air out of him.  He puts his legs to her body and breaks away with a huge jump.  She goes after and goes in for a huge attack.  Zenn dodges it, and connects a kick to her and a hook followed by and elbow, all to the head.  She tries to grab him again but he catches her hands and flips her over his head onto the hard floor.  He backs away and waits for the referee to check her.  She is fine, but protical must be followed.  She gets up and the round continues.  Zephyr is now put on the defensive, until he dodges a powerful downward punch.  He grabs her head and forces it down while kneeing her in the stomach.  This continues until the round ends, where Zephyr discovers she is now almost 11 feet tall.  She seems to he slowing, but is still a force to be reckoned with.  The next round..::  </span></div></div>",

I know that super powers and stuff are fantasy, but time traveling is still crazier than that... Anyway, these stories are most likely to ignore the original story, keeping the characters with slight modifications to fit into their current universe. As I'm writing this, I'm thinking about how to branch this new series of stories, which are supposed to be kept minor, since the whole story didn't make it as a true sequel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of the characters, they'll retain their age and most of personality, though they'll be adapted to the different worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the choices below:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one is already known, I toyed a bit with that genre with the SWGF/GTS 1.5, but in difference of that, this wouldn't stick to the original story nor the backstory given by it and the X series (It may sound confusing, but SWGF/GTS 1.5 sticks to the back story, and shows the characters in their younger versions, but it keeps parts of the canon, for example, Joana and Blake meeting at 7th grade, Karina befriending Blake at 9 years old, etc). These stories are supposed to be complete changes to the story, keeping only the caracters and maybe the context of 2000-2010's world. Most of these might be radical changes on how the characters grew up or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second one might sound ambiguous, but with fantasy I mean an alternate world, in a different age, for example, Middle Age-like, Renaissance-like or maybe even a futuristic world (hell, I might even leave option for a prehistoric-ancient world), involving maybe magic and/or technology. If I get an idea I'll write, but is someone has already one, go ahead. My invitation to add is always open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third and fourth ones may be the craziest one, a spin-off-fan fic hybrid... (or maybe author-fic? since I'm the author... it makes no sense anyway XD). And NO, with this I don't mean to involve my characters in anything hentai related. I had the not-so-good the idea of a story mixed with my characters and maybe some anime/videogame/movie. I have a small project on this one, but you'll know soon enough which one I'll be working on. <b>By the way, I DON'T intend to replace the series' characters with mine, as the title says, they would appear as additional characters</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's all I've thought of. If someone wants to suggest a fifth branch and its possible option, I'll be glad to discuss it by e-mail. I'm online almost every day, so, I'll reply as soon as possible. Have a nice reading!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PS: The item \"Blake... Another Future\" is NOT canon. Is just the prelude for this interactive's main story, and no, I'm not otaku nor a very hardcore gamer, that's why my choices would be limited in the guests path</b></span></div></div>",

The father was happy, a tall man (5'11\" or 180 cm, maybe not that tall I guess...) with dark skin as well, and black hair. His eyes looked sharp and cold in their natural state, but despite his seemingly dark features, the man was really happy when he could hold the baby in his arms. Before that, and in difference of the rest, this baby was continuously crying since he was born (all of the other babies were tired and sleeping). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother didn't look happy at all, which almost didn't surprise the nurses, despite being used to see both happy parents or being usually the mother the happy one... but no, this woman was not happy at all, she had been restrained for nine months by doctors and nurses because she kept trying to eliminate the life she was carrying in her womb, and pretty much all of the hospital personnel knew it. However, this didn't seem to affect the man, who only cared about his son and nothing else in that right moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, James, the man, now father, knew about his wife's intentions, and was forced to take the little Blake anywhere he was going. One of those days, Lilith's (the mother and wife) family came in early in the morning, James and Blake had already left and were at James' work. Lilith's father (who was a white seemingly old yet still strong man) said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good. Now, we have serious business to talk to you, Lilith...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't need to tell it, old man...\"- She said rudely, another man, Lilith's brother, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's not the way to talk to our father!! This is all your fault you bitch...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to slap her older brother but the old man stopped both of them, with a look that showed his authority, then he cleared his throat and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We always knew that it was wrong that you were with an impure one, you already have dishonored our family's name, and there's more...\"- He said, and someone else entered the house. His presence felt heavy to everyone, like a really great authority of some sort, but none of his features was visible, he was covered in a dark gray cloak with a hood. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The child is a threat. He carries evil blood within his veins, and he will be the one to bring disgrace and destruction to all of you...\"- The mysterious guest said, with a teenager-young sounding voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And just who the hell do you think you are?!\"- Lilith was angry, not because she cared, but because her father was allowing a stranger to warn her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You better watch your mouth, young woman, he is a Great Sage!!\"- Her father said, again, sounding authoritarian<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"From... the Orden?\"- Lilith's voice showed fear, and both her father and her brother nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But not everything is lost yet. The almighty God gives everyone a chance to mend their way... even you, sinful woman...\"- He paused, and added -\"What you have to do is what you have wanted to do ever since the little bastard was born. To get rid of it. The child descends from demons, and he's destined to bring the world's end if he reaches adulthood...\"- Then he turned to Lilith's father and brother, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know that his father will protect him, that's why I want all of you to kill the father first, then the child. That's something this woman won't be able to do by herself. Remember, time is running out, and the clock is still ticking...\"- The mysterious guy left very quietly. Some minutes later, the old man said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"None of this would've happened if you JUST wouldn't have had your fun with that goddamn lowlife slacker...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least we'll get rid of him and the damn child...\"- She answered, again, not really caring<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You BROUGHT a DEMON into the world!! Our noble family always took pride on...\"- Lilith's brother was cut off by her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know!! I f***ing know!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, uncomfortable silence filled the house. They waited like that for hours, until James came back from work, carrying the 8 days old Blake. He was silent when saw Lilith's family. Everyone, including Lilith hated him and the baby both, however, he wasn't expecting what was going to happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe instinctively placed Blake on the floor and dodged an otherwise fatal blow. Lilith's brother tried to stab him with a knife. James said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And you call me a lowlife... at least I'm not a sissy coward... like you\"- He kicked Lilith's brother's arm, which made him to drop the knife, then, he punched him in the stomach, just then, James felt a punch on the back of his neck, and behind him was Lilith's father... old, but still strong. For an unknown reason, he looked where Blake was, and saw Lilith getting near him, obviously, with no good intentions, so, he kicked the old man in the stomach and rushed toward Lith, who slashed at him with another knife, it hit his shoulder, but it wasn't a very deep wound. He took Blake in hir arms and kept dodging punches, kicks and slashes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wouldn't allow him to get out of the house with his son, and they got him surrounded. He kept fighting back with just one hand and his feet. Surprisingly, he was keeping up against two men and an armed woman despite his handicap, and managed to knock out the old man by punching him in the chin. He also got to punch Lilith's brother with all his might, which forced him to cough up some blood, and stunned him a moment, then, James confronted his ife and espite she was using two knives, he could pin her down with his feet. She was struggling againt it and tried to make James lose his footing, but she wasn't strong enough<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith's brother got up and tried to attack James as well, but he was too battered and weakened, and was struggling against James' free arm, in that moment, the door opened, and someone covered in a dark gray cloak and a hood. For some unknown reason, everyone stopped, as if a great authority had just entered. The guy spoke, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh. I knew you pathethic people wouldn't be enough... to match even your own species...\"- He walked toward James, and noticed the knocked out old man, the woman and her brother struggling against him. Without saying anything, he punched James and the force of impact sent him through the wall to a room. Lilith and her brother stared in awe... what they just saw, was not human. The Sage was obviously far superior to them. In the end, the guy ignored tham and walked toward the rubble, and saw James, who placed the child on the bed and asked angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who the hell do you think you are?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I am far more than you can even comprehend. Now, give me the child...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Over my dead body\"- James answered firmly, despite he was really damaged by crashing through a solid wall. He coughed up blood, then charged toward the guy in gray, he was so enraged because it looked like everyone and everything hated him and his son. His wife hated him, her family did as well, and now, even a stranger came to take his life, it was the last straw for James, who connected his best punch right into the guy's stomach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he didn't move an inch, nor showed any sign of pain (well, his face wasn't visible under his hood anyway). James attacked again with his strongest punches and kicks, but they did nothing to the \"sage\". When James stopped, he saw two red eyes glowing in the hood's darkness, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're nothing but a pest to me...\"- with that, he shot a dark purple beam through his hand, which pierced James' chest and created a large hole in his thorax. His eyes went blank, and he felt cold... he felt how the life was quickly getting drained from his body (he was just 21 years old by that time). He saw his son, now a defenseless 8 day old baby, and muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was no longer able to say anything, but his mind kept thinking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"Maybe you will never forgive me, but I'll understand it. I failed. I wasn't strong enough to save you from this imminent death... I hate myself for that... I have just left you on your own, at an age where you can't comprehend anything... Good bye, my son...\"-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames' mind was the last thing to fade away, and while doing so, he saw many things he couldn't understand, and assumed they were an extremely flashing back of his own life, despite some things weren't right... but he had no time to think about it as his body was quickly going cold and lifeless. The guy in gray simply said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh. Moronic animal instincts...\"- He walked, stepping over the recently dead father, and picked up the child, saying -\"AND YOU are coming with me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy left quietly, not even caring about the dead body, nor the heavily damaged people on the floor</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been years after that fateful day, and the child was \"raised\" by the guy in gray, who without it was a 16-18 year looking teenager, with extremely long white hair, which went down his waist and covered his eyes as well. Just after he got the child, he came to an abandoned warehouse, and threw him violently against the floor, and did not pay attention to his cries. He simply walked away and did not return until the following day, to check on him. He gave an evil smile and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey little baby, I brought you a pet!!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he released a big rat, which almost instinctively, attacked the defenseless child, slashing through his soft skin with its claws and biting the baby in the shoulder. The baby tried to get away from the rat, and despite being hungry and tired, managed to crawl away, but the rat was after him and kept wounding him. It kept like that for more than 30 minutes, and the white haired guy was considering killing the rat, when the baby's black eyes went blank, and swiftly grabbed the rat and broke its neck easily. After that, the baby fell unconscious. The white haired guy smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the baby woke up, he was presented to a badly cracked and seemingly old bowl full of milk. The white haired guy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You earned it, but only for that one. If you want more, you'll have to prove worthy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite not truly understanding the stranger, the baby's instinct told him to drink the milk from that bowl. As the time passed, this white haired guy kept making the baby fight everyday rats, mice, and as he grew, cats and dogs. When the child was old enough, he stopped giving him milk and gave him water in his only bowl per day, along a small piece of bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe years passed, and the child turned into an older kid (10 years old). The white haired guy allowed himself to even bring wolves to make the kid fight with, and was pleased on seeing how first Blake got wounded, then, his eyes became blank and killed violently the animals. He had taken little time to speak with the kid, and barely taugh him some language. The kid knew how to read and write, but beyond that he wasn't allowed to do anything he wasn't told to. He spent most of the time recovering from his wounds from his daily fights. One of those days, after killing two wolves and waking up from unconsciousness, the white haired guy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well done my pet. Here's your reward as always\"- He presented him the same old bowl full of water and two pieces of bread. He ate them desperately, and after he was done, the white haired guy stared impatient at him, asking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thank you, master, for feeding me once more\"- The kid answered submissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's better. Now, go to sleep, you need to rest for tomorrow...\"- The kid walked to an empty room inside the warehouse, and laid on the floor. Minutes later, the white haired guy felt a presence behind him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How long is this going to take, Blaze?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Years. Fricking years, I told you!! And since when have you grown so bold\"- He turned around to see his visitor <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry, prince...\"- The visitor apologized<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's progressing well. At this rate, in about 4 years he'll be ready\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"4 years?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!! We've been stuck here for over 10,000 years!!, I guess 4 more won't hurt\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright...\"- The visitor vanished<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, things were going to change. 1 years later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was sleeping as usual, but woke up when hearing a knock in the door 'Who the heck knocks a warehouse's door? And this early at that?!!' He thought, after checking his watch, which marked 7.00 AM. He walked groggily and opened the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good morning\"- A police officer said -\"I've been informed that people live here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So what?\"- Blaze asked groggily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is an abandoned building!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no means to get a better place, officer...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How many people live here?\"- The police officer asked, Blaze growled, he was thinking about killing him with just a single energy shot, but noticed a lot more of patrols outside 'Dammit... the kid isn't strong enough yet... he'd die easily if these stupid bastards shot at him...' He thought, and decided to stay \"good\" with the officer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just me and my brother...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where is he?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sleeping over a room...\"- Blaze opened the door slightly more to allow the officer to see the black haired boy sleeping on the floor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He looks nothing like you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm a frickin' albino, 'kay?!!\"- Blaze said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... sorry about that...\"- The officer apologized (well, despite the way Blaze was answering, an adult man would be more comprehensive to stray children, at least normally, right?) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But that kid should be getting ready for school right now...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't have money for that. We have barely enough to get food. But at least he finished elementary\"- Blaze answered, and showed the officer a certificate (which was fake, Blaze kept it just in case), though inside, he was having fun fooling a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see, though, I'm afraid I'll have to take you both at some orphanage...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!! I mean... that wouldn't work, my brother is too old to be picked by any family... and, in case you wonder, we aren't into drugs, otherwise we'd have loads of money...\"- Blaze replied in such a teenagerish way that made the officer laugh, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay then. I'll let it slide for this time, but you better have your brother registered at a high school ASAP good thing he's at the right age...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah\"- Blaze nodded annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll get you some money through a scholarship, so, as long as your brother studies, you won't starve\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Gee... thanks officer\"- Blaze pretended to be polite, and soon the officer left. Blaze growled angrily, thiking <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'God dammit!! I have to frickin' get this kid at school!! And I can't leave that easily because I know they're watching me... I might kill them but more officers would come and I'd make it to the most wanted list... And this kid might get killed in the process, no way, I've spent years to train him...' He thought, then another thought echoes in his mind <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well... that might be a chance to Blake for seeing what humans really are like... and so he'll come to truly hate them!! When he's strong enough he'll start killing people mercilessly!!! Maybe the school is a good idea'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake!!\"- He shouted, and immediately, the boy was before him, down to his knee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, master?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your life is going to change. You'll be going to school in a few months*\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"School, master?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not a big deal, it's a place crowded with immature young humans. Your mission will be to lean about their disgusting nature, and keep on a low profile. You'll have to act as a human...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"With all due respect, master, I don't know how to do that\"- Blake answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dammit... well, I guess I'll have to teach you their disgusting ways of life then\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's it for, master?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I've kept you isolated from the world, the cruel and horrible world. Yet, you have to get to know because you'll destroy it one day, and need to know what will you be fighting. I also want you to see the people with your own eyes, how disgustingly they live, and how stupid they are. I want you to hate them, after you see how they truly are...\"- Blaze said, really sounding conviced, despite he knew that he was acting cheaply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Understood\"- Was Blake's answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But your training will go on while you aren't as school\"- Blaze remarked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Understood, master\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Blaze taught Blake about human behavior, but he mostly was focusing him on hating humans after finding out how they were. Blaze told him that they were hypocrite, and acted nice despite they hated others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, remember this, even if a human attacks you, don't fight back unless he either really hurts you or are alone. If you happen to be alone you may kill him\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Understood, master\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Also, don't talk very long to them. Talk to them as least as possible, or they may corrupt you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I will not fall for their lies, master\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good. But I want to remark THIS because most of people will try to act nice around you. Just ignore them, and don't say anything unless it's necessary, however, this only applies to the other humans which look like your age. You'll have to stick to what teachers say...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Teachers?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Adult humans, who are supposed to teach things to the young ones, though most of that isn't important at all. But you'll have to pay attention to them and do as they say, within limits\"- Blaze answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, master\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You also are not allowed to fight back ANY adult being while in school. You can fight back only the ones your age. I'll take care of any adult who causes you trouble\"- Blaze added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Understood, master...\"- And so, the months passed quickly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*In story, it's December, and school registrations are done about February, at leats that's how it's done where I live, I'm not sure about the US... Also, here's obligatory for children to go to school up to 9th grade</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze also had to teach him minimal stuff which would be basic for normal teenagers, such as learning what was a woman like (not much, i fact, Blake only learned that they're refrred as she or her, and that their physic looks different from males. Blaze himself wasn't too fond of the topic). Blaze even had to explain how are humans born, because they'd be studying that topic at some point in school...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Blake really disliked pretty much of all the stuff related to humans, and, as taught by Blaze, \"their instincts were plainly pathethic\". Blaze remarked several times to not talk to anyone unless it's necessary, and during the lunch break, avoid any human company. To the point Blake memorized what Blaze said about most of possible situations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonths later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze had already gotten Blake registered at the nearest high school, and early in the morning, he woke Blake up by throwing an angry rat at him. The now nearly 12 years old boy killed it with ease, and saw the bowl with water and three bread pieces before him, Blaze said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'll need a bit more of energy, just in case...\"- Blake ate them rather quickly (given his life style, he was always hungry, but never complained) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now, remember that if someone asks about who you live with, you have to answer 'My big brother'. Also, never, NEVER tell anyone where you live\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Understood, master... but...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But?\"- Blaze was about to shout and possibly punch the teenager he had been \"raising\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Is this school stuff necessary?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze sighed in relief, at least he wasn't questioning him, as he kew clearly that not even Blaze was happy about the school thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sadly yes. I'd hate to spend the whole day around humans... it's a punishment that none of us truly deserves, but, I can't confront the human police until you're strong enough. You can get killed by a mere bullet... humans and their damn fire power... if this were like 500 years ago you'd be already killing entire villages...\"- Blaze was starting to go off the point, but he realized and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you don't want to bear this for too long, then train better and harder, so you will grow stronger faster... As a gift, you'll kill all of the school's people when your day comes, I'm sure you'll come to hate them...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks, master...\"- Blake answered, and Blaze gave him a backpack which had a single notebook, a book and a pen inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now, go\"- Blaze said, and Blake left. All those years of extreme fighting against wild animals made him really strong and fast, and he was able to run quickly. He got to school in 20 minutes (where a normal person would've taken an hour). Blake checked the watch Blaze gave him. It marked 6:50 AM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good. 10 minutes left...\"- Blake sighed and saw before him the large building, at the current time, empty, as most of people came by bus some minutes before 7:00, so, there wasn't much people around. He checked a paper Blaze had given him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Classroom 10-D\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake also checked what he was going to do by the day<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>7:00  to 8.00   AM History<br>\r\n8:00  to 9:00   AM Biology<br>\r\n9:00  to 9:40   AM Lunch Break<br>\r\n9:40  to 10:20  AM Biology<br>\r\n10:20 to 11:20 AM Math<br>\r\n11:20 to 12.20 AM Physics<br>\r\n12.20 to 1:20  PM English<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is not going to be a good day... it was easier just to kill some animal every day than sitting the whole day hearing nonsense...\"- Blake growled angrily at his realization, he found his classroom and sought a seat in the last row. He didn't go for a corner to avoid being obvious, so he sat and opened his backpack. He took out a book called \"<i>The art of War\"</i> He saw a note which said <i>\"While you aren't doing anything, you better read about how to destroy people, understood?\"</i> Blake nodded, despite Blaze wasn't there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, he heard footsteps and with the corner of his eye he watched two people enter the classroom. According to what Blaze ad told him, those two were females, called \"girls\" as a generic term. He was seemingly not paying attention to anything but heard them talking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who's that guy over there**?\"- Said the short blonde one, low enough that she SHOULDN'T be heard. Blake's senses were above average, so he could hear clearly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know... I had never seen him\"- Said the other girl, who was average geight if not tall. She had brown wavy hair worn as a ponytail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Weird...\"- The blonde said looking at him, Blake seemed to be focused on his book so the girls weren't too worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why? He's just reading...\"- The brown haired one replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Doesn't look like an intellectual guy to me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe he does so because he know nobody?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe... but I have a bad feeling about him. We better stay away...\"- The blonde one said, though the brown haired one stared at him a bit longer, until they heard more foot steps and the rest of students came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake watched them, and noticed that they didn't pay attention to him 'Good. I'll keep getting here early so I don't draw attention...' However, that was going to change, as the principal came in. He greeted the students and introduced himself. He also introduced briefly all of the teachers. After that, he left and the History teacher was the only one to stay. He introduced himself as Mr. Pauls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was an average height man (170 - 180 cm) with dark brown hair, thick rimmed glasses whose age couldn't be told by sight, he looked young but his way to speak reflected far more experience, despite his serious look, he told the students they'd start calm and for the first week they wouldn't be doing much. He wanted to get to know the students as he did with each generation, and he asked them to introduce themselves as he took attendance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dammit' Blake thought, and disliked the teacher for that. As he called out the names, said student would introduce themselves, most of them with moderate confidence, as they knew almost everyone from back in the elementary. It came the turn to the blonde one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Karina?\"- (The teacher also called them by their names, not their surnames, to make it a bit less formal)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Present\"- She answered, and stood up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"May you introduce yourself to the others?\"- He asked with a warm tone, she smiled and a bit nervous, replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My name is Karina. I come from the Elementary School #42***\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And what's your age?****\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"12 years old\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, please take your seat\"- He said. He noticed a boy who was in the last rows reading some book. He raised an eyebrow, finding that behavior unusual for a first day. Usually, everyone was nervous and anxious, and somewhat willing to make new friends since they were new to school and stuff. Mr Pauls knew that well, because that's how it was for lots of generations of students. He made a mental note to pay more attention to that boy. He continued calling names and making everyone introduce themselves, he was now expecting to talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some calls, it was the bron haired's turn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Present\"- She answered rather happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is it correctly written? Many times the school's scecretaries screw up names\"- Everyone in the classroom laughed, except the boy reading the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes sir\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... where do you come from?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, from Elementary #42 as the rest of us\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright. Your age?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"13 years old sir\"- It wasn't uncommon that some students were slightly older than the rest, but it was strange that this girl would've lost a year, she had clean records, and good notes. Still, it was a minor problem compared to th boy who was seemingly not caring about the first day of high school... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good. Take your seat please\"- Mr Pauls kept calling names expecting to find what was the boy called, and almost coming to the last one, he called<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake?\"- Everyone went silent. Nobody they knew had such a name, which meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*By the way, yeah, school here is from 7.00 AM to 1 or 2:00 PM.

He knew that if he took any longer it would look suspicious, but everyone was suspicious already. Blake sat back and resumed reading, in complete silence.

It's clear that something is wrong with that guy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I still think he's shy, and is just tryint to not looke like it...\"- Joana added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever...\"- Karina said, and the mumbling stopped as Mr Pauls called the last names. After that. Mr Pauls let them have free time until his class was over. As usual, during the time between teachers, most of students relaxed and talked, except Blake, who kept reading. Karina and Joana kept watching Blake and noticed that Ayrton, a good friend of theirs talked to him, and Karina still had the feeling things would end badly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hi... Blake, right?\"- Ayrton greeted Blake, who didn't close the book this time, but looked at the one who was talking to him. A short guy, with tanned skin and short black hair 'Not much of a threat' Blake thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...\"- Blake answered flatly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, you're new here...\"- Ayrton tried to start a conversation, this time, Blake closed the book, and replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought this was everyone's first day...\"- Ayrton laughed at that answer, despite Blake kept his serious expression, Ayrton said then<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It is, but almost everyone comes from the same elementary school...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...\"- Blake was silent, thinking 'Like I care. I didn't come here to make friends'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry, I know what you're thinking...\"- Ayrton said, and Blake gasped, he added happily -\"Cheer up! I'll get you to meet people!!\"- Blake couldn't help but to have a '\u00ac_\u00ac expression (the apostrophe means a sweatdrop btw)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't think that would be...\"- Ayrton was already dragging him, but everyone stopped as Biology's teacher entered. She introduced herself ar Mrs. Philipps, though since she also taught at the elementary school, most of the students knew her. That was the reason she also was acting more relaxed, though, Blake drew her atention just like the previous class. He seemed to be unwilling about going to school, nor willing to anything (Since women have better intuition, that's why she realizes a bit more than Mr Pauls did). She was telling them that the first week was to get the students acquainted witht he whole new school and what it implied. It was also for the students to get to know each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed Blake's slight scowl whenever she said anything about making friends. She also noticed that he wasn't paying much attention, and since she hadn't taken attendance, she called him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, you!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stopped, and the teacher said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The one in the back row... the one in black...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed. If he were an ordinary teenager he'd be embarrassed, but given the circumstances he couldn't care less, however, he knew he had to stick to what Blaze said about teachers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, Mrs Philipps?\"- Blake asked calmly, though he was starting to get angry at getting called out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I forgot what I was saying, may you remind me?\"- She said in a tone that to the other students meant 'Show me that you paid attention or you're doomed'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake replied with surprising calm. The students were with wide open eyes and their jaws dropped, because none of them would've actually repeated the whole speech word by word. After he finished, he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then you called me, Mrs Philipps...\"- Even said teacher was with her jaws dropping and her eyes wide open. It was the first time a student could defeat her like that, sure, some students recalled exact words from just mere minutes ago, but none was able to say the exact speech word by word. She scowled in her inside but decided that she'd leave him alone for now... until he gave her another reason to call him out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... thanks... you may take our seat back...\"- Blake sat back on his chair without saying anything. The students started to mumble, and Blake clearly heard some phrases<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wow... this is the first new guy who can actually defend himself from teachers...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah and what a way...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Which makes him weirder...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So.. what do you think? He doesn't look like a bad guy to me...\"- In Blake's mind, a record needle's scratch was heard, and he quickly looked at who said those words... the girl with brown hair... he also paid more attention to her conversation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know... I still think he's creepy and that we should stay away from him...\"- Karina replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe he's just smart?\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Note to self: Stay away from the girl with brown hair... more specifically, stay away from the girl with brown hair and*...' Blake's thought was interrupted as the teacher regained the attention and everyone remained silent again. She kept talking, and to prevent further incidents, Blake stopped reading and pretended to pay attention, however, both he and the teacher knew he wasn't really doing so, but if she asked him he'd definitively answer correctly which would prove her wrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher then called out students names, again, asking their name and age. To make them even, before starting she revealed her own, 36. After a lot of names, it came Blake's turn. By the way, in difference of Mr Pauls or the rest of the teachers, Mrs Philipps asked the students as a last question to say anything relevant about themselves, what they liked, etc...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake?\"- She called out in her list<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Present...\"- Blake answered rather flatly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see that you're not from the Elementary #42, what school are you from?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed slithgly, and answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm from a mexican school...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see... so, how long have you lived here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A few months...\"- Blake said what Blaze told him to say when he was asked such a question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... how old are you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"11\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"11? Aren't you too young?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll turn 12 in September...\"- Blake answered, barely containing the anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright. Some other thing you may tell us about you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not really...\"- Blake said, wanting to end the questions as soon as possible, however, that was not the answer she or anyone would expect... it was like a non written contract, everyone risked to say a few things about themselves so the others would know them better... and sticking to this, since others told about themselves, the following ones would do so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No?\"- Now Mrs Philipps was growing more suspicious on Blake. He knew that Blaze told him to NOT tell anything about his real life, she stared at him inquisitively, Blake sighed again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's not anything I could say about me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There has to be something. Everyone is different and everyone has a story to tell...\"- (I know, she sounds more like an art education teacher, but she actually speaks like that)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I have nothing to say...\"- Mrs Philipps sighed and Blake sat back on his chair.As it happened with Mr Pauls, she couldn't dig deeper into Blake's mind because it'd take longer and it would look suspicious. But she was now sure that there was something wrong with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>* I thought it'd be better to leave to your imagination what other trait of hers Blake was going to mention...</b></i></span></div></div>",

Suddenly his chair is yanked from under him and he falls backward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey freak\"- Comes the voice of the person who threw him down.  Blake sees a huge kid at least 6' 5\" and 230 pounds.  He begins to send a punch to Blake but someone steps in the way.  A kid in a sweatshirt with his hood up stands over him holding the fist of his attacker.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You leave him alone.\"- The larger pulls his fist away and Blake gets up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How will you stop me?  You're weak\"- says the larger person.  The smaller goes into a position for fighting.  One hand held in front of his chest in a fist, the other held half open in front.  The larger sends three punches towards the kid, but they were sloppy.  He ducks the one aimed for his head, sidesteps one going for his stomach and deflects one on a course for his face.  Suddenly, the kid goes on the offensive.  He punches his enemy in the stomach, then connects his elbow to the side of his head and then kicks him in the ribs.  The older kid now bent over holding his stomach is laid out by an uppercut to the face.  He stands and begins to try once again to hit the smaller kid, but no hits are connected.  The smaller sends a kick into his gut, a punch to his jaw, and then, once more the other holding his stomach finishes his fight with a flip kick to the face.  The larger boy finally gets up and leaves, knowing his odds of winning are low.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other one goes over to Blake.  \"You ok?

He noticed Seth's look, and somehow feeling obligated he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My name is Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah I know. You kinda started school with the wrong foot\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd guess that I did worse than that\"- Blake said and was interrupted by a happy-annoying sounding voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There you are!! No escape this time!!\"- Ayrton came in, pulling Blake's arm, who had a raised eyebrow and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Isn't there someone else who needs your help in... social stuff or something?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope. You're the first in my list... now, be good and come along...\"- He was trying harder to drag Blake, Seth watched in amusement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Listen, I am not into anything social, I just want to be alone\"- Blake was starting to get angry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you'll ruin your reputation, then nobody will talk to you\"- Ayrton was trying his best to convince the stubborn guy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not like I care...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I'll bring people here to meet you\"- Ayrton said after getting tired, Blake had now a twitch in the eye, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You wouldn't...\"- He saw Ayrton going after a few guys, and got up to leave. Ayrton quickly came to where he was and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm going ALONE\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You aren't. I'll follow you around all day...\"- Ayrton said, and grinned as Blake faceplamed himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If I go to your social stuff you will stop annoying me?\"- Blake finally asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just for today...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Arghhh...\"- Blake was clenching his fist, but Seth's glare somehow stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"C'mon. You'll like it\"- Ayrton dragged a sighing and facelapming Blake by his arm out of the classroom. Mrs Philipps had watched everything and was slightly amused as well. Seth also walked out of the classroom. He'd watch the new guy \"just in case\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe the students themselves might help that guy...\"- Mrs Philipps muttered, and then she heard them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And just because I'm so damn cool, I'll get you to know some GIRLS!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?!!\"- Was the last a very desperate Blake said before getting too far away to be heard. Mrs Philipps smiled at that. 'This might be interesting' she thought, and got up to leave as well, she'd have her lunch in the cafeteria, to watch how would Blake do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught up with them timely, and taking a seat from a descent distance, she watched Ayrton and Blake, who was dragged by the former and met with Joana and Karina<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hi girls\"- Ayrton said happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hi Ayrton\"- Both girls greeted back, they noticed Blake and had different reactions: Karina stared at him and Joana just giggled. Ayrton nudged him in the ribs and he said reluctantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hi\"- After a small pause, he said  to Ayrton -\"Alright, I met people. Whooohoo, I am SO happy. Now, if you excuse me...\"- He started to leave when Ayrton grabbed him by the back of his shirt's collar<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not so fast, pal. We're having lunch with them\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ayrton, maybe you shouldn't annoy him so much...\"- Karina said, and for the first time, Blake didn't dislike her, however, Joana, the other girl glared at her and Karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't mind...\"- Blake wanted very much to strangle Joana. His angry look was only noticeable to Seth and Mrs Philipps, who by the way, was caught by Mr Pauls looking at some students<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Too bad they don't sell popcorn here...\"- He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's alright...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you up to this time, Linda?\"- He asked more seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That kid... there's something that's not normal with him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh? what kid?\"- He asked, and Mrs Philipps pointed at Blake discreetely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh... that kid... yeah there's something strange about him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Didn't you notice?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course I did\"- Mr Pauls said -\"But he acted polite and behaved well... so, I have no reason to do anything about him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think there's something wrong with him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe he's maltreated?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe... but he seems too calm to be just that. No, what I've felt is that he dislikes people...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"C'mon, aren't you overreacting again?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I am not!!\"- Mrs Philipps said angrily -\"I can understand bad attitude to teachers, but to other students?\"- Any person at 12 years is beginning to become a teenager, and want desperately to be part of a group...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, there will be always someone different\"- He said -\"I also found that he's younger than the rest...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah I know, but that doesn't explain...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, he's sitting with other students, it can't be too bad...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just because another student forced him to. He kept annoying him until he agreed...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's better than nothing. Maybe they'll eventually help him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe...\"- She said, and Mr Pauls sat on an unocuppied chair, both of them watching Blake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... you're new here?\"- Joana asked, trying to be friendly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...\"- Blake answered flatly. Then she noticed that he wasn't eating anything, and asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Um... where's your lunch?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lunch?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Food. Aren't you hungry?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hungry?\"- Blaze didn't tell him the meaning of those words<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you have money to buy food?\"- Joana thought he simply didn't know the words in english, and showed him some coins and then pointed to her food<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't have that... Anyway I've already eaten\"- Blake answered, not really caring<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When I woke up. I had my meal early... so what?\"- He noticed that both girls and Ayrton stared at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You mean you only have a meal once a day?\"- Joana asked, worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's the fuss for?\"- Blake asked angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Everyone has two or three a day, Blake...\"- Ayrton said, now sounding serious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I'm alright...\"- Blake knew it was an uncomfortable situation, and saw Joana getting up without saying anything. Blake still didn't care about what was she going for, and tried to leave, but Ayrton tried to stop him. And so, Blake was trying to walk out of there slowed down because he was dragging a determinated Ayrton (Again, Blake doesn't care about the fact he's doing a scene...) Just when he was about fo get out of the cafeteria, Joana stood before him, with a tray with food. She noticed Blake's struggle to get away but gestured him to go back to the table. Blake, who just felt like having enough of everything, glared at her, and kept trying to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Ayrton knew what was going to happen, and quickly released Blake, and grabbed the food tray and went back to the table. Joana walked behind Blake and grabbed his shirt's collar by the back. Blake said loudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the...?!!\"- And was dragged by Joana, who did not say any word at all, until she brought him to his chair and sat him (forcefully). Blake tried to stand up again but her glare stopped him... Blake was used to obey Blaze, but he wouldn't lower himself to obey people. Still, Joana's look somehow stopped him, and thought 'Just for THIS once...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good thing they were serving pizza today. Now, here you go\"- Joana said, while Karina and Ayrton had O.O faces. They rarely had seen Joana like that, and what was weirder, she managed to subjugate Blake's stubbornness, at least for a while...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake, who had never seen a pizza in his life, stared at the 2 triangular slices that were in front of him. He muttered, wondering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell is this?\"- However, Joana heard him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's pizza... you didn't know?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Never heard of it...\"- Blake answered flatly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He must be joking... there's no person on earth who doesn't know what's a pizza...\"- Ayrton said, patting Blake's shoulder, who was pondering either eating it or swiftly getting away (well, not that swiftly... he would make a mess in the cafeteria, and Blaze told him to not get in trouble...) 'Dammit' He thought and kept staring at the pizza slices, and his instincts were telling him to eat them. He was used to be hungry, and early in his childhood came to the conclusion that it was normal to feel like that. After living eating very little per day for years, his instincts wanted him to eat. It was a chance he wouldn't have outside school, and Blaze wouldn't have to know...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ate them quickly, though he tried to not look like he was really hungry. Ayrton, Joana, Karina, Seth, Mr Pauls and Mrs Philipps knew it in the end though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You see? It has to feel good...\"- Joana said with a n_n expression<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh...\"- Blake answered, disegarding what just happened. But he felt good. He felt slightly more lively, and wondered why then he was used to eat just once a day... he was told that he was a demon prince, so, he should live better than any person on earth... well, he'd try to find out later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was strange...\"- Mrs Philipps said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What? The scene he just did? or the fact that he just has one meal per day?\"- Mr Pauls asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No! The fact that the girl stopped him without force...\"- She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't blame him. Angry women are scary\"- Mr Pauls said, laughing. Mrs Philipps pretended to be mad.</span></div></div>",

However Ayton followed him. When he got far enough, Karina narrowed her eyes and said to her friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the heck was that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh? What are you talking about?\"- Joana asked, seemingly confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't pretend innocence... I know that you're up to something...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's what I should ask!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm up to nothing.

I hope to God that he's not into mafia or drug dealing or something...\"- Karina emphasized the words \"new guy\" in a tone that implied that it was no good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think you're exaggerating...\"- Joana said, laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, do as you wish... but if he does something bad to you, I won't help you...\"- Karina said, frowning and crossing her arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I doubt he's a pervert...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He better isn't one...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake decided to go to the restroom, just to wash his face, as a means to wake himself up. It had been realy strange and it was just the first day. But he stopped as he noticed the guy who helped him, laying on the floor, bleeding and nearly unconscious. He simply stared at him... he had no reason to attack him but neither had reason to help him, as Blaze had told him that all humans were evil... which contradicted what happened just this day... Blake was pondering what to do when Ayrton came behind him, gasped and quickly helped Seth up. He (Ayrton) asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It...was...nothing...serious...urgh...\"- He almost fell to the floor -\"Let's...go...back to classes...this never happened...\"- He said with difficult<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyrton was still amazed at Blake's emotionless expression even after seeing Seth hurt like that. He almost looked like something not human. But Ayrton shrugged it off, thinking that maybe he was shocked. As they were walking back to their classroom (Ayrton helped Seth, who was still able to walk but leant on his shoulder for support ). Seth had noticed Blake's blank expression but it was something he'd expect. But, a punch from behind interrupted his thoughts, and sent him and Ayrton about 2 feet forward, landing face first on the floor. They saw two huge guys and an average one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dammit...\"- Seth muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, this is the little freak who caused everything...\"- Said the average size one*, though Blake was in fact tall (170 cm is tall for an 11/12 years old)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's HIM? That's the fool we've looking for?!!\"- Said one of the large guys, sounding angry and disappointed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It'll be easier to deal with him...\"- The average sized guy walked threateningly toward them. Ayrton got up and helped Seth to do so. Then he nudged Blake, tryint to tlel him to run, but noticed that his blank expression changed to a half smile... a creepy half smile. He and Seth stared in shock as one of the large guys punched Blake right in the face... and he didn't move a single inch. When the guy's hand returned to its position, they noticed that Blake's face wasn't even damaged, except for a bit of blood from the corner of his lip. Blake calmly wiped it off and smiled, showing his teeth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Background Music: Guilty Gear - Suck a Sage <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F7M1sfAjBw\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F7M1sfAj...</a> ]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake dashed quickly, sinking his fist into the guy's stomach. Then the other attacked but Blake swiftly dodged the incoming fist and countered with a kick into the face. The average size guy tried to tackle him but Blake dodged him and he ended up landing face first on the floor. Blake stomped on his back, and before anything else, spun around to face the guy he previously had hit, and punched his face like a punching bag. Needless to say that Ayrton had a O<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">o</font>O face. Seth was slightly surprised as well. The bad thing is that they were seen and other students started to crowd around them, watching the freaky new guy kicking bullies' asses<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake moved around, dodging the fists and kicks very fast, but his fighting style didn't look ordinary... he moved more like an animal than a person. He also didn't block, other than dodging, and attacked really wildly when he got in close combat. Three guys, two ones being heavy, were still no match for him. Blake could stop each one with a hand and kick the average sized one with one foot. He also smashed the big guys' heads together. And punched their stomachs like punching bags again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana and Karina noticed the crowd and walked near to find out what was going on. When they asked a guy who was watching, he replied, excited<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The new guy is kicking asses!! This is a hell of a fight!!\"- With that information, Joana gasped and started to walk into the crowd, Karina sighed and followed her. They managed to get to a point where they could see the fight almost clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake took several hits, punches and kicks, and whenever he bled, he simply wiped it off and smiled more. He also enjoyed when he drew blood from his opponents. He kept stomping on the average sized guy until he spat out blood, but got punched by one of the big guys, sending him agaist a locker. He turned around, and only slight damage was visible. Blake ran toward him and punched his face several times, like a punchball. The guy fell backwards, completely knocked out, but Blake hadn't enough and started kicking the unconscious guy's body. He also started to stretch his arms, but was kicked by the remaining guy (the other big one)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is the best day EVER!!\"- Some guy exclaimed. Blake didn't even mind that there was people seeing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I won!!! The new guy kicked ass!! I'm rich!!\"- Said other guy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was worried and Karina had a pale face. She was a fighter herself, but had never seen something like Blake... he was fighting like some sort of wild beast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the fight... Blake dodged the big guy rather easily, and grabbed him by the face, smashing him violently on the floor. He did so several times more, and stomped on his head. He was about to punch it once more when his hand was stopped... it was Seth, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Enough...\"- Blake glared at him and growled angrily, but Seth didn't release his grip. Before Blake thought of anything else, everyone heard a voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll say when it's enough...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn absolutely huge guy walked in, and the ones before him stepped back in fear. This guy was 6'6\" and had to be over 260 pounds. He had white skin and several scars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The guy is dead... nobody stands a chance against Ivan...\"- Said some other guy in the crowd. Joana gasped again, and this time was a lot more worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... it's you the one who's been causing trouble around...\"- Ivan walked threateningly toward Blake and Seth, the latter released his grip on Blake's hand. Blake stood inhis fighting stance without saying any word. Ivan laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're so funny... too bad I don't like clowns...\"- Ivan was about to punch Blake but the bell rang, and everyone rushed to their respective classrooms, as they knew that the teachers would soon go out of their lounge and if they caught anyone in the fight, they'd be in deep trouble. They didn't know that at least two teachers had watched everything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmph...Saved by the bell...\"- Ivan said, turning around, then added -\"If you value your pitiful life, don't get into any more trouble...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's go back to classes...\"- Ayrton said, nunding Blake, who was growling angrily, because he lost the chance of another fight. Joana and Karina ran to where they were and she asked worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you okay?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...\"- Blake stayed silent, and still had an angry look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess he is... now, let's go back before we get in trouble...\"- Karina said, pushing Joana away from Blake. Ayrton and Seth laughed at it, and walked toward their classroom. Blake reluctantly walked next to them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>*Given that is a 12 years old, I assume that average height would range from 130 to 150 cm.</b></font></span></div></div>",

People glanced at Blake, wondering how he could be so calm.  He now had Ivan to deal with.  He must not know about him.  Seth, on the other hand, was worried.  He felt a vibe from everyone.  Blake, though he couldn't read.  Something blocked his emotions from him.  Seth glanced at him, only reading.  Where was his fear?  Ivan is a monster of a person.  Seth thought back to his own life.  Yesterday someone pulled a knife on him and told him to give all his money to a thief.  There was a struggle and he stabbed the thief in the leg.  Now this accomplises are after him and after today, school is no break from the pain.  Assaulted here and assaulted at home.  He looked at the teacher as he walked in.  \"I'd like to do some introductions today, I'm sure you're all tired of it but I don't know you.  Let's start here in front.  Seth looked on from the back and watched.  Eventually the monotone of introductions reached him.  He began his introduction.  \"I am Seth Firman.  I moved here from Chicago a few months ago.\" he started to sit and the teacher looked him over.  \"Alright class is about over.  I'll see you all tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",

He got up and gave his introduction when it was time, but now he was thinking about the best way to beat Ivan in a fight.  He was a big guy, and the best way would be to get away from his punches.  The faster he goes down, the better.  Still, nobody can beat Ivan easily.  Actually, nobody has beaten Ivan at all, that Seth has heard of.  He looked at Blake again.  'Maybe he's crazy.' Seth somehow felt better thinking that he is actually insane.  'Maybe it'll make him fight better.' He finally wondered about the glass ball.  His father had left it with the warning of \"Only break it if you're ready to face the evils of the world.\" Seth assumed that was metaphoric.  It did have an interesting sparkle to it.  He looked at his watch.  Twenty minutes until I go through the worst beating of my life.  He looked at the little marble in his pocket.  He held it with great meaning.  His father gave this to him on the day he died.  Three hours before.  Seth disappeared that day at his father's command.  Breaking it means losing the last tie to him besides the name Firman.  Seth put it back in his pocket.  What would breaking it do, anyways?  Put some glass pieces on the floor.  Seth shook his head and then put the marble back.  He looked one last time at Blake before preparing himself mentally further.</span></div></div>",

Only that Blake might be a surviving person from the 2000's era, awakening into a different world, with no memories, nor a purpose. It's a bit too similar to another idea I have in mind, so, unless I or someone else comes with an original idea, I won't be adding much here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUPDATE: I changed the third slot for a Dragon Ball-like story.

One of them was particularly persistent, a plot I discarded long ago, having Blake and Co. in a fantasy world, middle-age styled, though I might combine Japanese and European middle age... just another crazy idea... Well, let's see if I can make this work. Blake\u00b4s story will retain its essence (I hope so) but will have more changes than you expect... Btw, I know, I kinda wasn't sure about how to begin with the story, and it might be the consequence of not writing for who-knows-how long...]</i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A different time, in another world... where what we know as fantasy is reality...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an ordinary day in Kildevar*, for most of people, they carried on their daily business, and did whatever they were used to do every day, most of children helped their parents with their work, merchants kept selling, buying, exchanging and advertising their products, and so on. A brown haired man was sitting at what seemed to be his house, reading some work papers, when the door was suddenly opened, and a guy came in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tall guy, wearing black gloves, a black shirt, and dark gray pants, as well as brown leather boots. He also had a black hooded cloak, which shadowed the guy's face, and carried an abnormally broad sword on his back. However, the man didn't seem to be bothered  by his presence, and interrupted his work to speak to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... What did you forget?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The mission is done already...\"- Said the guy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"- The man asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It wasn't that difficult... The robbers didn't get too far. Everything has been returned...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah, that's good... so, I guess you've come for your payment...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright then\"- The man took out a small bag with several gold coins in it, and handed it to the guy, who took it and walked out of there. One of the maids who was sweeping the floor stopped for a while, and asked to the man<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhm... I don't mean to be disrespectful, my lord, but is it really necessary to have hired a mercenary squad just for a minor rob?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course not...\"- The man replied calmly, and the maid gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then... why did you hire them, my lord?\"- She asked, confused, the man sighed, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"For the same reason I've been hiring them for the last two years...\"- Then he added -\"They would be wandering around with no place to be... As long as I give them some money, they will stay... And here, they're safe... Specially the guy you just saw... It's better for him to stay here... And you can't say they aren't useful, they haven't failed any mission... and the money I spend on them is the money other dukes use to live the great life themselves... at least I'm helping someone who actually needs it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why... it's a long story, but let's just say that I'm paying a debt to a friend of mine...\"- He said, and the maid resumed cleaning the place (Which by the way, was just a house larger than average, not enough to be a mansion or a palace)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the guy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked into a modest inn, and encountered with four guys, also in their teens. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, here's our reward for today's work. I've already taken my part, you guys do whatever you like with yours\"- He handed them the bag and started to walk away, one of the guys, a short one, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey Blake, why don't you stay here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have things to do... But don't worry, have your fun...\"- He said as he walked away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Man, sometimes I wonder what does Blake do when he's by himself\"- A red haired guy asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I dunno... Maybe he has some girl...\"- A black guy suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not that. Blake is a lone wolf, and I can tell you that he's truly by himself...\"- A guy with black curly hair said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But he rarely celebrates anything...\"- Another guy with black hair and tanned skin added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let him be\"- The guy with curly hair said, and the four of them went to get something to eat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blake was walking, wandering around the village, wondering about many things... When he snapped himself out of his thoughts when he heard suspicious noise, and walked toward where it came from. He found a man laying on the floor, with some wounds caused by a knife, Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Someone attacked me out of nowhere and took away my money...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright\"- Blake said, and jumped to a house's roof. He quickly noticed a man dressed in brown and white, who was running, towards the village's outskirts. He started jumping from roof to roof until he caught up with the thief. Then, he muttered something, and aimed his hand toward the thief, and ropes made of light were fired from his fingers, and entangled themselves around the thief's arms and legs, immobilizing him. Blake then jumped down and took the bags he was carrying (3 or 4), and went back to where he found the man who was robbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still on the floor, bleeding. Blake walked near him and crouched, aimed his left hand toward him and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shine, sun's gentle glow, 10 days of spring, heal, stop the bleeding, close the wounds with nature's touch...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand started to glow in pale golden light, and the man was healed, and stopped bleeding. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was incredible!! Thank you very much sir!!\"- Blake handed him the bags, and he answered -\"The thief only took away one bag from me... I guess you should keep them. Besides, you healed me!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No, you keep it. You seem to be a hard working man with family, they need the money more than I do. I'm just fine\"- Blake said and walked away, disappearing as quietly as he appeared. The man wondered for a while who was that guy, why did he get no money from him and how could he heal him so easily...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake kept walking, thoughtful, as the day continued. When the sun started to set, he went to a large, old tree, jumped on one of its thick branches, and quietly fell asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><i><b>*DON'T ask how did I come to that name... okay, I wasn't able to think of a really proper name, and I didn't want to be too clich\u00e9 and use japanese, so I searched some name generators, and I didn't like none of those names, and ended up checking foreign words, and came up with \"Kilde\" and \"Var\", both of them are norwegian for spring... Aghhh!! Don't judge me!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a second note, I guess you weren't expecting none of this, huh? This version of Blake seems to be more prepared for confronting the world... maybe... there are things that not even him would believe...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following morning, as the sunlight stared to glow, gently illuminating Kildevar for one more day, Blake slowly woke up from \"his\" tree, and stood up, jumping to a nearby branch, he caressed what looked like a giant sleeping cat (roughly as big as a horse, though a bit longer), which opened its eyes groggily, and stretched as all cats do. Blake and the cat jumped down. The cat rubbed softly its head and purred. Blake patted its head, and started to walk, with the cat following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to see a merchant's shop, who was seemingly waiting for him. He greeted Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hello, Mr. Blake... You sure get up early. That's good, seeing people who works hard while in their youth is a bit of a relief\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks. I guess you know what I'm here for...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course. Here it is\"- The merchant showed him two pairs of metal rings, a black shirt, black pants, a black hooded cape, a pair of black boots and a pair of black fingerless gloves. All of it looked identical to what Blake was wearing right now. Blake said, surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How come you could lift them up?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's where I was going. Blake, this new gear is different. It's controlled by this gem\"- He showed Blake a small blue stone, which looked like a sapphire<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really? Incredible...\"- Blake said, surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Also, with this new equipment, you'll no longer need to keep buying newer and heavier ones. This one controls its weight at your will\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But to deactivate it, you must remove the metal rings you wear around your wrists and ankles\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then it's all set. It'll be 12 gold coins\"- The merchant said, and Blake handed him the money. Then the merchant said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"To keep this important gem from getting lost, I can set it in that silver tag you wear\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Here it is\"- Blake took off a silver chain he always wore, which had a silver tag. After some minutes, the merchant returned with the silver tag, now with the small blue stone incrusted in it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thank you very much\"- Blake said, then he took the new gear into a bag that the merchant gave him, and left with the cat, who was black with some white parts (its legs were white as if they were boots, and half of its face was white as well. This cat looked thin and had delicate traits). Blake walked to a nearby forest, and after finding a lonely spot, he started to change his clothes and gear for the new ones. He placed the old ones gently on the ground, but even so, it sunk a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake put the metal rings around his ankles and wrists, and noticed that all of them had a smaller blue stone, and their color was lighter than he stone in his silver tag. Then, he concentrated and the stone glowed, then the other ones. Blake moved a bit, walked, and did some fighting stances to check it. He felt good, then, he took the metal rings off and put them in his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake quickly went to see the merchant again, and gave him his old equipment for free, so he could resell it. Blake never cared too much about money, as long as he had what he needed, he wouldn't worry, then, he went back to where the cat was, seemingly, it was waiting for him. Blake petted its head again, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've had to walk for a lot. I miss a good ride, do you mind?\"- The cat purred happily, and Blake then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, let's go check if there's any j...\"- Blake was interrupted because the cat ran, slid under him, and then started to run. There was, Blake, riding a giant cat*, and in no time they were in front of the Duke's house. Blake got off his cat and came in (despite belonging to the nobility, the Duke behaved more as a public server, and kept the doors open until the sun set), but before entering, he put on his hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good morning, duke. Is there any job for us?\"- Blake asked, rather calmly because he didn't really have anything else to do, and had enough money for a month (Blake used very little money, since he slept in a tree rather than an inn)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhmm... nope, I'm afraid... there would have been one, a man who got robbed yesterday around the sunset, but he reported that some mysterious young man in black saved him, got more than his money back, and healed his wounds...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see...\"- Blake knew the truth, but pretended to be disappointed and left. The duke resumed reading, signing and stamping papers. The maid again stopped her work and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was him, wasn't he, my lord?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah\"- He answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why don't you recommend him for the Royal Army? He might even become an Elite...\"- The maid asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" *Sigh* Believe me, he and I have our reasons. He's refused to go with the army before. And I agree with him on that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But why? He might make a living from it, and if he becomes an Elite and is lucky, may even marry some court's lady...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There are things you wouldn't understand. But I'll tell you two things...\"- He gestured her to get closer, then he whispered -\"One, the Royal Army might kill him, and two, he's already as strong as an Elite, if not stronger...\"- The maid dropped her broom in surprise, after a while, she resumed cleaning up the duke's house...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Blake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was riding again, and in little time he was near the inn where his friends stayed. Only Ferdinand (somewhat tall guy, though not taller than Blake, thin but not skinny, curly black hair, he dresses almost like Blake. But in difference of him, he wears gray bandages wrapped around his arms) seemed to be outside. He noticed Blake's presence, and was somewhat surprised o see him riding his cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, since when did you decide to ride again?\"- He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks to new stuff. Now this will only weigh when I walk or when I'm in battle. You know why I use this\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah\"- Ferdinand nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You haven't told anyone, right?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course not. It would be stupid to have this village's people to run after us furiously with torches and whatnot...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's been a long time since the last incident...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was even before we had a squad. It was just you and me at that time\"- Ferdinand said, remembering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know\"- Blake said -\"Well, I went to see Rick, and it seems we're off for today...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was about time, they've been keeping us here with little things such as robs...\"- Ferdinand complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't be like that, they payment is good enough\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Isn't it a bit suspicious that this village has been paying us here, a mercenary squad, for things the Royal Army can solve easily?\"- Ferdinand wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I bet Rick doesn't want to be so overseen by those snobs...\"- Blake said, he was serious but at the same time, it sounded like a joke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, when you're strong enough to be an Elite, you have rights to be a total snob...\"- Ferdinand commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You and I know perfectly that all of us can be easily ranked as such\"- Blake said, then added -\"In fact, I have never told you to stick here, you can be greater than this if you want. It's just the two of us who can't...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know. The sole use of dark-based magic was forbidden over 15 years ago...\"- Ferdinand said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Grandma never told me everything about me. She just said that my father was the Dark Sage, and that he's dead... nothing more...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was told when I was a child that there were more than one dark magicians, but that they were annihilated by the King... I bet we're the last ones...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...\"- Blake sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, what are we going to do?\"- Ferdinand asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How about bring food and just hang out somewhere in the forest. I don't like the sun very much...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know. Well, I'll go tell the rest of the guys\"- Ferdinand went inside the inn. Blake preferred to wait outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, they had the food and headed for the forest. It was Blake's cat who was carrying the food over its back. Blake and his friends brought their weapons just in case, there might be a thief or some dangerous beast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>*I know it's strange, but I didn't want to go with the clich\u00e9 such as a horse or a dragon... argh!! let me be!!</b></font></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later, in the forest, Blake and his friends were lying down on the grass, under the trees' shadow and hearing the birds. A day off was good once in a while. Blake was resting his head on his cat's back. Then the guys started talking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoa, how long have we been here?\"- Gustave (he was dressed with a cream colored shirt and pants, wore sandals, and had a wine colored cape. He's slightly taller than Ferdinand, has caucasian skin, and red curly hair, similar to Ferdinand's but red)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Three years...\"- Blake answered, with his eyes closed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shouldn't we move on to somewhere else?\"- Caesar (black guy <i>[I mean no offense]</i>, with short straight hair, very tall and thin, his arms are longer than average too. He wore white pants, and a blue vest <i>[sleeve and collar-less clothing]</i> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dude, we've been paid practically for staying, we've done little work, and this place is just fine\"- Ayrton said (Short guy, tanned skin but still caucasian, middle length black straight hair. He was wearing a blue shirt and gray pants)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah but I'd like to see something new\"- Gustave said, and Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What you want to see are new girls\"- Everyone laughed, then Gustave said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"C'mon!! I'm not like that!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're almost as bad as Anthony, heh\"- Blake laughed again, then he said, more seriously -\"I wonder how's he doing... the last I heard of him was that he made it to the Royal Army\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everyone was silent. It was like the minute of silence thing, when the memories of Anthony returned. Anthony was another friend of theirs, who was with the squad until 4 years ago. There was no conflict, Blake had stated that nobody had to stay with the team if they didn't want to, but most of them stayed because of their friendship, and a honor sense. However Anthony wanted to become an Elite<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, Blake, you mock me about girls, but, how come we've never seen you with one?\"- Gustave said, breaking the sad/uncomfortable silence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I've never been with one\"- Blake said, still with his eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGustave, Caesar and Ayrton gasped. Gustave said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you serious man?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's the big deal?\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You've never even kissed one?\"- Caesar said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who cares?\"- Blake said -\"I'm just not good in that stuff, and to be honest I have seen nothing special in none of the women you've seen\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh, I bet you'd be with a tough girl or something like that\"- Gustave said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope. I take no orders from anyone who doesn't pay me\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who said she wouldn't pay you? She would, in her own way\"- Gustave and the rest of the guys laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I meant money!!\"- Blake corrected himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's why I hate to tell you guys about me\"- Blake said, pretending to be mad -\"Anyway, if I were to be seeking for a girl, I'd probably end up like Ferdinand, any girl he likes has a boyfriend, husband, or is engaged\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's right.... I hate my luck\"- Ferdinand had a  T_T expression<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess I'm not missing anything important\"- Blake concluded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think that maybe a warrior girl wouldn't work. Maybe what you need is a cute, kind and loving girl\"- Ayrton said, Gustave and Caesar burst into laughter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's the funniest thing I've heard in years\"- Gustave said, containing a tear from laughing so much, Caesar kept laughing uncontrollably<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't see why it's so difficult to accept. I'm serious. I don't know why, but Blake gives me the impression of a guy who needs an older girlfriend, that would take care of him\"- Ayrton said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not that type of guy, Ayrton\"- Blake said, and threw a nut he found near him into Caesar's head, to shut him up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That will teach you\"- Blake said, and added -\"And if I were with a girl, Tabitha might get jealous\"- Blake said, joking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That reminds me, that you're so damn lucky... those cats are expensive as hell\"- Gustave said -\"And I'm telling you, a guy who came from a formerly rich family...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess. Someone must have abandoned her\"- Blake said, and moved his head slightly to a more comfortable position, Tabitha started to purr again happily, and the sound made Blake feel a bit sleepy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the guys were feeling sleepy as well. But less than 15 minutes later, an arrow as shot at them, nearly hitting Ferdinand. Tabitha stood (on her fours) and hissed angrily, Ferdinand, and the guys who got up quickly, looked at where Tabitha was looking. Blake nodded at Gustave, and he aimed his hand toward the tree's branch, and shot a fireball. It exploded, and apparently missed, but Blake and his friends heard movement, and knew that whoever they were, they were hiding in the nearby trees<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Caesar put his hands together, and thunderbolts hit the trees, electrifying them. 4 people fell to the ground. They all were covered in bandages up to beneath their eyes, and over them they had what looked like white vests, and white pants, without shoes, only their feet covered in bandages. They moved quickly and tried to attack Blake but Tabitha jumped toward them, slashing one of them in the chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake (who had quickly put the metal rings on) drew his sword, and heard Gustave say in surprise:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It can't be... the Sand Bandits...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sand Bandits? What do you know about them?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They are thieves and slave traders... they steal people's things, but mainly capture people and sell them as slaves...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!\"- Said Ayrton<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are they doing here? This is way far from the desert\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know...\"- Gustave answered -\"But they are the ones who made my family lose their wealth...\"- He added, angrily. and fire surrounded his hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, before spilling blood, I'll try to persuade them...\"- Blake said, and walked in front of them -\"Listen, bandits, I don't know you, but I'll tell you that we have nothing of value here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Naive young man. We aren't after things this time. We were given the mission to catch people...\"- One of them said, and his voice was creepy, the only thing visible was that he had long straight red hair, also, in different of the rest, he was wearing a very long, light beige cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do we look like guys you'd have at a house cleaning up? Don't make me laugh!!\"- Caesar said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WE are a Mercenary Squad!!\"- Ayrton said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's good. We were sent to find strong people, heh...\"- Another bandit said, this one was shorter, and had short black hair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then you leave us no choice. Under the 88th article of King's law, we have the right to defend ourselves, by killing you...\"- Ferdinand said, showing his scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no more words, Blake and his friends dashed toward the bandits. Blake fought the long red haired one, who seemed to be the leader. Ferdinand fought the shorter black haired one. Caesar started fighting a shaven headed one. Ayrton and Gustave started fighting another long haired one, but this ones' hair was white. Blake tried to slash his opponent with his sword, but he kept dodging, and connected quick hits on Blake, who was starting to lose patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he closed his eyes and aimed his hand at his enemy, and his hand glowed in golden as Blake muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shining light from the heavens, vanish the darkness, enlighten, erase the evil, destroy this soul...\"- He shot a powerful golden beam at the red haired bandit, who opened his eyes wide in surprise. It caused a large explosion*...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... a light magician... I thought they died in the war, that's what the books said... Impressive...\"-  The bandit leader was covering himself with his cape, and his clothes had slight burns, Blake said nothing, and the bandit added -\"But you should know better, our job is to catch any person, thus, we must be stronger than any other person... Now that I've found that you're from a rare race, it'll just increase the amount I'll get paid for...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake said nothing, but dashed toward him, and tried to slash him again, this time, the bandit countered with a katana (particularly long, nearly 150 cm, though thin), the force of their clash cracked the ground, and the bandit noticed this, then, he moved swiftly, trying to stab Blake in the back, but much to his surprise, Blake knew it and fired a golden beam behind himself without looking, the beam pushed the bandit away for at least 150 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A beam with no incantation... heh, you sure are something...\"- He did some quick moves with his hands, and placed his right open palm on the ground, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Earth Battle Spell #42: Granite Spikes!!\"- And as soon as he said that, very sharp rock spikes rose from the ground, in a line which went toward Blake, who moved quickly and dodged them right before they would pierce him from beneath. But, he opened his eyes wide as he saw the bandit, with his two hands together, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Earth Sealing Spell #14: Rock Coffin!!\"- Blake was seemingly enclosed into a rectangle shaped coffin made of solid rock, and then the bandit said -\"Earth Sealing Spell #16: Quartz chains...\"- Two chains made of pure quartz wrapped themselves tightly around the coffin, the bandit was breathing heavily, and sighed in relief...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">*I mean, an explosion similar to a grenade, about 2 times larger. Not an atomic-like explosion.</font></b></span></div></div>",

I better take these off...\"- Blake said, and took off the metal rings around his wrists and ankles. The blue gem in his silver tag ceased to glow, and Blake put the rings away in his pocket. Then he closed and opened his right hand several times<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's been over 10 years I've fought with my full strength.... Let's see what I can do...\"- Blake muttered, and gave s slight punch to the coffin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit leader was helping the bandit that was fighting Gustave and Ayrton, and were having a hard time, specially with Gustave, who used fire techniques and kept burning their earth shields, as well as the rock knives they tried to shoot at them. Ayrton had seen the coffin, and knew that they got Blake enclosed into it, which angered him further, and using wind, he enhanced his speed enough to get behind the bandit leader and threatened him, putting his swords' blades (Ayrton fought using 2 swords) near the bandit's throat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You lose, sand scum... now release Blake!!\"-  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"- The bandit leader said, and closing his eyes, two arms made of rock rose from the ground, grabbing Ayrton in a tight grip, while the white haired bandit kept fighting Gustave. Until they heard something cracking, and the bandit leader opened his eyes wide as he saw his rock coffin breaking to pieces, as well as the quartz chains... And Blake was standing there, completely unharmed, until, he suddenly disappeared... and reappeared, behind him, the bandit leader barely had time to look at him before Blake punched him, creating a powerful shockwave, and sending him away enough to be out of sight (roughly 500 meters, or half of a mile)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyrton had his mouth wide open, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There are a lot of things I cannot explain, this is one of those. Now, go help Gustave, I'll take on this one\"- Blake said, and disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ferdinand was fighting with the black haired bandit, who wielded metal claws as his weapons against Ferdinand's scythe, who was very good with it, and could change from a quick block with the scythe's blade to a surprising counter. Both fighters were focused on using their melee combat abilities. Caesar was fighting a bandit that seemed older, rather an adult than another teenager, and was using chained hooks (2 in each hand, hold between his fingers), versus Caesar's long chain whip. Caesar was however, capable of piercing the bandit's shoulder, and send electricity though the chained whip, causing heavy damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explosions from electricity, fire, light, and even the dust risen from powerful earth techniques was visible from Kildevar. Rick (the duke) was starting to get worried, and went outside, and asked where was Blake's squad. It took a while for him to find out that they went to the forest to hang out. He returned to his house, and was walking around frantically. He thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They are definitively in trouble... if I ask support from the Royal Army they're going to kill Blake and Ferdinand... And if I don't, they might not make it... and sending my personal guard is suicide... What should I do?! Blake and his squad are actually my best men... not to mention the debt to my old friend...' His thoughts were interrupted as the maid asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is something wrong, my lord?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes. Probably Blake and his squad are in trouble...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why don't you call the Royal Army?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've already told you. If they find out about Blake, they'll kill him, is friends, and maybe even me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's so bad about Blake?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" *Sigh* I can't tell you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you going to do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I...don't...know...\"- Rick said -\"The only thing I can do without causing further trouble is pray to God that they get out of there alive and safe...\"- He said, and it could be seen that he was very concerned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Blake and the bandit leader... far enough to not be heard or seen by the others...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Spell breaker and speed enhancing spells... nothing new...\"- The bandit said, brushing off the dust (ironically) from his cape<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope. You're very wrong if you think I used spells. This is my real strength and speed...\"- Blake disappeared again, the bandit leader, instinctively turned around, but Blake knew this and appeared behind him (if he hadn't turned around it'd be in front of him) and kicked him upward, sending him very high into the sky. Blake appeared next to him and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know what sucks about earth magicians?... they can't fight in air...\"- Blake said, who connected a lot of punches and kicks while they started to fall, after a considerable combo, Blake clutched his hands together, and double axe-handle punched him, sending him downward and into the ground, rising huge amounts of dust, and crating a large crater (deeper rather than wider)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake landed safely near the crater, and drew his sword. The bandit leader climbed up and got out of the crater, this time, he had some bleeding wounds, but he didn't seem to care, and after doing a quick move with his right hand, knives made of rock appeared in his hand and he started throwing them at Blake, who blocked them, using his sword's wide blade as a shield (His sword looked like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.tantra.ph/mudha/images/nikrato.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tantra.ph/mudha/images/nikrat...</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the bandit leader moved quickly, trying to attack in an open point in Blake's defense, but he swung his sword, creating an horizontal C-shaped wave of golden energy, which, although missed, prevented the bandit from attacking. Blake quickly turned around and hit the ground with his sword, creating a shockwave that knocked the bandit off his feet. Blake then shot three golden energy balls at him, and apparently hit their target, causing small explosions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the smoke vanished, the red bandit could be seen, he had activated a solid rock shield, which got cracked, and it turned to dust after some seconds. The bandit then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is inhuman... Nobody had broken a rock coffin and quartz chains through sheer strength... And nobody other than us can generate quakes...\"-, then, the dust rose from the ground and patched his wounds, and healed them. Then, he laughed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is a real earthquake!!\"- He did other moves with his hands, then put them together, and said -\"Earth Battle Spell #71: Great Quake!!\"- The ground beneath Blake cracked, and he moved quickly away from it. The ground started to shake violently, but Blake punched hard the ground, causing a wide and deep crater, and the quake stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...what?!!\"- The bandit was confused, and before he realized, Blake was in front of him, grabbed him by the face and slammed him against the ground, the impact caused a smaller quake and clouds of dust rose from it. Blake kept punching the bandit until he shot a wave of fire at him. Blake dashed back and drew his sword again, just in time to block another fire wave. The wind was swirling around the bandit, and it could be seen that he was angrier<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why you?!!\"-  The bandit said, and dashed toward Blake, his katana clashed against Blake's sword, and started an insane sword fight, both of them moved quickly, tried to slash and stab each other, and Blake was able to perform some amazing moves such as a 360 degree air spin, attempting to slash the bandit's shoulder from above, but he stopped it with his katana and pushed Blake away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ferdinand and his opponent were seemingly even, and had used only melee combat so far. However, Ferdinand perceived Blake was against a strong enemy, so, he started using dark magic, he formed a bow made of what looked like black fire, and shot an arrow made of the same thing to the black haired bandit's knee. The bandit said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A dark magician? I thought your King had wiped you out...\"- Ferdinand knew that what he just did was really risky, but he didn't feel like having much more time to waste on these thieves. Then, he swung his scythe and formed two C-shaped waves made of darkness, they caused a great explosion but apparently missed, until Ferdinand noticed that his opponent was limping, and that his right leg was bleeding...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, Caesar managed to pierce the shaven-headed bandit's chest, and forced a heavy electroshock on him, through his chained whip. He pulled his whip back, and the bandit stared at him blankly, then, he fell to the ground, dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyrton and Gustave were having a hard time against the white haired bandit, because he was using a lot of powerful higher level earth spells, which such as a quartz shield, which were able to block Gustave's fire attacks, and Ayrton's Wind cutter (Similar to other waves, this one is made of wind, and in difference of the others, this one cuts rather than exploding). Until a thunderbolt struck him from above, Gustave and Ayrton turned around to see Caesar, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Need some help?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually yes, but Ferdinand and Blake are fighting alone over there...\"- Ayrton said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know, but they can handle it. And you know Blake fights hates interference when fighting one on one...\"- Caesar replied, Gustave noded in agreement, while Ayrton said no more because it wouldn't change things<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, let's take care of this one quickly, then we'll help out Ferdinand\"- Caesar said, cracking his knuckles...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake saw what Ferdinand did, and knew that he couldn't let these bandits go alive, not after witnessing one of the last living dark magician. Blake sighed, thinking <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This terrible power is what led to my people's downfall... the power of darkness caused their deaths, by fear, of them becoming dangerous... I hate what this does to us, what it has done to me, to Ferdinand... It probably also got my father killed... But right now, I have no other choice than killing all these bandits as quickly as possible'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake took off the silver chain with the tag he always wore, and put it away in another pocket. The instant he did that, his heart started to beat faster, and louder (though Blake was the only one who could hear it, of course), his hair started waving upward, like a flame. And his eyes whited out (became iris and pupil-less). The wind started to swirl around him violently, and small dark flames were visible around him along the wind. Then, he dashed toward the bandit, who formed a thick rock solid shield, but Blake broke it with a single punch, and, after grabbing the bandit by the throat, smashed him on the ground again, and pinned him with his left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then shot an immense dark beam that bounced off the ground as a massive pillar of black reddish fire (That's what's darkness like here, though Ferdinand's is bluish instead). Then, without warning, a purplish dark beam struck Blake from above, and the white haired bandit stood in front of him. Blake got up and turned around to see two of the bandits dead (the shaven-headed and the short haired one) and his friends laying unconscious. Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I-Impossible... w-who...what the hell are you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't have to know\"- The white haired bandit's eyes glowed in red (before, they were mistaken for dark brown), and had a purplish dark flame in his hand, then he said -\"Now that nobody's watching, fight me with all you've got!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought the bandits were earth magicians...\"- Blake replied, and dashed toward his new enemy, their firsts clashed and caused a powerful shockwave that even shook Kildevar's buildings. They started moving at insane speeds, exchanging dark beams, which caused more explosions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit earlier, at Kildevar, the people was starting to get scared, and kept asking the duke about what to do, also, they started to push him to bring the Royal Army<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Listen, people of Kildevar. I don't know what's going on, but our mercenary squad is fighting whatever might threaten our safety. Please trust them, they've worked here for three years and have stopped crime, and we've been enjoying peace thanks to them. I only ask you to stay calm\"- Rick said, and the crowd calmed down, until someone shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I saw clearly earth dust, and we felt an earthquake not too long ago. That can only mean that we're under the Sand Bandits' Attack\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!!\"- Rick said, and the crowd became very worried again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Listen, let's give it some more time... if this doesn't stop at noon, I'll send my personal guard\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We need the Royal Army!! Only they can handle such a thing!!\"- The crowd shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just calm down, what if Blake and his squad stop this threat? We'd have brought the Royal Army for nothing, and they'd be mad, you know how are the General and the King about these sort of things\"- Rick said, and people started to go to their houses when they saw a massive pillar or dark fire rise from the ground. It was so massive that blocked the sun for a moment. The people didn't move an inch, but kept staring at Rick, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... I'll send a message to the Royal Army\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecretly, he wrote another message in a scroll, which said<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'Blake. I don't know what's going on there, but people has become very worried and scared, and what happened recently forced me to bring the Royal Army, as there are rumors about the sand bandits. If they find you, you and your friends will be executed. Get outta there ASAP!! I personally thank you very much for your services, and I know that you were the mysterious person who helped people. Take this as a gift, and use it wisely. You have to go as far as possible from here. Maybe you could go back to some place you've been before, I know there's people willing to help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick - Duke of Kildevar<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS: In case you forgot... GET THE HELL OUTTA THERE!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled it and put it in a small bag, which was nearly full of gold coins. He sent a messenger to the woods, and told him to watch them, if the fight ended, or if the Royal Army started to get near there. In both cases, he would need to deliver the message to Blake and to see that they get far enough. He also gave him money to buy a few knives and a sword just in case...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe messenger went to see a blacksmith, who was the man Blake saved the previous day. After learning what the messenger was there for, he gave him his best weapons for free, and gave him some golden coins to add to the bag. The messenger left, and as soon as he started walking into the woods, he could feel the powerful shockwaves, and saw traces of black fire in the sky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Blake's fight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept trying to punch and kick this bandit with long white hair, but he was able to dodge and counter his attacks. They also shot powerful dark waves at each other, but they cancelled and exploded when hitting each other, which meant that this guy was as powerful as Blake, who was surprised by this, and muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dark magic... this guy is definitively NOT an earth magician... but how can that be? Ferdinand and me are the last living ones!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you scared? You should... stupid little kid. You certainly overwhelmed that sand bandit with such power, but that doesn't intimidate someone like me!!\"- He disappeared and reappeared next to Blake, and aimed his open palm in front of Blake's face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bye bye...\"- The white haired bandit said, and fired a massive purplish dark energy ball, which, again, was visible from Kildevar. The explosion was extremely intense, and shook Kildevar to the point that some houses and stores collapsed, also, people saw the traces of dark energy, though only the older people knew what it meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was now lying unconscious, and reverted to his normal state. Just in time, the white haired bandit's eyes stopped glowing and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmph... Not bad, but it seems you haven't used darkness in a while... how funny, attempting to deny what you truly are...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the bandit leader woke up groggily, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ouch... my head... everything hurts...\"- Then he saw Blake and his friends laying unconscious, then, he looked at the white haired bandit, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's all ready. I managed to knock these guys out...\"- He pretended to be wounded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah. You're really good. But... it cost us two of our team members... Our bosses won't be happy\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They will when you get your payment from that deal. I'll tell you what. Sell them this guy, we don't want him at a normal house, which he can escape easily from...\"- The white haired pointed his finger at Blake. Then, the bandit leader picked him up, and felt a sudden pain as something attacked him from behind. He quickly recovered, and saw an angry giant cat* hissing furiously...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... we forgot about this thing...\"- The bandit leader said, and a rock fell from above, hitting Tabitha's head, leaving her unconscious. The white haired bandit said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're taking her as well. We'll get a juicy reward for such a rare and expensive animal\"- The white haired bandit lifted her up, and placed her, as well as Blake's friends, in a very solid rock cage, reinforced with four quartz chains. Blake was chained with diamond+ chains around his wrists, ankle, abdomen and neck, to a cage made of diamond, inside another rock cage, which was reinforced with 4 diamonds chains wrapped around it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is NOT good...\"- The messenger sent by Rick said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>*Just to remind readers: They are supposed to be a certain species of cats, used for riding and carrying things, though they are really expensive, as Gustave said.

I would've lost more men if I sent a weaker team after such a mission. Then, get prepared, because the rest of the teams are busy right now, so, you'll have to do the delivery as well\"- The tall man, who seemingly was their superior, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, sir\"- The red haired bandit said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"One moment. I think we can get more money out of those people...\"- The white haired bandit said -\"Just sell them the strongest one, it's not like we want him near us, or in a house from which he can escape with no problem... and we might make him very, very expensive...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I like how you think\"- The tall man said, then he added -\"Then, deliver that one, and we'll sell the rest for high prices as well\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll get going sir\"- The red haired bandit said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When you return, you can have two days off. And make sure to check the apprentices, you'll need to add two of them to your team...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes sir\"- The red haired bandit replied, then he said to his white haired partner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's a bit of a long trip. Can you take care of the other guys until we sell them?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white haired bandit nodded as an answer, and the red haired started to get going. It wasn't that difficult since he formed wheels made of rock under the cage that kept Blake prisoner, and had two camels pulling it, despite this, he preferred to travel on a plain rock (surfing-like, using his earth abilities) rather than mounting one of them. Hours passed, and after roughly 6 hours Blake woke up, just to find himself bleeding and in a dark place, chained everywhere, he couldn't move, and because he used a lot of power, he had little strength left, perhaps, enough to survive the travel, to wherever those crazy bandits where taking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake couldn't know how much time had passed, it was hot, dark, and couldn't move. He was also hungry, and thirsty, but nothing he couldn't endure. What he hated was the idea of being sold as a slave, he could almost see some random man buying him, and use him to clean the house and do everything, specially disgusting tasks, for a miserable portion of food that wouldn't let him get back to his full strength, and would probably get whipped as well. The better case was that of a domestic slave for a woman, generally, wife to an important person, such as a duke, or a count (though Rick didn't make use of slaves, he had maids and paid them, as well as providing them with food and decent living)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake also considered that they might take him to some spectacle manager, elegant name for a gladiator manager, who would find Blake's abilities very attractive for bloody spectacles, for which the people paid a lot to watch. Blake might return to his full power, but it'd be still difficult to escape, as Elite-level guards usually keep the gladiators from that. Some captains and colonels were known for using their men for this, and are extremely rich because of the two jobs, on the Elite ranks, paid by the King, and by their own earnings from gladiator fights... Blake hated this idea. It was true that he was a mercenary, but he only worked on stopping crime, and defending villages unattended by the Royal Army (They used to bully people and take their stuff away, and nobody could complain, because anyone who dared would probably get killed by them)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake thought again, about the bandits' words <i>\"That's good. We were sent to find strong people, heh...\"</i> What could they mean? What would someone want a warrior like Blake for? He kept wondering, he knew it didn't matter, because on the end, he'd find out the bad way, but this at least kept his mind busy, as he neither knew how long had he been there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only good thing about being tightly wrapped in chains, was that he didn't feel the bumps along the ride, but this was of little help, Blake was far more worried about where would he end up. He also thought the possibility of being brought to the King, just to be executed for being a living dark magician. He was told by his grandma that if he was ever caught by the King, that's what would happen to him, that's what kept Blake and Ferdinand from trying to get into the Royal Army. Blake would have prayed for this not to happen, however, he had little to do when finally, the hunger and tiredness knocked him unconscious again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, it had passed 2 days, and by the look in the red haired bandit's eyes, they were near their destination. It was an immense village, literally, all buildings were like they were scaled over 50 times their normal size. Anyone with a small bit of brain would know that it was obvious that giants lived here, however, the bandit was not worried, and entered the village without fear. But, despite it couldn't be seen because of the bandages he wore, he was truly surprised, he had never seen such a place in his entire life. The inhabitants were roughly 150 feet tall. Anyone else (normal sized) would be scared and run away, but the bandit was confident on his power and the threat of Sand Bandits' enmity. He headed to a gigantic castle, which didn't need a moat due to its sheer size and its inhabitants' size as well (Thus, it didn't have the typical bridge-door thing, but still, it had an immense door)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camels stopped, and the chains they were pulling turned into dust (they were made of rock as well), then rock chains appeared to keep the camels from escaping.  The red haired bandit walked toward the door, rose from the ground with a earth platform that went up to 100 feet tall, and used a big hand made of rock to knock the door. A giant girl (blonde, with short hair, slightly shorter than the rest, possibly around 200 feet tall), seemingly 17-18 years old opened it, and wasn't very surprised of seeing the tiny (to her) bandit, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, did you bring what we agreed?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course. And let me tell you that this is of the best ones, it was very difficult to capture him\"- The bandit said, though the girl rolled her eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It would have been easier for any of us, but since your king exiled us and threatened us with war, we needed someone else to do it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We aren't under the king's orders\"- The bandit said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever...\"- Replied the giant girl -\"So, where is it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's outside, but now, let's discuss the payment. This specimen was extremely difficult to capture, and it cost two of our teammates lives. So I expect a good payment\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, it was only one, but if what you said is right and is particularly strong, I guess it was worth it\"- She put on the ground a giant bag filled with...guess what? giant gold coins. The bandit used a giant hand made of earth to grab it, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's a few meters behind me, in a rock cage, though to you it's more of a box\"- The giant blonde girl called for another girl, an asian-looking one (also, slightly taller than her)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Claire? Can you bring that rock box inside? It's a very special thing...\"- The girl nodded and brought the box inside. The bandit left, and they closed the castle's doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it, Karina?\"- Claire asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Something very rare and expensive...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"More jewelry?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"New shoes?\"- Claire asked, and Karina slapped her forehead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Open it and look by yourself\"- She said, and Claire complied. Inside it, was a tiny guy, wrapped in lots of chains<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is this a toy or something?\"- Claire asked, Karina sighed and started removing the chains (which was very easy for anyone that size). After the \"mess\" was removed, it remained a tiny unconscious guy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's a man...\"- Karina said, a bit surprised, as she had never seen one in her entire life, only in books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is he alive?\"- Claire asked, seeing Blake's terrible condition<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He must, otherwise, that bandit is going to suffer a lot...\"- Karina said, and noticed lots of wounds on him -\"At least he was telling the truth, it seems that he gave quite a fight to them... We better start healing him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are we going to do with him?\"- Claire asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WE? Nothing. It's for the princess...\"- Karina replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Awww...\"- Claire said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe in the future we might get more, but for now, this one will be for the princess. Royalty's first, you know. And we can't let the royal family die out like this. Anyway, it was with good timing. The princess will turn 18 in a few days...\"- Karina said, and put Blake to rest in a bowl with what looked like hot water, plus some herbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Take care of him. I'll go tell the princess\"- Karina said to Claire and left...</span></div></div>",

Apparently, he was in a large bathtub, and the water smelled of healing herbs, Blake thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can this be? I was sold as a slave... unless...No, that can't be, this place looks like nothing I've seen before... I wonder...' Blake said, not moving yet, but his eyes were open, and opened even wider when he saw a girl's face, a lot bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT IN THE NAME OF...?!\"- The girl put her index finger on Blake's mouth, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sshhh... calm down, little man...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"MFFFF MFF MFFFFFMFFF!\"- Blake said, muffled by her finger, and she moved her finger away from him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How can I calm down? My friends and me were captured by some crazy bandits! And they sold me as a slave! And I'm not little, you're FREAKING HUGE!!\"- Blake shouted, though, much to his dismay, the girl giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You look as you had never seen a giant before\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't even know giants existed in the first place!\"- Blake said, still very angry, and tried to get up, but some of his wounds reopened, and fell down in pain (still in the bowl)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should rest for now. Your wounds haven't healed yet...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of all people, why would YOU buy a slave like me?!! I can't do any thing you'd expect from a slave, you'd need a giant slave for that!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Believe me, you can do things we can't...\"- Claire said, trying to sound seductive<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like what? Killing giant mice?! Cleaning small places?! For the love of...\"- Blake was interrupted again by Claire putting her index finger on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Calm down. Anger is not good for your health\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And you care about my health?!\"- Blake said, angry and sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course. You need to be in good health\"- Claire replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh...\"- Blake said -\"I am SO going to hate this...\"- Then he thought 'Maybe I have better chances of escaping, I guess it would be difficult for them see someone my size going out through a window...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire giggled again, somehow, it was cute to her that he knew nothing about giants, and also, somehow, Blake's reaction was a bit comical...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By the way... What's your name?\"- She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Does it matter?\"- Blake said, still mad, at himself for being wounded, and for losing the fight, at the bandits for kidnapping him and selling him to giants, and at this girl for trying to be cheerful when he's gonna be a mere slave...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It does\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"- He said, reluctantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm Claire\"- She said, and winked at him, just to find that he closed his eyes, leaving her with a \u00ac///\u00ac expression (angry/blushing) -\"H-Hey!!\"- She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!! Do you expect me to be happy about this? You still haven't told me what the hell do you want me for!!\"- Blake answered, angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... I'm not the one to tell you that... the princess should tell you herself\"- Claire replied, while Blake could hear a glass breaking in his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A...a princess?!!\"- Blake had a nearly petrified expression and his mind was already creating horrible images, possibly a 12 -13 years old spoiled brat, maybe ugly, or maybe just with lots of freckles and a geeky look, pigtails (why? don't ask me, maybe because they look childish, I dunno). Blake also imagined that he'd probably be treated as a hamster or an animated toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"G-G-goddammit!! Of all things!! A toy?!!\"- Blake got up, and despite some of his wounds reopened again, he didn't care, and attempted to escape by jumping out of the bowl (He had no weights on, so, he can jump far, though not as much as he would if he were fully healed). Then he started to run, screaming -\"There's no way IN HELL I'll become an oversized spoiled brat's toy!!\"- He almost got out of the room (equivalent to a living room, by the way) but the gigantic door was closed, and the space beneath was not enough for him to escape. Claire towered over him, and he gulped hard, she picked him up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're not going to heal if you keep running like this\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I DON'T WANT TO HEAL! I WANT TO GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE!\"- Blake kept struggling and more wounds reopened. He started to get weakened, and Claire said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were too expensive, I can't let you die like that. Anyway, Karina would kill me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Please, for whatever you believe in, let me go...\"- Blake attempted to appeal to her mercy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's not going to work\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you want me to do?! I'll do anything if you get me out of here...\"- Blake said more desperately, and Claire was somewhat tempted, but knew that Karina would be extremely mad, as well as pretty much all people, for stealing princess' birthday gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry. I can't help you. What you have to do is lie there, relax, get healed and stay with the princess\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Seriously, a human?! That's the best you thought of?! There are things called TOYS! I won't be a toy for whatever spoiled brat you call a princess!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually it was Karina's idea... well, not exactly, we were seeking for a human male...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aren't there other ones?! Why me?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's a long story. I dunno much about it, only that we were exiled by your king under threats of war, and since we don't have males, that would only make our extinction faster...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Extinction...\"- Blake's mind was processing the information, then, it hit him in the head like a brick thrown from a castle tower... -\"W-wa-wa-wait... if you want me because you're endangered... that means...\"- Blake gulped hard, and added -\"You want me to...\"- Claire nodded, as she knew that he realized...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"THIS IS A LOT WORSE THAN BEING A TOY! Let me go!\"- Blake was starting to open Claire's hand, and she used both hands to enclose him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Please! You can't do this to me!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I won't do anything. The princess will...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aaaaarghhhhh!!\"- Blake's scream was so strong that nearby birds fled from the trees...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire placed him in a thick transparent jar, and poured the healing water in there (With Blake standing up, it went barely past his ankles, so, he could just lay and let the water do its job). Karina came in immediately<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Claire!! What happened?!! I heard a scream...\"- Then she looked at the jar, with the human the bandits brought punching and kicking it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He screamed because he learned what he's here for...\"- Claire said, giggling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He doesn't seem happy about it...\"- Karina commented -\"It's not like that matters. I bought him legally, and belongs to the princess\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"LEGALLY?! What the HELL?! What kind of kingdom allows giants to buy people?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ours\"- Karina and Claire replied, and both giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I demand you to cancel this! I'm not from your kingdom, the law doesn't apply, I'm a foreigner!\"- Blake said (he was running out of ideas)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorry, but only your king may rescue you, only he and his army are powerful enough to threaten us...\"- Karina answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's it!! I need to contact Rick! He's a duke, he might get me out of this mess!' Blake thought, but also knew that the possibilities to contact him were nearly of 0%, so, he decided to go on with his plan to escape, punching and kicking the jar, although he was doing it slowly, because of the pain he was feeling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's stubborn, but cute\"- Claire said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I bet you that he'll change his mind once he sees the princess\"- Karina said, then she called her -\"Your Majesty, you may come in...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake gulped hard, and stopped for a moment. Although he didn't really want to see the princess, his curiosity would force him to (He was thinking more like \"How bad/ugly will this spoiled brat be?). She came in. It was a girl taller than the others, with fair skin, wavy brown hair, and hazel eyes. As well as large breasts but Blake didn't really pay attention to that. He stared at her for 10 seconds in shock, and Karina laughed, saying to Claire<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Blake turned around and started to punch, kick and throw energy frantically at the jar, cracking it slightly, and kept giving stronger punches and kicks, more frantically than ever<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... he changed his mind\"- Claire said sarcastically, she had perceived before that Blake wouldn't really care of what the princess looked like, he'd try to escape anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why is he... trying to break the jar?\"- The princess asked, shyly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, you stop doing that!\"- Karina ordered to Blake, but he didn't listen, and kept trying more frantically than ever. He managed to dent the thick glass and was cracking it more and more, then, he shot a golden beam from his two hands and caused an explosion (small to the girls). After that, he was breathing very heavily, and with his hands trembling (by pain and tiredness) he drew his sword and started hitting the jar, and began to splinter it. Claire walked next to the jar and was about to take Blake out when he stopped, and fell unconscious again. The medicinal water turned red from the blood that was shedding from Blake's wounds, all of them reopened due to his desperate efforts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhm... I guess you'll have you acquaint with him when he wakes up. But it'd be better that you keep him at your room. If he tries to escape just call us, Majesty\"- Karina took Blake from the jar and put him on the princess' open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll get more healing water\"- Claire said, and left. And so, the princess took Blake to her room, although very shyly...</span></div></div>",

Some richer people came in their fancy clothes, and then one man stood in his brown cloak.  They were sold as a group.  The auction started and ended with his bid.  He pulled them along, chained up, wounded, and mentally destroyed.  He reached his carriage and left with them.  He pulled aside a ways from the auction and unchained them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know exactly who you are and what you want.\" They were all shocked that this man was so forward.  \"You want Blake, I want Blake.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hours later, in the giantesses' castle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess was contemplating the little human Karina and Claire gave her. She didn't really know what to do (Karina was going to start explaining about it when they heard Blake's scream). He was laying unconscious in a bowl with medicinal water inside a small cage, to keep him from escaping. He was sleeping, and moved a bit in his sleep. After a while, she noticed that it was more like a nightmare, his arms were moving a bit, as if they were swinging his sword, which had been conveniently put away by the princess on her nightstand. Despite what it seems, she was more worried about him getting hurt rather than afraid of him escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe muttered in his dream/nightmare 'I..am...not...guilty....I...was...born like this...you...can't blame...me...for that' This confused the princess, who started to wonder who was really that little guy. He seemed to be suffering in his dream, and by what she heard, he was in some sort of trial. After some minutes, he kept moving while in the medicinal water, and sat up quickly, exclaiming<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not going to die!!\"- Then he realized that it had been all a dream, and said -\" *Phew!* Good thing nobody heard me...\"- And when he looked around, he noticed a different giant girl staring at him, he fell backward and got some water in his mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the?! *Gasp* \"- Blake then coughed out some water, which by the way had a stronger taste, as it was more concentrated to accelerate his healing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to scare you...\"- She apologized, Blake recognized this girl as the princess (Or in his own words, \"the spoiled brat\"). He sat up, and checked his wounds. They closed again, but would reopen with another big effort, he sighed, calculating that he'd need at least 3 days to fully recover. Then he looked around, and noticed the cage around the bowl where he had been laying unconscious. 'I guess they don't make the same mistake twice' He thought, and now, with the girl watching him, there was no way he could escape...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then noticed that his sword was no longer there, and slapped his forehead 'Dammit!! Just what I needed... I can't lose that sword, I need to get it back...' he thought, and searched for it, soon he found it on the nightstand. Blake opened and closed his hands repeatedly 'Maybe I can still pull a last attempt off' and prepared himself, a ball of pale golden energy started to charge up in his left hand (while it was behind his back). He then said, almost whispering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Gold shining light. The source of all life, gather in my hand, lend me the power to destroy my enemy, purify, vanish the darkness...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the ball changed to a darker and stronger golden color, and shot it at the cage's padlock, exploding and destroying it. The princess got scared by this, and suddenly, felt something hitting her in the stomach with tremendous force, making her to fall back on her bed. Much to her surprise, Blake had quickly gotten his sword back, and was pointing one of its bladed edges at her throat. He even pushed it slightly so she felt the cold and sharp metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I may not be gigantic, but I'm not someone to be underestimated...\"- She gasped, and Blake said -\"Any word, any suspicious move, and I'll cut your neck, understood?\"- She nodded, very scared. Then Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Honestly, I have nothing against you. But I'm NOT for sale!! And I'm NOT GOING to be your property!!\"- Blake then charged what looked like another golden energy ball, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you don't say anything, I'll just leave, and you'll see me never again...\"- She could hear the energy charging in his hand -\"BUT... if you try to have those giant girls to catch me, I'll blow your head with a beam...\"- Then the door was suddenly opened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your Majesty, it's dinner t...\"- Karina entered, and the first she saw was the princess laying on her bed, and the little human was pointing a sword at her throat as well as a charging energy ball -\"How dare you to treat the Princess like that?!!\"- She said angrily, and tried to dash toward him to catch him, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm outta here\"- He jumped quickly and escaped through the open window. Despite Karina was really mad, she first checked on the princess, and asked her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened? Are you hurt?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know, there was an explosion, and before I knew anything, he appeared in front of me. But he said he wouldn't hurt me, he just wanted to leave...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina facepalmed herself, then she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"With all due respect, Your Majesty, you could have easily have pinned him down with your hand...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No... I couldn't, he was too fast\"- The princess denied with her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll go after him\"- Karina said, and called for Claire and explained her the situation, soon, they ran outside and started searching, leaving an even more confused, and a bit scared princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He can't get too far, this place is immense to him...\"- Claire said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I better hope so. He cost us too much to let him go like that...\"- Karina said, angry again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blake was dashing* the fastest he could. He knew the girls would be after him, and that they'd search in grass and ground in general, so, he climbed a gigantic tree and resumed escaping by jumping from branches to other branches, until a huge house blocked his way. He would go around it in normal circumstances, but he knew he'd waste a lot of time, and time was what he needed, so, he decided to sneak in, though the window, go in a straight line and get out of the house as silently as he entered. And so, he saw the window, and jumped toward it, but the bad thing was that Blake's legs failed for a brief moment, due to the constant strain and that Blake hadn't given himself time to rest and fully recover, which resulted in him crashing through the window, instead of landing near it and sliding beneath a small opening, Blake ended up landing in a table...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake got some cuts from the glass, and quickly took out the glass pieces stuck in his shoulders and arms. He also noticed that his wounds were reopening again. 'Damn!!' He thought, and when he prepared to run, he noticed a giant woman at his left, who was sitting at her table, which <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Argh... just great... I had to crash into that goddamn window... it's obvious I did some noise...\"- Blake also noticed that the woman was staring at him, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry. I don't have money to pay that broken glass. My presence here it's just an accident...\"- He prepared again to leave and the woman said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Blake was confused, and didn't trust giant women after what happened some minutes before -\"I don't mean to be rude, ma'am, but I can't stay here, nor anywhere near here. I need to go back to my home village\"- Despite Blake knew he had no home land, he wouldn't waste more time to explain that woman, and a simple excuse was all he needed. However, the woman said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're hurt...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll take care of that later... wait!!\"- The woman grabbed Blake in her hand, and this time he had little strength left to oppose more resistance. By the way, this woman was thin, with wavy waist-length brown hair, fair skinned, and had emerald green eyes. Blake couldn't determinate her age by her look, she looked like she was in her 20's. or did he care, he wished that she wasn't going to give him back to the princess and her servants (SPECIALLY her servants).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought him near her eyes, and Blake assumed she was checking his wounds, although he didn't understand why a giantess would help a human she doesn't know, but his thoughts were interrupted when he was abruptly moved, and the woman gave him a very tight hug. She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My baby!!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"W...What?!!\"- Blake said, then, after realizing what she said he muttered -\"Oh God... why did I have to sneak in this house... this woman is crazy!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she released her hug, Blake said, trying to sound as polite as possible -\"Excuse me, ma'am. But you're obviously mistaking me for someone else. I am not related to you in any way...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course you are. You are my little baby...\"- The woman said happily, with a n_n face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I AM NOT YOUR BABY!!\"- Blake shouted angrily, and tried to leave, more desperate than before -\"This woman is totally nuts for sure...\"- He muttered, but the woman closed her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Listen, how can you seriously think I'm your baby?! You're a giant!! I'm a human!!\"- Blake said, struggling against her grip, and noticed that her expression became more serious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't believe me, do you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course not!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can prove it\"- The woman said, still sounding serious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh really?\"- Blake said, with a challenging tone -\"Let's make a bet. If you can prove it, I'll stay. If you're wrong, you let me go...\"- The woman nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Dash: A fast move, which consists of Blake \"disappearing\" and \"reappearing\". It's not teleporting, it's just Blake's raw speed. Also, despite he apparently disappears from eyesight for brief moments, that doesn't mean he can't collide with things. The length and speed of these dashes depends on Blake's health and skill.</span></div></div>",

You have a blue beauty mark in your left shoulder...\"- The woman said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake opened his eyes and mouth wide. He knew he had that blue beauty mark, (And there was no way she could see it, since he was wearing a black shirt and a black cape on top of it) and his grandma told him that it was his mother's family's mark... (Although Blake was never told who was his mother)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There has to be something wrong... This isn't possible... this isn't happening...\"- Blake's hands were trembling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guessed you wouldn't believe me... but it's true, you are my son...\"- She said, sounding even sweeter -\"Although not a proof... the scar you have in your right eye is identical to your fathers'...\"- She added<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"But... I am a human... how can a giant be my mother?!!\"- Blake had never been so confused in his life<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's a very long story...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then, why did you never say anything, tell my grandma where to find you?!!\"- Blake was angrier at the revelation that his mother was a giant and that she didn't seem to care about him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We had to keep you secret until you were old enough... Blake... in the rest of people's eyes, you are the fruit of a forbidden relationship... well, technically, of two forbidden relationships...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -\"You must be aware that you are a Zasshu... aren't you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's a Zasshu?\"- Blake had heard the word before, and remembered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He had lived his entire life with his grandmother. His only friend and neighbor was Ferdinand. They lived in a forest, away from most of people. One day, when he was 9 years old, a furious crowd attacked him with no reason, Ferdinand came to help him (he was 10 years old), and they kept chasing after them, they tried to lose them inside the forest, but the crowd used torches to illuminate their way. The crowd kept shouting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Death to Dark magicians!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand and Blake got cornered, and started fighting back using dark magic and light magic, respectively, then, a man slashed Blake's face with a pitchfork (which would leave a scar in his left eye, which is one of Blake's most recognizable traits, though he always wore a hood to darken his face, preventing others from seeing it. Only Ferdinand knew of it). Ferdinand countered with dark beams and formed a shield in front of Blake, which made the man bounce off... Then another man tried to pull Blake by the arm, but he swung it, and threw away the man through a lot of trees at an insane distance. The people stopped for a moment, then they shouted more furiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Death to the Zasshu!! Death to the Zasshu!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's grandma appeared, and told them to go away. She told Blake that she had nothing else to teach him, and that he needed to live on, to move on, to go on his own. After he and Ferdinand got far enough, they saw a massive pillar of darkness rise, shaped like a double edged sword's tip. They knew what it meant... it was a forbidden spell, that needed a person's life to be performed. Blake fell to his knees, and tears dropped from his eyes. Ferdinand could only kneel next to him and put his hand on his shoulder... That was the only time anyone had ever seen Blake crying...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's the name humans gave to the hybrids born from a male human and a giantess...\"- Blake's mother interrupted his thoughts -\"A long time ago, the world was in peace. Giants and Humans lived together, until a certain rebel general decided to become the new King. That general was extremely powerful himself, and had an entire army of rebels, thieves, and renegades with him. The Seven Sages, and the King, with his army, weren't going to let it happen without a fight, and giants decided to help as well which meant it was a war between humans, giants, and rebel humans...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a horrible and long war... At first, we won. But it cost us a lot... all giant males died in that war, and there wasn't any male born... Some giantesses theorized that they might breed with humans, creating 1/2 human-giant hybrids, which were assumed to be larger than people but smaller than pure giants. Following that theory, they thought that if those hybrids kept breeding amongst themselves, the human blood would soon dilute until it was a very minimal portion, and these new hybrids wouldn't be much different from original giants. That was the plan to restore our species... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the rebel general returned, and convinced most of the people against the plan of restoring the giants' species, and with all that support, he managed to kill the King and take over the whole kingdom. As soon as he was crowned, he forbid any attempt to breed between humans and giants. Six of the Seven Sages, the most powerful magicians, rose up in arms once again. But the new King, and his new army branch, the Royal Elites, imprisoned 5 of them. Only the Dark Sage and his people, the dark magicians were left alive, because they escaped...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My father...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No... your grandfather...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But, if there were 5 imprisoned sages, and the Dark Sage, that makes 6. Where was the 7th?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was the Sage of Light. He died during the previous war...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see...\"- Blake said, and wondered why was he taught light spells being he born as a dark magician...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"With 5 sages imprisoned, one dead, and the other missing, there was nothing to stop the King, and he banished all giantesses, thus, the plan to restore our species was actually never done... although some men who lost their wives in war accepted to help marrying giantesses...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then?\"- Blake was already intrigued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought you wouldn't believe any of this...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I always wanted to know...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... the King made himself extremely powerful, and by sacrificing the 5 sages. Fire, Water, Wind, Thunder and Earth, he acquired all of their powers, and became nearly immortal by performing another spell... but the spell has a flaw...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What does that have to do with what happened to you and my father?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let me continue. The spell prevented any living species from killing the King, but at the moment it was done, there were no hybrids...  None of them had been born yet. Technically, that means only a hybrid can kill that King...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Some months later, the first hybrids were born, but much to our surprise, they were all female, and with time, they grew up just like normal giantesses. This raised our hopes because we thought it'd be easier than we thought to restore our species, until the first male hybrids were born... in difference of what we thought, they were human sized, but had inhuman abilities, almost like having a giant's strength compressed into a much smaller body. They were also very fast. Because of their size, they were taken to the villages in the kingdom, to be raised as ordinary people, but soon they realized of their abilities and started calling them Zasshu. Which has a negative meaning by the way...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And where were you at all this?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was about 10 years old by that time...\"- Blake's mother laughed -\"People started trying to kill the Zasshu, but they all got together, among some dark magicians, and commanded by the Dark Sage, they fought against the King and his army once more... The Zasshu proved to be even more powerful than the Elites, but they were outnumbered, and they all died. Before going to that battle, his wife and his son, who was 12 years old by that time, left, as well as the majority of dark magicians...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My father...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yup. And as you may assume, at some point I fell in love with him, but he wanted to avenge his father's death. He also told me that he was taught that the relationship between different sages was forbidden, because they'd bear a child with both powers...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't get it\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I am the Sage of Light's daughter...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah, stop right there... this is just too much... my mother is a giant, and now I end up being the son of two sages?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's why you are so special...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Special... not a word I'd use to describe myself...\"- Blake said -\"I'm more of a freak...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't be so hard to yourself. I hated that about your father...\"- She hugged Blake</span></div></div>",

Anyway, when he became 18, and I was 16, he claimed the title of Dark Sage. I knew that it meant he'd go on to fight the King as his own father did. However, he had not yet prepared an attack, and the Elites appeared, they were sent by the King to exterminate all dark magicians, which lived in self imposed exile as well, in difference of the other magicians, who despite losing their sages, still lived in the kingdom, under the King's orders...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all fought with all their power, but in the end, only your father and your grandmother, who were powerful enough, could defeat them. All other dark magicians were killed, though your father rescued a baby. The last living dark magician other than himself...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake gasped when he heard this -\"Ferdinand... he's the last pure dark magician...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's right. After a while, I finally convinced to marry me... and some time later, well, you know...\"- She blushed a bit -\"9 months later, you were born...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But... why didn't you keep me here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're the only living male hybrid. There were some bad things going around in here, and it was dangerous... also, as the only male around, you might have suffered a bit... also, carrying the blood of 2 Sages would be taboo and it was known that your father was the Dark Sage, and my father was the last Light Sage... you could have been executed...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...So, that's what Grandma meant...\"- Blake now understood -\"She said people would try to kill us for being dark magicians... but she always remarked that I'd be in danger...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your father's mother has more than all my respect. She took a responsibility that was not hers, and raised you, despite it was my obligation...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stood there. It had just been revealed to him that his mother was alive, though she was a giantess.. also that he has both the powers of the light and dark sages... and that his always unusual strength and speed were caused because of him being the only living male giantess-human hybrid. Blake even forgot why he came to this place in the first place, until it rang in his head. But first there was something he wanted to ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhm... what's your name? It's a bit weird that you told me that you're my mother but didn't tell me your name...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoops... I'm sorry. My name is Lith. But I don't mind if you call me 'mom'...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's too soon for that...\"- Blake replied, Lith saddened a bit, but she knew she was asking for too much, she got the chance to see her son grown up, and at least he didn't seem to hate her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You need to be healed...\"- Lith said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you going to start with that stuff? Meh... if you're the current sage of light, why don't you do a spell or something?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I want to... have a last chance of being a mom... I know I failed at it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was about to say something like \"It doesn't matter anymore\" But he realized that he'd hurt her feelings, more than they already seem to be... also, his internal instinct was also keeping him to do so, telling him without words, that this giant woman was his mother. Despite Blake showed very little emotion himself, he was perfectly capable of sensing others' emotions. His thoughts were interrupted again when Lith hugged him tightly again, and she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought you'd never learn who you really are, and that I would never see you... I missed you a lot...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had bandaged Blake's whole body, and before that, she had put some paste made of medicinal herbs. Blake was not saying anything just because he felt that Lith really wanted to be a mother at least for once. Then, while she was cooking something, she asked Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now tell me about you... what happened? I only raised you a year before your grandmother took you with her. How did you end here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't tell some things yet... but, I've had to go on my own for over half of my life. I formed a mercenary squad, and we wandered, went anywhere we had a job, and stayed for three years at a nice place* called Kildevar...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Kildevar? Does that place still exist?\"- Lith stopped cooking for a moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know Kildevar?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's where the dark magicians used to live, but when your father took me there, it was a beautiful landscape, uninhabited...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now it's a village. I guess things changed in 17 years...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How did you end up here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'll be hysterical if I tell you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"C'mon. I'm not that type of woman\"- Lith turned around and faced Blake, who was resting on the table<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just some days ago, I was with my friends, hanging out at the forest, we had a day off, when suddenly some strange guys called the Sand Bandits attacked us, we fought back but we lost... I lost consciousness... and when I woke up again, they were selling me as a slave...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Here?\"- Lith was a bit confused, but Blake was relieved that she didn't went hysterical as he had predicted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. They sold me to some crazy girls at some sort of castle... I had to do some crazy things to escape from that hellish place, and I ended up here because I was going as fast as possible to get away from them...\"- Blake lied about that, because he suspected that if his mother knew he threatened a princess, and ran off, she might be mad at him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The castle? Why would they want a slave?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I. don't. know. \"- Blake said those words separately, and somewhat lied, he knew what they really wanted him for, but he wasn't going to tell anyone that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you're safe here. To everyone, I'm just a common woman, a bit lonely but nothing unusual. I doubt the royalty is going to search for anything here\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks\"- Was Blake's only answer, and despite he was now relieved, Lith kept wondering why would the castle giantesses buy a human slave (Umm... yeah, Blake's relative naivety comes from her.. though hers is worse...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more minutes later, the food was ready. Lith made a nice vegetable soup (There aren't enough large animals to get meat from, so pretty much all giantess eat vegetables and fruits only. Though the royal family used to eat cows as well...). She even had a very small (to her) bowl and other stuff such as spoons, which were from the time she was married to James (Blake's father)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Blake it was very strange, he used to eat fruits from trees, and cooked meat from animals he hunt himself. He had never had a vegetable soup for a meal, but he was hungry (he didn't eat for 2 days) and tried it... it turned out to be really good. Lith noticed that he was enjoying it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your father loved this soup\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's really good\"- Blake finished in less than 5 minutes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wow, you were really hungry...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know for how long I didn't eat. I only know it was a long time, while those bandits brought me here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then here you go\"- Lith served him another bowl of soup (her agility at using tiny things comes from the time her husband was alive)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake started to eat the soup, when they heard that someone was knocking the door...</span></div></div>",

He was about twenty voice-wise and had a sister of about 18.  In the first 3 days, nothing had happened except for food and rest.  They sat at the basement if the inn, eating dinner when the man's sister Sarah came down.  Ferdinand and Gustave had both been flirting with her, something to due with her nice body and other things as well.  She was kind and modest, even denying offers of marriage from nobles due to their personality.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can one of you help me grab a crate of wine from the cellar?\" Ferdinand jumped up and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me milady.\" The man shook his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in a few minutes. You guys dig in before it gets cold.\" he leaves and begins sharpening weapons and gathering gold to get arrows crafted.  He walls out about ten minutes later and all are back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know all of you want Blake back.  Not only that, but I know why the royal army can't help.  I want to-\"\"How do you know all this?!\" Ayrton said, angered and surprised.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have connections.  They let me know.\" He said.  The table all seemed angry and scared for their friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tell you who my connections are.  They would be unhappy.\" Now they were outraged.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also why do you hide behind your hood?!\" Ayrton said as he tried to grab the hood.  The man caught his hand and threw him down with one arm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You NEVER try to lift my hood.  IS THIS UNDERSTOOD!?\" All were silent as he had gone from their generous savior to an enraged person who clearly had the potential to take them on in a fight.  They nod and he walks to his room and slams the door.  Sarah rushed down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?  I heard yelling.\" Ferdinand only said \"It was nothing.\" But he thought 'He really got upset because of the hood, just like Blake'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back to Blake and Lith...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was eating his second bowl of soup and Lith went to see who was knocking the door. She glanced through the window and saw Karina, a servant of the royal family, and the current counselor (as her mother was the royal family's counselor, but died by disease), in other words, she was running the royalty's businesses until the princess became a queen. Lith acted groggy, as if she just woke up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, Karina, what's the reason of your visit?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We lost something very important... and we think he might be somewhere near here\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Blake was not lying...' Lith thought, and crossing her arms, asked -\"What could have been so important?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina looked around, then she whispered to her -\"We acquired a human male. He's going to be the Princess' birthday gift...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLith couldn't help but scowl at that, but she pretended not to believe her, and asked -\"How did you get a human to come here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We had a deal with the Sand Bandits, since they operate outside the human kingdom's law, and selling slaves is their specialty. We asked for a young and strong one, but it seems he was a bit too strong. He was heavily damaged yet he was able to escape...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I have seen no- \"- Lith was interrupted by Claire, who said loudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's inside!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!!\"- Karina rushed inside the house, but Lith was faster and quickly grabbed Blake, who had just finished eating, and had no idea of what was going on -\"Lith. I have no time for games. Hand over that human, it's an order from the royal family...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No\"- Lith said firmly -\"He doesn't belong to you. And what's more, this boy is MY son...\"- Karina could almost feel the fire in Lith's green eyes, but couldn't allow that to stop her, and sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not what you think. The Princess will turn 18 in a week, and he is to be married to her...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?!!\"- Blake screamed, inside Lith's fist<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"- Lith asked, though no longer in an angry tone. Karina nodded in response. And Lith opened her hand and brought Blake near her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You said they bought you as a slave\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What else could it be?! Normal people isn't sold!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's sorta of a tradition... human men used to pay a certain amount of money to the bride's parents or the person responsible of her... given that here, there are very few men, it changed to the bride's family paying some money to the groom's family... But still, and under our own laws, it was illegal to pay those bandits...\"- Lith said, and while Blake was getting scared, her last phrase relieved him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait a minute... how is it possible... he's your son?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yup\"- Lith replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How's that possible?! Everyone knows all Zasshu died fighting the King along the penultimate Dark Sage... They even taught that at schools!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's why I kept him secret, and was raised among human people...\"- Lith added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is so incredible. And I thought I had only bought a ordinary human...\"- Karina seemed excited, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not yours anymore!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" *Sigh* I've already paid a lot for him, and he's really worth it. What do you think? Do you agree to give your consent for him to marry the Princess?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"W-What?!!\"- Blake asked, sensing the imminent danger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you serious?\"- Lith asked, and sounded enthusiastic about the idea<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lith, I don't want to make you feel guilty, but for THIS ONCE, protect me!! don't give me back to that spoiled brat!!\"- Blake hugged her cheek in desperation, and added -\"Please, I'm too young to have my life ruined... there are so many things I want to do, I want to go back with my friends, to keep doing mercenary jobs, to travel around the world, to hang out with no worries, please!! Don't ruin my life a second time...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLith had laughed at Blake's desperation until she heard he was serious, and the words <i>\"Don't ruin my life a second time\"</i> fell heavily on her heart. Blake was clinging to her cheek like she was about to drop him from a cliff, and her expression changed to a worried one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry. But I'm afraid I can't give my consent... he really looks scared...\"- Lith paused, then she asked -\"What did the Princess do to him to cause him to be like this?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina gasped at that question, and answered -\"NOTHING!! The Princess has done nothing to him, he was the one who hurt himself attempting to escape, he dismayed and was bleeding...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLith took Blake with her fingers and stared at him seriously -\"Is that true?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She hasn't done anything YET!!. I was unjustly captured and sold against my own will, and when the other servant explained me what was I there for, I had to escape!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You also threatened the Princess' life, and that's a serious crime...\"- Karina crossed her arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"- Lith sounded disappointed at her son<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you just let me go, it wouldn't have happened. Tell me how much did you pay for me and I'll pay you back every single coin!!\"- Blake answered to Karina, and she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even if you paid the money back, that doesn't help us. The money can't marry the princess, nor save the royal family from dying out.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then get someone else to do it...\"- Blake was growing angrier, and started to check his surroundings to pull off another escape. Lith said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're being mean...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"MEAN?!! Is it mean to refuse a forced marriage?!!\"- Blake was almost out of his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, it is. They're paying money for YOU. And it's the Princess we're talking about. You would no longer to wander around and constantly doing mercenary jobs for little payment...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"ACTUALLY I like that lifestyle!! I've lived like that for 8 years!! You have no right to force me to do this...\"- Blake said -\"And there's no way in hell I'm marrying a girl I don't know, let alone one many times my size... when she gets angry at me for no reason she can just crush me as easily as crushing a bug. And nobody will care, of course, because the only one who cares about me is myself!!\"- Blake didn't realize but those words hurt Lith a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's normal to be afraid. Your father was afraid of me when we were younger... It's easier for us to accept the idea of loving a being smaller than ourselves...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because you aren't the one who can die easily...\"- Blake was examining his possible escape routes in the mean time, though he couldn't believe his mother had just found him and wanted to give him to that princess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You wouldn't be crushed easily. Your body is way stronger than a normal human's... And the Princess is a shy girl. I doubt she'd dare to do something wrong to you... specially after your threat...\"- Lith remarked that with a more serious tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't care!! I have no reason to marry her!!\"- Lith's expression changed and brought Blake closer to her mouth, and whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's another girl, isn't it?\"- Then she brought him closer to her ear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What makes you think there's one?!\"- Blake asked angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your persistence on not getting married...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't want to marry anyone!! I just want to live my freaking life until I die by old age...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you feel lonely?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've been always alone. You said it, I'm a freaking hybrid. But I can live with that. What I can't live with is to be married to a giant girl for the rest of my life\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLith's expression saddened, and sighed, saying -\"Blake. I'm afraid you have a lot of things yet to learn. Karina, I give my total consent about the marriage...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt like it was the end of the world, what was more, the end of his world, of life as he knew it. And he wasn't going to let it go without a fight. Remembering that he had eaten, and wasn't restricted by his clothes' weight, he decided to quickly, open Lith's hand, and dashed away, he muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You really disappointed me. I'd have preferred not to know who was my mother... Just to find that is a woman capable of selling her son just because of becoming part of the royal family...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake dashed away but bounced from what he recognized as a light shield, which appeared in front of him. He fell to the floor and heard Lith<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you...\"- She said, referring to her being the daughter of the Sage of Light (technically the next sage, but she never claimed the title) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I will not give up\"- Blake said, and got up, but Lith snapped her fingers, and he fell unconscious. She picked him up, and whispered -\"Blake, I know you already hate me for this, but I want you to see through appearances...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she handed him to Karina, though rejected the money she offered in exchange...</span></div></div>",

There were 40 foot stone walls surrounding it, with towers holding guards all around.  The gang stood at the ready to charge and the man just stood there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't send more than one of us in until one of us triggers the alarm.  I'll go in.

Around his waist, a belt of exactly 24 throwing knives, strapped to his thigh a short-sword, and a bow with a quiver of arrows across his back.  From there they watched as he fired an arrow and the shadow of a guard disappeared.  He grappled up and climbed the sheer wall.  The man was now sneaking along behind a guard and then quickly stabbed him in the spine and covered his mouth silencing anything he might say.  The same fate followed for each lookout.  He climbed down and walked to the fort in the center of the town unhindered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo guards attempted to block his way and he apologized about not having an appointment and walked away.  He snuck around, stabbing one and throwing the knife into the other's neck.  He retrieved it and walked in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked in and a guard at the desk said \"Appointment?\" he stared at him before the reply of \"I am here to check in on a search I started.  My name is Ajax.\" the guard began scanning his ledger and didn't see the sword that severed his neck.  He walked straight into the leader's room, a throne room furnished by crimes that were punished by death from the true throne room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir.

The others closed in, and he jumped over one and put an arrow through the top of his head.  With 8 survivors, they began to charge him.  He parried a few and killed all but the sergeant, who stood with his arms crossed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Earth Battle Spell #41: Earthen Armor...\"- He muttered and a solid rock armor formed around him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do this!\" </span></div></div>",

I was thinking more on the lines of maybe you'll last over 20 seconds.\" The sergeant threw a few stones at the man, which were easily dodged.  He then began trying to attack at close range, which led only to a stalemate.  They exchanged either dodged or ineffective blows for about two minutes until the man finally got slightly fed up with the fight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, maybe I should exercise some of my magic.  A faint blue glow came from under the man's hood and he lifted a knife from his belt.  Slowly ice surrounded it and he threw the knife at him with a grunt.  The knife went straight through the guards torso and then when the man motioned with his arm, came back around through his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir.  I humbly request the location of the boy.  Now.\" The leader looked him over and the man did as well.  Long dark hair and many, many scars lined his body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you didn't use ice powers I would... It doesn't matter it isn't like you can get him at the giantess village unless they want you to.\" The king smirked as the man paused and seemed less strong and terrifying.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye sir.  You can also call of that mercenary search, but keep the gold I don't need it back where I'm headed.  With that he left.  No sneak attack, nothing, he just left and climbed the cliff again.  The gang looked at him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" He sighed and began.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sent Blake to the giantess village.\" Most of them yelled something but he held up his hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need rest and time to get blueprints to make a plan.  We are getting Blake back.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The morning after...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake woke up, chained from head to toe, and inside two cages, despite this, he was still laying in a bowl with medicinal water. He noticed that his sword was no longer in the room 'I guess they won't allow me to be armed anymore...' However, despite Blake usually fought using his sword, he was very strong without it. And he started struggling to break free. The chains were made of solid iron, and Blake might have broken up to four, but he was completely enveloped in chains, save for his head and feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered that awakening his dark powers enhanced all his capabilities, and again, he realized he was not wearing his silver chain and tag (It's been in his pocket so far, as well as the metal rings that make his clothes heavy). So, he concentrated, trying to focus his power. A reddish black aura surrounded him, and the chains started to crack. Blake felt that powering up was quickly draining his energy and stopped. He tried to struggle and managed to break some, but he was still tied, he had limited mobility in his legs and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Better than nothing' Blake could free his left arm after another struggle, and started to punch the cage. He had noticed that the so called princess was watching him, but he didn't pay attention to her. He shot a golden beam through the cage's padlock, and could open the cage. The princess stood up, and he thought 'This is not good... she'll have her damn servants to catch me again...' She was walking slowly toward him, and he muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've had it with this...\"- He broke all his chains in anger and dashed toward her. She instinctively covered her stomach, but Blake disappeared and reappeared next to her face, and punched her in the right cheek with all his anger. Quickly, he disappeared again, and reappeared on the other side, hitting her left cheek as well. Then he dashed downward and punched her in the stomach several times, now uncovered, after the punches, he kicked her. The hit was so powerful that knocked her backward, and fell to the floor. Blake landed a few feet from her, and walked toward her, charging a golden beam in his right hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I am sick of you!! You're the cause I'm held here!! I am just here to be used so you be come the Queen!! Well, guess what?! I'm NOT doing it!!\"- Blake noticed her right hand moving toward him and almost by reflex fired his golden light ball at it, causing a small burn. Strangely, she didn't scream. Blake kept walking toward her face, and added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You bought the wrong guy to be a slave... I guess you don't know how it feels because EVERYONE serves YOU!! Well, I'll give you a taste of what happens when you enslave someone... \"- Blake aimed his right hand at her face, holding his right wrist with his left hand. Just then he noticed that she was silently crying. Also, that no matter what he did, she could have screamed at any moment and he'd be really screwed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake cancelled the energy he was charging, and muttered -\"What am I doing? Have I really sunk so low?\"- Karina's words from the previous day rang inside his head <i>\"NOTHING!! The princess has done nothing to him!!\"</i> 'Technically, she's right... what the crowd said that day, years ago, was true, in the end, I'm just a monster...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of the princess, she was still crying in silence, and didn't move, fearing another wound. Her right hand had a small burn, but it hurt a lot, and she couldn't even rub the wound, nor wipe her tears. She noticed Blake turning around (no longer facing her), saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have nothing to say in my defense. You were the wrong target for me to take my rage out on...\"- Still without looking, he aimed his hand toward her, and muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shine, sun's gentle glow, 10 days of spring, heal, stop the bleeding, close the wounds with nature's touch...\"- Pale golden light illuminated the princess, and her wounds started to heal, and also, her pain disappeared, and it was replaced by a comfortable warm feeling. Because of her size, It took a while for Blake to heal her, and when he was done, he fell to his knees, tired. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have all the right to hit me, I won't block...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"N-no... I don't want to hurt you...\"- She said, she was no longer crying, but her voice still faltered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not that difficult. Just stand up, put your foot above me and let it go... just as easy as a bug...\"- Blake said -\"If I can't escape, at least help me to end this... If you say you killed me because I tried to kill you, they won't be mad at you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't want to kill you...\"- She said, and slowly stood up -\"I tried to stop you because everyone is alert, and if you leave this room they might hurt you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And I shot a light ball at her hand for that... I'll never learn... If I never get out of here, one day she'll take revenge no matter what she says, and what's worse, is that I'll deserve it...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know it's cruel to keep you here against your will...\"- She added, and Blake opened his eyes wide. She was the last person he'd expect sympathy from, which made Blake feel worse about what he just did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Can't you do anything about it?\"- Blake asked, and the princess could tell he was being honest. She sighed and denied with her head, and answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't. Karina is in charge until I marry someone...\"- She could heard Blake's grunt, because he was the one she'd marry to... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What if you say you don't want me? That you want someone else?\"- Blake said, and the princess could notice that he really wanted to escape more than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know... I'll try...\"- She said, and walked out of her room, and closed the door. Karina immediately went to talk to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your Majesty, is something wrong?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhm... well... I... I'd like to ask you something...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it, Majesty?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What if... What if I... I mean... I-I don't want to marry the human you bought... Can't you get other one?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I knew this would happen!! That little bastard...\"- Karina cracked her knuckles, and was about to rush into the princess' room, but the princess stopped her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not for that!!! I... I think we shouldn't keep here... it's cruel... he's a person... and he doesn't want to do this...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not cruel... it'd be cruel if we kept him with no food nor water, and to be killed for something. He's been fed and healed here, and he's to marry you. I don't see anything wrong with that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But it's against his will... would you marry someone by force?\"- The princess asked and had her index fingers tented together<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If I was paid for, I'd have to. It's the tradition...\"- Karina replied sternly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But... What if I want...someone else?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" *Sigh* If he were a simple human, I'd give him to someone else, he's already bought... Maybe Claire would be interested, I've seen how she looked at him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If he were? W-what does that mean?\"- The princess was really confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's as I said, if he were, I'd give him to someone else... HOWEVER...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"H-however?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't lie to you, Majesty... I can't give him to anyone else. He was too expensive, and is a really rare type of male...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What does that mean?\"- The princess asked, and this time, she didn't stutter or pause in mid-sentence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's the only Zasshu alive...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Zasshu?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You learned about them when yo were taught History... Zasshu, is a human name for the hybrid males, born from a human male and a giantess...\"- Karina paused, ten she said -\"They are exceptionally strong, far more than almost any human... and the best type to marry a giantess. You wouldn't have to worry much about crushing him by accident. He wouldn't die... That's why I requested a strong human, I never expected to find a hybrid...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He... he's a hybrid?! That means... his mother must be a giantess...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. It's Lith, a woman that lives nearly outside the village. I don't know much more... But she gave her consent to marry YOU. And she was who informed me that it was her son whom we bought...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And she agreed?\"- The princess was confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course. Any giantess with a son would say 'Yes' if offered to have him marrying a princess...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry, but that's the truth... and for the reasons I told you, I can't give him to anyone else. The chances to find another one are practically none...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhm... well... thanks...\"- The princess went back to her room. Karina sighed, and thought 'I know perfectly that he told her to act as if she disdained him... I know the princess better... He really doesn't like to be here, but I can't let go such a chance... I wonder why the princess actually bothered to do this?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmm... maybe she likes him already...\"- Karina muttered, and giggled at her thoughts</span></div></div>",

They won't let me to get someone else... She said that because you're special (She remembered that 'Zasshu' was a name with a negative meaning) she can't let you go...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks a lot, Lith...\"- Blake muttered, then, when her words hit him in the head, and he asked -\"What do you mean with special?\"- Blake thought 'God. I reall hope she doesn't know I'm a hybrid... that might mean trouble for me...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Karina said nothing else. You tell me...\"- The princess did a bold move with that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhm... I don't know...\"- Blake lied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why would you want to know?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because we have nothing else to do...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In that case, I'll go back to sleep...\"- Blake went back to the bowl and laid on its bottom, which still had medicinal water. But the princess walked near the bowl, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"M-maybe... if I knew...I might make something up...to help you...\"- She said, again, boldly but shyly at the same time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake raised an eyebrow 'I thought this girl was just shy and dumb... it seems she's shrewder than I thought...' But he had seen the catch, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What would change if you knew more about me?\"- This caught her off-guard, and blushed a lot, then, she kept thinking, and got nothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I knew it. It wouldn't help. It'd just dig deeper into my grave...\"- Blake said, and closed his eyes, but muttered -\"Goddammit!! If I were a normal human I'd be released from this hell!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually, no...\"- The princess had heard his 'confession'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!! You heard me?!!\"- Blake was snapped out of his thoughts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Karina would only release you from marrying me...\"- She blushed more when saying that -\"But because you cost a lot, she'd give you to someone else... and it's likely she'd give you to Claire...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!!\"- Blake's eyes opened wide, and his imagination tortured him more... Instead of the princess, Claire getting him... she already seemed to be weird, and acted weird toward him, and since she told him what he was there for, she imagined Claire whispering to him something like 'Well, well, well... So, you rejected the princess? That's too bad... because I'm going to do to you what she won't!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"NO!!!\"- Blake screamed, then he got back to reality, and noticed the princess staring at him, a bit confused by his scream -\"That never happened... It was just a day-nightmare...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess didn't really know, but she assumed Blake was afraid of Claire. Then, Blake sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no choice then...\"- He sighed again -\"I'm stuck here, I'm going to be married by force... can this be worse?!!\"- He sighed a third time -\"I'll just go back to sleep. This is too depressing...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess stared at him, and felt bad for him. He really hated the idea of being married to her, and she couldn't blame him, she knew that someone that size would be more than scared if forced to marry someone much larger. Though what Karina told her intrigued her, he was the son of a giantess and a man, but obviously, he was raised as a human.... the only hybrid who did not die in that fight against the King, as it was said in the books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Will you sleep for 3 days?\"- She asked, and sounded so sincere and naive Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You didn't have to remind me of how long I have left... But... yeah, if I can't escape, I can't do anything, so, I'll just sleep. Wake me up when it's my death's day...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Y...y-you aren't going to... to die...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Killing my freedom is just as bad...\"-  'This is so low... I'm just used as a tool...' Blake thought while he closed his eyes, and tried to sleep, though he couldn't as he just woke up, but he didn't want to spend time with the princess. That was just worse, and Blake was starting to realize that he was given to the princess with that purpose... them alone, start to spend time, and get used to each other before marriage 'That's not going to work. I'm smart enough not to fall, specially if I'm aware of the trick...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake knew this because in some of the villages he worked, there were similar customs. The man and the woman that were to be married usually were given a certain amount of time to get to know each other. 'Trying to soften the damage... but it's already done...' Blake thought. He didn't realize that the princess knew he wasn't sleeping, and heard her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's your name?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Does it matter? I'm nothing to you. I'm just your ticket to become a queen...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess gasped, she didn't like the way he was depicting her. She felt hurt by this, and said, saddened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"W-why do you say that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because it's the truth...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But...how can you say I think like that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't care. You don't care either. Nobody cares. Legally, I'm nothing. Enough said...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I care... if we're going to be married at least I want to know my husband's name...\"- The princess blushed very much after she said that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh...what?!\"- Blake blinked twice, and sat up -\"H...h-husband?!!\"- Blake was now the one stuttering -\"You aren't taking this seriously, are you?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not...\"- She replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Phew!!\"- Blake was relieved<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But I had a point...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever...\"- Blake said -\"I don't know what's so special about knowing my name, so I'll tell you and you'll stop annoying me, okay?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess stared at him in silence, and Blake knew it was a 'no'. She wanted to spend the time with him, since they were pretty much enclosed there except for things as eating or taking a bath, which Blake hoped it was not going to be done together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My name is Blake... are you happy now 'Princess' ?\"- Blake said the last word sarcastically, but the princess took the chance to reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't have to call me that\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I honestly don't care. I won't be saying your name too often, whatever it is... unless that's a keyword to get me out of here...\"- Blake laid back on the bowl's bottom, his arms were submerged in the medicinal water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My name is Joana...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...So?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You told me your name, I told you mine...\"- She answered happily, with a n_n face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I still don't care. Nothing you can do will lessen the fact I'm going to be forced to marry you... and that I can kiss goodbye my good old life...\"- Blake's mood wouldn't change<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What did you do before being... errm... 'caught' ?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Seriously, don't you have anything else to do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope. Karina ordered yesterday that we'd spend as much time as possible together...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were brought back, and unconscious...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake slapped his forehead, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you have any book to read... or something? A village to destroy... someone else's life to ruin?\"- Blake was trying hard to hurt her with words so she'd shut up, but it was only saddening her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know... this is not my fault...\"- Tears started to form in Joana's eyes -\"I didn't tell them to buy me a human... nor to capture and force one to come here...\"- She was on the verge of tears<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" *Sigh* I guess you're right... It's Karina's fault...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It isn't her fault either... My mother told hers to make sure I was married by when I turned 18... and since she also died, Karina was told to carry that order...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She still had the option of NOT to...wait a minute... 18?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, why?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is worse than I thought...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm 17...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have never seen a man marrying a woman older than him... and since I'm 17, I'm not an adult according to the king's law... THAT'S IT!! This will get me out of this, now what I need is to- \"- Blake was interrupted by Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhm, Blake... we're not in the human kingdom... and here, the law states that a guy 16 years old is old enough to be married... Formerly the age was 14, but they changed it because some giantesses felt wrong with someone so young...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do you know that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've been taught many different things during my life... law was one of them...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess...\"- Blake said, his bubble of hope was burst once again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry...\"- Joana said, trying to comfort him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's alright. I guess it serves me right...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's a long story. To make it short, my entire life is product of a mistake... so, I guess I deserve this, to be miserable until I die...\"- Blake said -\"But what I hate is that my friends ended up paying for my sins too...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened to them?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't know them... and as I said, it's a long story...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd like to hear it. We have time...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh God...\"- Blake said 'Seriously, I wonder how are my friends doing... They must have been sold as slaves, but it can't be as bad as this... What would they be doing now?' He thought...</span></div></div>",

On the road a few highwaymen stopped them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"100 coins for each of your lives.\" The man smiled and got out holding a bag with a few knives in it.  He moved so fast if was as if the knife appeared in his throat.  When the man's sword came level with the other's throat, he simply said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave or die, your choice.\" Apparently not wanting death the bandit left.  When he got back in and started the horses going again, he simply said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dead one had killed many.   The other is not stained by blood.\" They all looked at him and began to wonder more and more.  Who was the man who could kill so easily without any magic and could tell who has killed before?  Ayrton spoke their thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?  At least tell us your name!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked back, his face invisible under the hood, and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be patient. I'll show you when the time is right. The ride continued peacefully for the next day until the carriage's wheel broke off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pull into this village and get it fixed.  It'll be the rest of the day, so make yourselves at home.\" he threw each a small pouch of coins. These'll get you the food and any trinkets you may want.  If I see any for my sister I will hit you in the face Ferdinand. Meet back here at sunset.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all jumped out of the carriage. The man went to talk to the man inside the village's blacksmith shop. The rest went on to do a few things.  Ferdinand went to see what he could learn of the giantesses at he local library. The others took some money for food and herbs for healing.  Others went to train very hard to increase their strength and speed, just in case.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man simply waited and watched the repairs get done. He stayed until he saw the singed and shattered part. He got up to leave and walked along the path they took seeing a creature of relation to a dragon, minus wings and more resembles a crocodile. It began to breathe fire at the man and he dove away.  They went into close combat and the man gouged out an eye, but took a semi-deep slash across the chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt opened it's mouth to inhale and the man formed an ice crystal, shifted lodged into it's throat.  The monster began choking.  The man jumped into the air and brought his sword down with huge power, beheading it. He brought a section of its tail, which was an orange patch. When he arrived at the blacksmith, the carriage was nearly finished, and the sun was on its decent.  He handed the blacksmith the orange patch and his eyes widened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sell it to the healer.  Ought to be more than enough to cover the cost.\" The gang arrived back, slightly wiser, stronger or prepared than they were before.</span></div></div>",

The man looked up at the castle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need two days to check the watches. If they change, we'll wait a month. If not we have a chance to break in after three nights.\" Sadly, the next two nights went right, but then a scramble began for something big. In their camp they could see the village with a telescope but were nearly invisible from elsewhere.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a celebration. Sorry guys, we need to wait a little while and-\" there was a rumble behind them.  In their spot, there was nowhere to go only to stand and wait.  Soon, two giantesses came up to the cliff.  One was talking to the other.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it has the best view of the town, this should calm your nerves. I know it helped me...\" she trailed off when she saw the gang standing there, nowhere to go but through them or jumping off the cliff.  Soon they both were right next to them.  For once they all looked to the man and he didn't do anything.  They looked over and saw that there was a chain leading behind the brown haired girl.  The black haired girl looked at them curiously.  Soon, the thing on the chain got close enough that they could all tell what it was. Blake. The man snapped out of his trance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll grab Blake, you keep the other one busy.\"  He pulled out his shortsword and started cautiously moving in. They now looked angry. The black haired girl spoke up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know who you're threatening?  That is the soon-to-be queen!\" The man ignored her and continued.  Joana did nothing and let him continue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do something, he's going to hurt you!\" the black haired girl said.  Neither tried to attack and the black haired girl was actually not wanting to do any fighting, just smashed her foot down near the man.  He jumped away, but if his face were visible, a rare look of fear would have been seen on his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release your prisoner.  We just want him.\" The man said, standing up and walking towards Joana.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't have to fight.  Just release him and we can all go our separate ways.\" finally the black haired one got fed up with it and said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Power of light, bind the foe, spare his life and tie the ropes\" the entire group was binder in golden glowing ropes, except Tabitha, who managed to escape them.  They both began to reach down for them and as the man was picked up you could clearly see him tense in fear. Joana whispered that she wasn't going to hurt him but the struggling didn't stop.  She eventually calmed him down enough to grab the others.  They were brought into the castle and then hit with a strange gas, as darkness approached they knew that terrible luck had just gotten them killed through a gas chamber.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>2 days earlier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of nagging, Blake decided to tell Joana a bit about him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do I have to do to stop this madness?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Tell me your story...\"- She said in a cute way, though Blake didn't care<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not a big deal. I was a mercenary, got caught, and I'm here. THE END...\"- Blake said, and Joana stared at him, confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What does a mercenary do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Mercenaries work for money. They are paid for doing a certain thing, it varies. Some of them do dirty works like killing people...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... so... you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I worked with my friends as a mercenary squad, but we didn't do such jobs, I mean, we were paid to catch thieves, help people, or rescue kidnapped people, or to fight wild beasts... We never killed innocent people...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Isn't that the same as soldiers?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope. We depend only on ourselves, and when we aren't needed anymore we go to somewhere else. Where? We never know. It has something special to live like that, never know what's next, and-WAIT!! You tricked me!!\"- Blake realized, too late. Joana giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But... don't you miss your home?\"- She asked, back to a more serious mood. When she asked him that, images from his early life flashed in his mind. He couldn't help but clench his fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't want to talk about it..\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?! Were you banished or something?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have NO home... That's why I have no problem with traveling, I don't have a home to return to... nothing awaits for me, and I don't care. I like to live like that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"- Joana didn't really know what to say, but could sense a very faint sadness in Blake's words. However, she picked him up and hugged him. Blake tried to push her away but given the physical difference, Blake was unawarely pushing her breast, which made her giggle. Blake then realized and blushed heavily, and asked both angry and embarrassed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"W-w-what was that for?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I felt like it... You need some affection...\"- Joana still had him standing on her palm (Blake was barely the size of her pinky finger)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blushed even more, and angrier, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't need pity from anyone!! W-Who d-do y-you think you are?!!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana giggled at his reaction, thinking 'He acts as he had never been hugged been by a girl before...' Then she realized, and giggled more, and answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your future wife...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"GAAAHHHH!!\"- Blake nearly fainted -\"Don't do that EVER again!!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana giggled and had a n.n face while Blake was still blushing like mad, and thought 'Calm down!! Calm down!! How is it possible I feel embarrassed... it's not like it felt good or something... NO!! It can't feel good!! It's not even natural... she's a giant!! Despite I'm a hybrid I'm still MOSTLY human!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why are you so scared of it?\"- Joana asked sweetly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It scares me that you're beginning to take it seriously... I'm not going to be your...husband...\"- Blake blushed even more -\"...Nor anything like that!! I'll just play along with this farce, I'm not going to be married to you for real...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It is real...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stop it!!!\"- Blake said, and tried to calm himself -\"You're a giant, I am a human... don't you see something NOT matching?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, we both have two eyes, two ears, hair on the head...\"- Joana started petting Blake's head while saying that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you're huge!! I'm the size of your fingers!!\"- Blake was still exasperated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You look cute to me...\"- Joana blushed almost as much as Blake was, and now, he nearly fainted, as almost all the blood of his body went to his head. She giggled at his reaction. Blake thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why do I blush?!! Why it affects me that a giant girl likes me?!! I shouldn't care!! I'm Blake, the mercenary warrior!! I'm no ladies man!! I shouldn't care about this!!!' Blake was torturing himself mentally, and Joana just giggled. Her intuition told her that Blake was trying to resist to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed, and Blake was constantly shutting off his mind in an attempt to ignore what he was living here. But this time, Joana kept him near her almost the whole day. When the night fell over the village, Blake returned, though this time, to a piece of fabric that Joana's servants left as an improvised bed for Blake, however, the night was cold, and Joana picked Blake up, and placed him on her belly. She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It will be cold...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh...\"- Blake answered, and almost instantly fell asleep. He had been used to sleeping on tress, due to his early life customs, but also slept at inns usually on hard wooden beds with a towel on top. Joana's belly was soft and firm, and also warm... Blake had never felt better, but hadn't time to deny it as he closed his eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake woke up when a giant finger brushed his hair, and he woke up, though grudgingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wake up sleepyhead\"- Joana said happily -\"Didn't you sleep well?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh... Just as always...\"- Blake said, rubbing his eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana sensed that he was lying, trying to seem tougher than he already is, and giggled. She knew Blake slept better than ever before by how fast he fell asleep. She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"See? You don't have to suffer...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't try to soften the damage... it's already done... how long have I left?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhmm... well... it's been 5 days counting this one... you have two days left...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?!!! I've been here just 3 days!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess it took 2 days to bring you here... Sorry...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate my life...\"- Blake said, facepalming himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... well.. \"- Joana could think of nothing that may comfort him, as the sole idea of being with her was bad enough for him. Still, since he was brought, Joana thought he was particularly cute, and by his looks it was obvious he lacked lots of affection during most of his life, and that triggered some thing in her mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll go lie down on my 'bed' and do nothing for the rest of the day...\"- Blake said, but Joana stopped him, and laid him back on her belly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What about telling me more about you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've already told you!! I'm a low-class warrior who works with his friends as mercenaries and wanders around the world... there's nothing special about it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who says you're low class?\"- Joana didn't like that Blake depicted himself like that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I do, and pretty much any person you ask in the kingdom... I'm just someone with no family...\"- Blake was really disappointed at his newly discovered mother, who gave him away just for being part of the royal family, at least, so he thought... 'I can't believe she'll get away with this... I'm gonna make her pay...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... you won't be low class for long...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know that... after we marry, I'll become the queen.. so...\"- Joana blushed a lot when saying that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!!\"- Blake didn't get it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If I'm the queen and you're my husband, what does that make you?\"- Joana blushed even more, and Blake finally got it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A king!!\"- For one moment, Blake's hopes raised, and thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Karina said only the King could nullify my marriage... but if I become this land's king, I can nullify it myself!!! And get the hell away of here!!! And if that doesn't work I'll banish myself!!! Hehehehehe...' Blake for the first time didn't feel so bad about the marriage 'This is not going to last even a day, the moment I'm made king the moment I leave this damn place!!!' Blake was smiling for the first time. Joana looked at him sympathetically, believing that he was comforted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, they noticed movement near the window, like someone who had been watching them. Blake disappeared from on top Joana's belly and reappeared near the window. He looked below, and there was a man with a scroll and what seemed to be a money bag<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who are you?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I... I am a messenger the duke of Kildevar sent...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It took a lot to follow those bandits... and to sneak here, my most sincere apologies, sir...\"- The messenger said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry... why do you look so scared?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I saw you, captured by a giant woman...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who, her?\"- Blake pointed at Joana -\"She's harmless, come in...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course...\"- Blake offered his hand to help the messenger climb up. Joana was curious at seeing other human, and walked near them. The small quakes caused by her steps intimidated the messenger a lot. He gave the scroll to Blake, who read it, and closed it rather roughly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damn!!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's going on?!\"- Joana was worried about Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The Royal Army was called... if they get any clue of where I am I'm dead meat...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry, sir...\"- The messenger tried to calm him, and gave him the money bag -\"The duke and people of Kildevar gave me money for you to survive, this should be enough for you to go anywhere...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana wasn't happy about the messenger. She thought Blake was starting to accept the idea of staying. Blake, however, thought of the opposite</span></div></div>",

I guess you'd take a lot to go and return here\"- Blake realized about the fact of distance and got disappointed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't be disappointed sir. I have this!!\"- He showed a small bird, which had been posing on his shoulder the whole time, but Blake hadn't noticed it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll write a message to the duke, and he'll sure reply immediately... The bird would take 2 days at most...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It would be the same...\"- Blake said, thinking that it was 2 for going and other 2 for returning<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No, sir.

We'll have to wait for the answer...\"- The messenger said, then, noticing Joana, he gulped and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I... I'll be outside... if you need anything, I'll be in that tree...\"- The messenger said to Blake, and left anxiously. Joana picked Blake up and went back to her bed, this time, she put Blake on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why didn't he stay here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because NOBODY wants to stay here... good for him that he could leave...\"- Blake said, with his arms crossed, Joana was saddened, as she realized Blake wasn't giving up. It wasn't that she really wanted him to give up, but if he failed, he'd feel worse... and, she was growing fond of him, despite his behavior... she even thought that if she knew under different circumstances, things might be different...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhh... Blake... have I done something wrong to you?\"- She asked, and she was being really sincere. Blake was about to reply with a long list, but her tone stopped him... her tone was like that of a girl about to cry... or about to be scolded, or punished...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It reminded of Blake's earlier life, when he started wandering around the world, at 9 years old, along Ferdinand, who was 10... A year later, when they were 10 and 11 respectively (It was just he and Ferdinand by that time), they were hired to rescue a count's daughter, from thieves who kidnapped her for money. Ferdinand, being the older one, took on the thieves, despite Blake's strength and ability, he didn't want to risk him, and he went to rescue the girl... who was 11 or 12 years old, Blake couldn't tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Blake, if was nothing special, one more job. But the girl followed him around (They were hired for a year, partially because of this girl) and kept nagging him trying to know more of him. Ferdinand thought it was funny, despite he had bad luck with girls himself. Blake grew exasperated about the girl and one day he was about to shout at her, and she spoke in that tone, asking if she was doing something wrong... He stopped and sighed. He told her that he was just a mercenary, and was younger than her. That she was the daughter of a count, and deserved someone better than him. He also told her that he wouldn't be there forever, when they stopped needing him, he'd have to leave, to move on to somewhere else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw her tears dropping, and knew that truth almost always was more painful than a lie. He sighed at that realization. He also told her, that someone like him was not fit for being a husband, that taking care of a wife and a family wasn't something he was fit for... He told her that he was meant for nothing, and it made no sense ruining more lives. However, Blake agreed to spend his free time with her, as friends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had convinced her father and most of that village's people to keep Blake and Ferdinand hired, as they were doing a really good job. And they weren't particularly expensive, in fact, their services were cheaper than most mercenary bands. The count's wife had somehow guessed why her daughter wanted to keep those mercenaries, and even told her husband about the idea... she knew that they were too young but that when Blake was older, he might ask them for their daughter's hand. They also allowed them to sleep in their guest rooms...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, an unknown person called for the Royal Army, and told them that there were mercenaries in the village, and that they were suspicious of practicing dark magic. Luckily, a scout came first, and interrogated the count. He told him that he had no knowledge, and that the mercenaries left the previous day. He also gave them a false indication, telling him that they headed for north. (Blake and Ferdinand were sleeping at the count's guest rooms)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the scout left, he woke up Blake and Ferdinand, gave them a lot of money, food, water and equipment, and told them what happened, and told them to leave, heading for south, and better if it was south eat or south west to not be so predictable. However, the noises woke up the count's daughter, who was shocked to see Blake and Ferdinand packing their stuff. Her father explained her that they needed to leave, otherwise the Royal Army would kill them. She was on the verge of tears, and Ferdinand, understanding, took most of the stuff and said he'd wait outside, meanwhile he'd load some things on Tabitha (who was a bit bigger than a colt by that time)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake didn't know what to do, but decided to explain her, and whispered to her the truth about himself, that he and Ferdinand were, indeed, the last living dark magicians, a species not allowed by law, and punished with death... He said he usually spoke with the truth, and that there were very slim chances he'd ever return, and apologized for that. His last words before leaving were <b>\"I would write to you... but if I stopped for some reason, it would worry you... it also would feed your hopes about me returning... and... if I die in battle, or by the Royal Army... I don't want you to know...\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, crying, hugged him very tightly and kissed him in the left cheek. After some seconds, Blake sighed, and left, carrying the stuff Ferdinand left... It was the only time Blake had been hugged and kissed by a girl before... As he walked, he quietly muttered her name \"Aranza*...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Joana asked confused, and Blake was snapped out of his memories<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You muttered something... I couldn't hear it clearly...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nyeh!! I...I-mean... it was nothing!!\"- Blake said, but thought 'What would've been if I never formed a squad, and stayed there for longer... would I... no... I'm still the same... but maybe... I wouldn't have ended up here... it would have been better to be married to a normal girl rather than a giant...' Blake then realized of what he was thinking, and scolded himself 'What are you thinking?!! You aren't meant to marry ANYONE!! You are a Warrior!! A proud low class warrior!! I'm not a man who would be in a warm house playing with children!! I'm someone who fights battles!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sure?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, just stupid stuff of mine...\"- Blake tried to pretend the situation never happened, but his mind kept wondering 'Now that I'm probably marrying this girl by force, it wouldn't hurt to think of other possibilities... seriously, was Aranza that bad?! No matter what she'd be better than THIS' He thought, referring with \"THIS\" to Joana...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's ironical I rejected her to end up like this...\"- Blake muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!! You heard me?!!\"- Blake said, and thought 'I need to stop thinking aloud...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nothing... I guess I get what I deserve for being myself, nothing you care about...\"- Blake remained silent, until Joana asked him if it was about his friends, and that reminded her that he didn't tell her about them, and so, she nagged Blake, and poked his head with her index finger in a comical way until Blake grew desperate again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Enough!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Will you tell me?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Does it look like I have a choice?\"- He said, and sighed -\"There are 5 of them. Ferdinand, is like me, uses dark magic, and fights using a scythe... he's smart although a bit weird... and he says he has bad luck with girls because none have accepted him as a boyfriend... Something I personally don't care about... Then, there's Gustave, a nice guy, he's polite, and knows many things, he was once from a noble family, but the Sand Bandits killed them, as well as steal their wealth...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's terrible...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nobody said the Sand Bandits were nice people... whatever... the others are Ayrton, a very cheerful guy, he also seems to be the most insightful among us. A little too happy I'd say... Also, Caesar... he's a normal guy. He is at a mid point at most things, and also knows a lot of ancient history, because where he's from, people did their best to preserve history...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see... but, what about the 5th?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That would be Anthony... he's no longer with us... he left to join the Royal Army, although I still consider him a friend...\"- Blake looked down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Just to get facts straight, this character is entirely fictional, although I thought of the name because that's one of my friends' sister's name...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the day passed, and Joana noticed Blake's gloomy mood, so, she stopped annoying him. At night, she had him sleeping on her belly again, but this time, Blake didn't fall asleep easily. He couldn't stop thinking about that fateful day... Had he not been forced to escape, he would've stayed there for a longer time, and luckily he wouldn't have ended up here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also wondered if the Royal Army ever went back and took vengeance, or just left them alone... Blake wouldn't forgive himself if he found that the Royal Army destroyed the entire village and/or killed the count and his family... He thought 'They're okay... and there's no way I'll know... plus, it's been years, I doubt they're still looking for me, and most likely think they were victims of a stupid prank... so, I better stop thinking about that...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake slept, and seemingly stopped thinking about his past. This time he woke up by himself. Blake started to question why he hated this so much... He was doing almost the same he did years ago, and regretted that. He remembered his talk with Ferdinand, when they were leaving the town<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"I'm sorry...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"About what?!\"- Blake tried to sound tough<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know about what... that girl... you...\"- Ferdinand added -\"I know it must be difficult...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We had nothing... She was just a friend...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Riight...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In difference of you, I don't drool by merely seeing a girl...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!! *Ahem!* Still... you and her may have been a good couple...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'M 11 YEARS OLD!!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hee hee... the more you deny the more true it is...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It doesn't matter anymore...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You needed more time... you know... it fits you... a girlfriend like her... older than you... that helps you to heal your wounds...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can heal my own wounds...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not the physical ones... your mind's wounds...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever, it's over... Let's move on and forget about this!!\"- Was Blake's final answer. The rest of their travel was with no talking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since that, Ferdinand noticed Blake's heart hardened even more, and he longer even tried for a second time. Several girls along their way were nice to him, but he didn't really care much about it. The most they'd get from Blake would be polite answers, and indifference... Blake also convinced everyone he knew that it wouldn't work with him. That he was not fit for a relationship, and that his fate was to die in battle, one day... Nobody else other than Ferdinand and Blake himself knew about this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stopped considering those memories, and after thinking deeply about several other things, he realized that this was his 6th day... counting this one, he had only 2 days left... 'I can't believe I have 2 days left... I feel I wasted my life...' Blake thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you still sad?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was NOT sad!! I'm... forget it... I have just 2 days left...\"- Blake then remembered about his 'backup plan', but didn't want to be married in the first place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't start with that... All of this is bad, and nothing will change my mind about it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know, but- \"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I DON'T like you. And I doubt I would no matter what...\"- Blake said, emphasizing the \"don't\", and crossed his arms. He felt the \"ground\" beneath him move rhythmically, and heard quiet sobs. He stood up (with some difficulty) and saw Joana crying silently. Blake found strange that she didn't cry liudly when he realized that it would've drawn attention towards them, and Blake would be in trouble. He sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Listen... I can't apologize for what I said... because it's true...\"- Blake started, and her crying increased, it was very quiet but some sobs sounded louder -\"I had to tell you this... I noticed that your hopes started to raise, and I didn't want to ruin everything in whatever ceremony you're going to have... It's just, you're a giant.... I don't feel good with this, I wouldn't marry a human girl I don't know, and I would never marry a giant girl...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's attempt to tell the truth worsened Joana's crying. He got off Joana's belly, as her crying no longer let him stand up. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Would you prefer a lie? I hate hypocrisy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana wiped her tears (but didn't stop crying), and asked Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you listen to yourself? You <i>wouldn't</i> marry a human girl <i>you don't know</i>... but you would <i>never</i> marry a giant girl...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was not considering marring anyone. I just wanted to get my life back, as a mercenary, travel around, and have nothing to worry about... That's who I am. That's also why I told you I'm not for relationship... I'm someone who can't love nor be loved...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You aren't even trying. You didn't even try to be friends with me...\"- Joana was still crying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Excuse me for being angry...\"- Blake said, and added in a sarcastic tone -\"Oh, I was captured to be forcefully married to a giant princess. Hi giant princess. Wanna be friends?\"- Blake stopped his sarcastical mode and shouted <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" WHAT KIND OF FREAKING WORLD DO YOU LIVE IN?!!! Nobody told you to be nice, you have all the right to be angry too!! You're being forced to marry some guy you don't know!! Now it's even worse, you know it's a low class vagabond who fights for money!! And you're still NOT angry!! Doesn't it anger you that a princess like you marries a mercenary!!\"- Blake had practically released almost all of his anger through words, by the end of his angry speech he was breathing heavily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually... no... I never cared where does someone come from, or what's their job...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should still feel insulted. There are many human nobles you could marry...\"- Blake said, looking down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Karina said they were too protected...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why aren't you angry yet? I gave a lot of reasons to hate this forced marriage, and to hate me. And the solution is as simple as grabbing me and throwing me through that window, or stepping on me like an insect...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't hate you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should... it would make things easier...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know that you say this because you're suffering... and because you hate yourself...\"- Joana said, and her crying stopped for a moment. Blake opened his eyes wide, but then regained composure, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That doesn't matter...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let me help you...\"- Joana said, and Blake was confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!! How?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just try to be my friend... telling things to a friend would help your soul...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake never told anything personal to his friends, nor was he intending to tell them for example, that he was a hybrid... one of the infamous Zasshu, hated by most of people...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Also, spending time with a friend can help...\"- Joana added, and regained some of her cheerfulness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know how to do that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were starting to go good yesterday... until you took out your rage again on me...\"- Joana said that with a different tone, as she didn't mean to make him feel guilty<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed, and said -\"It's not like I can't do much else...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana giggled. She couldn't understand why she was insisting so much on helping him, for some reason she was growing fond of him. She also wanted to heal his soul, it was obvious that Blake was bearing a lot of grief, and many other things torturing his soul. She remembered when she was taught by her teachers that a hybrid, if fertile, can succeed attracting the opposite sex from both species... And also remembered, that despite his human size, Blake is in fact a hybrid, and 50% of his blood is from giants... 'Could that be why?' She wondered.</span></div></div>",

Joana's friend spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, I just heard the news... You've got a guy, and you will become the Queen!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh... yeah...\"- Joana got nervous when she heard that. She was trying to get used to the idea herself, though in difference of Blake, getting married didn't anger her, but the ceremony and the wedding made her nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where is the lucky guy?\"- She asked cheerfully, and Blake muttered angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... lucky...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana then noticed that Blake was hiding behind her, and it looked cute to her, but still, she grabbed him with her fingers and put him on her lap. Blake was reluctant to meet Joana's friend, as she already thought he was happy about this. She petted his head a bit though. Then she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You look pretty nervous. Let's take a walk outside...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana nodded, and was about to g outside when Karina stopped her, and told her that if she was going out with Blake, she'd need to keep him tied, and chained him. A ring was closed around Blake's neck, then a long chain, which in its other end was attached to Joana's wrist by a larger ring (handcuff-like) around it. They went to a cliff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Then this happens <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/cid/1064403\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/cid...</a> ]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana and Blake returned to her room, while her friend went to get dressed for the public announcement and celebration. Then Blake heard something, and saw Tabitha coming in through the open window. She almost tackled him and licked him desperately. Then she noticed Joana and hissed angrily. Joana was confused by how the cat entered and started licking Blake, and he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is my cat, Tabitha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd although Joana tried to move slowly and act harmless toward the female cat, she roared (panther-like), and Blake had to grab the back of her neck before she tried to attack. he petted her head and massaged her neck until she calmed down. Then he started moving his hands, and placed his open palm on her forehead. Tabitha's eyes changed from green to yellow. And her claws glowed in golden. He then ripped a small piece of paper from Joana's desk, and wrote a message, which read (btw, the parentheses used in the note count in-story)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Before anything. Thank you very much to all of you guys. I felt bad because you ended up in the same mess as me. And because I failed to beat the sand bandits. As the squad leader, it's my fault, I recognize that. That aside... HELP ME!! They are forcing me to marry a GIANT princess!! (Leave the laughs for later, this is serious guys). These girls are not to be underestimated as you probably saw. Their powers are light based, Ferdinand knows how to counter that. Also, I gave Tabitha a spell breaker so she releases you. Don't get caught again!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS: HELP!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled it, and gave it to Tabitha, who carried it in its mouth. Blake told her -\"Go, wherever my friends are...\"- and she left. Joana stared at him with a sad look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems your friends came for you, after all...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't really expect them to. But this is really good, if we're lucky we'll not even marry!! My friends are the best ones!!\"- Blake was happy, and Joana just answered with<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... yeah...\"- To tell the truth, she was sad, she wanted to marry him, or have other means to spend more time with him, and stopped disliking her just because of her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You aren't gonna tell the guards, are you?\"- Blake was worried because she knew what happened, but she denied with her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It might be your chance to escape. If it succeeds, I won't stop you...\"- Joana said, and her words rang in Blake's mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>After rescuing the count's daughter, Blake and Ferdinand intended to move on to somewhere else, and the girl stopped Blake, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why are you leaving?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My job is already done... I have to go somewhere else...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why don't you stay, there's still jobs for you. You can stop thieves or something...\"- The girl said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do you want me to stay?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd like to know you better...\"- She got very close to his face, and he could feel her breathing -\"You look like someone who is sad about something... I want to help...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!!! Yeah... whatever...\"- Blake pushed her away and decided to stay for a while. Ferdinand, who watched everything, agreed, and thought it would do Blake good. One day, some months later, after they had stopped the majority of thieves, killed dangerous beasts and did some deliveries, there wasn't any job for Blake and Ferdinand, so, the former decided to leave, and the girl stopped him again. By the look in her eyes, Blake knew what she was going to say, and Blake spoke first<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm leaving because there's no more work to be done here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Can't you take a day off? It wouldn't hurt...you know... spending time with a friend or something...\"- She asked, and while doing so, she kept playing with her hair, which was auburn, wavy and shoulder length. Her eyes were brown (Joana's were hazel)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ugh...\"- Blake just grunted as an answer, and knew he'd end up doing whatever she had in mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But... if you really want to go somewhere else, I won't stop you. I don't want to force you to anything...\"- She said in a more serios and saddened tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed and thought deeply. He really had a difficult choice: Either keep with his mercenary life, or stay in that place. After a while, Blake decided forthe latter, which led to Aranza giving him a happy n.n look (she knew Bake wasn't used to hugs)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake just thought 'This is going to be very loong...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heard Karina's voice from outside, which snapped Blake out of his memories<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your Majesty, the ceremony will start in 30 minutes...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... I'll be ready...\"- Joana said, and sighed, saddened by what she knew was going to happen...</span></div></div>",

Tabitha rushed in, a giantess behind her.  She lunged and cut each of their ropes and the giantess stood over them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not to leave until the ceremony is over!\" The man walked up and held his arms up.  \"We didn't do it, the cat did now you can let us go back into the HIYAAH!\" A huge blue glow erupted from behind his hood and the entire giantess froze solid.  He dropped onto one knee for about a minute until Ferdinand brought the nite to him.  After reading he said simply, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This makes everything harder.  But who cares, let's go!  We need to improvise a way through the princess's guards and get Blake.\" The man ran out while the others followed.  Unarmed they snuck through a few hallways.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?  Ferdinand whispered into the man's ear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Was the only thing he whispered back.  They followed and reached a staircase.  He pept up one and pulled himself up.  Eyes wide they all looked as he held his arm out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!  We can't waste time!\" they each managed it with each others help and did this for the entire set if stairs to the top floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her quarters should be the third door on the right.  Wait, was it left?\" Eventually he walked over to the third door on the right and, hood glowing, kicked a piece out of the door.  Looking around, this was her quarters.  The cage proved that, but no Blake could be seen.  \"No!  He'll be in the courtyard for the wedding ceremony!  We have to run!\"</span></div></div>",

There were a lot of giantesses wanting to hear what was the public announcement for. While Joana was walking toward the courtyard, they could heard Karina speaking, when they got closer, they could hear that it was a public speech about Joana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake checked his surroundings, but couldn't find his sword. Blake only knew the entrance and Joana's room anyway. So, he guessed Karina kept it somewhere.He had the feeling his friends would bust during the event, at least he hopes so. He was now fully recovered, and hadn't put on the metal rings that restrained his strength, although he had put back on the silver chain with its tag, which suppressed his dark powers. It was given to him by his grandma, but she said both his mother and his father made it, they knew he'd have the two powers, but only dark ones were punished...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't show my dark powers to the rest of the guys, otherwise, I'd have to do a lot of explanations...' He thought 'Good thing Joana is bringing me in her hand... Though, I could bet it was because she knows what's going to happen too... I wonder why she's sad... She should be happy since I'm not marrying her... ANYWAY... Focus, Blake!! You know you will have to pull off your best effort'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake took the silver chain off, thinking 'Just in case...' Also, he put his hood back on (Just to specify, Blake's hood didn't cover his whole face as those of executioners, it was more like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2rd9nox&amp;s=7\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2rd9nox&amp;...</a> Except for the hair, the sword, and the metal rings, as well as the silver chain and tag, Blake looks like this)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina was saying some more stuff (I was too lazy to write a whole political-like speech. Sorry) and ended introducing Joana herself and her... fianc\u00e9? When she walked outside, the crowd applauded, and while most of them expected her to show Blake more happily, she just held him in her hand. Still, this shocked most of the giantesses because they had never seen a man*...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt a very tiny energy ball hit him behind the neck, and looked toward where it came from. It was a tactic he and Ferdinand used to be communicate without making any noise. Ferdinand gestured him with a thumbs up, to which Blake replied by smiling, He showed his wrists so they saw he was not chained anymore. Nobody noticed this because they all were asking Joana about how did she get a human male and just in time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand whispered to everyone -\"He's fine. We'll attack n-\"- He stopped when noticed that the man was missing -\"Where did that guy go?\"- He asked, and everyone shrugged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wonder why does he know Blake and us... well, we don't have time, we'll proceed...\"- He added, and Ayrton, Gustave and Caesar nodded. Tabitha stood still, knowing she wouldn't able to do much in battle (She reacted very badly to Joana's presence, because she looked human-like but gigantic... I can't blame her...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand grabbed his scythe and gestured with his other hand the killing sign (thumb moves resembling a knife cutting someone's neck, I don't know how it's called...) Then pointed at Joana, with a somewhat sadistic smile, however Blake replied by denying with his head and waving the 'No' sign with his hand. Ferdinand was confused, but shrugged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... according to Blake we're not killing the princess...\"- Everyone said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ferdinand went to look back at the princess, and Gustave went to catch a glimpse as well. Both of them stared at her for several seconds and Ferdinand said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can understand Blake... she would be such a beauty if she wasn't giant...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Man, Blake has good taste... It would be a crime to kill her... if she was a normal girl...\"- Gustave said, and soon both guys started drooling, Blake, who was watching them, facepalmed himself. Ayrton and Caesar punched them in their heads hammer-like. Ferdinand, after some moans of pain and cursing his friends, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright!! We're attacking now!!\"- He stood there, and nobody moved<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"ARE YOU DEAF OR WHAT?!!\"- He sighed and added -\"Alright, I'll start myself...\"- He aimed both hands toward where Blake and Joana were, muttered an incantation and shot a wide dark beam. The crowd gasped in shock as they noticed a black beam with a blue outline seemingly striking down the princess. It created a powerful explosion, but it created lots of dust, smoke and a shockwave. It wasn't much of a fire explosion, and missed Joana intentionally. Blake then jumped upward, encountering with his friends. He shook hands with Ferdinand but Gustave hugged him (despite knowing Blake disliked hugs, and Gustave was actually saved by Blake nearly 6 years ago). Blake, maybe because of being rescued, allowed it for this time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Blake shouted -\"WATCH OUT!!\"- He pushed Gustave away, caught with his hands an incoming giant light ball. Blake had a bit of difficult but compressed it a bit and threw it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Light... Magic?!!\"- Caesar was the first to wonder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Weren't light magicians extinct save for you, Blake?\"- Ayrton asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We were wrong... These giant women have light magic as well...\"- He answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But... how?!!\"- Caesar, Ayrton and Gustave asked. Ferdinand was thoughtful, and soon suspected 'Can it be... no... that would mean Blake is not... that he is a... no, it can't be... though... I've always wondered why has he always worn those weights... I thought it was training to become a sage or something...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It doesn't matter right now!! We'll talk later!! We're being attacked, we need to fight back!!\"- Blake said, and dodged two more giant light balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm gonna get payback from whoever imprisoned us!!\"- Caesar cracked his knuckles, and started firing thunderbolts from his hands.Ayrton unsheathed his two swords, and prepared to dive, but Blake stopped him by holding his shoulder, and denying with his head, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Melee combat is not an option here, Ayrton, we'll need to stick to distance combat for now...\"- Ayrton noticed that Blake hadn't his sword, and asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where's your sword?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They took it away. It doesn't matter, we have to fight back and get THE HELL out of this place!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You always went back for that sword... you said it was important to you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It IS important to me, but no more than my life... I'd rather die than be married!!\"- Blake said, strangely sounding heroic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Didn't you just contradict yourself?\"- Ayrton observed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up and fight!!\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was the only one able to fire back the light energy balls, so, he ended up at the front, using his light abilities to stop the light shot at them and throw it back. Ferdinand formed a bow and started firing dark arrows at the giantesses (who were Joana's servants... somewhat trained to defend their princess, despite their lack of practice...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his attacks did very little damage, and angered them more. Gustave kept shooting fire balls, which caused more damage, as they burnt the giantesses' skin. Caesar was also having a bit of success, as his thunderbolts also damaged them. Ayrton kept waving his swords to create what according to him were called Wind Cutters  (Other elements have wave-shaped attacks, but only Wind cuts, the others cause heavy damage according to their element, and usually explode. Also, Wind Cutters, despite requiring a lot of training, don't consume much energy, and Ayrton can create them massively for a long time without draining his energy)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Although not mentioned by Lith, The King's attack on the dark magicians also killed all remaining men that lived among gianteses, to prevent the birth f new Zasshu hybrids. Thus, the youngest giantesses are Blake's age at the very least (17). Older giantesses were surprised because of nearly 20 years without seeing a human male...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He swung it twice to create powerful dark waves, which were very large, and hit 3 giantesses at once. The explosion also distracted them. Blake and his friends tried to escape but as soon as they landed on the ground, the giantesses recovered quickly and kept attacking them. Blake and his friends were surrounded, and the giantesses kept getting close. Blake also noticed that Joana's servant, and Joana's friend were the ones attacking. He wondered about Karina and Claire, but honestly, he didn't want to know...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shouted -\"THE HELL WITH THIS!!\"- And dashed toward Joana's friend, he punched her in the stomach with such force that she was knocked backward a great distance (although to the giantesses, it was equivalent to 3 feet)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's friends were amazed, and asked -\"How the HELL did you do THAT?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We have no time I'll explain things later...\"- Blake did a lot of quick moves with his hands, while muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Purify evil, Light punisher... Bring the judgement of light... Consume the darkness, sentence to death... Incinerate!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA circle made of golden light appeared in the ground, and it was massive. Enough to be around roughly 10 giantesses. As Blake said the spell, a pentagram formed inside the circle, and five pillars of light struck the pentagram's peaks (or points, I'm not sure how are they called). Then, a sixth emerged from the center, which grew until it engulfed the giantesses, and rose high into the sky. It was incredibly huge, and pretty much anyone in the human kingdom may have been able to see it (although only as a very thin pillar)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also caused a massive explosion, and Blake's friends had their mouths wide open, and their jaws dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"H-h-h-h...he took down 5 giantesses in a single shot...\"- Ayrton said in disbelief. Blake fell to his knees, and they went to help him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Forget about punching a giantess...How did you DO THIS?!!\"- Caesar said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh... *cough!! cough!!* it was one of the most powerful spells I learned *cough!* I would only use them in *cough!!* life or death situations...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand looked, 5 giantesses were down (Joana's friend was NOT among these) and the damage done to the courtyard was considerable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, it was really something. Now, let's escape before something worse...\"- He was cut off when a huge shadow towered over them, it was Joana's black haired friend, who was very angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's YOU again!! How dare you to humiliate the Princess like this?!!\"- She tried to stomp on them, but Blake got up and stopped her foot with his two hands. Blake's friends were further impressed, and stared for a moment. Blake slowly sank into the ground, which cracked because of the giant girl's force. Blake shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you waiting for?!!\"- Blake's friends moved away quickly, and saw Blake disappearing, and reappearing near them. The giant girl said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And YOU are on their side?!! I thought you came here to marry the Princess!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was brought BY FORCE here!! I didn't come on my own will. And I will fight for my freedom!!\"- Blake dashed again at her, but this time, she covered her stomach with her left arm and Blake quickly jumped from it, punching her in the left cheek. Blake disappeared and punched her right cheek. Then, he reappeared behind her head, and kicked her in the back of her neck. She fell again, but caught Blake in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand then fired a dark wave from his scythe, which exploded in her face, and Ayrton shot at her hand a Wind Cutter, which shed a bit of blood, and forced her to release Blake. She tried to pound the ground with her right first, but missed, and Blake shot a light beam at her face. The girl got up, and wiped the blood off her hand. She shot a light beam, which to them was massive and could barely dodge. Ayrton said, worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We aren't hurting her that much...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's alright. I'll take her on...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But we came to rescue you!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know. Back me up. I need all the help I can possibly get...\"- Blake said, and they heard quakes, coming from different directions. Karina and Claire towered over them (and formed a triangle if you count Joana's friend)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... did these little pipsqueaks come to rescue their friend?!\"- Karina said, in a despising tone (Unknown to them, Karina had higher than average training to defend the Princess, although her training was more of melee fight and didn't work properly on humans... still, she's stronger than average and can take more damage without much problem. She also knows some light spells...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, they are the ones I imprisoned earlier...\"- Joana's friend said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought you had already learned your lesson...\"- Karina said to Blake -\"You disappoint me. I thought you already had accepted your fate...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"NOBODY tells MY fate!!\"- Blake readied two golden light energy balls in his hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We do...\"- Said Claire, teasingly. And the three girls aimed their hands at them, and fired three light beams, which Ferdinand and Blake blocked by creating a dark shield that absorbed the light, and shot it back as a single beam, which missed, but caught the three giantesses in its explosion. Blake and his friends then started to run, and soon they heard fast quakes which were nothing else than the giant girls running... until a giant woman stood in front of them. It was a different woman, she had wavy brown hair, and her skin was fair. Her eyes were green, and Blake's friends could tell she wasn't at the celebration. However, Blake knew who she was said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ignore her\"- And tried to walk around her, but she moved, blocking Blake's way. He shouted angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHY YOU?!!\"- And shot several energy balls at her face and chest. They did very little damage, and Lith denied with h head in disappointment. Then the rest of the girls arrived and they found themselves surrounded by 3 giant girls and a giant woman. This was definitively bad...</span></div></div>",

Joana's black-haired friend signaled to Claire, who went to find him.  He continued to speak as he laughed a bit.  The man was kneeling on a roof, echoing his voice with a spell.  \"You're getting warmer.\" Claire neared the perfect spot beneath the roof.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found me!\" He lunged down slashing her cheek with the sword.  She stomped at him but he jumped back and fired a light blue beam right into her forehead, jolting her from consciousness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next?\" The other three stayed put and he sighed.  \"But the fun just started!\" He began charging towards them and stopped just far enough away that they couldn't reach him.  The black-haired friend grabbed Blake and quickly teleported away with him.  Karina started to move in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" He threw a knife that froze her solid.  \"You're special, eh Lith?\" Lith herself was surprised by this man.  I will let you get off fine if you leave.  If not, things'll get ugly.\" Lith stood her ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three, two, one.  Ready or not here...\" he disappeared and smashed the back of her head with full power.  \"Went.\" with each incapacitated, he firmed a ladder of ice up to a roof.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay put, I'll be back.\" He formed a roughly cone shaped shard of ice around him, point facing down.  It drilled into the dungeon, where the black-haired girl sat with Blake restrained and gassed.  She saw the cone fall through the ceiling and the man stepped out of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me Blake.  Now.\" The man was silent and she picked him up.  \"Don't you dare teleport again because, if you do....\" A wavering beam of light blue hit her and drained her energy.  She fell to her knees and she drained her to sleep.  He grabbed Blake and got back into the cone.  He finally arrived on the roof to see a frantic search.  The man handed him to Ferdinand.  He formed a huge bridge of ice, spanning from the rooftop to outside the village.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go across!  I'll get rid of it.\" they ran across and the man followed, melting it.  He began to feel the strain of everything he had done, but continued.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to that village where we stayed a day.  If I'm not there four days from now at noon, I'm caught or dead.  That means keep going back home.\" The gang wondered what he meant, but saw the mob of giantesses at the base of the bridge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ladies.\" he said as he formed a huge golem of ice.  He jumped in and prepared to fight on a more even size scale.  He managed to buy them enough time to escape, and knocked out fourteen giantesses before he failed, but by now the gang was long gone, and only the insignificant seeming cloaked man laid by a bunch of huge feet.</span></div></div>",

Blake, who was that man?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do you expect me to know? You came with him...\"- Blake answered, confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... he seems to know about you and us... we thought he may have been someone you worked for in the past or something...\"- Caesar said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope... I had never seen him...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... I guess this is over... how about going back to Kildevar?\"- Gustave said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhm... no... I'm afraid... we can't...\"- Blake remembered about what Rick told him in the message<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"- All of them asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The incident with the Sand Bandits.. Rick had to call the Royal Army, and you know, a bunch of mercenaries is a perfect scapegoat...\"- Blake answered, but his friends (except Ferdinand) were a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway, we should wait for that man...\"- Blake said -\"After all, he saved us from this mess...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... he told us to keep going as if he wasn't coming back... He said <i>'Go to that village where we stayed a day. If I'm not there four days from now at noon, I'm caught or dead. That means keep going back home'</i> \"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then we'll wait those 4 days...\"- Blake said, and after discreetly removing his metal rings, rode on Tabitha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn 3 hours they arrived to the village Blake's friends stayed previously, and paid for 4 nights at the inn. However, Blake didn't pay for himself, as he usually slept in some tree's branch. It was near sunset and they bought some food to have dinner. Blake's friends were hungry (at normal level) but noticed Blake wasn't as hungry, and ate slowly and little quantity of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's wrong Blake? You should be happy!! You avoided being married to some giant girl...\"- Ayrton said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm glad for that... but I'm just not that hungry...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!\"- His friends (except Ferdinand) asked in confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was fed while I was kept there, thus, I'm not hungry right now...\"- Blake didn't want to do more explaining, and grabbed his glass (filled with water, while the others drank wine or beer) to drink. Then they heard the door opening, and a seemingly unknown man entered in a rush. Blake was the only one who wasn't surprised about him, and the man said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sir!! The duke's reply arrived some hours ago, but I watched your successful escape... I came to deliver you the message anyway, although I guess it's pretty much useless now...\"- He handed Blake a scroll, which read<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Blake. I received the message... I'm sorry, but I don't have the power to do such a thing... Only the King by means of threatening with his army would be able to force the marriage to be nullified... I don't even have much of an army of my own... I'm sorry, the only thing I can do is to pray and to wish you the best luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS: Seriously, a giantess?! Of all people!! I'd hate to be you...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was a bit disappointed, but at least they escaped. However, Blake's mind couldn't rest until he saw the man who saved him and his friends. He owed him, and Blake has a honor sense that tells him that if that man helped them, he would at least thank him himself. Getting back to the message, he thought that he'd better wait for the mysterious man to return, but also worried that if the giantesses caught him, what would they do to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... There's one last thing I'd like to ask you...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it, sir?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have been able to be in the giantess village without being seen. Could you survey them?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh? I can, but what would it be for?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A friend of us is still there, he told us that if he didn't come in 4 days he was caught or dead. I would like you to find out what happened to him. If he's in danger, tell us as soon as possible...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright\"- The messenger left. Blake and his friends would stay for 4 days or until the messenger returned. Although Blake's friends were happy that it was over, only Blake wondered why did someone he doesn't know help him, to the extent of risking his life. That weird feeling that his well-being was costing more than it should tormented Blake's mind, and opaqued the relief of not being married to the giant princess. And also, he wondered what happened to her... Blake dismissed that thought, as he knew it wasn't officially her fault, so, they couldn't blame her... but maybe... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It doesn't matter, she's giant and she's a princess. I don't care' Blake shut his mind up about anything else related to the giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What a hell of a day, huh?\"- Ferdinand said to Blake, whose mind had been absent for a while. Ferdinand didn't know what happened those days Blake was alone, but it left a mark in his mind for sure. The rest of Blake's friends didn't notice this, and were talking about the day, happy about their victory, despite the fact that their savior's fate was unknown. Caesar and Ayrton were thinking about just moving on to somewhere else, and start again, as they had done for years. Gustave somehow also perceived Blake's absent mind, and he thought deeper that maybe he suffered torture of some sort... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, Blake... what happened while you were alone back there?\"- The redhead asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" *Sigh* Nothing worth telling. And, to be honest, very little happened, it was just waiting for that damn wedding day...\"- Blake said, and Gustave added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... we kinda came at last minute...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope... It was supposed to be tomorrow... Today was just some announcement...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then it's even better...\"- Ayrton said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It would have been even more dramatic if we came at the very last moment...\"- Caesar said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's very risky... those things only happen in books...\"- Ayrton said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway, Blake's back, we're no longer slaves... We're at a nice inn... Life's Nice...\"- Gustave said, leaning back in his chair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess...\"- Said a not so convinced Blake, who after finishing his food, went outside, where Tabitha was waiting for him, he petted head, and she purred happily. She was definitively the one who missed him the most. And despite being far larger than her master, she rubbed herself against him (like normal sized cats usually do with their owners' legs as a sign of affection... I don't know how it's called in english), and also licked him in the cheek. Blake stayed with her, playing for about 30 minutes, then, decided to go to sleep, and Tabitha followed him. Both of them climbed to a tree with thick branches, but in difference of other times, this time, the tree had very wide and thick branches, and when Blake laid to sleep, Tabitha climbed near him, and moved him so that his head rested on her back. She usually did this when they slept on the ground, but Blake didn't mind. Tabitha was more comfortable than the tree's branch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whoah... this is almost as comfortable as...' Blake was thinking, and stopped right there, blushing madly, and dismissed that thought as well, and tried to sleep...</span></div></div>",

He knew he needed out, but was surprised that there was no security. He was sitting there, still cloaked, witt a mysterious band over his head. He decided to take care of the cage first, band later. He began to form an ice blade to cut through, but electricity shot out of the band, zapping him until he cut off the magic. He decided to try once more so he could escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was zapped more strongly as he continued and began to scream in pain and curl up in a ball.

Tabitha followed him, and he went to buy some food for him and his cat, he wasn't in the mood for hunting as he always did, Tabitha noticed this, and tried to comfort him by rubbing her head against his side, he smiled at her and petted her head, but Tabitha could sense that that smile was empty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what happened, and the fact that he was sort of hunt like any other animal, made Blake's mood gloomier... Also, the fact that their mysterious savior wasn't in the village yet stung in Blake's mind. He hated when something for him implied something bad for someone else. His grandma died to save him and Ferdinand... his father also died because he hid his very existence (Lith didn't tell him this, but is grandma told him in a more vague way). Blake arrived to a shop and bought some meat and some fruit juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the shopkeeper noticed Blake's mood , and despite he didn't know him, asked politely about it, Blake said it was just something from his job, and that he didn't want to talk further about it. He went back to where the tree, and sat under its shadow, eating and drinking, although he wasn't enjoying it at all. Until the messenger arrived, and noticed him immediately<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sir!! I've got news!! Bad ones!! The g...\"- He started to say, but Blake covered his mouth and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Tell me, but not here. Let's go somewhere else...\"- Blake and the messenger started to walk toward the nearby forest and after getting a good enough distance, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, what happened?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not very clear... but they're torturing the man...\"- The messenger said, Blake grunted at that, then he added -\"Also, it seems that the giant princess has a broken arm or something...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's mind flashed back into his memories...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Some time after rescuing Aranza, and months before he was forced to leave... The girl followed Blake around nearly all day, and wanted to be like him as well, despite being 2 years older. Blake found that she was a decently trained sword fighter, and wielded a nodachi (longer katana-like sword, at least 90 cm). Despite Blake and Ferdinand didn't want her to get involved into their mercenary jobs, she kept appearing, and at least ended up being helpful, in circumstances Blake and Ferdinand alone weren't enough, this was the first moment Blake thought of not only a mercenary duo, but a mercenary squad. He'd think about that later, but wouldn't enroll Aranza for such a job. She was the count's daughter... and it looked rather weird that she acted between typical girl and warrior-tomboyish girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after realizing that she would go to missions with them anyway, he and Ferdinand stopped trying to keep her from that. One of those days, they were fighting a group of rebel warriors, who used their abilities to steal and destroy whatever it was in their way. Blake decided to go ahead and have Ferdinand and Aranza in reserve. He engaged 6 of them at once, and was having a difficult time (Blake was 11 years old by that time). And he was about to be slashed from behind when Ferdinand blocked the incoming sword with his scythe, and helped Blake fighting, then, realizing it was only Ferdinand, he looked to where Aranza was, alone, and other 6 warriors were attacking her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ferdinand, you idiot!! You left Aranza alone!!\"- Blake shouted angrily, and Ferdinand also looked toward her. They could do nothing to help her... unless... Blake took the decision, and while fighting one-handed, used his other hand to remove the weighted metal rings around his wrists and ankles. When he was done, pounded on the ground with his sword, knocking his opponents off their feet and rushed toward the other warriors and Aranza. Blake punched and kicked them with tremendous force, but it was a bit too late...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAranza got badly slashed, and her right arm was nearly cut completely. Ferdinand was horrified, and not many things really freaked him out. Blake performed the healing spell on her (Ferdinand was unable to do this, as it was a light spell), but fell unconscious before completing it. he healed her whole body, and most of her arms, regenerating almost everything but the bone, which wasn't as damaged...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ended up with a wound equivalent to a broken shoulder, and Blake never forgave himself for that, despite she acted cheerful and even kept training using her left hand to wield her sword. Blake also gave Ferdinand the scolding of his life. And he laughed, because even if it was a reckless thing, he knew why Blake got angered.. In the end, nobody blamed them, and Aranza even promised that she'd become stronger so she wouldn't get hurt so easily. Blake facepalmed himself when heard her, not imagining a girl with red waist length hair as a warrior... she looked more like she was, a member of nobility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should leave these jobs to people who doesn't matter...\"- Blake said in a serious tone to her, but she broke the seriousness by playfully pushing him aside...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of when she got her arm nearly completely cut was what haunted Blake for a long while, and just recently had gotten over it to a decent extent... now... Joana's situation reminded him of that day... It was his fault, because he was so persistent on escaping by any means, he was really desperate, but who could blame him? Not much people would marry an unknown girl who, besides anything, was much larger than average houses, or even mansions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sir?\"- The messenger asked, and Blake snapped out of his thoughts, and answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... I'll go to save that man myself... Don't tell my friends. If they ask, I'm doing something personal... and if I'm not back here in 2 days, I either died or failed\"- Blake said and wrote a note in a piece of scroll (he carried several ones to quickly send a message to whoever it was necessary). The message read<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'To Ferdinand, Gustave, Ayrton and Caesar: If you're reading this, it means that it's been over 2 days after I went on a personal mission. I intended to rescue the man who helped us, but by this time, I'm probably imprisoned or dead. Don't go back to that giantess village, and go somewhere else, wherever you may get a job. Keep the team alive, that would be my only last will...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's not much more I'd write. I've lived for 17 years... I've done many things, and didn't do many more. I've made mistakes I will never make up for... And I've regretted for many things I didn't do at their time... People who knows me knows different things about me... but that doesn't really matter... Guys,it was nice to meet you, all of you.... and it was my pleasure to have worked with all of you for all these years...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake ended by adding his sign, and gave it to the messenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"After two days, if I'm not here, give this to them. Don't let them find out before the two days... That's the last thing I'd ask from you. Thank you very much for everything\"- Blake shook hands with the messenger, and started to walk, heading for the giantess village...</span></div></div>",

Joana, to pass the time, called in her black-haired friend, who he learned was named Taylor, and they were talking.  She asked why she chose to keep him from the dungeon, and she said it was because he would be tortured.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does it matter?  He attacked us.\" Joana replied with something that he didn't think a single giantess would have seen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He attacked us to protect and save some people he cares about.  Didn't you attack them because you care about me?\" Taylor stopped to think.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they broke your wrist...\" Joana smiled a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I did that.

It's just that there's something I must do before leaving...\"- Blake did some quick movements with his hands, then, he said -\"Shine, sun's gentle glow, 10 days of spring, heal, stop the bleeding, close the wounds with nature's touch...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana's arm was illuminated by golden light, and it gave her a warm and pleasant feeling, meanwhile, her broken bone, damaged muscle and everything was being regenerated. She noticed that Blake was putting a lot of effort into healing her, and she reasoned that healing a giant would be much more energy consuming than healing several people...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait a minute!! How can a human perform an advanced light spell?!! Light magic is exclusive to giants!!\"- Taylor was very surprised when she noticed what Blake was doing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"- Joana was surprised, as she temporarily forgot about Blake's real nature, but soon she remembered about it <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, it seems that it's not anymore. Not that I care...\"- Blake said, and headed for the window, but Taylor stood in front of him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where do you think you're going?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm done. I'm leaving...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you mean?!\"- Taylor asked in an angry tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I just came to fix what I did wrong. I never said I was going to stay and be married...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But... but...\"- Taylor was confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She got hurt because of me. I came to fix that. Now, we're all even, I don't owe you anything, nor you owe me anything. I shall leave and we'll never meet ever again, I promise...\"- Blake resumed walking toward the window, but Taylor extended her hand in front of him, to which Blake replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fine...\"- He extended his right arm (toward the right) and closed his eyes. His sword came back to his hand, and both giant girls were surprised by this. Taylor knew that it was another advanced spell, but Blake bypassed the incantation, something that only sages were said to be able to do... Taylor was starting to wonder who was really this human...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your princess has done me no wrong. But if you try to prevent me from leaving, I'll fight...\"- Blake dashed toward the window, and anticipated that Taylor would try to catch him in her hand, which he dodged. Then, he disappeared, and quickly reappeared behind Taylor. She reacted by turning around very quickly and fired a white light ball at him, which Blake deflected with his hand.  Taylor then muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Power of light, bind the foe, spare his life and tie the ropes\"- She fired two ropes made of golden light, but much to her dismay, Blake was able to catch both of them in his hands, and they shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Impossible!!\"- Taylor shouted (She was a medium-high class light magician, which meant not many people would be able to break her spells so easily), then, Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Golden shine, brighter than thunder, disable my enemy, by piercing their nerves... Paralyze, Seven Solar Spears!!\"- He shot a beam that split into 7 spears made of pure golden light (which by the way was another thing that alarmed Taylor even more, as using golden light energy implied that the user was someone very powerful), and they pierced, 2 through her shoulders, 2 pierced her knees, 2 pierced her hands, and the last one pierced her chest. Although they didn't cause physical damage, they paralyzed the black haired giant girl completely, only her vital functions were untouched. Then Blake headed calmly outside...</span></div></div>",

At the same time a man was watching Blake finish Taylor.  After binding the giant girl he begins to leave.  He drops in next to Blake.  He is wearing a black trench coat that covers his entire body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Blake.\" He walks closer to him, looking around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fighting with simple peasant girls, eh?  Maybe I will serve as more of a challenge.\" He immediately begins to float into the air and throws his arms wide.  The trench coat falls, which leaves the man in a black suit of extremely light, but just as strong armor.  He looks to Blake, purple eyes and shoulder length black hair that falls in a ponytail, which makes no bash to how imposing he looks.  Blake is still confident he can beat the man.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend in the cloak won't be there to save you.  Now you fight alone.\" The man smashes into Blake with surprising speed, sending him into the wall and leaving a dent where he hit.  Blake solemnly removes the metal rings that restrain is strength and rushes at the man.  He sends a black beam into his chest and he flies back into the wall.  Blake fores his own beam but the man dodges it.  Blake fires many more, each either deflected or dodged.  Until one hits the man.  He steps back and laughs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are weak.  Look, you are tired already.\" Blake was beginning to show strain from his fighting.  The man charges at him, first tricking him with a fake punch and hitting him with a real one, which leads to a combo of about twelve punches and kicks.  The man finally throws him into the air and them flies into him, careening them both down to the ground.  Blake lies defeated and the man stands.  The man leans in and whispers in his ear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no fighting destiny.\" He smashes Blake's face, leaving him unconscious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start the wedding tomorrow.

He has to be real stupid to despise such a life...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana sighed in defeat, she knew nobody cared about other than their own species. She had got to know a bit of Blake, and she already felt he was someone who didn't do his job for the money, but rather for the living style... something that it would be taken away from him against his own will...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was secured with a double binding spell by Karina and Taylor. However, Joana still took him with her, and said she'd go out for a walk. She looked for Blake's mother, a seemingly lonely woman called Lith. It took her a while but she found her house. Lith was surprised to see the princess... After Joana explained briefly what was going on, Lith asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see... he came back to heal you... now, where is he?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Here...\"- Joana took him out of her skirt pocket and showed him to her, and felt ashamed of Blake's mother seeing him tied with light ropes -\"Someone beat him up, and he won't wake up... he also told us to do the wedding tomorrow...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He didn't get to recover properly...\"- Lith mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Also... I'm a bit afraid...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Lith asked with a confused tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Taylor and maybe the others will suspect of him... everyone saw him using light magic... and Taylor said he used advanced spells, even bypassing the incantations sometimes... I know he's your son... which means he is... a...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know...\"- Lith sighed -\"A hybrid...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What if everyone wants him dead because of that?\"- Joana asked, genuinely worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Karina already knows, and I doubt anyone would interfere... in fact, it'd be better to know that you'll be married to someone who won't die by accidents... Ask any woman my age or older and they'll tell you what was like when their human husbands lived...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened to them?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They were killed by the King's Elites... The very same ones that killed all other Zasshu hybrids...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"- Joana didn't know what to say, but Lith patted her shoulder, comforting her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry. What already happened can't be changed...\"- Lith said -\"By the way... you haven't told me the real reason you're here for... I doubt you just came to visit me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana looked down, sighed, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I came to ask you... to deny your consent on Blake marrying me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I got to know a few things he told me himself... he liked very much his lifestyle... and I'm nobody to take it away from him... Anyway, he'd hate me for it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm afraid I can't...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why? If it's about the money, don't worry, you won't have yo pay anything... it's just that I feel bad ruining Blake's life...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLith put her hand on Joana's shoulder, and gave her a serious look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Tell me something. Why would you care so much about him? Why did you bother to come here to practically ask me to cancel the wedding?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana blushed, and looked down nervously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I... I just...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's alright. I trust you. You'll be a good wife...\"- Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"N-No... it's not that!! It's just... well... I don't know how to explain it...\"- Joana was blushing a lot<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know it's just been like a week... but I see you already have certain feelings for him...\"- Lith laughed -\"Don't feel ashamed. It's just that I went though almost the same... I recognize that look...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Also... my son needs to learn some things... like to see through appearances...\"- Lith added, and Joana blinked twice, she remembered that Blake had stated he didn't like anyone in particular, but he would never choose a giant... which had saddened her previously... however, now Joana reacted with a mixture of anger and embarrassment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Does that mean you're using me as a punishment?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course not... you're a nice girl. Blake just needs to realize of that himself... He didn't tell me, but since I first saw him, I felt he needed love in his life... And you can be the one to give him that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana's face was nearly as red as a tomato after hearing Lith saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... don't worry... you won't be doing anything wrong... and if you want, you can blame it on me. Blake was angry at me anyway...\"- Lith said, and Joana perceived the very slight sadness in Lith's talk. Joana knew she wouldn't deny her consent, so, there was nothing else to be done. She said goodbye to Lith and left. When she walked outside, Lith said to her, laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Tell Blake I want at least a grandchild!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana just waved goodbye, and blushed even more. After she walked some distance, and her redness disappeared,  she muttered to Blake, to whom she was holing in her cupped hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do...\"- Joana still felt bad about Blake, but tried to calm down and listen to what Lith said...</span></div></div>",

Get packed while I go get horses. Ferdinand, you ride Tabitha. We are getting Blake back if we need to storm the place to save him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later the gang sat on horses, preparing to travel once more to a place they hoped could remain a bad memory.  They traveled fast, pushing the horses to keep up a fast pace for a long time. As the sun came down they stop under a small group of trees. The group eventually rifts off to sleep, but the man stays awake. He walks a long ways away and begins powering up. The band around his head begins to overload him but he continues until the pain seems unbearable and the band snaps down the middle. The man is not finished yet and begins his next fight of the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes a few deep breaths as a light blue symbol forms on the ground, steadily growing and glowing brighter.  A flash of light comes and a golem of ice is left standing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove your worth or find peace in death!\" the golem's voice is nearly a whisper and can only be heard in the man's mind.  He pulls out his swords and feels a vertigo as the world blurs by, leaving him in a desolate, icy wasteland.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I be freed, we can rule the world make it like this, make it perfect.\" The golem now stands fuller and stronger than before due to it being in its home element.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You were sealed for a reason.

Its eyes glow white, blazing with rage.  The man steps out of the path of a clawed hand, throwing a knife into the golem's back and jumping away.  The golem holds its arms out and begins firing ice shards at an extremely fast rate.  The man brings up a shield of ice that collects the shards and then fires them back in one burst.  Ice shards collect and the golem takes a sluggish step back.  The man looks at the golem who begins walking to him.  Then.....</span></div></div>",

They were simple, but effective to stop him from being beaten to a pulp or having to move away from this extra icy patch of land.  The golem took a step and realized too late as the ground flew up in a catapult motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golem went back about forty feet, not too far, but enough to buy time.  If his plan works, the golem should go down with two spells and a powerful thrust of his sword. The man had drained all the ice out of this patch and continued moving, collecting the ice in a cavern below. He drained a second patch of ice. With another, he would be ready.  The man fires off an ice harpoon, which smashed into the golem's head. It pulled it out and laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Running away and using traps?  Are you scared of me?\"The man smiled as he finished gathering ice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  You should be afraid of me.\" The man raised his arm as a mass of ice rose from the ground.  It was about ten feet around and the man smashed it into the golem's back, rocketing it to him.  He takes out a sword and pulls it back, waiting for the moment.  He thrusts it with all his strength and it hits the golem in a weak spot formed by the javelin.  The sword pierces the golem's head and the man feels the world blur again and he stands once again near the camp.  He walks back and goes to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>2 days earlier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Joana's last attempt at stopping the wedding, she had no other option other than going back to the castle and rest. the next day, she woke up, and found Blake was still seemingly unconscious, she poked him very lightly with her finger, and he moved a bit, which relieved her, she knew he was sleeping. She laid back on her bed, as she had nothing to do, Karina told her to stay inside and to spend time with Blake for the two days that were left, she didn't have much hopes of Blake changing his mind but at least get him to accept the idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Joana didn't agree, but could do nothing about it. Some minutes later, Blake woke up, just to find he was tied with 2 light based spells. He then noticed he was inside Joana's room, and that she was laying on her bed. Blake analyzed briefly the spells, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Tch... Is this the best those girls can do?\"- He closed his eyes, and the light ropes shattered, as well as the light chains. Joana noticed this and quickly sat up. Blake, without even looking at her, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't even bother saying anything. I'm outta here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But... Blake... You'll get hurt...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh. A bunch of giants isn't enough to stop me...\"- Blake just walked toward the window, and pushed it open, then, he proceeded to go outside, but after taking 5 steps, he started to get electroshocked, and fell down to the window's base, as he didn't get to jump out of it. He tried to crawl but he kept being electroshocked, and Joana quickly got up and picked him up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was trying to tell you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They used an old spell to keep you captive...\"- Joana explained -\"Karina wanted us to spend some time... uh... before... the wedding...\"- Joana said hesitantly, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's it!! I don't care about the pain, I'm definitively outta here!!\"- Blake stood up, checked if he had the rings on (they were still in his pocket) took some steps back, and dashed outside, however, doing so also triggered an alarm that that was placed by another spell, Karina was alerted by it, and called Claire and several other servants outside, Karina yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell do you think you're doing?! How did you break from that double seal?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" 1, I'm leaving, and 2, That's none of your business...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm going to count to 5, and if you're not inside that castle, I...\"- Karina said, charging up a white energy ball, but she felt a slashing pain in her right cheek, and noticed Blake had fired a golden beam, and had disappeared, next thing he did was to punch Claire in the stomach, then, he hit another servant's back of the neck. Karina shot the white light ball at him but Blake deflected it back, and added two of his own (again, his are golden). When Blake landed on the floor, he started to get electroshocked, but he jumped, as he had found the spell's weakness, it only worked as long as he stood on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother female servant started chanting a light spell, but Blake punched her in the back of the neck, and jumped again, this time, he was surrounded by 4 servants, and Karina, who had gotten up. Blake was in a giant tree's branch. The girls aimed their hands at him and charged up white light beams, and fired them, but Blake stopped all of them at once with his bare hands, and absorbed them through them. He glowed in a golden aura and his body got healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then performed another spell without incantation, and formed a bow made of light. With it, he fired several light arrows at the giant servants at amazing speed. Blake then disappeared and reappeared behind Karina, and hit the back of her neck with his knee. Then, he did quick moves with his hands, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Golden shine, brighter than thunder, disable my enemy, by piercing their nerves... Paralyze, Seven Solar Spears!!\"- He had summoned the same spell he used against Taylor some time ago. The light spears hit her hands, knees, shoulders and chest, and paralyzed Karina completely. Blake took impulse to jump to a nearby tree, and barely had time to dodge a huge light beam, it was Joana's black haired friend, Taylor, was still standing, and wasn't going to let him go so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake knew he had to do something, but also, more servants came, and the ones he had knocked out were getting up... this was not good... Taylor then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why don't you just give up already? There's nothing you can do!! You're gonna marry the princess and that's all!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor's phrase was like the last straw for Blake's mind. He answered firmly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Never!! I am a proud low class* warrior!! I will fight until the last moment!!\"- Blake then sighed, and muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shining light of the heavens, burn the enemy, using my soul, destroy, incinerate them down to ashes...\"- Blake then jumped from the tree toward Taylor, while added -\"Golden Blade Cremation!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor opened her eyes wide, as she thought Blake was bluffing... the spell he had done was one of the most powerful ones among light magic, also, it required the user's life, thus, it was known as a \"Sacrificial Spell\". Blake's grandma had taught it to him but she told him not to use it unless it was a real emergency, and this was a real emergency to Blake. Blake's grandma used a dark analog version of it to save him and Ferdinand from the angry crowd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above, a giant sword made of golden light landed right on Taylor, and created a colossal explosion that engulfed her and the servants (about 15, counting Karina), after the light and smoke vanished, Blake was surprised to find himself to be alive, as he knew that if he used that spell he would die... he muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I... I... did it... at last...\"- Blake coughed up blood, but stubbornly he started walking away (By this point, the spell that kept him captive was nullified when Karina took such enormous damage). Blake was limping, but still, he felt like the luckiest man in the world, he had meant to die while taking the giants with him, but instead, he survived. He walked some more, but then, Lith appeared suddenly before him (Using a similar high speed technique to that of Blake, high level magicians of any element have this ability, although in difference of all of them, Blake does it with just raw strength)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dammit...\"- Blake muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't believe you used that spell to escape the wedding!!\"- Lith sounded disappointed and angry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're nobody to tell me what's good or wrong!! You sold me out!!\"- Blake shouted, and coughed more blood<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm trying to teach you a lesson...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That giants are evil? I already knew that...\"- Blake fell to the ground, with no more strength to stand on his feet, Lith picked him up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can't judge someone by their appearance or size...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're not the best example... Anyway, if I wanted I may learn that, but not marrying a giant girl!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why not?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I don't want to!! I want my life back!! As it used to be, with my friends, missions, and nothing of these stupid things to worry about!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Lith wouldn't change her mind, the fact that he used a fatal spell meant Blake didn't value his life enough. She knew Blake would be very angry at her, and maybe not speak to her ever again, but she knew she was doing the right thing. Blake noticed she was walking toward the castle, and drew his sword, and saying no words, stabbed himself through the chest, much to Lith's shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's more honor in dying as a warrior than in living as a slave...\"- Blake muttered very silently, and fell unconscious, expecting death. It was a decision he had made while he traveled to do things right (saving the mysterious man and healing Joana), that if he failed to escape, the only way to really escape would be to take away something not even they could get back, his life... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>*It's been said several times that mercenaries were usually seen as low class, and even some of them were people who failed at making it to the Royal Elites, although Blake and his friends are on par with almost any Elite Squadron.</b></font></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However... he woke up... in Joana's room once again... He was bandaged, and inside a bowl filled with herbal water. He noticed that his sword was still next to him, but he still felt angry at failing even at killing himself. He noticed Joana wasn't in her bed, and he turned around, she was sitting in a chair, near the table the bowl was on. He felt that he had very little strength left, and even standing up was a bit of struggle. He put his black cape on (it was laid next to him, completely intact, as he didn't damage it when he stabbed himself) and grabbed his sword, he said nothing but started to walk away, then it was when Joana spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your mother was very worried about you... She used her best healing spells to keep you alive...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't care. I'm still leaving...\"- Blake answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why did you try to kill yourself?\"- Joana sounded like she was about to cry, but this only annoyed Blake, as he thought it was none of her business, and that he should be the upset one. Still, he replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because dying as a warrior is better than living as a slave. Someone without freedom is as good as dead. That's a lesson your princess life will never teach you... Even when you apparently have everything, you lack that freedom... And that's why you'll never understand my reasons... I'll just tell you, that if I'm gonna die, I'll die as what I am, a warrior... a free warrior, not some girl's slave...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't have enough strength to survive outside... You can barely walk...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do you care? To you, I'm just another slave, and you already have a lot...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I care because despite what you think, I appreciate life. I never agreed to Karina paying the sand bandits to capture someone and I never agreed to have that someone forced to marry me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, sure...\"- Blake was still walking away, and jumped from the table, although he fell, because his legs, as well as the rest of his body, were heavily weakened. Joana stood up and walked, standing before Blake, she sighed and said, looking down, staring at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I also tried to convince your mother to deny her consent... But she didn't listen to me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was briefly with a surprised look, but soon he regained composure and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't believe you...\"- Right in that moment, Blake froze, as he realized Joana MET his mother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What would I gain if I lied?\"- Joana asked, but she got no answer, Blake was now frozen, realizing that if Joana met his mother, that means that she knows he's a hybrid... Joana stared at him, and somehow knew what he was thinking, and she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, I know your mother is a giant... what's wrong with that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've been told that if anyone found ever what I really am, I'd be executed, although my grandma never told me what exactly was I in the first place...\"- Blake said, feeling unable to do anything by this moment, Joana felt bad for him, she remembered being taught that the human king ordered a genocide of all hybrids...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nobody's going to kill you here...\"- Joana tried to calm Blake, or help him in some way<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yet, my life is going to be thrown to waste... death is not so bad after fighting so many battles... as I said, it's preferable to die free than to live enslaved...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you die you're not getting your old life back. You lose whatever you liked...\"- Joana said, and Blake stopped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"SHUT UP!! You have NO IDEA about what's life!!\"- Blake was very angry at her for saying he'd lose anyway -\"I don't have to stand this...\"- Blake tried to run, but his muscles failed, and wounds opened in his ankles, result of the weakening from the sacrificial spell. He also coughed more blood, but he spat it out, and crawled, muttering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No wound is gonna stop me!!\"- Blake's body was suffering from a hellish pain, which was worse than when he stabbed himself, but he stubbornly kept on trying to escape, and more wounds opened in his torso and arms, the bandages changed to red from his intense bleeding, while Blake still crawled toward the window. He managed to stand up and jump, but when he landed, he fainted from the effort and the immense pain, that not even he could handle. Joana picked him up, and put him in the herbal water once again, but this time, used a weakened version of the light ropes spell to bind Blake's wrists and ankles with small ropes, which were proportionate to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she laid on her bed, and cried silently, for the pain she was causing, and that she was unable to remedy it. She felt really guilty about having Blake forced to marry her, and knew he'd hate her if he was forced to stay alive and with her. She was mad at Karina for having someone to marry her, and for hiring the sand bandits to get a strong person that might withstand living with giants... although she knew Karina's intention was to accomplish what she was ordered to, and that if she failed, she'd fall into dishonor for letting the Royal Family die out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she was between 2 bad situations, and her attempts at fixing the mess failed (telling Karina to release Blake, and trying to have Lith denying her consent). She also felt bad because Blake returned to save the man who led his friends to save him, and because he felt guilty about hurting her, the only giantess he believed innocent at the time. Blake could have chosen not to return and let the man die... but his attitude showed that Blake respected others' lives as well, as long as they didn't mess with him of course. Joana had seen part of this, that Blake was noble and actually nicer than he seems, but the circumstances put them as enemies, at least from Blake's point of view...</span></div></div>",

His whole body still ached, although the wounds closed. He sighed, knowing he wouldn't be able to get up, and went back to sleep, as he didn't want to think about what's going to happen if he stays there for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake would've liked to get revenge on all the giantesses, and knew many mercenaries would give it a try for the giant food and coins, but at the same time, he wanted to get away from there and never come back, which was also more realistic to do, although if he got someone else to tell some bad thing about them, the King might lead a war against them. He fell asleep thinking about that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake woke up once again, this time, by the feeling of someone pulling his arm, and when he opened his eyes, it was Tabitha, and his friends had just come in, and used their elemental spells to create an explosion, and got out of there. Running away on horses, while Blake and Ferdinand rode on Tabitha. Blake noticed the mysterious man ahead of them, who, without turning his head, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your friends are really good ones\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nodded in response, as they kept getting away. 2 days and many hours later, by sunset, they were away enough, and stopped in the nearest village they found. Blake was a bit surprised about escaping being so easy, but thought it was just a lot of luck. He petted Tabitha's head several times, in relief of escaping from being married to a giant girl. They went into an inn, and Blake was asked by his friends what happened, and he only spoke about the battle he nearly won. Blake's friends wanted to know a bit more about Blake's days as captive (they didn't know the full reasons Blake went back there) but he refused to tell further, then they heard a voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't believe it... Blake, the mercenary leader, prisoner?\"- Everyone turned to where the voice came from, and they were really surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anthony... what are you doing here?\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is that the way to greet an old friend?\"- Anthony then got up and laughed, and said -\"You haven't changed at all\"- He walked toward Blake and his friends' table<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, I've been told so...\"- Blake said -\"I thought you were with the Elites\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I am. I'm now a Major\"- Anthony then sat in another seat with Blake and his friends<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Congratulations\"- Blake's friends said, not too cheerfully, as the Elites usually looked down on almost everyone else<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was taking a break here, after a mission... we were sent to investigate on abnormal activities...\"- Anthony said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like what?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, some massive demonstrations of energy were sighted like a week ago... The King said that if the Sand Bandits or such someone is getting that strong, he, she or them might be a threat...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looked at the table thoughtfully, and said to Anthony<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have some things to talk to you... in private...\"- Blake said, he and Anthony got up and went outside. They walked toward the forest, and Anthony crossed his arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's going on, Blake?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Can I still trust you?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course!! Don't let this armor fool you, you're still my friend!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I want you to swear that you're not going to reveal who am I, or my friends, nor how you got this information...\"- Blake said, with a very serious look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course I wouldn't betray a friend. What's up?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... Actually, me and the guys were involved in the incident you're after\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We had been working at Kildevar for a while, and when we got a day off, we went to the forest and have lunch, but the Sand Bandits attacked us\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems they were no match for you\"- Anthony tried to cheer Blake up, but Blake looked down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We lost to them... they used some sort of paralyzing venom during the fight... But that's not all\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The Sand Bandits aren't the real threat... there's something you're not going to believe\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Giants... they were the ones who paid the bandits to catch us\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Giants? I was taught they were extinct!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They aren't, believe me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know, Blake... it's a bit weird\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What would I gain by lying to you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have a point\"- Anthony scratched his chin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The giants are the real threat, they paid the bandits to catch us\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why? Did I miss the day you attacked a giant?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We NEVER messed with them, hell, we didn't even know such beings existed... but they are evil... truly evil... They paid the bandits to get them slaves, and were after strong people so they could carry on tasks for giant people\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. In the end, only I was sold, my friends were bought by someone else, who freed them... and they rescued me... but the point is, the giants must not exist anymore\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is something big... heh, no pun intended\"- Anthony laughed at his unintentional joke, then went back to serious mood -\"Do you know where are they hiding?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, but it'll take a while to get there. We need a lot of resources and a great force\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you get a great force to fight them, I'll fight as well. I'm gonna take revenge on these people... I am no man's slave, let alone a woman's\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Woman? Are you not telling me something?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed, then he said -\"They are mostly female, but don't let that fool you. They're evil... and they have also know some magic. They'll be dangerous...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You better not be lying, Blake... I'll go back to report on this...\"- Anthony walked with Blake, and Anthony got on a light brown horse, and left. Blake then heard a voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure on what you did?\"- It was the mysterious man that saved him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How long have you been here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Long enough. Anyway, thanks for not mentioning me. But I still ask... are you sure on what you've just done? Will you unleash and participate in what seems to be going to be a genocide?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. I'm not forgiving those damn giants!! They are just giant beasts!!\"- Blake said, clenching his fists (Nobody so far, other than Blake himself knows Blake's mother is a giant)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not all of them were, Blake, and you know it...\"- The man said, Blake immediately thought of Joana, but he replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sucks to be them then. It's not my problem... But I won't let live anyone from their kind\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Was really that evil that they tried to get you married to their princess?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"H-how the hell do you know?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Me and your friends actually listened a bit of Joana's conversation with her friend Taylor... also, she mentioned that it was what you were bought for...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, yeah. It is evil to get me married to anyone by force...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A species desperate for survival, trying to not die out... and this is what they'll get?\"- The man asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know nothing about them. They're just a bunch of wild beasts...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry, but if you are going to fight them, I won't help you... I won't get stained by innocent blood...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you saying you'll be on their side after they were to execute you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No. I won't be on anyone's side...\"- The man sighed -\"But, Blake... I thought you'd be better than this...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've worked as a mercenary for years, yet, this is the first time it's personal. And I will never forgive those who have been evil to me for no reason...\"- Blake said, clenching his fists tightly. The man sighed, and left, nowhere to be seen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was asked by his friends, and told them the man left for personal reasons, and told them about the next battle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Will we going back there again?!\"- Ayrton asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This time, with reinforcements\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why don't you let the Royal Army handle this?\"- Gustave asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because those damn beasts made it personal!!\"- Blake shouted, and punched the table with anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah, I had never seen you THAT angry\"- Ferdinand commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That is because this is the first time someone tries to force me to be a slave\"- Blake said, calming a bit, but it had been revealed already that he was repressing a lot of anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... I guess we should train while we wait for Anthony\"- Caesar said, and the rest of the group nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We'll start tomorrow. For now, let's get a good sleep\"- Blake said, and most of his friends went to their rooms, except Ferdinand, who was holding a cup of wine, and asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Tell me something Blake, would you be this mad if Aranza's father suggested you marrying her? I know you're mad at the giants because of that\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake moved very quickly, grabbing Ferdinand's neck, and squeezed it a bit, starting to strangle him -\"Don't EVER DARE to compare Aranza to such animals!!\"- Blake released his grip on Ferdinand, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay... that answers my question...\"- He left, and Blake went to a tree to sleep, and was followed soon by Tabitha, who again put herself as a pillow for Blake (she does that always). Blake stared at the stars in the sky until he fell asleep...</span></div></div>",

I was sleeping on a tree...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... Haven't you realized yet?\"- A mysterious man, completely covered in a dark hooded cloak spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Realized what?\"- He said, turning to face this unknown person<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The hate you feel now... it's the same hate that brought an end to the Dark Magicians... the king hated them deeply and wished to slay every single of them, just like now you want to do to the giants...\"- The mysterious man said, and from hearing him, Blake concluded it was most likely an old man, but still had no idea who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The Dark Magicians weren't offering the King to be a monster's toy...\"- Blake replied, and the old man smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But who's the real monster?\"- The old man said and Blake heard thunder, he saw imaged of the giantess village burning, dead bodies, both from giants and humans laying on the floor, in puddles of their own blood, while further away, some humans and some giantesses were still fighting violently...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What they did may not be completely justifiable, but still, it was a species' desperate attempt to avoid extinction... and YOU brought this upon them for it...\"- The old man said in a more echoing voice, and Blake saw Joana and her servants not even trying to fight back, instead they were trying to escape. Karina and Taylor were just trying their best to protect Joana while Royal Elites started to swarm around them. They were stomping and just killing as many soldiers as possible, but every time they got even more wounds and eventually both were on the ground. clinging hard onto life, leaving Joana alone. Blake could see more soldiers go at her, and he couldn't help but look away...The vision stopped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why did you look away?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I didn't want to see her get killed...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed in annoyance, seeing where this was going -\"Because she's innocent...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought you said giants were monsters\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not all of them... in the true monsters sense... but physically, she's just as much as any other giant...\"- Blake replied trying to not let the man be entirely right, he laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You still care about her...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just because she's innocent so far...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, now what?\"- Blake asked raising an eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have already confronted you with what you're intending to do, you still have a choice, there's still time. The rest is up to you...\"- The old man vanished just as mysteriously as he had appeared, and his whole world started fading away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake woke up, he was sleeping on Tabitha on the tree's branch \"Damnit, that was some dream...\" Blake mumbled annoyed, and he jumped off to the ground to get some water to drink. After he quenched his thirst, he headed back outside and saw Anthony and a considerable number of Royal Elites who had just arrived, most on horse, and a few on giant cats like Tabitha. Blake looked around and roughly counted less than 100 men<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is this all you got?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I found that if we were to go to war against giants, it would be actually somewhat of a big deal with the King and it would take long for us to get even an approval, so, I discussed it with my men and we agreed to pull this off on our own! All the more fame to all of us for slaying the monsters ourselves\"- Anthony said with a boastful laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I should remind you they are like freaking over 100 feet tall and know magic... I think we'd get slaughtered if we even try to attempt this as we are...\"- Blake said, sincerely trying to dissuade them from attacking <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, we are royal elites. We kill giant beasts and fight armies for a living\"- Anthony said in a reassuring tone -\"We should be able to put these giants back to their graves, where they belong...\"- Anthony offered his hand and Blake shook it, however he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I will lead you there as promised, but, I reconsidered about having my squad participate in this battle... You're on your own Anthony\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's no problem\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then snapped his fingers and Tabitha jumped off the tree, he rode on her and then they started advancing toward what Blake called the forest of the giant trees. He left his friends sleeping at the hotel because he didn't intend to go fight anymore, however, he still felt like he might be still unleashing the massacre he saw in his dream. When they had just got to the entrance of the forest, Blake's friends had caught up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why did you not tell us?\"- Ferdinand asked annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I decided we're not participating in this battle. I'm just leading them to the village and the rest is up to them\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's friends were a bit relieved to see their leader regained his calmer behavior and gave him thumbs up, however they decided to accompany him. Blake broke several branches and Gustave lit them so everyone had a torch except Blake, who used a golden light orb himself and they walked into the forest, there was a minor shaking and everyone stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are there giant beasts in the forest?\"- Anthony asked, looking around and illuminating with his torch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know, didn't run into any when I was here myself\"- Blake replied, but he felt the shaking growing stronger 'I don't like it though, it gives me a bad feeling...' Suddenly, they noticed giant shadows move between the trees, and before they knew they were surrounded by Lith, Karina, Claire, Taylor, and a few guards<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Holy hell!\"- Anthony exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How the...?!\"- Blake's eyes opened wide, and Karina smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Going through the forest with those torches is quite a manner of giving away your position...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How come...?\"- Ayrton thought out loud but Karina interrupted him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We have far greater night vision than you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damnit...\"- Ferdinand mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"EVERYBODY RUN NOW!\"- Blake used his golden orb to flash a blinding light for a few seconds, which everyone used to start running away, however, only Blake's friends made it out of the forest, Karina had anticipated herself to this and closed her eyes, preventing her getting blinded, and she used a massive light rope spell to tie up Anthony and his forces. Blake himself was also unable to escape because despite getting blinded, Claire managed to catch him in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recovered her sight rather quickly and smiled, Blake gulped, and Karina walked closer to them, a small firefly made entirely of golden light flew from Blake's shoulder and it vanished -\"A tracking spell, of course...\"- Blake facepalmed himself hard for failing to notice he had been marked with such a thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Trying to get us slain by the Royal Army is a bit harsh, isn't it?!\"- She asked barely suppressing her anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was angry, I admit to being wrong, but you provoked me with this 'bought slave' nonsense!\"- Blake said, somehow managing to both sound humble yet defiant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I would kill you right here and now if you weren't so valuable\"- Karina replied tightening her grip on Blake, despite this, he didn't show any sings of bein in pain, and then he suddenly smiled, and Karina noticed this, she felt the pain of getting wounded with sharp weapons in several parts of her back and legs, and let go of Blake by reflex, he landed safely while Anthony and his soldiers started attacking the giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Simple girls with basic spell usage think they can take on Royal Elites just because you're oversized? Hmph...\"- Anthony said and taunted Karina, who even stopped paying attention to Blake and tried to stomp on Anthony instead, he laughed as he kept dodging every stomp and mocked her each time. Meanwhile, the other soldiers were attacking Taylor, Claire and the guards, and while some did manage to wound them, many soldiers got smacked against trees or the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the forest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's friends heard and saw that explosions started, and the ground was shaking violently -\"So, the fight already started...\"- Ayrton said -\"Yeah, and we ran away like rats!\"- Ferdinand said, clenching his fists in anger -\"I doubt we stand a chance against them with such a small force\"- Caesar said, trying to help -\"Screw it, Blake is there, and I'm not letting them take him prisoner again or kill him! I'll go... Whether you want to follow or leave is up to each of yo... only come if you're not afraid\"- Ferdinand said and rode on Tabitha, who seemed to agree to this whole situation and headed back inside the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was intense for sure...\"- Gustave commented, scratching the back of his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake is the last light magician, Ferdinand the last dark one... And they've gone on adventures together since before even forming this mercenary squad, I think they understand each other pretty well, both are sort of outcasts that aren't even supposed to exist by the King's law, and they have stuck together since they were kids... Even I, who has been with them for less time, feel like I can't just ditch Blake...\"- Ayrton said -\"I'm going too\"- Caesar and Gustave just nodded to each other and followed as well...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Royal Elites kept fighting the giantesses using both elemental magic, which varied for everyone, and sword fighting as well as acrobatic skills, this particular terrain surrounded by giant trees favored them in fighting the giantesses, they might have not as many chances to strike back in an open field. However, despite their young age, Karina, Taylor and the guards were actually trained soldiers as well, although they weren't used to fighting enemies much smaller than themselves. Despite their best efforts, however, most of the men were defeated, with only Anthony and a few others still standing after about 15 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony jumped and bounced off one of the trees and seemingly had Karina in a perfect angle to slice her neck from behind, but a few meters before reaching her, Blake appeared before him and blocked his sword with his own, and Karina turned around and looked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you think you are doing?!\"- Anthony asked furiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Saving your freaking life\"- Blake whispered, and they landed on the ground, but still, their blades locked against each other -\"Don't move your head, but try to look from the upper corners of your eyes... if you got JUST any closer, that black haired giantess was ready to blow you up...\"- Anthony glanced, and indeed, Taylor was charging a golden energy ball, ready to fire at any moment, but lowered her hand when she observed the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I also saved your men from getting finished off\"- Blake showed him a pile with the unconscious men, they let go of the blade lock and Anthony sighed in annoyance -\"You're still stubborn about sacrificing a few lives to achieve something greater... that's the sole thing keeping you from being an exceptional leader, Blake, if you just put that aside, you could be one of those generals that make history...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who's to say what lives are to be thrown as sacrifice? Would you agree if one of those lives was your own? If there is a God, maybe he could tell because he created us and stuff, but otherwise, deeming other lives anything less than equal in value to your own is foolish and is what separates us humans from animals and monsters...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina was amazed at the speech, but she frowned shortly afterwards to try to hide it. They were all interrupted as Blake's friends arrived to the scene and started attacking the giantesses, while Ferdinand pulled both Blake and Anthony further away from Karina -\"Are you two stupid or what?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them stopped in their tracks as Taylor jumped and landed before them, shaking the ground violently upon landing, and held a web made of light which held the defeated soldiers. Blake gasped and turned around, noticing that all his friends except Ferdinand were pinned down by Claire and the guards, using either their hands or feet. -\"ONE wrong move, and all these guys die, Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You witch!\"- Ferdinand said angrily and grabbed his scythe, but Blake stopped his arm, and denied with his head, Taylor smiled -\"I'll tell you what... give yourself up, and all these soldiers will be set free and spared... Or, try to fight your way out, and we all just step on them...\"- Ferdinand growled and tried to grab his scythe again but Blake's grip on his arm grew tighter -\"ARE YOU SERIOUS?!\"- He shouted angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"OUR FRIENDS WOULD DIE TOO YOU IDIOT!\"- Blake said, and Ferdinand turned to see the other guys were indeed pinned under giantesses' feet or hands. Blake sighed in annoyance and stuck his sword in the ground. -\"Let them go\"- He said with a firm tone. Taylor nodded and Lith came to her side, she cast a small golden orb that knocked Anthony out, and he was added to the pile of unconscious soldiers, then, they started chanting a spell in a language Blake didn't know. A golden heptagram appeared in all of the soldiers' foreheads, including Anthony, and it vanished just as quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What was that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"An ancient spell that erases the victim's memories, we erased only this day's. We can't have the Royal Elites know about us and leaving just free...\"- Taylor said and she along Lith started doing hand signs for a different spell  -\"And this is a teleporting spell, we'll send them back to the last place they slept at\"- The soldiers glowed with a blinding flash and once it disappeared, they were gone. Blake noticed his friends were still pinned, and Ferdinand was still next to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What about my friends?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry, I said we'd set the SOLDIERS free... you and your band of misfits aren't true soldiers, right?\"- Taylor said with a smile, and while Ferdinand was suppressing his anger by this point, he noticed Blake was tempted to grab his sword but still was making an effort not to. -\"You will still be married to the Princess, and I'll see what we can do with the others... I read in some old book that many years ago some giants ate humans, maybe we can have a nice dinner after this battle\"- She added, and Claire looked at them, winking and licking her lips. Taylor walked towards Ferdinand and Blake and bound them with a golden ring of light each, and picked Blake up -\"In fact, scratch the part about marrying the Princess, what's to stop me from eating you right now?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe expected to see him cower in fear, but instead, Blake smiled -\"Go ahead\"- Everyone gasped, even Taylor herself, but then Joana walked out from between some trees -\"What do you think you're doing?\"- She said to Taylor, and she noticed the anger in her voice -\"I... uh... I wasn't serious...\"- Taylor frowned -\"I was trying to make this insolent bastard feel fear for once in his life!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Keep trying, whale, oh wait, you're even bigger than that\"- Blake said and laughed a bit, Taylor's grip tightened on him as she growled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, you too stop. I'm not going to let you die nor get yourself killed\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's friends were amazed to see a giantess talk like that to Blake. However he just laughed -\"I don't think ms. elephant lady here agrees\"- Taylor tightened her grip even more, but Joana slapped her across the face and took Blake in her own hand. Ferdinand was amazed by this enough hat he voluntarily put his scythe down. Joana crouched and gently placed Blake on the ground near Ferdinand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I order you to let them go, and let's stop this madness\"- She said with a firm tone none of the giantesses had ever heard her with in her life until now, the guards let Caesar, Gustave and Ayrton free, and they ran towards Blake and Ferdinand. However, Taylor and Karina denied with their heads -\"I'm sorry Joana, but I don't think we can let them go, specially the hybrid, he was way too expensive and we most likely won't find another one\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hybrid?\"- All of Blake's friends said in confusion, and they took a few seconds to realize they might be referring to Blake, he looked down and sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes... Apparently, I am the son of a man and one of those things...\"- He said the last part in an angrier tone than the rest. They all took a step back in fear out of instinct, but Ferdinand spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So that's why you kept on wearing heavy equipment...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It would have been way too obvious if I hadn't hidden my real strength all these years...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But still... damn... the son of a giantess... hey, wait! how come you look like a normal human?\"- Gustave said scratching his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can answer that\"- Lith said, taking a few steps forward -\"The offspring of a human and a giantess varies depending on gender... Females are born giant, and develop just like any of us, no real noticeable differences from pure giantess save a bit of a greater variety of skin and hair colors*. However, males are different... they are born the size of a human, and they remain that way their whole life as far as we know. They have much greater physical strength, speed, senses and magic power than a regular human. Because they could have been a threat to the throne, the King ordered their destruction years ago... and the only one who was left was my son...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's friends opened their eyes wide at the giantess' last words and their jaws dropped, then they looked at Blake, he nodded shamefully -\"I guess this is *ahem* uncomfortable...\"- Ferdinand said, but Lith smiled -\"I see that Blake managed to find good friends who were willing to risk their own lives to come save him\"- They all, even Ferdinand blushed a bit -\"We're a mercenary squad that is also made of friends, I guess we're like brothers...\"- Ayrton said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do you want Blake though?\"- Gustave asked, and Joana blushed, Lith laughed and she replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He was bought to marry the princess... with the intention of having babies so we can start repopulating before we go extinct\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...my god...\"- Ferdinand muttered -\"Now I see why Blake had been so desperate to escape...\"- Joana blushed even more while Lith laughed even more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It takes strong humans to be able to do this... and a hybrid is just about the best possible candidate... none lived long enough for us to see what kind of offspring they'd have either\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"TOO...MUCH...INFORMATION...\"- Gustave said and promptly fainted, Caesar and Ayrton fell dismayed as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>*Giants in this story prior to getting hybridized with humans were fair skinned with either blonde, light brown or red hair.

It's an order. LET THEM GO!\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry, your majesty, but your orders can't go against your parents' last will and order, which is to find you a suitable husband by the time you turned 18 and start with the repopulating attempts\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you aware that he will not even do it EVEN if you manage to marry us?\"- Joana said annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, in that case, I guess we can have him be 'educated' about it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In any case, the other guys will be healed and will remain in custody at the castle until you decide what to do with them, as long as it does not violate your parents' last will\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand finally fainted and Blake remained alone, bound, and defeated, he sighed in annoyance as well, and Karina picked him up -\"It seems you never even got to have any sort of experience with a woman from your species, right?\"- Blake just gave her an angry glare, and she laughed a bit -\"I guess that answers my question... so, I will have you be 'educated' by Claire...\"- Said giantess just smiled and her eyes seemed to have gained a little spark to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What what?! Are you crazy?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She knows what she can and what she cannot do... I'll leave you to be taught by her about certain things you need to know to get used to your new life\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My god...\"- Blake shuddered. and Karina handed him to Claire<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll be trusting your judgement, lady. But if you go beyond the limits you will also be punished\"- Karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, don't worry, there's no need for that...\"- She winked at Blake, while Joana herself was baffled at the fact her orders were invalid and that they're going to do who knows what with Blake and his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It'll be only for a full day if you behave properly after... but if you don't, Claire will need more time to teach you...\"- Karina added, and Blake gulped in fear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were taken to the castle, and Claire took Blake to her room. Even though she was a servant her room seemed fairly large in proportion, and it looked decent to live in. Karina had changed the spell that bound Blake to wrist and ankle cuffs made of light. She put him on her bed and started taking off her clothes, Blake just turned around and sat on the bed, not really wanting to know what she was up to. However Claire giggled and turned him around with her fingers so he looked at her, who was already in just her underwear, a rather simple black bra and panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Please put some clothes on\"- Blake said closing his eyes and taking a deep breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Have you forgotten why Karina left you at my care? I'm supposed to help you on being around a giantess\"- Claire said with a giggle -\"You have to learn these things so you can be a good husband for the Princess. She's fairly shy and she won't make any advances if you just don't cooperate... also, like I said, you're supposed to look\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't think looking at a woman dressed inappropriately is within my list of things I do\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire laughed and decided to take advantage of Blake having his eyes closed, she leaned forward and licked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The hell?\"- Blake opened his eyes just from sheer surprise, and immediately started wiping his face off as best as he could<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Had to start somewhere. Get used to it. The Princess looks like she'd be an affectionate wife and she might do this often to you...\"- Claire said and licked him again, this time more slowly, then she grabbed him with one hand and started licking him over and over. Blake tried to struggle but being handcuffed and gripped by Claire's hand, there wasn't much he could do other than take it. After a few minutes, she stopped and without warning, she wiped him dry on one of her breasts. She was giggling while Blake had an angry and annoyed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aww, come on, don't tell me you aren't having a little fun?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not...\"- He answered closing his eyes in anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, how about this?\"- Claire sat on the bed and put Blake on one of her thighs -\"The Princess might also have you like this fairly often\"- She moved her leg slightly, making Blake fall face first on her thigh, she laughed a bit and added \"Her thighs are also bigger and most likely softer than mine, but this should give you an idea\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake just struggled to stand up and just crossed his arms, hoping that this day would be over as soon as possible and just lie when Karina asked whatever she wanted to hear. By this point he almost preferred being with Joana, at least she wouldn't be putting him through this stuff herself. The 'ground' shook more as Claire laid on the bed and grabbed Blake, placing him on her stomach, and as she had a bit of a tummy, he sank into it while Claire giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, that actually tickles!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Give me a break!\"- Blake replied to no one in particular as he struggled to 'swim' in Claire's soft flesh with his wrists and ankles cuffed -\"This doesn't even make sense\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm... yeah, partially\"- Claire said with a thoughtful look -\"The Princess has a flatter stomach, but it's likely that when you're both sleeping or taking a nap, this is one of the two places she might put you in\"- She giggled more, which made a small earthquake for Blake and he sank even more into her tummy -\"She would get a bigger tummy if you get her pregnant though\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like that is going to happen...\"- Blake said while shuddering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It will. Or I'll have to teach you in every detail...\"- She gave Blake a look  that seemed more predatory than seductive, and he stopped in genuine fear -\"I'm not going to do that this time, so, you better try to get used to your future wife and give her babies!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I seriously wonder what's even the limit Karina drew to Claire's behavior...' Blake thought while he didn't even notice he fell into Claire's navel, even she gasped. He heard her stomach gurgling a bit 'I really hope that doesn't mean she's hungry...' -\"Whoah, that's a new one\"- Claire sat up, surrounding Blake completely with her tummy once again -\"Carrying your husband in your navel... sounds fun, I must totally tell this to the Princess\"- Then she noticed Blake seemed to be tickling it and wondered what he could possibly mean, until she felt a stronger punch and yelped, she fished him out of there with 2 fingers and had a slightly angry look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you think you're doing?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You *gasp* were *gasp* FREAKING SMOTHERING ME!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh...\"- Claire then realized he was inside her belly button while she had sat up, and given she had a tummy, Blake was completely surrounded by her and had little to no air -\"Alright, sorry about that one, my bad...\"- Blake was completely baffled by hearing Claire say 'sorry' and added -\"Believe me or not, I'm not trying to hurt you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By this point I wish you were trying that instead of what you're doing\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How did you even do with human women?\"- Claire asked this time, herself now being the baffled one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"THAT'S THE POINT! I DIDN'T!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh... so... you're really a virgin...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake facepalmed himself hard enough that Claire heard, but she just laughed more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We all are, but at least our moms taught us stuff... so... you really have no idea...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's the point, we get it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's just perfect for the Princess. But you need to cooperate!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"All of this stuff is scary enough as it is, and you have no idea how much worse it is when beings big enough to swallow you whole are the ones doing it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And that's the point of this... you have to stop fearing our bodies just because of our size, you're  a hybrid, you can take it... at least your friends can be genuinely afraid because they're ordinary...\"- Claire said and held him close to her chest to drive her point, and she mumbled -\"Although then again, the Princess is a bit heavy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And you still expect me to go along with this?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're the best possible candidate for that, as a hybrid, I doubt even her weight would harm you, which reminds me...\"- Claire put Blake next to her hips and then raised them above him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HOLY...\"- Blake shouted but didn't get to finish the phrase as Claire's large butt descended on him, he started trying to break free, which only tickled her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe the Princess will ask you on occasion to sit on your lap, and you must absolutely say yes and behave... unlike you're doing right now\"- She heard very muffled screams but she kept on sitting -\"She's shy and sensitive, if you do this to her you'll make her cry and she will probably stop eating for a long while...\"- Claire wiggled her hips on the bed as an attempt to force him to be quiet, but he kept struggling, and Claire gasped when she noticed he was lifting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I seriously doubt Joana would do this\"- Blake said, while still lifting Claire at a bit less than half his arms' length above him, because over half his arms' length was sunk into Claire's literally gigantic butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And you were saying you couldn't handle this\"- Claire said a bit satisfied</span></div></div>",

If you sit on them you'll kill them!\"- Blake said and Claire smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Can you pay the price?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Full obedience from now on, for the rest of our day together...\"- Claire said adding a more sensual tone to her voice, Blake wasn't liking where this was going and hesitated -\"I will allow you to ask questions, hopefully I can explain stuff to you, but you better do everything right when you're left alone with the Princess...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What guarantees you'll go through with your part of this deal?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My honor as a royal servant\"- Claire said offering him her other hand's pinky to shake as if it were a hand, Blake took a deep breath, thought about it for a few seconds and shook it -\"I assume you will put your honor as a warrior on the line\"- Blake nodded, although silently, as he was starting to make an effort to endure whatever Claire had in store for him, she placed him on the bed and turned around -\"Deal. Your friends won't be squashed under my butt... as long as they behave...\"- She looked down from her shoulder -\"Even if it's not really that big\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you sat down in a human village you would leave at least 2 families homeless...\"- Blake said with a half smile hidden by his hood's shadow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!\"- Claire tried to sound mad but couldn't help but laugh -\"Even if it poked a bit of fun at me, I like your sense of humor\"- Claire said and sat down next to Blake, this time he jumped before she sat to avoid bouncing out of the bed, she gave him a sweeter look -\"So you're not entirely bitter\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That depends on your interpretation...\"- Blake said, looking down in a more serious attitude -\"Wait a minute!\"- He said after a moment of thoughtfulness -\"What's with that 'as long as they behave' part?\"- Claire smiled again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The deal you just made guarantees that I will not sit on your friends, as long as they don't do anything to provoke my anger and thus, a punishment\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I should have known there was a catch\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's something more you can do for them though\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it?\"- Blake asked annoyed, and even if she had already gotten around with wording, he still hoped to trust on her promise and was willing to make another deal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can take your friends' punishment in advance...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That sounds like utter nonsense...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not really\"- Claire said, standing up -\"Your friends already went to quite the lengths to help you, even disregarding their own safety, ditching their chance to escape to go and fight at your side and get you out of here...\"- Claire took two steps sideways so that she stood before Blake, with her large butt once again towering from above -\"If they misbehave, I might show them what I would do to them... but not actually do it, and tell them instead that you paid for their punishment in advance...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What kind of punishment?\"- Blake asked, and, without turning around, Claire grabbed him with one hand and held him above the back her black panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, it seems that unlike you, the problem with your friends would be kinda the opposite, I believe they might try to get fresh with me once they think nobody else is watching\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... do I have to remind you you're like one freaking hundred times bigger than any of us? I doubt they'd try anything besides running away in fear... specially if you keep on threatening them with your butt...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sometimes people can be more stubborn than it's good for them\"- Claire said and pulled her waistband open -\"At least one of your friends looks like he might anger me, and I could just drop him and let him spend a good while in there... I would also crush him a bit just to teach him a lesson\"- Claire said and clenched her butt briefly to make her point -\"You don't really have to...\"- Claire said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll do it if you truly spare them from it\"- Blake said, and Claire gasped a bit, surprised to see this kind of display of courage, specially because she thought she was intimidating him quite a lot already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know, it's actually kind of painful and you haven't even...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Promise that it'll truly pay for them in advance and I'll do it\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was further amazed now, she could still call it off and go on, but she felt a slightly new respect for him, he was willing to take the pain others could even deserve, just because he wasn't sure they could really take it themselves -\"It's a deal\"- She said, although she failed to sound as sensual as earlier, and dropped Blake in the back of her panties and let them snap back into place, he found himself trapped in darkness, with the black fabric behind him, and 2 warm and soft walls at his sides, which shook wildly for a moment -\"Are you sure you want to do this?\"- Claire sounded a bit worried this time, and realized she wouldn't hear him if he answered, so she added -\"Touch once for yes, twice for no...\"- Blake just touched one of the walls lightly once with one of his hands, and it quivered for a bit -\"Uh... alright... let me know when you want to get out...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire took a few steps, still feeling unsure about this, even if it was her own idea. She was originally just meaning to mess with him and maybe tease him a bit with her body, but he took it the literal way and was willing to take punishment he didn't even deserve for his friends. Feeling Blake tucked in her backside tickled her a bit, and she giggled. Given she had little to do in the mean time, she put some clothes on and went out of her room to go clean something or put stuff away, just as she walked by one of the castle's halls, she encountered Karina, who was a bit surprised to see her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I would have thought you'd be eager to teach that little punk a few good lessons\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, he's actually learning pretty fast\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where is he?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire giggled -\"I'll just tell you, he's in a safe place...\"- She walked away, swaying her hips slightly more than usual with each step, enough to tip Karina off, she brought a hand over her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh my...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire heard Karina's reaction and just giggled, she headed for the kitchen to drink some water and to wash some dishes. She did a few dishes and realized at least 20 minutes must have passed, and given she was alone, she spoke to Blake, although softly so as not to be heard by others -\"You still there?\"- She shuddered upon getting tickled once, which meant 'yes' according to the system she used earlier. She did some more dishes and asked again -\"Are you alright?\"- And she felt him touch one of her cheeks yet again. She sighed and continued to finish the dishes left, this took a while (at least 2 hours), and she also walked a bit back and forth, she sat on a chair to rest and stood up with a gasp as she remembered Blake was still there, she asked once again if he was ok and she also asked about sitting on the chair, which one again Blake replied with a yes. She rested on it for about half an hour and headed back to her room. While walking, she remembered hearing how Karina always seemed to be speaking ill of the small human guy she held currently prisoner between her large cheeks, most of the time referring to him as a sort of criminal or just a plain bad guy. She realized that he was more like an untamed beast, wild, yes, but also noble in his own way, and felt again guilty for this idea of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire walked to her bed and fished Blake out of her panties -\"Alright, I think that's way more than enough...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is it enough to cover for my friends in case they screw up?\"- Blake said a bit weakly, Claire opened her eyes wide<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Y-yeah...\"- She stuttered -\"About 3 hours... my god...\"- She looked at Blake, something looked a bit off about him, and noticed he had some trouble standing up -\"What's wrong?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm just a little dizzy, it happens when I've been deprived of air for a while, like one time i fought some guys underwater for longer than I should have, or when the Sand Bandits brought me here in a diamond cage-thing\"- Blake replied, sitting down on her bed.</span></div></div>",

I... I had estimated I'd put your friends in there for 2 or 3 minutes at most, and I thought you'd be asking to get out by around the same time... I swear I won't do this to them, Blake\"- She said with a hint of guilt, but Blake merely smiled and laid back, taking deep breaths he truly needed 'This guy... is amazing, and not just for being a hybrid' She thought, and sat next to him -\"I'll let you rest for a while, but before that, we should get a nice bath, I bet you really need it right now\"- She laughed, Blake just nodded weakly, and she walked into her personal bathroom inside her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure you're a servant?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A royal servant, but yeah\"- Claire added, and turned a faucet to start filling a bathtub that looked more like a small pool with water<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've only seen that kind of technology in some noble houses. Peasants like me have to bathe in rivers or lakes\"- Blake laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're the future king, remember?\"- Claire replied, and then Blake stopped in his thoughts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WAIT A FREAKING MINUTE!!\"- he shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's wrong?\"- she asked genuinely worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I just realized you have taken me to your bathroom...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, so?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you seriously going to bathe with me?\"- Blake asked with a twitch in one of his eyes, Claire laughed heartily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, that, don't worry, I'll bathe with my underwear on, it needs a washing after this anyway\"- She replied and Blake gulped and just nodded and remained silent -\"You were right to ask though. The Princess will do this with you at some point, although given she's shy, it might take a while\"- Claire added and then brought Blake closer to her mouth and whispered -\"But that time will be without clothes\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What about mine?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll wash them as well. You're allowed to bathe with your underwear too\"- Claire giggled and took Blake's black hooded cape off and put it away in a shelf, she saw that Blake had messy wavy black hair and giggled -\"Why do you hide your face like tha-Oh...\"- She said and stopped as she observed the scar that ran down Blake's left eye, he looked away -\"It doesn't really look bad\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I still prefer to just hide my face\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sure the future Queen will want to see her husband's face way more often...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess\"- Blake sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, don't be like that, as shy as she is, and even if she's a bit heavier than most, she's really nice and gentle... and she kinda cares about you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Blake was briefly snapped out of his pessimistic mood<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, she was watching whenever you were unconscious and healing, and also tried to get Karina to release you or to nullify the marriage in various manners, she even went through reading the law trying to find a way, but she couldn't find any\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did she really do all that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nodded, and Blake just felt guilty himself, remembering the times he threatened her or took her rage out on her, believing her to be the enemy behind his misery, and in reality she was a nice girl who was trying to help him, and her only 'defect' was that she was born a giant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sure she'll be a nice wife. She'll probably treat you well, and maybe even spoil you\"- Claire giggled, and Blake laughed a bit as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Doesn't seem like the way to treat a mere stray dog...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're far more than that. Don't you see you're amazing? You're the single hybrid of a giantess and a man that was left alive, you wandered around the world and managed to make good friends that are willing to go until the end with you, and... you could have just found a woman that loves you, and you have a chance to help a species out of extinction...\"- Blake raised an eyebrow and Claire stuttered for a moment -\"Scratch the last one, but the others are still perfectly valid. Anyway, by what I've heard, you've led a mercenary squad that only does good things like defeating criminals, and you've gone through the world with your friends, we don't even leave this village much... I can't even begin to imagine the things you've seen...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks...\"- Blake replied, although he admitted to himself he also witnessed terrible things happen, and sad ones, but he got Claire's point -\"Still... I don't feel like a forced marriage was my way to go...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fate can be weird at times... would you have met the Princess under any other circumstance? No...\"- She said, comforting him -\"My mother used to say God can sometimes make things that look initially bad turn out good...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nice... although why do you say 'used'?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She passed away... most purebred giantesses died to an unknown disease like 10 years ago...\"- Claire said with sadness while almost absent mindedly taking Blake's shirt off and putting it on top of his hooded cape -\"I think the only pure ones that survived are the Princess, Karina and a few others scattered around the village... oh, and also Lady Lith...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know her?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well yeah... she's kind of lonely... but she's the daughter of the last Sage of Light and...oh my!\"- Claire said, and then brought Blake closer to her eye -\"Is that a blue mole on your shoulder?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So you're her son?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nodded although he felt a bit nervous about Claire's sudden change of mood -\"That means... you're the next Sage of Light... oh my god, I thought the power had been lost forever... Also, that's quite a lot of scars you've got there\"- She added, looking at Blake's torso, indeed, he had a lot of scars in several parts of his body, mostly the torso and neck, and surprisingly near none in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've fought from petty criminals to major threats, and wild beasts in between...\"- Blake added -\"What a mercenary has to do for some money to buy bread... Anyway, you mean most of the current giantesses are hybrids with humans?\"- Claire smiled, and a small thread made of water came from her bathtub and spun around her hand, and it became a giant snowflake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Water magic... wait, so you have dual magic!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nodded -\"Light is still a bit more powerful, and that's the standard one used for our formal training. but water magic has quite the practical uses, like keeping stuff very cold\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Any food kept at very low temperatures takes very very long to spoil, meat, vegetables, you name it\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Awesome...\"- Blake said, genuinely impressed, not noticing Claire walked to the bathtub with him still on her palm -\"Hey, what the hell?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bathtub is ready\"- Claire sat in the tub and relaxed, she placed Blake on one of her breasts -\"And this is one of the things the Princess will do with you some at some point later...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I doubt she'd put me in her body like you have been all this time\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're misunderstanding, I have kinda misused all of these things for teasing and a bit of mischief, but many of these are actual affection displays giantesses did with their human husbands. The Princess most likely would do them herself if she's sure she's not scaring you... and you really shouldn't be scared of her, even if her bust is quite bigger than mine, she's far less likely to harm you in any way\"- She jiggled her chest a bit just to make Blake trip and grab onto her breast -\"Hers must be softer too\"- She laughed, and Blake slid down carefully to the water, although he was still in front of Claire's rather impressive chest. He decided to just turn around and wash himself with the water, he also swam and dived a little just for the fun of it despite being wrist and handcuffed still, and Claire watched amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not a water elemental but still like a good dive or swim\"- Blake said -\"By the way, how can you even see the blue mole on my shoulder or my scars?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Karina told you, we have much sharper senses than those of humans, yours should be about on par, but I can't really test it, everything on me is already magnified for you\"- Claire laughed, she took a bar of soap and broke a tiny portion off with her nail and handed it to Blake -\"Here, wet it and use its foam to wash yourself, it cleans more than water alone\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh, so this is like tree resin\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought only I had discovered it. I use the resin of certain trees with water to bathe myself, i also taught my friends how to make it, and anyone who asked while on villages...\"- Blake started making foam with the piece of soap -\"It smells like perfume, even better than the resin I used\"- Blake laughed -\"That just had a somewhat natural clean scent, like a forest in a good day, but this is better\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, we use various blends of flower oils to mix with them\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mischievous giantess and the hybrid warrior continued talking about several things while bathing, and eventually they finished and washed their clothes, Blake used a weak light beam to quickly dry his own as well as Claire's and her underwear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah, I didn't know light could be used much outside combat\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I sometimes use it to light fire or even to cook stuff if there's no fuel available. I have also used it to cauterize wounds on some people if for some reason I can't use healing magic...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well Blake, we're nice and dry, we're going to get some sleep, we still have a full day ahead, just wait here while I go for a cup of water\"- She left him on her bed and after putting some clothes again, walked out of her room...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire found Joana when she arrived to the kitchen, they greeted each other and after she grabbed some cool water from a shelf with ice magic, Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... how is he doing? I heard you were punishing him a bit harshly...\"- She said blushing a bit and looking down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's fine, your Majesty. Actually, I think I found how to make him peaceful...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So far, we've been trying with tame him like a slave... I doubt that'll ever work, but love and understanding have done a lot in just a few hours than days of harsh treatment. Princess, I have seen the way you've treated him, and I trust you will be a good wife. Treat him with love, and he'll open up to you...\"- Claire said and went back to her room, leaving a thoughtful and blushing Joana mulling her words over in her mind. Claire once again took her clothes off after arriving to her room, but noticed Blake had still the same clothes as always<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you have any other clothes?'-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope, I sleep with this as well... At least I make sure to wash them every day\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire laughed, and grabbed Blake before laying on her stomach on the bed, and placed him on her shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where do you normally sleep?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"On top of some tree's branch, with my cat Tabitha...\"- Blake then seemed to trial off in his thoughts -\"GODDAMNIT! TABITHA!\"- He tried to jump but he tripped due to his ankles being cuffed, and Claire giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Relax. She was a bit wounded but they're treating her fine. Your friends told Karina that she was yours and she made sure she started getting healed asap\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh, I was sure she hated my guts\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire laughed again -\"Kinda, she's a bit authoritative and you kept on defying her, she grew to disdain you and also disliked the fact you cost quite a lot... But that might have changed... She heard when you talked to that Royal Elite about the value of life right after preventing him from attempting to kill her, she was really off guard at the time and if you hadn't intervened she might have been killed even if Taylor shot him afterwards... You saved her life...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I doubt she'd say thanks anytime soon\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She sent you to me rather than Taylor though\"- Claire replied -\"She would have lost her patience in no time and at least tried to crush you under her foot\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If I can lift you up, I don't think I should fear Taylor...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you calling me fat?\"- Claire asked with fake anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course not... anyway I guessed you all weighed about the same...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire giggled -\"Not really, just like with humans, our size and complexion vary. Lady Lith is kinda light, Taylor is like average... I... might be a bit heavier than average... and well, there's the Princess who has a really voluptuous figure and obviously weighs even more...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know, human women would die before talking openly about their weight, as far as I've heard\"- Blake laughed this time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We don't really have a problem with it... and if the ground shakes every time you take a step anything after becomes kind of pointless\"- Claire answered with a laugh -\"And like you might have seen, more weight doesn't necessarily mean ugly... The Princess is considered one of the most beautiful among us\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't really pay attention to further details beyond the ground shaking...\"- Blake replied blushing a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Come on, really? Males are supposed to have a sort of built in way to measure beauty, and the only honest difference between us is size...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You say that as if it weren't such a big deal... giant things tend to be rather terrifying when you are the small one in comparison\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you've already had some close encounters with some of the largest parts of a female body\"- Claire replied with sort of a half-seductive half-joking tone, and Blake remained silent, looking down in embarrassment -\"So... even that  was scary?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When you consider you can be crushed rather easily, yeah... Although you seemed worried, and later you behaved friendlier so, it wasn't as much as I had thought\"- Blake answered, and Claire looked at him curiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey... one more question... Is my butt really as big as 2 human houses?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had a baffled look and his jaw dropped slightly -\"Erm... do you want a honest answer?\"- Claire nodded -\"Yes... if not a bit more...\"- He gulped, and before he could react, Claire flicked him with her index finger, she didn't hit him really hard, but she still sent him flying for a bit until he landed on one of her butt cheeks and bounced on it while she giggled -\"Then I guess there's more than enough room for you to sleep at night\"- Blake gave her a baffled look and Claire just leaned slightly to the right, tripping Blake and making him roll down between her cheeks, but still on top of the panties -\"I don't think even the richest princes get to sleep between two pillows this big and nice\"- She added and wiggled her huge rear, bouncing Blake a bit on both 'pillows'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you serious?\"- Blake asked, and Claire lightly clenched her butt in response, enveloping in her soft flesh 'I hate sucking at lying' He thought, and assumed he was going to spend the night just like this, but Claire released her clench and he heard her giggle more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You really believed you were going to sleep in there?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't know, to be honest... I guessed that yeah, I was...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you said that my cheeks were each bigger than the buildings your species lives in, I thought there had to be plenty of space for a single human to stay in\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Doesn't mean said human wants to sleep there though\"- Blake said and Claire gently clenched her butt once again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So you want to stay during daytime? Sounds fine by me, I can walk around the whole day tomorrow with you resting nicely between these two pillows...\"- Claire laughed -\"In any case, you're quite close to the two largest parts of my body\"- Claire said between giggles and released her clench -\"Still terrifying?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Only if you make me stay the night\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you behave nicely maybe I will. Remember I can tell Karina I need more time to teach you, and I could have you sleep in there until you stop thinking they're big or scary, or both...\"- Claire said laughing but winked at him, she fished him out of her butt and laid on the bed, this time on her back and placed him between her breasts -\"Jokes aside, this is were pretty much all giantesses' human husbands slept in, it's supposed to be affectionate and make you feel safe, and the heartbeat is a natural lullaby. I'm completely sure the Princess will ask you to sleep with her like this\"- Blake just blushed a lot and stayed silent, although he could indeed hear Claire's heartbeat, it was much more powerful than a human but it was not an annoying noise, it was just as peaceful as a human's heartbeat and even if it was a bit louder, it had a soothing effect along her own warmth and her smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What I said about the pillows is true in this case...\"- Claire added with a more soothing voice herself -\"Any comments?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you know you have a diamond shaped mole deep in your cleavage?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire blushed this time and just replied -\"Alright, official bed time\"- She cast a few water drops from her fingers to put out the candles that illuminated her room and drifted off to sleep, Blake following shortly after, lulled by her heartbeat, and for the first time in years, he slept without nightmares. instead, he dreamed of a distant memory... the days he was a baby, and his mother had him sleep that way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext day, roughly 8 AM, a rooster crowed, and Claire woke up, she was a bit surprised Blake was still sleeping peacefully, she had read some reports Karina and other servants at the castle wrote, which described his sleep as erratic, and displaying obvious signs of nightmares. She smiled, knowing already that the cure for most of it was just a good dose of love, although she felt like a sudden cold breeze caressed her heart upon reminding herself that he belonged to the Princess after all, but still felt glad knowing Blake would have a beautiful loving wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Morning sleepyhead\"- She said gently and caressed his hair with a finger, he mumbled something and just turned to the other side, she giggled -\"It seems you're liking this way too much\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, but not for the reasons you probably think\"- Blake said and yawned -\"I don't know what kind of witchcraft is this, but I have slept well for the first time since I can remember...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That 'witchcraft' is just a little thing called love, and you're going to get lots of it from the Princess if you don't screw up and make her shy away...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I still, have no idea why I suddenly accepted this...\"- Blake said, remembering his stance on this just a few days ago<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because you gave yourself up for those soldiers...\"- Claire reminded him -\"You know, if you were really the scum you say you are, you would've let anyone die as long as you could escape...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, let's get some nice breakfast before starting with our day\"- Claire added and then noticed the light handcuffs which still restrained Blake -\"If I release you, do you promise me on your honor that you will not run away?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...I guess so...\"- Blake sighed, not really interested in escaping anymore given his friends were still captive </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire got dressed and headed for her bathroom just to wash her face, and gave Blake a small (to her) water drop to do the same, then she dispelled the hand cuffs on his wrists and ankles and had him jump in her cleavage once again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"These will have to do with your restraining for the day... If you misbehave, you know where I'll put you\"- She joked, however she pushed him a bit deeper so nobody could see he was actually unrestrained, then she got dressed and walked out of her room and headed for the kitchen, Joana was already picking her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is the first time I see a noble in the kitchen...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She likes to cook sometimes, and even if not, she never forces anyone to get her food lightning fast\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good morning Claire\"- Joana greeted her and Claire whispered 'Hold on'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good morning, your Majesty\"- Claire bowed briefly, and Joana noticed the little passenger in her cleavage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's better... I was afraid you'd continue with that punishment from last night\"- Joana commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It wasn't really that bad\"- Claire replied patting her butt slightly -\"It was about the same as this save the view, but then again he had a different nice view...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana couldn't help but laugh, seeing that he wasn't hurt -\"So, do you think you'll be done by tomorrow?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, maybe, but the again, he could misbehave during the day... and if that happens he might just get to stay in a place he won't like much\"- Claire said jokingly, Joana then leaned a bit closer to Blake and whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm really sorry you had to end up like this...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, I know... she told me  you even went out of your way to check for some way around the law... Thanks for the effort\"- Blake replied, and Joana blushed, Claire gave her a reassuring look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told him, yes, but he took i rather well\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm glad you didn't get any angrier, and again, I'm sorry I failed to help you though...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's alright\"- Blake added, and then Joana stood up from her chair <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, do you think it's fine if I make something for him?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're free to do pretty much anything you want as long as he remains in my custody for the day, your majesty\"- Claire answered, and Joana smiled, she grabbed milk from one of their freezing shelves, a silver cup, and then grabbed a bag of brown powder from a normal shelf. she poured the milk on the cup, and the some of the powder on the milk, then stirred it with a spoon, and came back to the table, gesturing Claire to set him on it, and she gulped, she leaned very close to her ear and whispered, Joana giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's alright, if anything I ordered his cuffs to be dispelled\"- She added, and Claire set Blake gently on the table, he scratched his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No offense, but that cup is like a small building to me...\"- He said, and Claire just generated a small drop of water which she shaped into a cup made of ice, small enough for a human although still a bit big, Blake estimated it would contain about 1/3 of a gallon, but it was close enough, Joana offered her hand and he climbed on her palm, she held him above the cup, really close to the cold drink, and Blake scooped some with his cup, completely filling it. He looked back at Joana, who smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Go ahead\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks\"- Blake then drank a bit of this new beverage, and his eyes seemed to have gained a little spark to them for a moment -\"This is freaking delicious...\"- He drank the rest rather quickly, but still enjoyed the taste -\"What is this thing? All I know is that it was made with milk...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Chocolate\"- Joana said with a smile -\"It's a powder we make with a fruit that only grows in or around our village...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should have called it ambrosia or something along those lines, this tasted like the stuff the gods drink\"- Blake said, and both Joana and Claire laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess you'll find it ironic that we kinda consider it a childish drink... but personally I don't care, it's good for the stomach and I don't really like wine anyway\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thank you very much\"- Blake bowed down respectfully, and then wondered what to do with his ice cup<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can throw it into the rest of the drink. I didn't add any ice cubes to it anyway\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought you would deem this as dirty...\"- Blake said a bit confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, you silly...\"- Claire said, and whispered to Blake -\"This will be nothing compared to when she decides to give you a kiss\"- Joana blushed intensely and looked away in embarrassment, while laughing a bit nervously. Blake also blushed as well and just dropped the ice cup on the chocolate drink -\"It was a joke, your majesty\"- Claire said a bit nervous herself, seeing the princess was a lot more flustered than she expected, but she looked back at them <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"W-well, you're actually right...\"-Joana said struggling a bit with her wording, this time Blake's eyes opened wide and his jaw dropped -\"At least, it will be required in the actual ceremony...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I-It's f-fine, no need to rush...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know, you'll be left in her custody after I'm done with you, might as well try and practice\"- Claire added and both Joana and Blake blushed madly again, she laughed for a short while -\"Don't worry, my future Queen, I can almost guarantee you that your future husband here will be better suited for you once I'm done with him\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire respectfully said goodbye to Joana and after putting Blake in her cleavage again, headed to other parts of the castle, she encountered Karina, who raised an eyebrow when noticing Blake's current location -\"Quite a change from yesterday\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, he has been behaving fine so far\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina, who is normally serious all the time unless around friends and when not in active work, laughed a bit -\"I guess not even someone as stubborn as him would want a second time in that place...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, come on, it's not as bad as it looks, right?\"- She said, patting her butt once again and glancing down at Blake, he merely burrowed deeper into her cleavage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems that it was\"- Karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"OR he's just provoking me to put him in there a second time\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you do, just make sure you don't suffocate him. I can't really imagine how he even survived the first time... It's pretty big... He could've gotten lost in there... You're lucky he's a hybrid...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry, whether in the front or in the back, he'll be warm and safe between 2 nice pillows, which ones is up to him\"- Claire replied and both laughed, and even Blake took it calmly knowing it was a joke, but remained hidden deeper into her cleavage. Karina started walking away, heading back to attend several tasks within the castle, but as she walked she added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In case he ends up in the back, at least be mindful of what you eat... we can't risk having him get poisoned so near the wedding date\"- Claire blushed a bit and felt Blake suddenly shivering inside her cleavage, and once Karina left, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not even I am that evil... I wouldn't do such a thing to you... unless you wanted...\"- She felt Blake shuddering again and she laughed -\"Just kidding, let's go, we have stuff to do\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire did several minor errands along the day, and helped with the daily cleaning of some of the castle rooms, it was just another ordinary day in their normally peaceful village, with the exception of her tiny prisoner. After several hours of performing tasks, she jiggled her chest slightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, aren't you going to misbehave today? Feel like doing something mischievous or something?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know where you want to get with that\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd argue that it's also where you'd like to end up\"- Both of them laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not really, but from what I have heard from my friends, some of them would like to themselves\"- Blake replied laughing a bit more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's too bad you took their punishments for them, I would've liked to shake them up a little with my house-sized special pillows\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't expect you'd take my joking description so seriously\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's kinda fun... wait  a minute, that means you purposely exaggerated?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The opposite...\"- Blake said just barely suppressing his laughter, and Claire faked pouting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I should give you a fourth view to refresh your memory\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So you even keep a record...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Strike two...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, alright, I'll behave...\"- Blake said and burrowed back into her cleavage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Awww...\"- Claire resumed walking around doing errands and other tasks while chatting with Blake on occasion, they saw Joana  few times throughout the day but the encounters were rather short since she was having some basic combat and culture classes throughout the day. -\"Hey, aren't you really bored from staying in there all day?\"- She asked while looking down at her cleavage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope. I have a decent view of the world around, and it's fairly safe as far as I know...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you're literally a few wrong sentences away from changing to the other set of pillows, and your view would be just as nice\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're kinda trying hard to get me trapped\"- Blake said raising an eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I admit I kinda liked it when you were there, and every time I asked you a question you had to tickle me a bit to answer... Also, we didn't get to test my research to see if we could get to make a walking dwelling suited for humans\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even if we managed to build anything resembling that, the moment you took a step you'd crush the whole thing, inhabitants included\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Unless a little someone volunteered to perform the safety tests, as many times as needed\"- Both of them laughed again, and she continued to walk around the castle until about sunset time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire finally entered her room and looked down at her cleavage again, closing the door behind her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... do you think you're ready for the Princess after today?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't think I can ever be ready... she's nice, but her size still gives me some chills...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guarantee she'll be way more careful with you than I'll probably ever be\"- Claire said in a soothing tone -\"You'll have a few days to spend with her, you should let her try and get some practice with you\"- Blake merely nodded in response -\"Come on! Cheer up! I know this wasn't really what you wanted, but try to see the good in it... you're going to be a king, and even though the size difference might bother you, you're still getting a loving beautiful wife...\"- She noticed Blake seemed to just be gazing into the horizon and smiled mischievously, she grabbed him with 2 fingers and laid on her stomach on her bed and dropped him between her butt cheeks once again, he immediately snapped out of it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the...?! WHAT THE HELL!\"- She heard him shout and giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were so pessimistic and lost in your thoughts I thought my special pillows would cheer you up\"- She answered and gently clenched her butt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But I did not misbeh-MPHFGHMPHFGH!\"- Blake didn't get to finish speaking before he was enveloped in Claire's soft flesh yet again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who said I'm doing this as a punishment?\"- Claire said and wiggled her hips, shaking Blake's entire current world as well, however, as he was unrestrained this time, he tried to push Claire's enormous cheeks apart, although his arms were sinking into these soft 'walls', he heard Claire moan a little, and blushed a lot, losing his concentration and her cheeks slammed back into each other and surrounded him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was... nice...\"- Claire said while blushing a lot -\"I could use a little massage from the inside\"- She added between giggles and wiggled her hips a bit -\"It's not an order though\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake himself was surprised when he heard the last part, Claire obviously had him completely trapped in her particularly large butt and she could have just ordered him to do so given the deal they made the previous day, and even if he refused to obey, she could have clenched harder to force him, or even force him to stay longer with her by telling Karina she needed more time. Blake concluded that even if she was a little too playful and relying on the fact he was a hybrid, she wasn't really evil. He also remembered she seemed to be aware that his human friends were significantly less durable than himself, he blushed intensely but decided to go ahead and do what she said, when he started massaging the walls surrounding him, they shook for a few seconds and heard Claire moan again although it was really muffled, and as he kept on with this massage, his surrounding walls kept shaking while Claire seemed to enjoy it thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter roughly 30 minutes, he decided to take a break, temporarily forgetting what those soft walls that surrounded him actually were as he let them envelop him, but soon snapped out of it when he heard Claire giggling, he got back to massaging but he heard her speak -\"It's alright Blake. Massaging these big pillows must be quite an effort, you earned yourself a good rest, enjoy\"- She winked although there was no way he could see her face, and just gently clenched her large butt to prevent Blake from moving around for a while. She grabbed a book from her nightstand and began to read while humming near silently to herself. Meanwhile Blake eventually fell asleep given he was warm and in near total darkness, and the massaging tired him a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 more minutes passed and Claire put her book away and wiggled her butt -\"Nice sleep you had in there, didn't you?\"- She said despite she knew she wouldn't hear his answer -\"I remember someone said that it'd be terrifying to sleep in there last night\"- She released her clench and fished him out of her butt and placed him on her actual pillow -\"So?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, it was not as bad as I thought...\"- Blake said a bit annoyed although he faintly blushed -\"Why there though\"- Claire smiled and grabbed him again and placed him on one of her cheeks, he sank a little in it and she giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's big...\"- Claire then pushed him a little deeper against her skin with a finger -\"...It's pretty soft...\"- She let go of her finger and Blake bounced a little -\"And it's the largest area of my body, not sure why, but I like feeling you there\"- She finished her answer with a smile and Blake couldn't really get mad at her even if he tried, on the other hand, her butt was really soft, and he wasn't under threats under getting crushed by it. He closed his eyes for a moment -\"AHA! I knew it! It's soft enough for you to fall asleep on!\"- Blake stood up with a jump and denied with his head, but she just laughed and picked him up before sitting up, and she placed him on one of her thighs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, after we take a bath we're going to sleep and I'm to give you to the princess tomorrow when we wake up... Do you think you're ready?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I got the basic idea of not running away regardless of my self-preservation instinct\"- Blake answered flatly, and Claire suddenly grabbed him and laid on her stomach, placing him on her butt yet again, she shook it a little, making Blake fall face first on the back of her panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your self-preservation instinct had told you THESE would crush you, and yet you've spent some time in there and even took a nice nap...\"- Claire said happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You just love using your big butt to drive your point, don't you?\"- Blake said standing up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If a male human is involved, yes\"- Claire replied and shook it once again so Blake also fell again, before he got up, she clenched her butt and stood up and headed for the bathroom -\"It also makes for a nice way to transport your species\"- She said -\"Also, even if for only a moment, my butt was your whole world\"- Claire added, and Blake realized that she was kinda right, and just to remind him of it, she shook her hips, bouncing Blake on both cheeks for a short while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again they bathed partially clothed and shared some more jokes, but also Claire kept reassuring him not to be fearful of Joana. After they were done and went back to the bed, Claire had placed Blake on her shoulder and she laid on her stomach on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... where am I going to sleep?\"- Blake wondered, and Claire glanced behind herself and smiled -\"Oh god not again...\"- Claire gave him puppy eyes <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You actually enjoyed it yourself, and, well, it's our last night together... You'll be the Princess' after this...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't believe you can make me feel bad while I'm the actual victim...\"- Blake grumbled annoyed as he walked down Claire's back and laid on one of her cheeks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorry\"- She said laughing a bit but it sounded sincere -\"It's just that, I doubt I'll ever get to marry, and even if I did it would be a normal humans, so, since you're the only hybrid there is now, it's very likely I won't get to play like this ever again. I know that if I did this to a purebred human he'd get crushed, or suffocated, or both...\"- She sighed in sadness, and Blake nodded, he closed his eyes for a moment, but something didn't feel right and when he opened them and turned around, Claire was still staring at him -\"I still hadn't believed you when you said my cheeks were as big as human houses, but now I'm convinced\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed and leaned towards her right so Blake rolled in between -\"Why have only one pillow when you can sleep with 2?\"- Blake merely sighed annoyed and just did his best to get comfortable, she noticed he wasn't attempting to escape so she put out the candles using small drops of water and whispered -\"Good night... my king...\"- She suppressed more giggling as she felt Blake moving a bit to get comfortable, and mentally said 'awww' before closing her eyes and drifting off to sleep as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext day, 8:00 AM...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire woke again thanks to a rooster and stretched a bit, then she groggily stood up and started putting her clothes on and went to her bathroom to wash her face, then walked out of her room and headed for the kitchen, this time, some other servants were cooking breakfast while Joana waited patiently at the table<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good Morning Claire\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good Morning your Majesty\"- Claire bowed a bit and Joana invited her to sit in front of her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... are you done with Blake?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... you think he's 'ready' as Karina said or will it take longer?\"- Joana said the 'ready' bit a little unconvinced as she wasn't really sure what was the big idea with this plan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nah, he's ready to spend some time alone with your majesty\"- Claire said with a slight smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... where is he?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question hit Claire like a ton of bricks, she did a minor clench to make sure, and felt Blake was still there, she opened her eyes a little wider and felt as if the blood was starting to leave her head, but she tried to play it cool -\"I'm sorry, Princess, I forgot about him and left him in my room, I'll be right back\"- She then walked until she estimated she was out of Joana's sight and ran back to her room, locked the door just in case and took off her skirt and fished him out of her butt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake what the hell? Why didn't you tell me you were still there?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... what?\"- Blake yawned and stretched a bit as well, rubbing his eyes, this time Claire had a baffled look -\"What?! I was just sleeping nicely and...uh...\"- Blake stopped as he noticed Claire was smiling -\"...damnit...\"-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-\"Sleeping nicely huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up, I'm sleepy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had an annoyed look and stood on her palm while Claire was just smiling, she patted her butt with her other hand -\"It seems that in the end, you really liked these pillows\"- Then she brought him closer to her mouth and whispered -\"Thanks for last night\"- and gave him a quick kiss, then she placed him on her cleavage and put her skirt back on and headed back to the kitchen, walking a bit slowly just to give lake time to fully wake up, then she arrived at the table and he saw Joana looked happy, although he still felt unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Morning, Blake. How did you sleep?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I slept well, thank you, princess\"- Blake deemed it proper to bow respectfully, Claire just smiled, and Blake noticed Karina was behind them with the cooking ladies and also observed it, she seemed to have given him a look of approval<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I am officially done with your future husband, your majesty\"- Claire added bowing as well, and then she said with a mischievous smile -\"The rest is up to you though\"- Joana blushed a lot and looked away. Blake was just standing there but Claire poked him with one of her fingers to cue him to go to her, and he did although rather slowly. The previous times he was too focused on escaping or his anger so he hadn't really taken a look at Joana, just her size and figure were already beyond impressive, and he still felt a bit intimidated by the size alone. However, Joana noticed him getting closer and gave him a warm smile, she offered her hand and he climbed on it, Joana then placed him on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" *Ahem* Your majesty... the shoulder is kind of a bit unreliable for transportation... I believe you have a better method at your disposal...\"- Claire said and pointed at her own cleavage, Joana blushed intensely again and both she and Blake replied -\"It's too soon!\"- at the same time, Claire laughed -\"You two are a better match than I had thought\"- Both he and Joana just looked away from each other awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina walked closer to them -\"So, since you've released him and given him to the princess, I believe he's ready...\"- However, Claire stood up and walked closer to her and whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't push them. It was difficult enough... also, don't try to force anything yet, or you'll ruin it...\"- Karina sighed but nodded in agreement -\"Give them at least 5 days before the wedding\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"5 days?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just trust me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh alright...\"- Karina said and then respectfully said goodbye to Joana and went back to work on something else. Just like the previous day, Joana had cold chocolate milk served to her and had Claire make another ice cup for Blake to serve himself, and this time she also said he could eat from her food. Some of the cooking ladies gasped and stopped, and Claire frowned a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's your future king, stop freaking out... in any case, the Princess can do what she wants...\"- She said annoyed at them and they resumed cooking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't really see me as a king. I'm not high class stuff...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you forget you're also the grandson of the last Sage of Light? You're not low class stuff either\"- Claire reminded him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He what?\"- Joana herself was a little surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's the son of Lady Lith, remember? And she's the daughter of the last Sage of Light... Blake can become the new one...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Incredible\"- Joana said amazed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't have thought the family's mark was known to the public...\"- Blake commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My mom was a healer, and sometime ago way before I was born, she got to heal the Sage himself, and when she noticed a blue mole on his left shoulder she asked him about it and he told her that it's the mark of his family. That's how I knew of it\"- Claire replied, and Blake had a truly impressed expression, however Joana gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So you saw him undressed or what?!\"- Joana partially sat up in surprise and shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not completely, your majesty. However I was told to check if he had any wound that could reopen\"- Claire said, which was actually true, Karina had told her to watch out of any wound suddenly opening up, and realized that her games with him and her butt could have killed him or injured him badly, but she was glad nothing bad happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright...\"- Joana replied when she noticed that when she moved, Blake had lost balance and was currently desperate clinging onto her breast with one hand, she turned red like a tomato while Blake just gave Claire a 'HELP ME!' look, she giggled and put him back on Joana's shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm really sorry about that, princess... It's just that smooth and silky fabric is kinda difficult to get a grip on, also I only had one free hand...\"- Blake apologized, and was worried she might have gotten mad<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It wasn't your fault, I was the one who moved suddenly, and you didn't get to hold onto my shoulder\"- Joana said stuttering a bit, and then some servants brought food to her, she noticed Blake couldn't recognize the food beyond it being some sort of meat -\"It's roasted cows with some horses...\"- then she noticed Blake still seemed to feel awkward<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Princess... I did some reading, and it said that humans tamed horses for riding, they use them for transportation of themselves, of materials and for battle... they are a bit special to them compared to other forms of livestock\"- Claire said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, really? I'm sorry...\"- Joana said to Blake -\"They have been food here since I can remember...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's ok... I guess giants wouldn't ever come with the idea of riding them\"- Blake laughed a bit -\"For obvious reasons...\"- He jumped off her shoulder and landed on the table -\"It's not the first time I've heard of people eating horse, some towns I've worked at did it too, they say it's a lean and nutritious meat\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought it'd be strange to you...\"- Joana said while looking away awkwardly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It is... but I just found out I'm the son of a giantess, that I'm the grandson of the Sage of Light, and I'm going to get married to a giant princess... I doubt things can't get any weirder, and by this point, horse meat should be the least of my worries I guess...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana and Claire gave a 'this is awkward' look at each other, but then Claire said with just her lips 'At least he accepted the marrying part' and both giggled. Then they noticed Blake had stopped in front of the meat and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is something wrong?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... is there any knife or fork?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fork? Knife? You mean butchering knife?\"- Joana asked confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Some of the old books about the studying of humans say that it appears humans have weaker teeth and they tend to use metal utensils to eat with...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh... well... we only have spoons for soups or stew...\"- Joana replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do you even eat this?\"- Blake said baffled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hands and teeth, that's it...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"- Blake scratched the back of his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake you're a hybrid, you probably can do it just fine. Or use light magic if it's that troublesome\"- Claire said and Blake nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, if you excuse me...\"- He used a light beam to cut off a chunk of meat off one of the roasted cows and grabbed it, after a few seconds of looking at it he just started biting and tearing meat off piece by piece. Joana and Claire giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He looks hungry\"- Joana whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Last thing I ate was bread. 2 days ago in a human hotel...\"- Blake said when he made a pause and continued eating the meat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You didn't feed him?\"- Joana raised an eyebrow at Claire<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... yea-no... Karina must have forgotten as well because she never told me either... but at least he got to drink some chocolate yesterday\"- Claire said while thinking 'So he was even a little starved when 'playing' with me... Now I feel curious to see him at his full strength...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've gone on for weeks without food while at some jobs, it's no big deal as long as I get to eat once I'm done, even stale bread is just fine...\"- Blake replied and continued to eat the chunk of meat -\"I have to admit this is better than what even dukes and counts eat...\"- He added. Joana smiled, although she felt a bit bad from learning the conditions Blake lived through, Joana started eating as well, although she tried eating more slowly than usual and taking smaller bites as an attempt not to scare Blake, meanwhile Claire noticed that both of them only touched their chocolate drink once they were done eating-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks for the food\"- Blake said to Joana, and saw Claire smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know for sure that you two will be fine... well, Princess, why don't you take him to your room already?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana blushed intensely a third time, and she stood up, this time, Blake grabbed onto one of her light brown locks and she noticed it -\"Nice thinking\"- Blake just smiled awkwardly and then Joana nodded to Claire, but after a few seconds of seeing her not move, she walked to her and started pushing her towards her room <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I now you're shy too, your majesty, but you two have to get used to each other before the marriage...\"- Claire then pushed her inside her room, closed the door and left. Joana was still blushing and glanced at Blake <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... uh... what now?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No idea either, and I think I'm afraid of knowing anyway...\"-</span></div></div>",

What did you learn then?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Most of it was about not being afraid of you... well... I mean... of your size... not yours in particular, I mean, you're all giants...\"- Blake found himself struggling to explain in a non offensive manner, however Joana smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I understand. You were very scared of us the first time you got here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was?\"- Blake himself remembered being angrier than scared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fighting is one of the responses of almost any scared creature...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess you're right...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have to congratulate you though, you've been around giantesses for a while and you seem fine\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks...\"- Blake said, and noticed he was still hanging onto Joana's hair lock -\"Maybe I should get off already\"- He mumbled, and Joana walked to sit on her bed, and then he got off her hair, and Joana had him sit on the palm of one of her hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't mind, it looked cute\"- She said -\"Well, what else did you learn?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"- Blake looked around awkwardly -\"I don't feel right trying to tell you any of that, It seems like stuff one shouldn't tell a girl like you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A girl like me?\"- Joana was slightly confused -\"What do you mean with that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, everything... you're a princess... and, for some reason just looking at you right now makes me nervous... and then there's a bit of the size thing...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have to admit it... I'm still afraid you might crush me or something if I say something inappropriate... and it seems what I learned kind of fell in that category...\"- Blake said looking down, however, Joana smiled and brought him closer to her lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have a vague idea of what you're talking about, and by what I know, it's not inappropriate for married people... and we're going to be husband and wife, so...\" Blake gulped, and Joana just giggled -\"I only know this much\"- She gave him a quick kiss, and both were blushing immediately 'How come Claire did a lot more stuff and I didn't feel like this?' Blake thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... I think you should tell me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed, and trying really hard, he said with little stuttering -\"Basically, Claire taught me some of the stuff married couples do... and in general to behave with you... but I can't bring myself to do any of those things with you... it feels wrong...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're forgetting the 'I'm your future wife' part...\"- Joana said, a bit curious about why Blake is flustered this time, he looked fairly confident when it was about fighting and escaping<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Despite what you may believe, I have zero experience with any female... so, yeah, I never did anything with one of my own species so I know very little about yours...\"- Blake said, and Joana finally understood, she brought him to her lips again for another kiss, this one lasted a bit more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, we're in the same boat then\"- She laughed -\"However... you can tell me whatever you learned, I promise I won't hurt you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think there's just one thing we did I can tell you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Joana was laying on the bed, and Blake was laying on her stomach, she had a thoughtful look -\"Are you sure Claire did this? I can't even see you... or even feel you on that matter...\"- Blake blushed upon realizing why Joana couldn't see him, nor he could see her face, however he found it strange Joana could barely feel him on her stomach -\"Are you sure you didn't skip something? I don't know how Claire could have done this herself...\"- She heard Blake gulp in fear and grabbed him, bringing him close to her face -\"That means you know you skipped something...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're going to kill me if I tell you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I promise I won't... what was it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She took off most of her clothes except the underwear...\"- Blake said rather fast and closed his eyes and covered his head anticipating something ugly, and after a few tense seconds, he opened his eyes and noticed Joana was blushing deeply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh... that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't have to d...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why didn't you start from there?\"- Joana asked and Blake just fainted, she opened her eyes wide, stood up and rushed to her desk, where she placed him and leaned her ear close to him to check if he was still breathing or his heart was still beating, she sighed in relief -\"And I thought I was the shy one...\"- Then she heard someone knocking on her door, and went to open it, it was Claire<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was told something might unusual have happened\"- Claire lied, she was actually using two spells, one that allowed her to read Blake's thoughts, and one that allowed to see what happened around him, but she played it cool -\"What happened, your majesty?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... I was trying to get started on learning what you taught him, and he told me of the laying on my stomach thing, but something seemed off, and when I asked him, he was unwilling to tell, and when he finally told me you were in your underwear, I asked him why he didn't say that from the start and he fainted... Now he's on my desk, his heartbeat is a bit frantic, and his breathing sounds fine...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire couldn't help but laugh -\"My god, Princess, I think you just overwhelmed his shyness... poor guy...\"- Joana looked down -\"It's alright... let him rest and recover and try again, you two have to get used to each other, although it seems you have to take the lead\"- She said to Joana who blushed a little herself but nodded, then Claire left, and Joana waited patiently for Blake to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damn, that was some weird... dream... oh... god...\"- Blake said and upon noticing he was in Joana's room he got nervous again, but Joan sat in front of him and kissed him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Calm down...\"- She said in a soothing voice -\"We're both shy, but we have to try... Please don't faint again...\"- Joana then stood up and started to slowly take off her dress, Blake immediately looked away and Joana could hear his heartbeat going crazy again -\"You can look away if it makes you feel better, but you'll have to look at me eventually...\"- She continued to take her dress off and sat again on her chair in front of the desk, she waited for Blake's heartbeat to lower a bit and then she turned him around with her hand, he gulped hard when he looked at her, she was wearing a more adorned black bra with some frills -\"See? Nothing bad happened?\"- Joana shuddered a bit herself <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I admit it makes me a bit nervous too...\"- She stood up, and since the desk was at about her waist level, Blake further noticed how tall she actually is, and was again feeling both nervous and intimidated. but she gave him a kind look and grabbed him gently, she want back to her bed and placed him on her stomach, this time, although she couldn't see him, she could feel him a lot more clearly, and giggled a bit, then she sat up and brought him to her face -\"What else did Claire teach you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Come on\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... she said that giantesses often put their human husbands in their cleavage when they went to sleep...\"- Blake gulped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I heard of that too...\"- Joana said and then glanced at her own cleavage, and then at Blake, she laughed -\"I'm afraid that won't work for us...\"- Blake himself glanced down and instinctively took a step backwards in her palm, her chest was indeed far bigger than Claire's, and Claire's was more than big enough to completely hide him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's too big, right?\"- Joana sighed -\"I knew I should have stopped eating meat these days but I'm just not that fond of vegetables alone...\"- She noticed Blake had a thoughtful look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Claire actually tried to teach me not to be afraid of your size... I mean the giantesses' size...\"- Blake said nervously, and Joana remembered Claire told her to take the lead, although she felt honestly unsure about this one thing. She gently moved her hand closer to her chest and placed Blake on top of one of her breasts, he immediately sank quite a bit into it, and she shuddered from feeling him, Blake stayed still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can move if you want\"- She said a bit more shyly, and Blake stood up, although he was sinking knee deep into her soft flesh -\"So... what do you think?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huge falls short to describe it...\"- Blake replied, already knowing lying wouldn't get him anywhere good, and he again anticipated a bad reaction, but instead Joana gave him a confused look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do you anticipate something bad?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought you'd get mad at me for, well, saying your bust is big...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even I said that myself, my point was that I wondered if it was too big for you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake remembered Claire's butt, which he already had deemed as far too big, and Joana's bust was on its own significantly larger than even that, he took a deep breath and said -\"No\"- It felt like this was the actual bravest moment in his life, and Joana noticed it, she giggled a bit and used her hand to hug Blake gently against her breast, however, she decided to step up a little more and grabbed Blake, then she sat up, and held him above her cleavage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you willing to try?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake remembered what Claire said about trusting more on his greater durability and ignoring his initial instinct, even though Joana's cleavage was the biggest thing he seen so far, he nodded and Joana lowered him, then he jumped off, expecting to just land in between like he had done with Claire's bust, but this time he sank completely, and Joana giggled because Blake's movement tickled her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Was that supposed to happen?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No!\"- Replied a very muffled Blake</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-\"Well... are you comfortable?\"- Joana asked, and something in her voice soothed Blake just enough to put aside his initial fear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Kinda... it's dark, if anything...\"- He replied, and Joana giggled, although that shook her chest a little and for him, it felt like an earthquake, although not as bad as when Claire wiggled her butt. Also, Joana's breasts were much softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess I wouldn't mind carrying you like this... if you don't either...\"- Joana said blushing a bit, and Blake didn't answer out of sheer embarrassment. Joana wasn't mad at him, he still expected some kind of punishment for this behavior but there was none, and Joana was just trying to get over her own shyness because she was going to marry him. Suddenly, he remembered his discussion with his friends the day they got attacked by the Sand Bandits, they mocked him for not having a girlfriend, and he also remembered Ayrton suggested an older, gentle girlfriend seemed to be his type. Back then, he had dismissed it as total nonsense, but now, it seemed the complete opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damnit, Ayrton was right...\"- Blake mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh? Who?\"- Joana said, and Blake was surprised she heard him from inside her really enormous cleavage, but he quickly remembered Karina said giants had much sharper senses...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ayrton, one of my friends...\"- Blake replied, and suddenly, Joana's fingers took him out of her cleavage, she sat him on one of her breasts though<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened with him?\"- She asked curiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you see, I never had any sort of girlfriend, wife, no romantic relationship at all in my life... the day we were attacked by the Sand Bandits we were hanging out because the duke of Kildevar had given us a day off, and I mocked Gustave for being after girls all the time, then he asked how come they never saw me with one, and I answered the truth, that I had never been, which lead to some more laughs and mocking... The point is, they discussed what 'type' of girl would suit me, and most of them believed a tough warrior woman was my perfect match, except Ayrton... he had said he sensed an older, sweet and gentle woman was better suited for me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana and Blake stared into each other for a few seconds, and Blake cleared his throat and continued -\"I disregarded what he said as complete nonsense just like the other guys' theories... and now...\"- Blake was starting to get too nervous to continue -\"...well...being with you right now... got me thinking, and reminded me of that... he ended up being right after all...\"- Blake covered his face with his hands in shame, but Joana used a finger to move them aside, she was smiling although she was also noticeably blushing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's... really sweet...\"- she pushed him slightly into her breast -\"I'm sorry we got rushed into this marriage though... You didn't get to have a girlfriend per se...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know what that's like, but... this feels a bit like that...\"- Blake said blushing even more, and seriously wondered what sort of witchcraft Claire did on him, as he was completely scared and disgusted of giants a few days ago... but he just started to see them as people since that nightmare when he was trying to get them killed... and at least Joana didn't seem to hold any grudge. He noticed Joana pressed a bit more into her flesh but it didn't feel bad, as it was extremely smooth and soft, he glanced up and saw that she closed her eyes and was enjoying the hug too, he couldn't help but smile, this time not because of humor... for the first time in years he just smiled, he was... starting to feel happy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is this... why am I feeling good? I gave up my freedom to save those soldiers whom I barely knew... I meant to save my friends too... but I failed at that... I should be sad... I've gotten past the point of fighting back, and once anger has vanished, all that's left is sadness... then... why am I not sad right now? My body feels like it's shivering from the inside, but doesn't feel wrong...' Blake thought, and unknown to him, Claire was listening to his thoughts, she had sneaked a mind small mind reading spell when she flicked him to her butt 2 days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems he's starting to feel it\"- She said with a smile, she was happy for both him and for the princess, even if she sort of had him and let him go. She was well aware she wasn't able to awake this kind of feelings on him herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana opened her eyes and brought him once again to her lips for another kiss, and for the first time, Blake also kissed her, when he did, Joana's lips pressed a bit more on him and didn't let go for nearly a minute, but he didn't fight it either, they slowly broke it, and she gave him a very sweet look -\"You kissed me this time...\"- Blake was blushing more and just nodded weakly 'Perhaps... even in the middle of all this... I'm happy...' He thought, which also shocked him a bit, and he sat on Joana's palm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is something wrong?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No... but that's what's weird... there is ALWAYS something wrong in me... but right now, I can't feel it...\"- Blake said -\"I was convinced happiness was for those born with good fortune... not for someone like a low class mercenary leader whose father and grandmother are dead, and somehow ended in a forced marriage... I feel... happy... why?\"- Blake looked away, and Joana heard something off in him, and used a finger to push back Blake's hood, but he caught her finger in her hand, not allowing her... but she still observed he was crying, and she wasn't entirely sure why, she worried she might have done something wrong, but they had just kissed and that felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry you're seeing me like this, Joana...\"- Blake said, turning around -\"I don't understand anything anymore... I don't know why I'm crying right now, when I haven't cried in nearly all of my life...\"- Blake fell to his knees -\"Why does it feel like this? I GAVE UP MY LIFE! MY FREEDOM! and yet, my usual sadness and the sense I wasn't mean to be born are not there! They're like my shadow, and they're not there anymore! WHY?!\"- He let himself fall face first onto Joana's palm, and broke down crying, Joana could vaguely feel his tears, and she was getting a greater understanding of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a guy who grew without parents, and from what she heard, his grandma only raised him for a few years before she died, and from then on, he has been going around the world, living as he can, and even if he made good friends along the way, Joana now saw that Blake was always accompanied by a sense of emptiness, and suddenly not feeling it anymore is beyond incomprehensible to him, she had a good guess on what to do, and she slowly brought him to her chest, slightly to the left side, and raising her fingers, she made him stand up, and then, she pressed him softly above her breasts, she had him listen to her heartbeat while he cried, and slowly, he just stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was about to move her hand away from her chest but Blake whispered -\"No...\"- and kept on leaning against her chest and listening to her heartbeat. He then pushed himself slightly apart from her chest and sat on her palm again, then she spoke softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shadows disappear when there's enough light...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stared at her, and from his face it looked as if she had just deciphered what he was feeling -\"Are you even real?\"- Blake said slowly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As real as the heartbeat you've been listening to...\"- Joana then brought him to her lips and kissed him gently, after she broke the kiss, she noticed Blake still seemed a bit lost, and she playfully licked him, which snapped him out of it, he was blushing again, and he felt it different than when Claire had done it, back then, it was just superficial embarrassment, but this time, he wasn't sure if perhaps this was love. Typically, love, as far as he knew, hearing from humans, depended on freedom and some other things, but part of the point was to find your soul mate and be free to choose to be with them... and yet... this wasn't the case, despite that this was supposedly a forced marriage, and she isn't even of the same species as him, he felt that maybe love still happened, in a different way, he laughed a bit, and Joana gave him a confused look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If there's a God... I bet he's some sort of poet...\"- Both of them laughed a bit, although Joana could only guess what was happening through his mind. She also realized that they almost completely put Claire's teachings aside, because he finally showed some of his true feelings, and she was able to help him the best she could, with just her own sense. 'Perhaps we're really meant to be husband and wife' Joana thought, and smiled, she laid on the bed and placed Blake on her left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How are you feeling?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"For the first time since I can remember... good... truly good...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you... still mad about me?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No... I mean... forced marriage sucks... but you... I don't even know how you could even understand a guy from another species...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe we're not so different\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The fact that I can get completely lost in your cleavage says otherwise\"- Blake joked, and Joana laughed as well...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, in Claire's room, she was writing notes on Blake's thoughts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Aha! I knew I was right... being a hybrid is more troublesome than many believe... there's a discrepancy between the inherited physical abilities from giants, and the human instincts... so, his fear of us was caused by his instinct underestimating severely his own capabilities...' Claire fondly remembered when she placed Blake on or inside her butt several times, testing her personal theory 'The first time I sat on him he was struggling hard to lift me or to try and get away... by the last times I trapped him in my butt, he even took a nap and even slept the whole night in there... And well... there's this part with the feelings... very intense... There's no way to teach anyone how to deal with those, and Joana did it better than anyone ever would... I was right, she'll be a good wife...' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire finished writing her notes, and laid on her bed 'Maybe I should dispel the mind reading and the surveillance already, but I really want to find out if the princess will attempt to put him in her butt or something...' She thought, and she laughed a bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Joana's room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... we have today and 4 more days for ourselves... is there anything else we should be doing?\"- Joana wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought it was about getting used to each other...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, I guess... but, isn't there anything beyond me carrying you in my cleavage?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake gulped -\"Well, Claire told me about the licks, but you got there already on you own\"- Joana blushed -\"She said it was a natural affection display for you, just like a kiss\"- He said to try and comfort her 'I sure as hell am not telling her of Claire's stupid idea with the butt' he thought. Unknown to him, Claire listened to this and laughed quite heartily in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... now that I think of it, you haven't seen much more of me besides my chest\"- Joana added surprisingly boldly, she placed Blake on the bed and stood up, towering above him, her face no longer visible due to her breasts, and for the first time he saw below her chest. She was wearing adorned black panties, and unlike Claire, she also wore black transparent stockings, tied below the knees with black garters, with a few gems and quite a lot of ribbons. It made her thighs look even bigger, although she didn't exactly need that, Blake took a step back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do I look?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... I don't think I have a word for it...\"- Blake scratched the back of his head 'Seriously what kind of witchcraft did Claire do? How am I even noticing anything past her size this time?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll take that as a compliment\"- Joana replied and giggled, she carefully sat next to Blake, and he still had to dash a bit away because of her weight sinking on the bed, and he still underestimated it, rolling down until he hit her thigh, she noticed this and laughed a bit, then placed him on her thigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Another thing Claire said and you've already done...\"- Blake commented, and even Joana was surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... do you like them?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My legs\"- Joana said giggling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh.. well... they are literally the biggest ones I have seen so far... that's... impressive, at least...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana smiled, and noticed Blake was sinking ankle-deep in her thigh flesh -\"Maybe I should really stop eating meat for a while\"- Blake looked at her confused, then at himself, and noticed his feet sinking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nah. Looks good on you...\"- He said while looking away and scratching his head, however Joana grabbed him and kissed him, still holding him in her palm, she spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you think I could get to see a little more of you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed, and pushed his hood behind his head. She had a good look at his face for the first time, she saw his messy wavy black hair, and also the scar that ran down his left eye, and his eyes themselves, they looked as if they had just recently lost the ferocity that was to them back when he was trying to escape, but still, she thought she could still see the eyes of a warrior, and while they appeared stoic, she already knew they hid a lot of pain from everyone else, until now. One more thing drew her attention though, and she brought her other hand and held it near his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I had never seen that skin tone\"- Joana said with a small giggle, comparing it to her own white skin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I descend from the dark magicians, most of them had this skin tone, or even darker\"- Blake commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, so I even got to get an exotic husband\"- She joked -\"Wait a minute, the dark magicians?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Almost nobody else knows this, but yes... my father was the last Dark Sage\"- He replied, and Joana gasped -\"Since Dark Magicians are supposed to be extinct, I rarely ever use those powers, unless nobody is seeing, or if I'm fighting someone to death...\"- Then he showed Joana his silver necklace that was still in his pants' pocket -\"Normally, I have to wear this to suppress my power, but since I've been quite worn down and haven't recovered properly, it seems my dark power is dormant for now\"- He still put it back around his neck -\"Just to be sure...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But I've seen you use light magic this whole time!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm also the grandson of the last Sage of Light\"- Blake said, and he laughed -\"It seems I got both powers running in my veins...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's amazing... I've seen dual magic with the giantesses here that were daughters of humans, but I don't think anyone ever registered there being a human with dual magic, and light and darkness on top of that...\"- Joana was genuinely amazed -\"How come you have yourself in such low self esteem?\"- She asked half-jokingly, and hugged him gently to her chest, but she brought him back to her eye level<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, my little exotic dual warrior, is there any more surprise?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not really...\"- Blake said, and took his hooded cape off, and his black shirt, he also took his gloves off and put those in one of his pants' pockets. Before he even thought about what to do with his shirt and cape, Joana grabbed them with two fingers and dropped them in her cleavage -\"Come on, really? Those are my only clothes\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can dive and look for them later\"- Joana said giving him a more seductive look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Right...\"- Blake said, and just extended his arms -\"There isn't anything you'd exactly like to see...\"- However, by the look in Joana's eyes, she disagreed, and looked at his torso with detail, he indeed had the musculature of a warrior that has been training and fighting his whole life, but also a surprisingly high amount of scars on his shoulders, abdomen, chest, and even some in his upper arms -\"I've fought quite a lot of stuff... And not just people, sometimes I've been tasked with hunting down some dangerous beast\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems you've lived quite an intense life\"- Joana said, she wouldn't have thought someone younger than her could have that many scars, they seemed more fitting to an old veteran -\"What kind of beasts have you fought?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you see, we have had to hunt sabretooth cats... Remember my cat Tabitha? Her species are like the tamed version according to some, like with dogs and wolves, sabretooth are of about the same size, but are much bulkier, and as their name says, their fangs can be as long as some blades, they can eat even elephants, and are very dangerous if near a human village. They aren't too difficult to track, but are a hell of a lot tougher to battle, specially since I had to hold back both my dark powers and my hybrid strength\"- Blake showed Joana the rings he used on his wrists and ankles -\"I've used weighted rings since I was a kid, and just recently got these ones that are adjustable with magic, but I believe I won't use them much anymore... I most likely need my full strength around you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana laughed at the last part -\"Well, yeah...\"- She glanced at her cleavage again, and at her thighs -\"You probably need it, but still, don't try to carry me to our room on our wedding\"- She joked, and both laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good one...\"- Blake said, although he mentally shuddered, imagining Claire would have wanted him to attempt such a thing. Even if he was able to lift Claire, who was a bit heavier than most, he seriously doubted he could lift the significantly taller and much more voluptuous Joana. However, Joana seemed to have caught on that he got lost in his thoughts for a moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was just imagining what you said... pretty hilarious\"- Blake said scratching his head 'Pretty painful too' he thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not like I'd actually expect you to carry me, ever. I don't care if Karina thinks you can just because you're a hybrid...\"- Joana said in a more soothing tone, and Blake resumed his stories<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway, like I said, I had to fight these beasts without dark power, and one tenth or two of my real strength, so, it was more about fighting skill than anything else... And those sabretooth cats know the neck is a weak point\"- Blake added, shoring Joana the scars near his neck -\"Close calls\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least, normally I have my trusty sword\"- Blake extended his arm, and his sword appeared in his hand, Joana was a bit scared at first, remembering he had used it to attack her and the others, but this time, he was showing it to her, in comparison to him, it was almost as tall as he stood, and it was broad enough to also serve as a shield, and it had runnic letters made of gold embedded in its center, going through most of the length of the blade. Also she observed that it was made of a shiny black metal she immediately recognized...</span></div></div>",

We used to use it to make weapons and armors, although we haven't had a full armed army for quite a few years... so we mostly use it these days to reinforce our buildings and things like tables or chairs... we had thought that since it's heavier than iron, it was unwieldy for most humans\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, all I knew is that my father forged this sword for me... So he found an unbreakable metal... wait, how could he even make a sword with it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In its rocky, mineral form, it's about as easy to melt as copper, but once you've melted it, two things can happen, if it cools down slowly it can be reshaped later, but it's only about as tough as iron, and heavier still, but if it's suddenly cooled like by dunking the blade on water, it becomes shiny and becomes near unbreakable\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Awesome... well, my father forged this weapon for me, although by what you tell me, I believe my mother also had a hand in this, anyway, it's a Dark Magicians' tradition, unlike the other elemental Sages who pass down their weapons for generations, Dark Sages make a new weapon for their child every time...\"- Blake commented, and looked at the runnic gold letters -\"I know they have some sort of purpose, but so far I can only activate the first one, it's what allows me to summon it in my hand at any time\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's old giant language\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...what...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Karina and others taught it to me, let me see the sword\"- Blake handed it to her, she grabbed the handle with 2 fingers and brought it a bit nearer her eye -\"The first symbol means 'Come' So, I guess it refers to its ability to be summoned by you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What about the other symbols?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll read them from top to bottom: Come, Burn, Shield, Heal, Strike, Slash and Rebirth...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Some are kinda obvious, and others are vague...\"- Blake replied confused -\"At least now I at least know what it says, so I might try to figure it out\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This also means your mother had more than a hand in the making of this, because rune magic is definitely a giants' thing...\"- Joana added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... well... to be honest I'm not too happy about her, and I may not talk to her in a really long while...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because she agreed to the marriage, right?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... she could have stopped it once we all learned she was my mother...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She's the daughter of the last Sage, we'd assume she's fairly wise, and might have her reasons...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm still bothered by the fact she didn't help me when she had the chance\"- Blake added, and Joana put the sword on her nightstand and brought him close to her chest for a hug<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe she did, in a different way\"- She said. Blake's mood softened and he hugged her back as best as he could, and even though he was still annoyed at his mother, Joana might be right. Then he heard her giggle and looked up -\"You can go get your clothes back if yo want\"- Blake glanced down at her cleavage, and shuddered a bit just from its sheer size, but decided to just go in and out as soon as possible, he jumped off her hand and dove right into her cleavage, she giggled a bit more and smiled, although even she was a bit worried her bust was too much for him. Before she could even think of anything else, she heard someone knocking on her door -\"Give me a minute\"- She replied and started putting her clothes back and walked to open the door, it was Karina<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry to bother you, Princess, but I came to check on several things... like to see if you needed something, or if you had clothes to wash...\"- She said as she looked around -\"Or check on the hybrid... Where is he?\"- Karina didn't even wait for an answer and she gasped -\"GODDAMNIT! HOW DID HE ESCAPE THIS TIME?!\"- She started frantically checking if he was hiding somewhere until Joana tapped on her shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"First of all, his name is Blake... and Second, he didn't escape...\"- Then she pointed at her cleavage, Karina was the one who got a baffled look this time but quickly regained her composure<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" *Ahem* So... Claire did tame him after all... Remind me to raise her pay...\"- Karina still stared at Joana's cleavage -\"Is he even ok?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I really hope so...\"- Joana said with a slight nervous laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, don't tire him too much before the wedding\"- Karina said with a laugh and respectfully said, picking a few clothes to take to wash and left, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you alright?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sort of, but I STILL can't find my cape or my shirt\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana blushed a bit -\"Sorry, I didn't think it'd be that difficult to search...\"- She felt tickled as Blake kept moving in her cleavage, and shuddered a bit herself when he started going deeper to try and find his clothes, it took him almost 20 minutes to find the two pieces of clothing, and about 5 more minutes to climb back up, when his head finally poked out of her cleavage he started taking a few deeper breaths<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Treasure hunters that go under the sea are definitely not paid enough...\"- Blake said, and Joana laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is it that big?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... yeah... but it's alright\"- Blake showed her his hood and shirt, he only put the shirt back on and gave her his cape -\"I assume you'll want to see me without the hood, but please, this time put it on your nightstand or something\"- Joana nodded and put it on her nightstand, under his sword just so the wind wouldn't make it fly away. Observing this, Blake jumped from her chest to the nightstand, and Joana was surprised by the little feat despite knowing he's a hybrid<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There are drawers in this thing, Maybe my cape would be safer in...\"- He said opening the drawer below him by leaning his back on it while pushing it open with his legs, and noticed Joana was blushing a bit more and trying to say something<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WAIT!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Blake looked at her and then he looked below -\"What the h...\"- He lost his concentration out of sheer shock and fell inside the drawer, he landed on what felt like soft fabric, like a bed of sorts, but that didn't make sense because it was in a drawer, he opened his eyes and Joana only heard him scream -\"WHAT?!\"- She walked closer to him blushing quite a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's where I put my panties...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she even finished the phrase Blake frantically untangled himself and jumped up with his clothes still in his hands and closed the drawer with one backward kick, which he also used to bounce off and did a somersault to get back on top of the drawer. Joana laughed a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was quite a performance... but it looked like you had just seen the plague or something...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I just didn't want you to think I did that on purpose\"- Blake replied, cringing at the memories of being trapped inside Claire's panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, those were clean clothes, there wasn't any real harm, as long as you're not there when i'm changing clothes\"- Joana joked and laughed, but noticed Blake shuddered and didn't laugh -\"It was a joke...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah I know, sorry... It was a bit scary to imagine\"- Blake replied, and Joana picked him up to kiss him, and let him stand on her shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... this is it?\"- Joana said -\"I thought we were supposed to know more stuff...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"To be honest I'm still worried about the actual wedding... I only have a very vague idea of what it's expected to happen right after, but no offense, I don't think I'll agree to do that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Me neither. Sounds like abusing you...\"- Joana replied and brought him to one of her breasts and gently hugged him to it -\"Although we might get forced to do it at some point...\"- Joana added blushing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's hope not\"- Blake sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in Claire's room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire continued to write down notes, as she was still using the spell that was reading Blake's mind as well as the surveillance one -\"Well... they won't exactly agree to making babies yet, but at least she supports his stance... I guess that's good...\"- She mumbled, as suddenly Karina jumped inside her room from her open window<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Karina, what the?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If I had knocked the door you would have dispelled those things...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"- Claire just gave her a defeated look -\"So... you know...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course! Who do you think I am?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That means you must be using a surveillance spell as well!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Didn't have to, skilled enough magicians can sense other spells going around them... I just had to pass by their room and confirmed the nature of the spells you used...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, you got me... what do you want?\"- Claire asked, sighing defeated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you could tell me what's been happening so far...\"- Karina said -\"I only saw that he seemed to be getting along with the Princess, but that could be a trick just to attempt an escape\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The guy gave up his freedom to have you spare his friends and those soldiers, do you really think he's going to escape leaving them behind and risk their execution?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe you're right... he does have some sense of honor...\"- Karina said, drifting off slightly into her thoughts, remembering that he prevented one of the elite soldiers from slicing her neck<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's not bad... It's just that you couldn't have just gone and force orders on him like you've been trying ever since he was brought here\"- Claire said in a more serious tone -\"Trying to tame him like that obviously turned out bad... but if you show some kindness, even someone as stubborn can change slowly... or if not change, reveal the side of themselves they usually keep hidden...\"-</span></div></div>",

I can't completely confirm it on Blake's side, but she might love him already\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That sounds strangely cute\"- Karina commented scratching her head, and read a bit more from Claire's notes -\"It seems that he's also started feeling something...\"- However, she turned a few pages back, then went to where she was reading and just gave Claire an annoyed look -\"It seems that your 'punishment' on him from 2 days ago scared him more than needed...\"- Claire blushed slightly -\"Seriously, don't even think about doing that with the other humans...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So have you decided their fate?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was kinda obvious from the start. Taylor's idea to eat them, even if as a joke, is plain insane... and executing them in any way would only guarantee Blake would try to get us to go extinct for good even if is the last thing he does...\"- Karina replied, shuddering a bit from remembering he had already brought a small elite force and things could have turned far uglier than they did<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... breeding purposes?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, since there weren't any other really good options left, the Princess signed her approval of giving them into marriage to some of us... although we have yet to decide who gets who, they're only 4...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire walked closer to her and gave her a funny look -\"That sounds like you want to get a chance with some of them yourself\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You too want a husband and you know it\"- Karina replied, pushing her aside rather playfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But I admit it, I don't go around acting like the evil lady that judges and stuff...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No, instead you go around acting as some sort of seducing maiden... at least for my case, someone has to do it\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You could be a bit less harsh...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess you're right... anyway, I'll come back to tell you what'll be of them\"- Karina said and left, unlike when she entered, she used the door this time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Seducing maiden huh?\"- Claire mumbled as she laid on her bed to continue checking what happened with Blake and the princess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Joana's room, she tried again to get the hang of carrying Blake in her cleavage, but he just sunk down completely like the first time -\"Not to be mean, but it looked just as funny as the first time...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, because you're not the one who risks getting drowned...\"- Blake replied and started climbing back up, which sent shudders down her spine -\"Please don't tell me you're like Claire...\"- Blake muttered, stopping at mid climb for a quick break<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not, but it tickles me... and it feels a bit weird, in a good way...\"- Joana replied from above<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Note to self, remember these giants have incredibly sharp hearing at least...' He thought and resumed his climb until he finally got out of Joana's massive cleavage 'I can't really wrap around my head that this is going to be my wife...' Joana noticed his thoughtful look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did something happen?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No... it's just that, well, fear aside, you giants are impressive...\"- Blake replied, and Joana seemed to have a puzzled look -\"I have seen you're actually very nice, but, on the physical part, it's a bit hard to wrap around my head the idea that you're going to be my wife\"- Joana giggled and picked him up and kissed him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We have 5 days to get you used to the idea\"- She said, for the first time with a somewhat seductive tone, which made Blake shudder this time, he gulped a bit hard, and Joana just smiled and started to slowly lick him while going to her bed, however, as she was herself a bit excited, her two fingered grip on Blake slipped and he fell inside her mouth, she immediately stopped in her tracks while having a bit of a terrified face, she quickly opened her mouth and stuck her tongue out, Blake climbed back to her hand, and she wiped him dry on one of her breasts before putting him on her forehead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm really sorry about that, I didn't mean to...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You could warn me next time... that was some extreme kiss...\"- Blake joked, and both laughed, Joana was relieved she didn't trigger Blake's fear of giants again, however she noticed that he walked down her forehead and towards one of her eyes, and he seemed to have grabbed something<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What did you just do?\"- She asked confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Loose eyelash... these things annoy me, I guessed I could just pluck it out for you since I'm here\"- Blake showed her said eyelash, it was about as long as one of Blake's arms, Joana giggled and picked him up again to place him on her left breast<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know, in our culture, whenever we pluck an eyelash of our own we make a wish...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... will you make one?\"- Blake replied, still looking at the giant eyelash in his hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think it already worked\"- She laughed and gave him a sweet look, Blake shuddered again and looked away, blushing slightly -\"Maybe you can make a wish too\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Up to yesterday, I would have wished for a means to escape... but you know what? I hate the forced marriage bit, but meeting you was... well... worth it, I guess... If anything, I wish we had a chance to have been boyfriend and girlfriend for a longer while...\"- Blake said, still blushing, and summoned his sword in his hand, and started tying the giant eyelash around the handle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's that for?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's a little memento\"- Blake laughed at the ironic usage of the word 'little' -\"Something from you I can carry with me almost all the time\"- Both blushed -\"I guess it could also laugh at the reactions...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What reactions?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If someone asks me what's this thing in my sword's handle, I'm sure 'My wife's eyelash' is among the last answers they'd ever expect\"- Blake laughed a bit more than Joana, she blushed a deeper red this time, and after putting his sword on the nightstand, she kissed him once again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How come you never had any girlfriend ever? You seem fairly good at making a girl blush\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake laughed a bit and scratched his head -\"Well, only you made me feel like my life could be better despite the circumstances... And, I have absolutely zero practice at courting unlike my friends, and they fail amusingly often...\"- Joana giggled and started licking him again, however, after a few licks, Blake stopped her tongue with both hands, and she gave him a confused look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh... too much?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No... I just remembered, my friends... what'll happen to them?\"- Joana sighed and sat up, placing Blake in her cleavage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, like with you, I was unable to set them free, because my parents left as imperative laws to make sure our generation isn't the last... they'll be given to giantesses too for, well... breeding purposes...\"- Joana blushed a lot when saying the last part, and Blake felt his heart sinking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey... uh... One thing is that this didn't turn out so bad for me because you're actually nice... but forcing the same fate on my friends is something else... They actually had relationships with human women at one point, and the excuse of being hybrids doesn't apply to them...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know, I made that point to Karina, but she said that since they were your mercenary teammates, it could be reasonably be concluded that they have enough strength to keep up with you, and that they could be suitable candidates as well\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I really feel sorry for them...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She said she would have them be instructed by Claire later...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now I'm REALLY really sorry about them...\"- Blake added, and thought 'She better keep up her promise or I'll kick her giant ass... on second thought, that could end rather badly...' He shuddered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We could go see them, and your cat too\"- Joana said with a warmer smile -\"I ordered that she's allowed to stay as your pet\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks... she's also my personal ride though\"- Blake commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, that could be argued\"- Joana giggled, pointing his current location, and Blake blushed a lot, and then observed Joana started putting her clothes back on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait a minute, you're leaving me here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, why?\"- Joana asked sweetly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Alright...\"- Blake burrowed a bit deeper, with only his head sticking out, just in case 'This warmth and softness... I think I shouldn't get too used to it...' he thought, while Joana walked out of her room...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joana walked out of her room and encountered Claire, who was doing some cleaning, she seemed to be a bit puzzled to see her out of her room -\"Uh, your Majesty... why aren't you in your room?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm going to check on the other humans...\"- Joana replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But what happened with Blake?\"- Claire asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's coming with me...\"- Joana said looking away awkwardly, and it took a few moments for Claire to catch on, and she smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So you already have him in your cleavage? Nice!\"- She gave Joana thumbs up, which only made her blush -\"No need to be embarrassed, Princess, it's a proper way to carry... a  loved one...\"- She whispered the last part, and Joana blushed harder, but nodded in agreement -\"Alright, I shall not interrupt you anymore, I'm just cleaning around\"- Claire waved goodbye and resumed cleaning around the house, a task Karina gave her to stop her from spying much further on Blake and Joana, or so she guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana headed for the underground dungeon, and Blake recognized this area as the place they once held that mysterious ice magic wielding man, Blake briefly wondered what could he be doing right now, but hoped he was doing fine. At the very least, that man had brought his friends, even if the rescue attempts ultimately failed, and now kind of felt bad for letting them get caught just like himself.  Another servant stood guard in there but she didn't even question the Princess and let her in right away. She noticed they all were hanging from ceiling with threads made of golden light, she sighed at the harsh manner they were being treated, and used a drop sized light orb to light up the candles around, they seemed to be sleeping, but the light woke them up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand was the first one to wake up, his vision a bit blurry, and as it eventually regained its focus, he observed the giantess that stood before him, even though he was hanging pretty high in the air, he was at this giantess' eye level, and he gulped, but, after paying a bit more of attention, he noticed this was neither Taylor nor Karina, those weren't as tall. He recognized her as the Princess from whom they had been trying to rescue Blake from, he sighed defeated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... are you coming too to rub your victory onto us?\"- However he noticed the Princess' face showed some sadness and she denied with her head, and suddenly, he heard as if something moved quickly near them, and he glanced down, first thing he noticed was, of course, the princess' massive cleavage, and had a slight nosebleed, which he couldn't cover due to being tied, however, the second thing he noticed was Blake standing on one of this giant girl's breasts, he opened and closed his eyes a few times to make sure he wasn't seeing things -\"Blake?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who else were you expecting?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By this point, either the giant girl who said we would be dinner, or the other one who just said she wouldn't let us go...\"- Ferdinand said with a feeling of giving up, but then he laughed -\"Now that's some high class traveling you got there... Wait a minute... you two... really?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Officially not yet, but, turns out it wasn't that bad, the forced bit sucks, but she's actually nice\"- Blake replied blushing a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... she's on our side...\"- Ferdinand said with a bit more of hope, Joana nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I tried to have you all released, but the current laws prohibit it, because *ahem* we need you to help repopulate...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My god...\"- Ferdinand felt his heart sink this time -\"Of all the ways to die, even execution for being a dark magician was above in my list than... that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana blushed a bit -\"I'm really sorry, I've tried to find any way to work around the current laws but there isn't, and even if there was, it's possible no other giantess would like the idea of letting you go free...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So you really don't agree to this... yet, you're with Blake...\"- Ferdinand said a bit more thoughtful<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They specifically got him for me, and then there's the thing of being a hybrid...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah I heard, care to explain a bit more on that? All I know is Blake's mother was one of you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The children of a giantess and a human vary depending on their gender, females are just like the rest of us, except that if the father had some type of magic power, the daughter most likely inherits both light and the father's element, and have a bit more varied hair and skin colors. Male hybrids are really different, they inherit the humans' size, but their strength is comparable to that of a giant, and are arguably faster since it's greater strength  on a smaller and lighter body... the thing is, most hybrids were wiped out by the king along the dark magicians... so, that we found one still alive was a big surprise, and Karina and the others are determined to have him marry me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That explains a lot, specially the light magic bit, I guess, but... how come you have accepted this, Blake?\"- Ferdinand asked still a bit confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No choice left... I can't be set free by legal ways, and I can't leave you guys behind...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" *Ahem* You could release us, right now?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm pretty sure there is at least someone guarding, and I can tell that if I were to break these light threads, one or more giantesses would be happy to crush us like insects...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... we're all dead meat...\"- Ferdinand's head hung down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually, killing any of you is not quite the point...\"- Joana said shyly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana, you're not helping...\"- Blake said, facepalming, but noticed the rest of the guys were just starting to wake up -\"And I'm the one who gets called a sleepyhead...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh... HOLY HELL!\"- Ayrton was the first to go from groggy to freaking out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Look a bit down\"- Ferdinand said, and Ayrton did so, he saw Blake standing on one of Joana's enormous breasts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The hell did I miss?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"To make it short, she's actually nice, the forced marriage sucks, but she is not evil...\"- Blake replied, and Ayrton looked at Joana's face, she greeted him with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"First time you get a girl and has to be a freaking giant? Maybe you should have stayed single...\"- Ayrton said, but he was joking by this point, he indeed saw in her eyes that she was not evil at all, and maybe could be the kind of sweet girl he theorized he needed. Blake and Joana also laughed, which slightly further proved his point. Meanwhile, Gustave had gradually been waking up, and when his vision regained focus, he looked at Joana and then he looked down her bust and cleavage, his nose bled a little, and he looked even below, she seemed to have nice hips, a bit thick along the thighs to go with them, her dress didn't hide her figure much, and he muttered -\"Niiiiceeeee...\"- Before he even noticed Blake was there, he promptly threw one of his rings, hitting him between the eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT WAS THAT FOR?!\"- Gustave asked angrily, frustrated at being unable to rub his forehead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're just hopeless...\"- Blake said annoyed -\"Seriously, you wake up and the first thing you do is ogling the first girl you see?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, it was a nice sight after all the stuff we've been through lately...\"- Gustave replied, Joana blushed a bit at being called 'a nice sight' while Blake just facepalmed again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And then you hate it when we mock you for being a fire magician...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, that's how I was raised... And a good looking girl is a good looking girl...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The fact that this girl is big enough to eat you whole apparently went over your head...\"- Blake said and laughed a bit, although Joana gasped and pouted slightly, he noticed this and added -\"I was just making a point on the size difference... seriously, this guy would marry a broom if it wore a skirt...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand, Ayrton and Blake laughed, however Joana did not, as she didn't quite even know the stereotypes they were referencing, however, she noticed the other guy, Caesar, had woken up without saying anything and was just listening, then he spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... we're all screwed, right?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm afraid so, and in more ways than one...\"- Blake replied -\"Which reminds me... some time later today, they will have a giantess called Claire 'educate' you on stuff I can't really talk about... she's kinda crazy so be REAL careful, and if for any reason you see her turn around RUN LIKE DAMNED HELL!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... care to explain?\"- Ayrton asked a bit confused and scared by this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'll see for ourselves. Remember my words, I doubt I can go save any of you this time so I need you to stay alive...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Still, 'educate' us on what? We're not exactly illiterate...\"- Caesar wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, believe it, we ALL are illiterate on what she will teach you, but be very careful, honestly... all I can say is that, as far as I know, your ultimate fate will be to marry some of the giant women of this village to make babies...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WE WHAT?!\"- Ayrton was beyond baffled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm really sorry, but so far, there is no way to free you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But we're gonna DIE\"- Ayrton added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They believe you won't, since you were my mercenary teammates\"- Blake said -\"They think you're actually strong enough for it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyrton glanced at Joana -\"If there's any giant girl even bigger than her, we're done for...\"- She blushed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Regardless of size and complexion they're all obviously heavy. No offense...\"- Blake said, and Joana smiled -\"None taken, I get the point...\"-</span></div></div>",

I just came to see they were alright\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"O...k...\"- Karina was a bit surprised to see them NOT trying to escape -\"Anyway, I came here to explain you your current fate\"- She said to the guys<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We know\"- Ferdinand replied, sounding defeated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is insane! We're all going to die horribly, and even if we didn't I still don't think a human could produce hybrid offspring with a giant...\"- Ayrton protested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your friend here is the living proof that it's possible\"- Karina replied pointing at Blake, who facepalmed hard enough to be heard, and everyone except she and Joana exclaimed -\"Goddamnit!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, no offense, but I kinda hate your father so much right now...\"- Caesar said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I understand... by what I see, he was kinda crazy...\"- Blake said still facepalming<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, who's insane enough to have a child with a giant woman?\"- Ayrton complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You\"- Karina replied to them, and they all looked down in defeat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They didn't even cost money, why not let them go?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because they seem to be suitable candidates for interbreeding, Claire will ultimately test them but we're pretty sure they are strong enough\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually we're not, see? We're a bunch of vagabonds that do mercenary jobs. hell, I'm just skin and bone!\"- Ferdinand said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah we're poorly fed and we are not even full grown adults...\"- Ayrton added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Claire will decide. She'll come for you soon\"- Karina said and left, the guys shuddered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just remember what I told you and you'll be fine... and if she goes crazy, well, I believe you can still use your elemental magic\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know Claire is a bit strange, but, is she that bad?\"- Joana wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have no idea...\"- Blake sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and the door opened again, Claire walked inside, Ayrton, Ferdinand and Caesar were all terrified, however, Gustave was enjoying the sight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now that's a nicely sculpted girl\"- He said while the others including Blake facepalmed, and the ground shook more with each step she took<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, so, at least someone has good taste\"- She said with a smile, and gave them a sensual look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Gustave, I hate you\"- Ayrton said while having a sense of dread about this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So I get 4 men for myself, and I thought this would be a boring day\"- Claire said, not minding the fact that Joana was there and obviously heard as well, she also noticed Blake standing on Joana's breast, and giggled, but he gave her a 'Remember your damned promise' look, and she nodded to him once, but still licked her lips and watched Blake's friends<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you're coming with me, we have things to do\"- She dispelled the light threads and caught the 4 of them in her palm, it was shown that they were wrist and ankle cuffed with light just like Blake had been, she then walked back to her own room, leaving a baffled and somewhat worried Joana, while Blake just hoped they survived her antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire placed the 4 guys on her nightstand and without saying anything, she locked the door and took her clothes off, once again standing only in her underwear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh... so this is what he meant...' Ferdinand thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hell yeah!\"- Gustave said -\"You don't see many girls with that body!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Except this one is big enough to crush you under her foot and most likely not even feel it...\"- Ayrton said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled and walked closer to them -\"So, you have an idea of what you're here for?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I do, but I really hope I'm wrong\"- Ayrton said a bit defiantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know but count me in!\"- Gustave said, Ayrton managed to hit him with his restrained arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Keep behaving like that and you'll probably die!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, but I don't mean to kill any of you\"- Claire said taking a few steps closer to them, the ground shaking more with each step -\"At least not intentionally\"- She said licking her lips and bending over a bit so as to hover her large chest over them, casting a huge shadow over them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"See?\"- Ayrton said angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Still a fine way to die\"- Gustave said with a perverted smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is going to be a long day...\"- Caesar mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As you know, you're going to be given in marriage to some of our beautiful women, and given you're technically from another species, I'm here to try and educate you on how to behave with your wives\"- Claire said, standing back up, temporarily removing the immediate threat of crushing them with her chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I doubt seeing them in underwear on day one is happening\"- Caesar replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You are given a few days with your future wife for the two of you to get used to each other, and yes, she's kinda expected to have you explore her body...\"- Claire answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I like this culture... except maybe the giant part...\"- Gustave commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's other of the points I'll have to deal with, you must try to lose or decrease your fear of your future wife. I can't fully guarantee it but she might develop some feelings for you, and most likely you'll be trusting her with your life, so you must not fear her, even though the size is greatly different\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"YOU JUST FREAKING HOVERED YOUR CHEST OVER US AS IF YOU WERE TO CRUSH US!\"- Ayrton shouted angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But I didn't...\"- Claire said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate to say it, but she has a point\"- Caesar said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In any case...\"- Claire turned around -\"If I were to crush you, I'd do it my favorite way...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand remembered what Blake said about her turning around, and even though his wrists were restricted, he managed to pull the other 3 guys by their capes and ran to the side, aiming to jump to the bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- She glanced behind herself and noticed they were running, she laughed and walked in front of them, due to the nightstand being only at about her thigh height, they all saw her clearly wide hips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We run like damned hell, right?\"- Ayrton asked fearfully, quoting Blake, Ferdinand nodded and they all started running away, however, Claire caught them easily, 2 in each hand, and she brought them closer to her face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's wrong?\"- She asked faking sadness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We know what you were trying to do!\"- Caesar replied, Claire just smiled and kissed them one by one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You just have to start to appreciate a girl's sensuality\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I do!\"- Gustave said, and Caesar hit him in the head with his restrained arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were about to die you idiot!\"- He said angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're all amusing to watch, although not quite the same as your friend Blake...\"- Claire taunted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So he also went through your 'education'?\"- Ferdinand said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes. and unlike you, he was way more prudish, it was funny to make him blush, but you're all perverted in some way, I see that you must have had experience with women of your species already...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't\"- Ayrton said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, really? Then you're going to like this...\"- Claire said seductively and licked him specifically while sitting on her bed -\"In our culture, licking is just as common as kissing regarding affection to our husbands, so, you better get used to that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaesar and Ferdinand shuddered -\"No thanks, we get it...\"- while Gustave just smiled and got licked as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Seriously, he's hopeless...\"- Ayrton muttered while wiping his face clean<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least I enjoy this sexy girl's teachings\"- Gustave said, but it sounded more like he was thinking out loud<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sexy? You haven't even seen what's sexy\"- Claire said with a smile, and the guys minus Gustave facepalmed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"For the love of God, Ayrton, kill the idiot! He's going to have us all killed!\"- Ferdinand shouted from Claire's other hand, and then she brought them to her chest, hugging the 4 guys, 2 to each breast<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your future wives might be shy in varying degrees, but at some point they will do this to you as well, you must appreciate it as a warm affection gesture and not make them feel bad\"- Claire said still hugging them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And what makes you think we'll agree to make our supposed wife feel ok?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because if she doesn't want to marry you, you'll be given to someone else... and then there's a chance one of you lucky boys gets to be my husband...\"- Claire replied, and again, with the exception of Gustave, the others shuddered deeply -\"And, back to speaking of sexy, you still haven't see the best...\"- She released her hug and stood back up, she brought Gustave and Ayrton to the same hand Caesar and Ferdinand were in, and then she placed them behind her, on the bed, they all observed 2 giant craters which were obviously imprints of her gigantic behind, she dropped them on one of the imprints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Holy... hell...\"- Ayrton said after standing up, they were in the middle of just one imprint, it was very deep, and they could barely see its edges<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If this is what her butt does to the bed I seriously don't want to see more...\"- Caesar commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is like a sort of inverted hill... or like one of those craters the rocks that fall from the sky leave on the ground...\"- Ferdinand said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just... wow...\"- Gustave said, he was the only who didn't stand up, and was instead feeling the warmth left<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And that's just half of THIS\"- Claire said, pointing at her enormous butt, which towered above them</span></div></div>",

LOOK AT THE CRATER WE'RE IN! HALF OF HER BUTT IS ENOUGH TO CRUSH US TO PASTE!\"- Ayrton was really annoyed at Gustave's lack of common sense, and even though his ankles were cuffed, he still jumped and kicked him in the stomach, and the two started trying to fight each other despite their cuffs, and it looked rather comical, while Ferdinand facepalmed and Caesar tried to break the fight, and meanwhile Claire giggled and shook her hips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A 'nice big ass' you say? That's new... Blake's reaction was fear...\"- She said with a seductive tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's because Blake never had any experience with women, and never got into appreciating their beauty, he was more like a kid, all he cared about was adventure\"- Gustave said, leaving the others baffled <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I like getting complimented, and I believe you deserve a reward\"- Claire said and started lowering her butt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I knew this bastard would get us killed!\"- Ayrton tried to attack Gustave while he dodged and blocked as he could, Caesar was trying to break the fight, and Ferdinand was trying to get them to pay attention to the actual current danger, they all just noticed a huge shadow that covered all of the giant imprint they were in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Too...damn...late...\"- Ferdinand said as Claire's gigantic butt came closer to them, they all laid on the ground and closed their eyes, trying to anticipate getting crushed by a massive weight too great to even comprehend, they felt Claire's soft flesh on their backs and took one last breath, while they had random thoughts about their lives, their regrets, their good moments... A few tense seconds passed, and they could only feel Claire's soft flesh on their backs, and couldn't move, but they weren't crushed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How the...?\"- Ferdinand mumbled, and he heard Claire laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wish I could have seen your faces... well... at least I can feel one of yours...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand already knew, but he still turned to see that Gustave was laying face up unlike everyone else -\"This guy...\"- he muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you I'm not going to kill you... although, I could slip at any moment...\"- She laughed -\"However, no, you're not going to die under my butt, I promised your friend I wouldn't crush you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I just wonder what would have happened if Blake hadn't somehow made her do such a promise... maybe we'd all be already dead...' Ferdinand thought, and Claire stood back up, but when she did, Gustave got stuck to her cheek, she apparently noticed this, and wiggled her hips a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... did you enjoy your reward?\"- She asked and picked him up, he started taking deep breaths<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A bit, although it'd be much better if you were human sized...\"- Gustave said between breaths, Claire actually blushed and gently rubbed him on her butt for a few seconds before leaving him in the imprint with the rest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Keep on and you're going to end up dead\"- Ferdinand said annoyed to him, but he just had a goofy smile and a lost look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake was kinda right about his perversion\"- Caesar commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't mind, if he weren't provoking her into killing us!\"- Ferdinand said frustrated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're lucky on this one regard, it's highly doubtful you'll get to have your wives sit on you since you aren't hybrids...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good Lord... that means...\"- Ferdinand said with his eyes opened wide and his jaw dropped, Claire nodded -\"My god, if this is bad, Blake sure experienced hell...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"More like heaven, warm and soft heaven\"- Claire said, turning around again and patting her butt, Gustave watched it jiggle while the others shuddered -\"This would be a fairly nice place to put you in\"- She added -\"But humans are too fragile...\"- She sighed and gave them a seductive look again -\"Although, you can be brave and try\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand, Caesar and Ayrton immediately tackled Gustave and started hitting him as best as they could, Claire watched and laughed, but after about a minute, she hovered her butt over them, and its shadow alone intimidated them enough to stop at once. She picked them up and held them near her chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now, the most common things your future wives are going to do with you is have you lay or stand on their breasts or carry you around in their cleavage, it's very safe and it should feel nice for both...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't feel safe with a woman that almost crushed me to death with her gigantic butt\"- Ferdinand said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, so you want to go there instead?\"- Claire said again with a sensual touch to her voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...no...\"- Ferdinand said and remained silent, then he along Ayrton, Gustave and Caesar were dropped in Claire's massive cleavage, her breasts were to them 2 giant soft walls that surrounded them completely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And if you think that's big, remember that there is someplace even bigger in my body\"- Claire teased them and walked around a bit to try to get them used to normal movement, due to her threat, none of the guys attempted anything. although Gustave moved around to get comfortable himself <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You guys have to admit her attitude is kind of hot, she recognizes she has a big ass and is not ashamed of it, human ladies were way too worried about diets and stupid stuff...\"- He said relaxed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How can you possibly like something so big?\"- Ayrton wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe I just understand Blake's father... maybe his mother was a hot giant woman as well...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, that depends on your definition... Lady Lith is actually kinda thin and lightweight... not exactly voluptuous... but her face and hair are pretty...\"- Claire said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least he had the sense to try to get someone nowhere near as heavy...\"- Caesar muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This lady's extra weight is well distributed and looks fantastic\"- Gustave said, which again made Claire genuinely blush<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ayrton, remind me why are we not killing this guy already...\"- Ferdinand said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"First, we cannot move, and second, even if we did, we might end up you know where...\"- Ayrton replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I bet that wouldn't be so bad, it'd be just like here...\"- Gustave said with a smile, taunting them, but they knew better and resisted the urge to try and beat him down<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while, Claire took them out of her cleavage, laid on her bed and placed them on her tummy. All of them were having trouble standing up in this extremely soft skin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Finally, something not even this red haired idiot can like\"- Ayrton commented while trying not to sink deeper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What? That she has a tummy? That's kind of cute actually, it means that she's well fed, and that just explains how she has her awesome figure...\"- Gustave replied, laying on the soft skin and letting himself sink into it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...that's a new low...\"- Caesar said with a truly baffled expression, meanwhile Claire blushed even more intensely but didn't do anything to let the guys know, and even used a fan to cool down her face, she was blushing so much it was starting to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just... shut... up... before I-ACK!\"- Ferdinand tried to threaten Gustave but he tripped and fell face first on Claire's tummy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Relax and just enjoy it bro\"- Gustave said, and he even rolled a bit, falling into Claire's navel, which tickled her -\"I'm ok... this actually feels even better...\"- Claire was giggling and blushing harder, and her fan wasn't helping much, and then Gustave started tickling her belly button from the inside, making her laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... if he can get her to a good mood maybe she'll be merciful\"- Ayrton whispered to Ferdinand and Caesar, who nodded in agreement and decided to let Gustave keep on with his madness unless he provoked her to use her breasts or butt on them, however, Claire sat up, and the other 3 guys rolled straight into Claire's navel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, I got here first!\"- Gustave complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Merciful? You still think I'm being evil?\"- Claire said faking feeling offended<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...oh god... no...\"- Ferdinand muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If I were really not merciful, I would do something like this...\"- She fished the 4 guys out of her belly button, stood up and held them above her butt, then she picked Ayrton up and even though he screamed and tried to squirm free, with her other hand Claire shoved him inside her panties, between her monstrous butt cheeks. Even Gustave was baffled this time. She wiggled her hips to make her cheeks jiggle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"One small clench and your friend would die\"- Claire said with a teasing tone -\"Or I could leave him there, he would get lost fairly easily\"- Claire held them in front of her butt so they stared at it, and after roughly 2 minutes, she fished Ayrton out and placed him on her palm, he was breathing very heavily -\"See? You wouldn't even last too long in there...\"- She said, and then brought them around her waist, sat on the bed and placed them on her thigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"However... I also promised not to do that to you, because your friend Blake paid for your punishment in advance...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HE WHAT?\"- All of them shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He was sure at least one of you could make me angry, and after getting to know me deeply, he realized I could either sit on you all, or leave you inside my panties. I offered him to pay in advance for any punishment you guys would earn... and he did... he stayed between these lovely cheeks for 3 hours, I was the one who took him out because I was worried about killing the Princess' property, but he could have gone on if I hadn't stopped him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's friends all sat down in shock -\"3 hours... holy hell... Ayrton barely resisted 2 minutes...\"- They all muttered in disbelief</span></div></div>",

I tried more times than you can count, but IT DIDN'T WORK A SINGLE TIME... Also I was trying with women of my species...\"- Ferdinand replied frustrated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wasn't even trying, I guessed that was stuff to do for when we were older...\"- Ayrton said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I had an arranged marriage, and I was in a good relationship with that girl, but that was before my tribe was annihilated by the freaking Sand Bandits...\"- Caesar said, looking down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait a minute, your people too?\"- Gustave said, being serious for the first time so far -\"My family was destroyed by them!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They killed near everyone because we fought to death to preserve our stuff, most of which is historical, and they took it all to sell most likely... It didn't help that we were all Thunder Magicians and we are at disadvantage against Earth ones...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah... I... I didn't know...\"- Claire felt a bit guilty this time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know about the rest, but Thunder Magicians have existed for quite  a long time, and we've made an effort to preserve our history. There was a time we had a kingdom, or even a small empire, but that was centuries ago... Nowadays we lived as nomadic tribes... the case is, we still have things from those eras, and bandits deemed our things as valuable to steal, worth killing people over, and due to our code of honor, most of us fought to death... I did too, but my parents left me somewhere hidden while they continued to fight, by the time I woke up, everyone around was dead, all our tents destroyed, and everything else stolen...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's jaw dropped, and Caesar continued -\"All I had left was my personal weapon, my spear, and my father's chain whip, which he left in one of my pockets... other than that, I could only get a wine skin with water and some dried food, and started wandering around, with no real purpose anymore. That was wen I encountered you guys, with the exception of Gustave who joined us later... I had completely given up on everything...\"- Caesar laughed a bit -\"Blake is really something when he wants, he is pessimistic himself and doesn't value his life much, and the guy can still convince you that unlike him your own life is valuable and worth living... And given I had nothing better to do, I joined the mercenary squad, to, as he said, 'have adventures around the world and make some money while at it'...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaesar remembered the day a bit fondly despite the tragedy, before that, he believed life was already written by his ancestors, he would follow every rule, and do always according to what his elders deemed best, but ever since he joined Blake, he started getting the grasp  of independent thought, and living almost independently, only surrounded by trustworthy, although a bit quirky, friends -\"We are all orphans, which for most of the world means nobody cares what happens to us, that's why barely anyone objects to our being mercenaries, we share the same pain, even if we lived it differently, and together we move on... that's why freedom is so valuable to us, specially for Blake... I understand now that his pain is greater... he knows he's the fruit of a forbidden relationship since who knows when, a hybrid that doesn't fit in either world... and that any human who learned about it would want him dead, and you giants didn't treat him much better...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire felt even more guilty this time -\"I hadn't seen it that way...\"- she felt her own heart sink a bit, as she hadn't really considered any further implications of Blake being a hybrid beyond her theory of the discordance between human instinct and his hybrid nature -\"I admit that Karina buying him was probably a bad idea... but in all honesty, the Princess is nice, and I think she's starting to love him, so... maybe this is not that bad? Seriously...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He seemed to be feeling a bit better, I admit... I had never seen him without his hood...\"- Gustave commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"His eyes look a bit different when not covered by it, it helps him hide his emotions, and he's not fond of his scar either...\"- Ferdinand said -\"He sincerely believes he's like an abomination or something...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I saw him without the hood too, he looked cute, scar and all, and I think I got a hint of what you said, he believed nobody can love him...\"- Claire said, gigglign at the first part, but got serious at the last<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure you don't want him for yourself, huh?\"- Ferdinand asked in a tone that suggested he already knew the answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I knew from day one that he belonged to the Princess!\"- She replied with a faint blush, which only accentuated that she was a bit flustered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah but you apparently went full playful on him because you didn't have to worry he'd die so easily...\"- Ferdinand replied, laughing a bit in his insides, he wouldn't have believed they could have turned the situation around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe I did...\"- She said while giving them a teasing look -\"Well, he's literally the only hybrid left alive, it was a one time opportunity\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I seriously wonder if his father would have agreed to him being used as your and then the princess' plaything...\"- Ferdinand mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Given that he married one of us and they had a child, I would say he'd be ok with him being with the Princess. She really cares about him...\"- Claire said sincerely -\"Anyway, I didn't know the Sand Bandits were that kind of criminals, we thought they were just mercenaries for hire...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They are both, they usually do the jobs for rich and influential people, like killing certain targets, or acquiring slaves for sale...\"- Gustave said, with a hint of anger at the last bit -\"On their own, they can also target and kill people to rob them of whatever they have. I've heard they have even gone as far as destroying farms just to steal the food and livestock, and they kill everyone regardless...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe I should tell Karina not to hire them anymore...\"- Claire commented -\"Although Blake was pretty damn expensive because capturing him cost them the lives of 2 members...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, that was our hardest battle not counting giants...\"- Ayrton said scratching his head a bit -\"I knew Sand Bandits were powerful, but I had no idea they were that strong...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They freaking slaughtered my family, where everyone was a fire magician, and we had the elemental edge!\"- Gustave said angrily, red flames appeared shortly in his hands -\"They are monsters...\"-He said, looking down -\"We killed a lot of them but they did not care, they kept sacrificing their own members as long as that gave someone a chance to kill us...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What did your family even do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My family were successful riding cat breeders, but they also expanded thanks to their wealth and we had our own farm and our own livestock, we were able to sustain ourselves alone and still make a profit. Despite fire magic doesn't seem to have much use for stuff like this, we all worked hard. My father made us work hard to appreciate the effort and its subsequent reward... He was strict, but he was a fair man, always honoring his word, and my mother was just about the happiest person I know, she always received us with hugs and delicious food\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least you have no trouble forging tools, or even fixing them on the go\"- Ayrton laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're right, but outside that, we had to really work hard outside, either feeding the livestock, or working at the fields\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's a bit strange, your skin is white...\"- Claire commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My family's clothes are made of a special kind of silk, from something my parents called sapphire worms, it's extremely light, fresh and comfortable, and it also protects you nearly entirely from the sun\"- Gustave commented and pointed that he was wearing them right now, and took something out of his pocket and put it on his head -\"And with this turban, i was completely protected from the sun while outside\"- Gustave said, although the other guys thought it looked rather funny, he also took out a small bag from other of his pants' pockets -\"I managed to salvage these dried eggs\"- He showed everyone that they were small shiny blue spheres, they even looked like the colored glass little balls some kids played with -\"Since I've been a mercenary, I can't grow these up yet, but if I ever establish, this might help me a lot\"-</span></div></div>",

Also, the oldest clothes we've known seemed suited for a much colder place than here... But all that could be a myth or some legend... Anyway, sapphire worms are something we brought with us perhaps they were different when our ancestors first brought them, but since long ago they adapted to this weather, we use their silk for all of our clothing, it's really versatile\"- Claire explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now that you think about it... my parents never let me see the worms themselves... They said that until I were older...\"- Gustave muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sapphire worms are extremely rare to find outside our land, so, it's possible the bandits targeted that, and the wealth might have just been further reason to attack, I'm sorry, this doesn't help...\"- Claire said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's alright, knowing a bit more about this makes me feel a bit better, what's done can't be undone, but we can always learn, right?\"- Gustave looked up at Claire's face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's more human philosophy than ours... humans seem to be very fast learning and creative, but then again, most things seem better suited at your size\"- Claire smiled, it was true that giants didn't have the same drive to find new stuff as their own size, while advantageous, also limited the things they could do, as the obviously couldn't ride any kind of animal for better transportation, and subsequently they didn't have to enhance wheel based designs much more, and still, they managed to improve their lives with a few things like advanced plumbing and the use of ice magic to better conserve food, as well as orichalcum reinforcements for almost everything they used like tables, chairs, and the buildings themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, if you stay here, I could help you on raising those worms, although I doubt you'd be able to weave that much silk to make clothes for our people\"- Claire giggled -\"Don't worry, most of us know how to do it, even the Princess\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"One would think a princess wouldn't do any tasks...\"- Ferdinand commented -\"Isn't that against the nobility status itself?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She had way too much free time, and it's not like we can order not to learn whatever she wants, although Karina did once say that as a noble she shouldn't do those tasks, but she also felt nice to see the princess spending her time in something productive. She knows quite a lot of our culture, history, cooking, weaving and dress making...\"- Claire whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That kind of sounds like a really good wife... my last girlfriend couldn't cook even if her life depended on it\"- Gustave said with a small laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fire magicians are particularly picky with food, aren't they?\"- Caesar commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, when you had my mom's cooking every day for at least 10 years, most stuff feels off at best, and like garbage at worst...\"- Gustave replied -\"She was an extremely skilled fire magician, my father even called her a fire master... and not just for cooking, she took down at least 30 Sand Bandits alone until she got too exhausted...\"- Gustave remembered both things, the happy days with his mother lovingly cooking for when her husband and children came from working hard outside, and that fateful day the Bandits attacked them, she didn't want Gustave to fight them and she took on them by herself. After the battle, she was still alive, but too wounded to last for much longer, she was glad to know at least one of her children survived, and she left him her personal weapon to defend himself, a scimitar with a blackish silvery looking blade, its handle was a vibrant red, with gold plating and one large blue gem embedded in its center, and a few smaller ones of varied colors adorning the handle, she had told him it was something from his father's family that she got as a wedding gift, she wished him good luck, and hoped he would find some woman who could make him smile again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was seeing these memories in his head, he didn't realize tears were streaming down his eyes, everyone else was baffled, and Ferdinand put a hand on his shoulders -\"Are you okay?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I... just...\"- Gustave sobbed a little -\"I just remembered her... my mother...\"- His voice faltered, and he covered his face while sobbing almost silently, after about a minute, he wiped some of his tears and spoke -\"She fought those bastards to death, and still managed to live when I was looking for anyone... but she was far too wounded... she gave me her weapon, and her last wish was that I found a woman who could make me smile again...\"- Gustave's voice was starting to falter again -\"I... I think I failed her...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess that explains some things...\"- Ayrton mumbled -\"I'm sorry...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Haven't you heard what some tales say about buffoons? Those who can make others laugh often are unable to feel the same joy... It's true I pull a goofy act far more often than I should, but I can't be like Blake or you guys, If I were to just try and swallow all that pain, I'd probably go insane and do something like klll myself\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah, stop it right there... let's not do something crazy...\"- Ferdinand said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I just told you why I haven't...\"- Gustave said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A goofy act... I admit, not even I was quite sure... these guys all have issues to some degree... Maybe Karina was wrong to capture them...' Claire thought, and without warning she decided to pick them up, and kissed them all, but she kissed Gustave more times than the others, and also licked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What was that for?\"- Gustave said, a bit baffled by the apparent randomness of this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm guessing you all needed some affection to cheer up. And, as for your future wives, don't worry, I'll see that you only get picked by the nicest girls I know, or can find...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That... doesn't help much... but thanks\"- Gustave muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I still have a say on whether you guys get the princess' approval or not, and if I tell her that the prospective wife is not good, she won't approve, she also wants you to be in as good conditions as possible, although her reasons could be a bit different...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Didn't you say she was nice?\"- Ferdinand asked confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, I mean, she feels sympathy for you guys, but it's possible her main reason for seeing you're all ok is well, Blake... just my theory though...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"For someone without talent at courting women, you could say it's a bit impressive the first girl he gets is a princess...\"- Gustave said scratching his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The Princess is also the most beautiful among us by a long shot\"- Claire added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't think you'd admit someone existing with greater beauty than your own\"- Ferdinand said with a bit of irony<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm just being honest... in any case, the Princess already has her husband-to-be, so, she's out of this, which means I must be somewhere in the top list\"- Claire said with a giggle and tried to strike a pose<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... we get it...\"- Caesar said, facepalming<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... what are we going to do the rest of the day?\"- Ferdinand asked, with hopes of not being tortured being among his priorities<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm trying to get you used to the idea of being with a giant woman\"- Claire said -\"Ideally, they should care about you and should be far more gentle than I've been so far...\"- She picked them up and gently hugged them to her chest -\"You seriously can't complain about this\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's actually nice\"- Gustave commented, but Claire frowned a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, the act is over, isn't it?\"- She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... you misunderstood... It's true that I act a bit goofy like this, but what I've said, even with my stupid attitude has been true. And you are really pretty yourself, it's just that the size kind of turns your voluptuousness a bit dangerous...\"- He explained, which made Claire blush real hard and she stayed silent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Man, you finally broke her... or angered beyond belief...\"- Ferdinand whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I... I'm ok...\"- Claire took a deep breath and with some difficult returned to her flirty seductive attitude -\"You should be careful... I'm not responsible for what your future wife may do if you get her too flustered and or excited...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That sounds like a thinly veiled threat\"- Gustave laughed, and even patted Claire's breast lightly, she shuddered. She was obviously not entirely prepared for an instance where someone were to flirt back at her. With Blake, she was almost in full control, and even then, she was aware she couldn't awake Blake's deeper feelings anyway, so she was cheerful and playful that time. Still, she picked Gustave up and kissed him for a noticeable while before putting him back in her palm with the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm starting to see something going on in here...\"- Ferdinand mumbled, confused but also slightly amused by the irony</span></div></div>",

She playfully pushed him a bit deeper so he sank into her soft flesh and giggled -\"We should try to focus back on ourselves...\"- she said more thoughtfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I still feel bad for them...\"- Blake replied -\"They all probably had the idea of marrying a human woman at some point and have a family of their own, they weren't like me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not your fault\"- Blake said, still allowing Joana's finger to press him into her breast<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, it's because of my 18th birthday that they got you, and all of this started...\"- Joana said with some sadness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Listen, this is difficult to explain, and it'll probably sound wrong because I can't grasp my ideas properly, but, I don't regret meeting you despite all of this... I was a complete jerk to you since I arrived... anyone else would have had me executed already\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't see you as a complete jerk... even when you threatened me with your sword, you didn't really hurt me and all you wanted was to escape. I kinda felt the desperation in you -\"And you even came back to heal me after I broke my wrist when I fell from that cliff... I could never say you were a bad guy\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure you're a giant and not an angel in a really weird disguise?\"- Blake joked, and he was immediately brought to Joana's lips for a passionate kiss<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't recall having any feathery wings\"- Joana giggled, and licked him a few times before placing him back on one of her breasts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey... like I said, I don't regret at all meeting you, but, it's hard for me to get the idea that I'll no longer be the mercenary leader that was free to wander around...\"- Blake sighed with some sadness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you could show me that world you keep talking about...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Blake jumped from the surprise, and he tripped due to Joana's flesh being so soft, she giggled because the motion tickled her, but continued to speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"After the wedding, we can use the honeymoon as an excuse to take our time and travel around the world, you just guide me and I'll walk you there...\"- She said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's a pretty cool idea... wait, but I doubt Karina will allow it...\"- Blake was once again brought to Joana's face, but this time, she placed him on her nose so se stared at one of her beautiful hazel eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The moment we marry I'll be the Queen... and you will be the King. She will no longer have the authority to quite tell us what to do, she can suggest, but that's it, you and I decide what happens for the most part... We can't leave the place permanently but we can take our time traveling though\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So you're not just pretty but also smart, interesting...\"- Blake said, making Joana blush, she brought him to her lips again and she started kissing him lovingly for a few minutes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's a bit ironic you say that... the general consensus here is that civilization-wise, humans are the smarter ones, more creative, and even in limited conditions they can think up new ways to achieve what they want\"- She replied after stopping her kisses, allowing Blake to catch his breath -\"Still, I appreciate the compliment\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Some sons and daughters of noble people I worked for would've failed to fill your description of humans... several were spoiled, uncultured, and for the most part, true airheads with power... and any of them would be completely shamed by you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought I was rather heavy for human standards\"- Joana said, glancing down at her cleavage -\"I admit that if someone told me how much I weigh in human scale, I may get depressed\"- She said with a laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We may never know... but still, I'm pretty sure that if you were human sized, you'd completely embarrass those people in both beauty and intelligence... and as for your weight, nah, nevermind that, I never really knew why nobility got this stupid idea of being bone thin, when they are the ones who can actually eat well and even build up a strong physique, or a healthy one at least, you're fine yourself...\"- Blake said, and noticed Joana was blushing again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should stop with that before I accidentally smother you with too many kisses\"- She said giggling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, Karina says I can take it since I'm a hybrid...\"- Blake joked, for the first time about his hybrid nature. He was starting to realize that it was always a part of him, and that while this was not the ideal outcome, in this context, he wouldn't have to hold his strength back as much as when he lived among humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway, Karina would probably get super mad if I told her I accidentally killed my future husband, specially because she told me to be careful...\"- Joana added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She did? I thought she'd be happy if I got crushed or something\"- Blake raised an eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought that too, and she didn't seem to care earlier on, although she commented on you having been expensive, and then learning you were a hybrid, she deemed you as more valuable and exotic... but she told me about being careful and gentle 2 days ago while you were with Claire. She's actually grateful for you saving her life, and she sees you as a honorable warrior, worthy of becoming a noble... well, those were her words... and she bopped me in the head a few times to drive her point of me being very careful and also mindful of well, my physical size... Just don't tell her, she's a bit proud to admit it to you, but I'm telling you so you know\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Understood...\"- Blake said, but he thought 'Still, not letting my friends go just to use them for breeding seems a bit harsh... I just don't understand exactly how giants think, Joana is the only one who is consistent with human morals...' He then snapped out of it as he noticed Joana's eye focused on him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What were you thinking?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"To be honest, I was just thinking over that I don't get all the concepts of your culture, basically I don't quite understand entirely how giants think, and the only one who is consistent with human morals is you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's being the quirky one among my people for you\"- Joana laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'd have no problem dealing with humans or their society, except for the part where they fear anything different, and these days most people believe giants to be extinct, or to have never existed at all, or that they were legends and myths that were ancient lessons about something like wild beasts or excessive power...\"- Blake said -\"I didn't even know giants existed, although I had seen some old drawings in books where humans were fighting seemingly taller humans who wore slightly more primitive clothing, but I thought it referred to nomadic clans\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, now you know I exist\"- Joana said sweetly, she placed Blake on her breast once again -\"So... do you think we might have problems if we visit places during our honeymoon?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No if you follow my plan. Basically, you'd have to wait a decent distance away, while I go to the city or town to try and inform the people, we'd be going to places I worked at previously, so, they should believe me. Also, it's possible that arriving as a new foreign king might just help a bit more\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So you're starting to like the idea\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just seeing the good side of the current circumstances\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure you're not marrying me for the crown?\"- Joana joked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nah, to be honest I didn't care you were the princess, knowing you as a person is what was worth it, you could have been anything, a farm girl, a milk maid, a servant or anything...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But they wouldn't have forced you if I weren't the princess\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe you're right, but the world is full of surprises, anything can literally happen, if what you said about us being meant to be together is true, maybe we would have met in some other way... Hell, who knows, once one of the counts I worked for, who was one of those guys who studies the stars and the planets said that there might be infinite worlds besides our own, and there could be infinite versions of ourselves, we could have met in literally every possible way, maybe there is one world were you're not even a giant... who knows... the case is, well, this was our world's way, might as well accept it by this point... even though that means my wife is taller than some of the greatest castles I've seen\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake noticed Joana staring at him again -\"I warned you...\"- She said before picking him up yet again to kiss him repeatedly until who knows when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Claire and Blake's friends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe behaved gentle with them, and tried to demonstrate the affection their future giant wives would, however Gustave kept flirting with her and she blushed increasingly every time. She also did the same thing of bathing with them while wearing her underwear, after they finished...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, it's getting late, and I need you to wake up full of energy for tomorrow, but, you can use up whatever energy you have left today, so, how about giving me a good back massage?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If we get to massage your big butt it's a deal\"- Gustave said while the others were tempted to beat him up, Claire giggled and put the other three to start massaging from her shoulders and neck and down, while she placed Gustave on one of her cheeks and nodded while winking...</span></div></div>",

I feel really sorry for Blake...\"- Ferdinand commented, just baffled at trying to process these notions, he also was amazed at Blake's own brave to face this kind of things, like spending 3 hours in Claire's enormous butt, or just spending any time with the princess, whose figure was much bigger and probably weighed significantly even more -\"Maybe, just maybe, Blake might get used to this stuff easier than us, if he's really half giant...\"- he muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I believe that too by this point, but earlier, it was the opposite, Blake triggered the same fears as you despite his body being able to take it, being a hybrid probably messed a bit with his mind, and only now he's starting to get the hang of it\"- Claire commented -\"Also, I didn't expect my cleavage could hide all of you perfectly, but it's nice to know\"- Claire giggled, and gently pushed her breasts together just barely -\"That's one of the type of hugs your future wives might give you, don't freak out\"- She quickly let go and said goodnight to them, put out the candles and closed her eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit earlier, in Joana's room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's getting late... we should take  a bath...\"- Joana said, while Blake was laying relaxed on her left breast<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... what?!\"- Blake jumped in surprise, but, forgetting his location, only made him bounce a few times on Joana's soft skin, she giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, we take one or two baths a day, depending on weather, and at least before going to sleep...\"- Joana explained, but realized this was not what freaked Blake out -\"If you bathed with Claire the last 2 nights, what's the problem this time?\"- For the first time, Blake perceived a hint of what could be jealousy in Joana's voice, he gulped hard. he was brought up to Joana's lips and she kissed him and gave him a sweet look -\"I'm sorry, I didn't want to scare you... However, I still have a point\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh.. alright... just let's do it and don't remind me much of it...\"- Blake shuddered, Joana giggled again, and walked with him in her palm to her personal bathroom, it was even bigger and more luxurious than Claire's, understandable, given she is the princess after all, and it smelled of flowery perfume -\"I love these candles with flower oils\"- Joana said happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Amazing...\"- Blake commented, also enjoying the scent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Had you never seen something like this before?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not really, I knew nobility had luxurious bathrooms but I never got to even see any of them... it would have been creepy if I did anyway...\"- Blake said with a laugh, but Joana was a bit confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh, how did you bathe then?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In rivers, or lakes... and a few times with rain water, like about everyone else\"- Blake replied, still laughing, but noticed Joana's expression<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorry... I shouldn't have asked...\"- She said looking away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not resentful at that, it was the life of pretty much a peasant, but at least I also got to go on several adventures, and some of these times bathing was a relief after a tough day, and even the rain was a blessing during hot days... I don't really hate that life, I also ate dried or stale bread for more times than I can count, and I'm not bitter at it, I also have slept only in two ways, either on a tree's branch, or back when I lived with my grandma, in a sort of hanging net called a hammock\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, there's a new way for you to sleep tonight\"- Joana said with a flirty tone and glanced at her cleavage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Yeah... I guess...\"- Blake muttered, still a bit intimidated by Joana's bust size, even though he had already been inside of it, and even dove in for his clothes some hours ago. He was a bit lost on these thoughts so he didn't realize when Joana got in the water and placed him in the bath tub as well (previously to this, he had absent mindedly taken off his shirt and threw it to one of the corners, as he'd pick it up after bathing to wash it), floating in front of her giant chest, it was just then that Blake noticed that she wasn't wearing her bra...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"J-Joana...?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"W-w-here's your underwear?\"- Blake asked after gulping hard, and stuttered a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In the dirty clothes basket, why?\"- She noticed that Blake was becoming redder and redder, and he faced away -\"Is something wrong?\"- But Blake didn't answer, and remembered Claire actually told her this, that Joana might bathe with him and not wear any clothes. Confused, she picked him up and put him between her breasts, which made Blake blush even more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Claire was wearing her underwear during our bath...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh...\"- Joana blushed, understanding Blake this time -\"Well, most of me is underwater, it's not like you can even look at anything even if you wanted\"- She giggled -\"In any case, I didn't have cloth covering the part of my breasts you were inside of... so, you've kinda already felt just my skin alone...\"- She said with a slightly flirty tone while blushing at the same time, and brought Blake to her lips once again for a long, passionate kiss -\"Just relax, I'm not even mad at you\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said, placing Blake once again in her cleavage and started to wash herself using the bar of soap, Blake didn't want to bother her anymore so, instead of asking her for some soap, he just took from the foam around him and used it on himself, Joana noticed this and thought it was cute, and they continued to bathe, and Blake burrowed a bit deeper in her cleavage when she stood up to wash more of herself. She also thought of Blake's reaction as cute as well, because he still tried to not behave like a pervert with her, and because she enjoyed feeling Blake go deeper into her cleavage for protection, it made her feel good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished and washed herself with the water, and Blake did the same, she left him on the tub to wash his shirt, and she walked to her room for clothes to change, the ground shaking with every step of hers made Blake look towards her direction instinctively, and he saw her walking towards her drawer to put on some panties, he was both surprised and freaked out at seeing her practically nude, and had to slap himself hard to knock himself back into sense and focus back on washing his shirt, while trying not to think anything weird anymore. He finished washing his shirt, and dried it quickly using a weak light beam, and put it back on, Joana came back for him with white underwear this time, and matching transparent white stockings and garters, however, he tried not to look at her too much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you that you can look\"- Joana said sweetly and picked him up -\"Well, I guess I shouldn't ask much more from you for just one day, we have still 4 more anyway\"- She placed him on her shoulder and gave him one of her hair locks for him to hang onto -\"I guessed you'd appreciate taking a break from my cleavage, but I'd like you to sleep there\"- She then started walking, and she didn't realize that her recently washed hair was slippery despite being dry, and Blake couldn't help but slide down her arm, he failed to hang onto her bra and the next thing he could grip would be her panties, her skin was too smooth and slightly slippery, so  when he slid by her panties, he got a desperate grip on her waistband, and took a breath of relief as Joana kept walking towards her bed. He was next to Joana's right hip, and he noticed the sheer size of one of her thighs alone... it was true he was small in comparison to these giants, but still, Joana had rather fleshy thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I just hope she doesn't use them to crush me somehow...' He thought while swaying along Joana's hips. When she arrived at her bed, she noticed Blake wasn't on her shoulder anymore, and started looking around, she found him quickly, hanging on her panties' waistband, just next to her right hip, she smiled -\"Feeling a bit more adventurous?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This was an accident...\"- Blake said a bit annoyed, and Joana picked him up, laid on her bed but still held him on her palm -\"Well, now that you had a look at my thighs, what do you think?\"- She placed Blake on her lap, and he sunk slightly between both thighs, he walked to the right one, and Joana raised the left one to give Blake another look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They are big...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Too much meat?\"- Joana said jokingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, it looks good on you\"- Blake replied blushing...</span></div></div>",

Blake felt a little cold so he burrowed a bit deeper into Joana's massive cleavage, and had to admit that as much as he was nervous and blushed, her soft kin was also nicely warm and felt just way too good 'I hope I don't feel like not getting out anymore...' He thought as a joke and laughed, eventually he too fell asleep, lulled by Joana's gentle, yet powerful heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana woke up, and noticed Blake had moved deeper into her cleavage, but was breathing fine, she slowly fished him out of there and kissed him, he woke up groggily -\"Had a nice sleep?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, but waking up sucks\"- Blake replied and yawned -\"Although that's a much nicer way to wake up than with some loud bird, or the sunlight on my eyes...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I'll head for the kitchen for some breakfast, just enjoy the ride\"- Joana said with a sweet smile and put him back in her cleavage, then she put some clothes on and went downstairs to the kitchen, once there, however, Joana felt she needed to go to the bathroom so she left Blake on the table and told him she'd be right back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake just sat on the table, bored, while also taking his time to fully wake up, as riding in Joana's warm and soft cleavage kept his sleepy state for longer, however, he felt the ground shake, but not as much as when Joana walked, so, it was someone else, when he observed a silhouette from the corner of his eye that he already recognized, he sighed in annoyance, not even bothering to directly look up at her -\"Well, if it's my favorite hybrid...\"- Claire said seductively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"3 questions, where are my friends? did you sit on them? and why you even call me your favorite if I'm the only one in existence as far as we know?\"- Blake said rather flatly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your friends are currently sleeping on my bed, taking a break from my beauty\"- Claire answered while showing off her hips -\"Second, I was tempted to, but I didn't... and third, well, you're cute in your own way...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...alright...\"- Blake answered, again, not even bothering to look at her, she pouted slightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, do you think I'm a seductive maid?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What kind of question is even that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you know... I heard that sometimes, some kings in the past had at least one maid... for when the Queen wouldn't give them what they want...\"- Claire said as she walked closer to Blake and turned around, with her giant butt towering from above, he only reacted when he noticed the large shadow that suddenly covered him, and she continued to speak -\"...a maid whose body the king couldn't just resist...\"- Before he could stand up and dash away, Claire's immense butt descended on him -\"And well, you'll be king soon...\"- Blake protested but was too muffled, and Claire giggled and wiggled her butt on the table -\"Didn't you miss this anyway?\"- She stood up, and once again Blake was stuck to her cheek, he had tried to lift her but Claire's constant wiggling made it very difficult for him. Just to be less noticeable, she sat on a chair and continued to rub her butt on Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm feeling really tempted to take you back to my 'pillows' \"- Claire teased, and felt Blake lifting her up -\"Maybe you need a couple more nights to sleep between them\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know what the hell got into you, but the answer is no... Even a forced marriage is still a serious thing, and I don't really intend on breaking that vow, ever... besides, Joana doesn't deserve to be hurt like that\"- He said while trying to throw her off himself, however, Claire just stood up slightly and sat back down, catching him between both cheeks, unlike last time, and she giggled -\"I don't think you can keep saying 'no' to this butt when it's so close to you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Believe it when I say NO is NO... I WON'T DO THIS!\"- Blake replied, trying to get out from under her, and he almost managed to do so, but Claire sat up and back down just to smother him once again under one of her cheeks, and when he tried to lift her up, Joana came back to the table, she greeted Claire, and promptly wondered about Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know, your majesty, maybe he left for something?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I asked him to wait...\"- Joana replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe he'll come back later...\"- Claire said and stood up -\"I have some things to do, Princess, but if you need me just call me\"- She turned around to leave<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Claire...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why is Blake in your butt...?\"- She asked with subtle anger in her voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He is?\"- She faked surprise -\"Blake, you naughty boy, were you waiting at my chair for this?\"- She said wiggling her hips, while Blake pulled himself apart, and jumped off to the chair, and from there to the table<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know, maybe he likes me... or is looking for something you don't have, or won't give him...\"- Claire said smugly, Joana glanced at Blake, then down at her own hips, and she just said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No... just... no... anyway, he doesn't look like he wanted to... But just in case, Blake, don't ever try that on my chair...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell?\"- Blake said angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can go\"- Joana said to Claire and she left, swaying her hips and looked briefly back at Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Seriously, you believe me to be that stupid?\"- Blake said to Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No\"- She laughed a bit -\"I knew Claire was lying from the start, and I'm guessing it's one of her weird tests... maybe she was testing you to find if you'd be a good husband...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And where did you even get that idea?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I heard her conversation with you...\"- Joana said blushing a bit, and brought him to her lips -\"I'm really proud of you\"- She kissed him passionately, not really minding that the servants glanced at this -\"But just in case... seriously, don't EVER think of hanging out at my chair, I consider myself a bit clumsy or distracted, and crushing my husband is about the last thing I want to do...\"- Joana said seriously, but then she added -\"Specially at breakfast time\"- her tone was more cheerful this time, and both laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It comes in handy that I don't even drink any alcohol\"- Blake replied, and they resumed normal talking, they had their breakfast served as well as a nice cup of cold milk chocolate, which Blake was already very fond of<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... how can I even drink this time?\"- Blake wondered, and Joana facepalmed hard, however, she had a servant bring her a spoon and just filled it less than halfway with some of the milk -\"This is a temporary solution, I hope it doesn't offend you... just remember to buy human stuff when we go on our honeymoon though\"- Joana whispered the last part, and despite the implications, Blake had to smile, Joana looked just so happy and cheerful that he couldn't just ruin her mood<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I've drank water straight from rivers or lakes sometimes, at least this is a silver spoon... a GIANT silver spoon\"- Blake joked -\"Classy in a strange way...\"- Blake then stared at the food, it was something he had never seen before, it resembled a sort of flat bread his grandma made, but the one he remembered was much thinner even in proportion, and was more of an edible utensil to eat with. This one smelled of sugar and milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Never had seen a pancake either?\"- Joana asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not quite. My grandma did a similar flat bread, but with corn, and it was more of something to eat other stuff with. I admit I wasn't too fond of it... but this looks like something only a court chef would make\"- Blake said, and he could swear he heard some of the servants in charge of cooking giggle -\"So, I assume this is some sort of sweet food, right?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana nodded -\"Even more when you add honey on top of it\"- She grabbed a small jar and poured honey on top of said pancakes -\"That's how it's eaten\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Finally something I'm familiar with... me and my friends have sometimes gone on missions with honey only as fuel, I was also taught to treat wounds with it. Really good stuff\"- Blake said with a laugh, but upon observing the pancakes, he guessed it would have been more appropriate to use something like a fork to eat with, but then again, this wasn't the culture he knew, so, he looked at Joana and she smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Go ahead\"- </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About 10 days earlier, outside Kildevar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mysterious man, covered by a black hooded cloak wandered around the forest, he walked to where the battle between the Sand Bandits and Blake's mercenary squad took place. He observed the two dead Bandits, and also noticed the damage in the terrain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Pretty intense conflict... to think there's anyone who can put up this kind of fight to trained professional assassins...\"- He muttered as he crouched, he recognized the marks of lightning attacks, as well as the faint lines from what was most likely air magic, and he also noticed some parts of the ground were scorched<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lightning, Air, Fire... interesting...\"- He mumbled, and stood up, then he observed a bunch of really large craters, and in one of them, rests of quartz chains and a rock coffin -\"This looks like someone broke through this thing...\"- He looked around at the crater -\"I don't think the Bandits did these...\"- He then observed marks in the ground -\"This looks like the marks from shockwaves from someone with exceptional strength... or a highly skilled self enhancing magician...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then closed his eyes, and observed the same landscape as if they were open, but in black and white for the most part, and he could see the lingering aura of the different types of elemental magic used, a shining blue for lighting, fiery red for fire, brown in varying tones for Earth, and a faint sky blue for air, he observed remains of bluish dark magic, and reddish one near the craters and the shockwaves -\"Dark magic, at least two users...\"- He muttered, but then he gasped when he also noticed traces of golden aura -\"Light magic?\"- It lingered in the same places as the reddish dark magic aura -\"Since there are no traces of giants in here... I might have a good guess at this...\"- The man then opened his eyes and decided to head into the town...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being covered by a cloak, he didn't seem to stand out, and he walked quietly to the local tavern, assuming it'd be a gathering place for various kinds of people, and hopefully someone could give him any leads. He pushed his hood back as he entered the bar and politely greeted the barkeeper. He asked for one glass of beer and got quickly served, he drank slowly, he observed the barkeeper attend other people, and when he was done, he spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Excuse me, barkeeper. I'm not from this town, but I happened to walk by the forest outside the town as I came, and I couldn't help but notice what looked like a battle zone, looked pretty intense, do you have any idea what happened?\"- Despite his polite tone and that he tried to sound discrete, the chatter going around suddenly stopped, and there was a complete silence for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry... I'm just a vagabond writer, looking to collect stories for my book\"- He said, laughing a bit in a casual manner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Listen... you may not believe it, but that was a battle between the infamous Sand Bandits and our local mercenary squad...\"- The barkeeper said after looking around, making sure there were no Elites around -\"This town is currently under vigilance by the Royal Elites, and I don't think they'd take it too well to someone asking questions...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think it's alright, Thomas\"- An older man said from the other side of the bar -\"Elites aren't allowed to come to somewhere like this during work hours...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As I told you, I'm a harmless old man who just wanders around anyway, looking for stuff to write, I couldn't be any more dangerous than one of such guys...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barkeeper laughed heartily -\"Old man? You look no older than 20...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's just say I'm a bit older than that, but that's besides the point...\"- The man continued to drink his beer -\"...So, how come this town had mercenaries capable of fighting off the Bandits?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We don't really know where they came from... a bunch of kids, hey, how long ago was that, Albert?\"- The barkeeper said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think it was 2 years ago, could be 3...\"- The older man that had spoken before replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, yeah, they came 2 or 3 years ago offering their services as a mercenary squad, I admit, it was a bit weird to see those 13 or 14 years old taking on dangerous criminals and hunting beasts, but they proved to be really strong, and our duke hired them, not just for sporadic jobs, but to stay and serve as a protective force...\"-  The barkeeper then leaned to whisper -\"To be honest, they were far more reliable than the Royal Army\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They also were much less greedy\"- Another man said, this one was corpulent, and had strong arms, as well as short black hair and a thick yet trimmed mustache, he lifted his shirt a bit to reveal a faint stab wound's mark -\"I was robbed by some bastard with a knife yesterday...\"- He said, letting his shirt fall back into place<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That wound looks like it healed long ago\"- The man said, and sipped his beer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The leader of the mercenaries was walking around the house roofs and saw it happen, he rushed after him and used magic ropes made of golden light, and he came right back at me, he chanted something and healed the wound in a few seconds, he also brought me more  money than the thief had taken from me, and when I told him to keep it as a reward, he said I needed it more because I work hard and have a family, and he left...\"- The man laughed -\"It's strangely moving in its own way that a youngster could think like that. That guy had to be 15 or 16 at most...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think I heard him once say he was 17\"- The barkeeper added -\"Yeah, he's saved people here and there, and he can heal wounds with warm magic, but can also fight with golden beams, he said he was a Light magician, but, I don't remember ever hearing of one such before\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He also has this shiny black sword that doesn't ever dull, and has sometimes even cut through stone. I don't know what smith gave him that sword, but it must be pretty amazing. I once had a look at it, as I'm a smith myself, but I had never seen such a skillfully made weapon. Maybe it was made with that thunderbolt iron some people talk about\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, the mercenary leader is a powerful light magician as well as a skilled swordsman? Sounds good. And I take it that he and his squad were sent to fight the Bandits?\"- The man said, writing some notes in a small notebook<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually, they were hanging out at the forest, the duke gave them a day off, and i's more like they intercepted them, because maybe those bastards were heading for our town. I don't know the details, but the ground shook several times and quite violently, it must have been an incredible fight to see\"- The barkeeper said -\"However, it seems those bandits were worse than we expected...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How so?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We all saw an immense pillar of dark energy that rose from the ground, it even blocked the sun for a short while... That's why the duke had to call in the Royal Elites, if there's a dark magician alive and wants trouble, they have to hunt him down for good...\"- The barkeeper added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, I too heard bad stuff about dark magicians. Something about being people corrupted by an immense power, once threatened the kingdom but were defeated and supposedly destroyed by the King and his army\"- The smith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And where are the local heroes today? An interview would be nice, to get some more from a first hand perspective\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They went missing... nobody knows what happened, and in fact we were all discussing it yesterday... but the most consistent theory so far is that the Bandits had reinforcements and just overwhelmed them when they were exhausted, and afterwards, nobody can know... the fate of those captured by the bandits is maybe worse than death...\"- The barkeeper said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There are only 2 corpses belonging to Bandits, but no rests were left of the mercenaries, so, it really looks more like they got captured rather than killed...\"- The smith sighed sadly -\"I hate it when bad things happen to good people, those kids were good at heart! They were hard working and were making a living by keeping everyone else safe!\"- He slammed his fists on the bar, shaking it a little -\"And here we are, all adult, fully grown men, going about with our lives as if nothing happened!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know very well we can't come even close to fight the Bandits\"- The barkeeper said, putting a hand on the smith's shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We should tell the Royal Army to give chase to those bastards, and hopefully rescue the youngsters, those stuck up good for nothing highly paid excuse of soldiers should do their goddamn work for once!\"- The smith added, still angry but calming down a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's up to the duke to handle the current situation, he asked us to be discrete about it...\"- The barkeeper said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... so, these mercenary young were captured by the Bandits after putting up an incredible fight... Not quite what I expected but better than nothing...\"- The man said, finishing to write and putting the notebook and pencil in one of his pants' pockets<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're a writer, right? Please, let people of other places know about this, maybe with more popular support we can have those Bandits hunted down for good!\"- The smith said, and the man put his hood back on, and smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll see what I can do...\"- He finished his beer and walked out of the bar...</span></div></div>",

I thought you wanted to have a girlfriend before the sudden marriage, maybe these days are still a short time, but, it's something...\"- Joana added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe you're right... but I'm not used to being indoors for long... I would've liked to have something else to do today\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe we'll think of something for later, but for now, I think you already have an appointment, young sir...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Blake was entirely caught off guard as Joana playfully let him slide down her cleavage -\"Next time I want to have a word with whoever manages my appointments...\"- Blake said with fake anger, and Joana just giggled and pushed him deeper into her cleavage with a finger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Claire's room... For most of the day, she has kept the guys inside her cleavage, and has blushed from time to time with Gustave's flirting. Her little experiment with Blake had a dual purpose, she confirmed that Blake would be a reliable husband, and also confirmed that Blake didn't particularly spark anything in herself, it was just the idea of using her butt on a human in a playful manner. Once she was done with her tasks, she allowed the guys to stay on her bed while she bathed and afterwards had them bathe on their own as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you've spent already a night with me, and a near full day, do you feel you're ready?\"- She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, we know some cultural bits of your people, but there is no way to be prepared for such a thing! I wanted to have a normal family at some point... in the far future...\"- Ayrton answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have confirmed yourself that we aren't exactly on Blake's league in regards to physical durability, why risk our lives when we have done nothing more than trying to rescue a friend?\"- Ferdinand said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The law is the law, sadly, the last King and Queen left as an imperative to ensure we wouldn't go extinct at all costs...\"- Claire sighed -\"Maybe the Princess' quirkiness has spread to me, or maybe it's because technically I'm half human, but I feel like we should let you go too...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait what? Half-human?\"- Caesar asked in disbelief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes... Purebred giants are white with either light brown, red or blonde hair, like Karina or the Princess... as you see, my skin is fair but not quite the same tone, and my hair s black, and these are not the eyes of a pure giant either\"- Claire replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Still nice...\"- Gustave mumbled, and Claire giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even if I'm not a purebred giant, you have to admit I have an amazing body, don't I?\"- She added striking a pose<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"- Ayrton, Ferdinand and Caesar all hesitated to answer, while Gustave nodded, and she smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In any case, yes, my father was a human... a water magician actually...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Was?\"- Ferdinand asked sincerely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He along the other men, and nearly all of the hybrids, together with the Dark Magician, were to be destroyed by the King and his Royal Army, but they wouldn't go down without a fight. They had a last stand somewhere not too far from here, but as we rarely go out of the village ever anymore, I don't know exactly why, but yeah. they all died... and from what I heard, Blake's father was leading that battle, and he met the same fate...\"- Claire explained -\"Even if they lost, the King never learned our village's location, preventing us from being attacked and most likely get destroyed, with all the men dead and many babies to take care of, we would've probably lost rather quickly, and for that, their sacrifice will be always remembered\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When I couldn't feel any worse about that...\"- Ferdinand sighed, but he started seeing the point of these giants as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know this is far from being the ideal outcome, but it's what there is as of now... You can try and be rejected by every single lady, but I have no idea what they'd do with you afterwards. My advice would be to try and get a good wife you can bond with in a more personal level. Unlike your friend Blake you have more than one chance, he was to be with the Princess and that's it, whether she treated him well or not wouldn't have mattered to Karina or the others...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least he got lucky on the first try\"- Ferdinand laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As weird as it sounds, I think he deserved it... as in, even within these rather ugly circumstances, he found a girl who finally loved him... I don't know all the details but I think it's obvious Blake carries the death of his father over his shoulders, and has lived a rather tough life...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"His grandma too... she raised both him and myself... and she died to save us from an angry mob that wanted to kill the last hybrid..\"- Ferdinand added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, there's a chance to be happy right there...\"- Claire then whispered -\"Now that I think of it, maybe you guys can get off the hook, when Blake marries the princess, he will be our King. I don't know for sure but there would be little to prevent him from freeing you guys\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The question would be what to do if that happens...\"- Ayrton said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh? Don't you all to go and be free out of here? among your own species?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're kind of outcasts even among our own...\"- Caesar commented -\"Orphans who work as mercenaries aren't precisely stuff people normally care about...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There was the oath too...\"- Ayrton commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"An oath?\"- Claire was surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We swore, over Blake's sword, and with the full Moon as witness, that we'd be friends for life, together until the end of our own lives, working together, sharing our pain, but also our joy, working hard and also getting the reward. Friends, brothers from different mothers, joined by our own blood and sweat...\"- Ferdinand said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was even our idea, Blake himself thought we were free to leave, but we didn't really have anywhere to go, nor people to go to, and being friends, we also became a sort of family ourselves\"- Ayrton commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was beautiful...\"- Claire said, her voice faltered faintly -\"But, Blake can't leave... what will you do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If he's your King, he'll also be our King, and loyal knights won't leave their King, right?\"- Ayrton said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That sounds a bit like some self-promotion\"- Ferdinand laughed -\"From mere peasants that fight as mercenaries, to knights for a King...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't think any of our names would sound bad with Sir added to them\"- Caesar joked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't have thought you guys would throw your freedom away when there's still a chance...\"- Claire said a bit confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We told you of our oath, we're together until the end. If Blake stays, we stay\"- Ayrton said more cheerfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not like we really have anything else to do anyway, it's either stay with our friends and face whatever challenges life throws at us, or wander around aimlessly again, on our own, alone...\"- Gustave said -\"And that''t without mentioning that we'd be missing some lovely sights...\"- The 3 other guys facepalmed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You just ruined the moment...\"- They said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway, now that I think of it... if Blake was frustrated with the death of his parents, why isn't he all about seeing his mother again?\"- Ferdinand wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"First, he doesn't seem to like much being a hybrid, so, his mother being a giant was quite a disappointment for him, and because she agreed to the marriage with the Princess, I think he hates her...\"- Claire replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh...\"- Ferdinand said awkwardly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the talk continued on Claire trying to explain them more of giantess' affection and did some rather bold demonstrations with them while teasing them the whole time, of course, only Gustave seemed to enjoy it. Back to Joana's room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was kissing and licking Blake slowly and lovingly, and set him in front oh herself, as she was laying on her stomach on the bed -\"So... have you thought about anything?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"To be honest, I enjoy your kisses by this point, but, I still feel bad about not being able to help my friends... hey, wait... if I become King, and with your approval as well, couldn't I have them released?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana gasped -\"I didn't think of that... It's probable you can\"- She said gladly, and lowered her head so her mouth was closer to Blake -\"So, can I kiss you without you thinking of other stuff?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why the urge to kiss me so much lately?\"- Blake jokingly wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't have an exact answer, I just feel like that, and I don't think I'd stop if I didn't worry about you suffocating\"- Joana giggled, and slowly licked him -\"Is there anything better to do anyway?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake walked closer to her lips and kissed the lower one himself, Joana blushed a bit and just started kissing him again, however she remembered -\"We could go see your cat, I heard she's okay...\"- She added, and, anticipating her, Blake promptly walked into her cleavage on his own...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joana got up and put some clothes on to go downstairs, and check on Tabitha, she was left in the care of girls trained in healing, both with magic and herbs, although they were refraining from using magic before fully checking the damage, they had her float in a cup filled with water infused with healing herbs and used a very slow spell to heal along the liquid. They were  a bit surprised when Joana walked into the room they were, they greeted her, and Joana smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, the cat's owner has come to check on her...\"- She said, and fished Blake out of her cleavage, he jumped from her hand to the table, and Tabitha immediately jumped out of the cup and started purring, rubbing her head against her master, Blake petted her gently and scratched her ears<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"All wounds are closed but we weren't sure yet if internal damage was healed...\"- One of the healing girls said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She doesn't seem to have any trouble, in any case, it's not like she'll be fighting for a while... Thank you, by the way\"- Blake answered and continued to pet Tabitha, he looked at Joana -\"My friends often joked about me being married to this cat, but the truth is she's more like the daughter I don't have\"- he said with a laugh, and Tabitha licked his hand, but afterwards, she looked around rather nervously -\"It's alright, Tabby, this is a safe place...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Can she even understand our talk?\"- Joana asked with a raised eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"For the most part, yes. I've been teaching her many words since she was a kitten. I always believed she was more intelligent than people give these cats credit for, and maybe all cats are just this smart\"- Blake commented -\"By this point I can literally talk to her, and she'll understand at least 8 out of 10 things I tell her, it's a shame she can't talk back though...\"- When he said that, Tabitha meowed gently and purred more -\"Well, she tries...\"- But then she gave Joana a suspicious look and narrowed her eyes, which were emerald green by the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't think she likes me...\"- Joana said a bit nervous<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Tabby, calm down. She's Joana. She's good...\"- Blake said to his cat, but she hissed at her -\"Tabitha!\"- Blake said more firmly and she stopped -\"She won't hurt us... now, be a good cat and greet her...\"- Blake pushed her a bit towards Joana, and the reluctant cat walked slowly towards her and meowed -\"Let her smell your hand and then you can pet her\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana nodded and slowly brought her hand towards Tabitha, she also hesitated but then smelled her finger, and licked it, then Joana started to gently pet her in the head -\"This feels nice, now I understand why humans have pets\"- She giggled, and continued to pet Tabitha for a while. Then she returned to Blake, who hugged her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"See? She's nice. Don't ever attack her, you heard me?\"- Blake said, and to the surprise of everyone except Blake himself, she nodded. -\"Well, if you don't mind, she'll be accompanying me for most of the time, she's my personal ride as well as my pet\"- He said and hopped on Tabitha's back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... Blake...\"- Joana said, and she leaned closer to whisper -\"I thought you were coming with me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh... right... I guess it'll be for another time. Let me take her to your room and I'll tell her to stay there\"- He said and Joana nodded, then Tabitha jumped to the ground, with Blake still on her back -\"Go ahead, Tabitha and I will follow you\"- Joana then proceeded to thank and say goodbye to the healing women and walked towards her room, glancing back every few seconds just to make sure Blake was ok, he seemed to have a fun time riding on Tabitha. After a few minutes they arrived to her room, but Tabitha did not enter -\"You can go inside, let's go\"- Blake said to her and she cautiously entered the room, Blake signaled her to climb the bed and then jump to the nightstand, Blake jumped off her back -\"This is our room, at least for now... Stay here, and don't come unless I call you\"- He told her, and she seemed a bit reluctant but nodded obediently as well, and laid down to take a nap<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's what she does when she's bored, but she's also mounting guard. She'll be fine...\"- Blake said and Joana picked him up, when she was bringing him to her cleavage, Tabitha opened both eyes and her fur stood on end, and was ready to jump at her -\"I'm fine! Just stay here until we come back\"- Blake said and Tabitha reluctantly laid down again, closing only one of her eyes, she observed Joana put Blake inside her cleavage and walk out of the room, and when the door closed, she closed her other eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought we'd just go for your cat\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Give her some time to recognize the place. She already knows I'll be sleeping there. Anyway, can't we go out of the castle or something?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, we can go around the village, but what for? People is working, and selling stuff like food, clothing or materials... doesn't sound too interesting...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We can hang out in the forest, can't we?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sounds like you have a plan\"- Joana giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My plan is more like not having a plan, you see, I lived by improvising on the go, stuff just happened and we did things accordingly\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana just laughed a bit and they walked to the forest, it was almost right outside the castle, and it was covered by the tree's shadows, and fresh wind blew around -\"Maybe it's because I'm a dark magician, but I'm not too fond of sunlight, love the trees\"- Blake said, noticing that he didn't need to put his hood on, but he still wore his cape. Joana just decided to lay on the ground, and brought Blake to her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What now?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We could stare at the clouds\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What for?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's fun, we try to see different shapes in them, like a man riding a horse, or a sword, or a sheep, anything... just try...\"- Blake said and Joana gently set him on her right breast, Blake sank a little but didn't mind, however he noticed the change in the pattern -\"Why the change?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I just noticed I always put you on the left one... why, you like that one more?\"- She asked jokingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nah, I'm fine... this is really nice\"- Blake said, and both teenagers were staring at the clouds, it took Joana a while, since she had never done this before but she started seeing things in the cloud shapes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That one looks like a really fluffy sheep\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... and that one looks like a camel\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's a camel?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Short explanation, desert equivalent oh horse, they also have these big humps on their backs, some have 2 and some have one, and can last a lot without water, but when they drink they can drink like 60 or 100 liters, to give you an idea, about 60 or 100 times what I drink in chocolate in breakfast\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Doesn't look like a really large amount to me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is what I get for having a giant girlfriend...\"- Blake facepalmed although he was joking, and seemingly failed to notice what he just said, until after a few minutes of silence, he stood up and turned to look at Joana, she was blushing a lot<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you hear yourself?\"- She said softly, but before he even answered, she brought him to her lips for several loving kisses, Blake was surprised himself, and scratched the back of his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My mind slipped...\"- He said shrugging, but Joana licked him and started kissing him again, then she placed him on her right breast again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I like those slips\"- She giggled -\"I really like it that you see me like that\"- she covered Blake with her hand for a gentle hug of sorts, holding him between her soft chest and her hand, they didn't even realize they drifted off to sleep. Unlike most of the time, Blake had been sleeping finally free of nightmares, and despite he was fully rested, he was growing fond of Joana's warm, soft and smooth skin. Even though she was wearing clothes now, the warmth was enough to lull him effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 2 hours later, Lith was walking around the forest, picking flowers to make some tea for herself, when she noticed someone in the distance, as she walked closer, she observed that it was the Princess, and walking even closer she observed Blake was sleeping on her breast, and mostly covered by her hand, she smiled and quickly went back to her house by using extremely high speed bursts, and came back just as quickly with a mug filled with fresh water, she noticed they were indeed sleeping peacefully, but who knows for long they've been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana woke up just by hearing someone's steps, and opened her eyes groggily -\"Lady Lith... uh... what are you doing here?\"- She said and yawned softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I just saw you sleeping in here with your future husband\"- Lith said, the last part with a giggle -\"I brought you some water...\"- She set the mug near her hand, and she slowly sat up, still remembering Blake was on her breast, and observed him waking up from the movement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened?\"- He asked to Joana while his eyes readjusted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I brought you two some water... and I also came to see how's my baby doing\"- Lith answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Thanks for the water... I guess... but still... what were you doing in the forest?\"- Blake asked, not too glad to see her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I always come to pick up some flowers to make my tea\"- Lith replied -\"So... have you confirmed your mother's wisdom?\"- She said looking at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You could have been wrong... and still, what mother sells off her child just after re-encountering?\"- Blake said a bit more angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A mother that knows her child was given to a nice, caring girl, who also happens to be a princess...\"- Lith said with a giggle -\"Cheer up, not even your father was that gloomy...\"- She said</span></div></div>",

I stayed here and tried my best but most purebred giantesses ended up dying, with very few exceptions, and I had lost contact with any of you so, there was no way I knew where you were, last thing I knew was of the last battle between the hybrids and the Dark Magicians, and I learned the aftermath, so, I knew we'd be mostly confined to our village from that day on...\"- Lith said, a bit saddened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't know...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least I raised you here until you were 4\"- Lith said with a smile -\"We were starting to get worried because you started walking before the 4th month, but wouldn't speak until your third year...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He was walking before his 4th month?\"- Joana had an amazed look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, we knew he would be a smart boy, and a strong one, he had plenty of room to swim around\"- Lith said, patting her stomach slightly, then she hugged Blake to her chest again -\"And as time went by, we realized he'd be more of the silent type\"- She laughed a bit -\"At least I kept you well fed during your time here\"- She giggled, although Blake felt awkward, however, Lith continued -\"I hoped you'd become strong so you could survive in the tough outside world, and I'm proud that you did, I was always uncertain on whether you were still alive or not...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite feeling a bit awkward in this situation, Blake hugged Lith as best as he could, and she cried a little -\"At least now I'm sure James kept his promise...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What promise?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He promised me that you'd survive no matter what, and hopefully you'd find your way back here... although we believed you'd be searching for your origins rather than getting captured and sold...\"- Lith said with a hint of guilt -\"I let my chance of taking care of you go, and I'll never get that back, but I'm glad you made it on your own, now, it's the turn for another woman to take care of you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana blushed and even took a step backwards -\"Uh... I... I don't mean to take your son away from you...\"- Joana scratched her head while smiling nervously, and sipped her water<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's alright... there's not much I can do by now anyway\"- Lith replied, and brought Blake closer to her face -\"Can I kiss my son at least once?\"- She asked him, despite his weirded look, he nodded, he knew that this giant woman was indeed his mother, even if he had just met her a few days ago and not in the best way, but now, he also felt guilty for not looking for his place of origin earlier, both of them could have had a different life. Lith kissed him gently, and Blake felt his guilt soothed by quite a lot. Afterwards, she gave him a loving look, different from Joana's, and Blake just felt that he had to ask...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Can you tell me more about my father? My memories of him are vague...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, he was a very strong man\"- Lith giggled -\"By the time he was about your age he was capable of lifting me up, not many humans can do that\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Blake and Joana were surprised to hear this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When he was younger, he was very focused on avenging his father, and on becoming the next Sage himself so he had even more power, he was a bit like you regarding the Princess, he couldn't even picture it in his head, despite he was friends with hybrids that were born at around the same time as himself... Dark magicians and hybrids became allies and friends, as both were people whose existence was taboo for everyone else, and the King wanted every single one of them dead... He was also a bit gloomy due to his parents' death, but I managed to soothe his pain, because I loved him\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...I guess I can relate...\"- Blake said, and Joana blushed a bit again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He was a caring man, and loved both of us deeply, I managed to get him to drop his revenge for me, and our original idea was to raise you here just like everyone else, but, well, many other things happened, however he intended to raise you and take you back here when things settled, but, from what I heard, he had to battle among the grown up hybrids of the time, and met his demise at the hands of the King...\"- Lith let a tear roll down her cheek -\"He also made you a magnificent sword for you while you still were in my womb\"- Lith said with a half smile -\"He said it was a tradition among his people. I helped him, I told him of the orichalcum, and of our ancient rune magic...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, I still carry that sword with me almost all the time\"- Blake said, and promptly summoned it to his hand -\"Joana told me what the runes mean, but, I can only use the first one... how do the others work?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The sword is linked to you only, the runes are specific abilities you can trigger, you must figure exactly how, because, it'd be like explaining you how to extend an arm... it's something you must get the hang of, it works like an extension of your body...\"- Lith replied -\"Your father also said this weapon would keep you safe, it seems that it lived up to its purpose\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, I had some smiths take a look at it and every one of them was amazed\"- Blake added, and put it back on the holder on his back, he looked at Lith, and sighed -\"I can't guarantee exactly when, but, sometime after this marriage thing, I might come by sometimes...\"- Lith smiled, she knowing this was his way of telling her he'd come see her, she handed him back to Joana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You too should drink some water...\"- Lith commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, except I have no glass or mug or tankard or jar or whatever I could drink it with...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh, Blake... you know... I don't think I have a problem with you directly drinking from the same water as I\"- Joana said blushing a bit, and Lith laughed heartily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So you've even already kissed. I'm happy for you\"- She added, and Blake sighed, he jumped inside the mug, using one hand to hold onto its edge, and used his remaining hand to scoop up water and drink, he did so until he was satisfied and jumped back to Joana's chest, and she simply drank the rest. Then they noticed Lith slapping her forehead -\"I actually forgot I brought this for you...\"- She gave Joana a relatively small bag, and Blake peeked inside, it was a bunch of human sized things, like mugs, plates, forks, knives, spoons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nice, thanks!\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't think I need them anymore\"- Lith giggled -\"Take good care of him\"- She said more seriously to Joana, and she nodded. Lith then finished picking flowers and waved them goodbye, they started heading back to the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have to admit, that was a bit unexpected... I thought you were angrier at her...\"- Joana commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What can I say, there's something inside of me that doesn't let me stay mad at her because she's my mother...\"- Blake said a bit awkwardly, but Joana lightly poked his chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's probably your heart. You're not a bad guy\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks...\"- Blake said, and he jumped to Joana's lips, holding onto the lower one with his hands, he raised himself a bit and kissed her, this time entirely on his own. Joana stopped out of sheer surprise, and giggled, Blake simply slid down her cleavage afterwards <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was strange but nice\"- She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wanted to do it on my own\"- Blake said, burrowing deeper into her cleavage, but even with this Joana knew he was blushing, she felt his body temperature was slightly higher than usual. He closed his eyes and meditated a bit on this meeting with Lith, she was truly the woman, or well, giant, that gave him birth, he could feel it, and there was no doubt, however, he was still uneasy about his father's death, or his grandma's, both sacrificed their lives to give him a chance, but at the same time, Blake now felt that he lacked the guidance to become the next Sage... although, what would he want to be a Sage for? The thing with carrying two elemental powers only made this even more awkward, and then, there was this feeling that his business with the Sand Bandits was not over yet...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Joana got back at the castle, she saw Karina shouting at some servants while everyone else looked frantic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened?\"- She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Princess? Where have you been?\"- Karina asked worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was outside, in the forest, with Blake...\"- Joana replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...The forest... did you set him free?!\"- Karina walked closer to her, but Blake climbed out of Joana's cleavage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think it's evident that I didn't escape...\"- He said with crossed arms, Karina sighed in relief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't even sneak, I just walked out of the castle...\"- Joana said, further pointing that Karina was overreacting -\"You need some rest, take the rest of the day off\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I CAN'T!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sure everyone else is fairly competent at whatever they're doing, and you need the rest. Go, it's an order...\"- Joana said, and although Blake smiled a bit, Karina bowed respectfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks, your majesty...\"- And walked back to her room, she hated to admit it but yes, she needed a break, but she felt she was th one person who shouldn't even take one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, that takes care of that, I apologize to everyone for the trouble\"- Joana said and the other servants bowed respectfully as well and resumed their current tasks, Joana then walked towards her room, and she noticed she had a bit of sweat on herself from being outside, she fished Blake out of her cleavage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You could have told me I was sweaty... I wouldn't have carried you in there...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't know, and well, even if I did, it's no big deal, clothes can be washed...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't think it would be too nice\"- Joana said a bit embarrassed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's nothing compared to when I've been at the jungle or in some forest during a rainy day\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least rain water is clean...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was no big deal, you bathe everyday with perfumed soap, and you're barely outside, there's no way you'd really smell... So stop worrying\"- Blake said, and Joana giggled, however, both of them agreed to go to the bathroom as soon as possible. They waited a short while for the water to refill the tub, and once again, Joana removed all her clothes to enter. Blake gulped nervously and removed most of his, but kept his underwear on. When Joana set him in the water, he couldn't help but see her nipples, but quickly looked away. Joana giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were going to see them at some point anyway\"- She said with a faint blush, and slid gently into the tub, she giggled when she observed Blake shudder and just bathe himself without looking at her, she eventually convinced it was not a big deal either and they just chatted while washing themselves, and their clothes afterwards. About 30 minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was laying on her stomach on the bed, with just her underwear, and Blake was in front of her, they were talking. Blake noticed Tabitha had stayed on the nightstand, but since he had stayed in close proximity to Joana, she hadn't come closer. He smiled at her, and she seemed to be satisfied seeing her master unharmed, and she headed for the bathroom on her own, and climbed up to one of the shelves and just began to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She fell asleep just like that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, she can't sleep for real unless she knows I'm fine. Also, she needs the sleep during daytime unless we're traveling, as she mounts guard on her own at night. Heh, for a ride, she does quite a lot of stuff... protecting, transportation, carrying supplies, and even can help us hunt or hunt on her own... A few times I've survived on things she hunted for me\"- Blake said, remembering some missions he was too tired to hunt himself something to eat, and Tabitha would bring him some large bird, and once even a full grown boar for him to cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You could say she's like a fur covered maid of sorts\"- Joana giggled, and imagined the cat dressed with servant clothes as something funny<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't really see her as a servant, she's more like my daughter, or that's what a lot of people say\"- Blake replied -\"Still, she just confirms that she's far more than a simple beast of burden... even horses are smarter than people give them credit for, but cats are just much stronger, agile, intelligent, and capable of things like this. Gustave told me his family could even train cats like her precisely for hunting, or for personal guarding. Hunting with a few of them must have been quite something to watch\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can only guess... I have never seen this 'hunting' you speak of... for us, acquiring food is fairly simple...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, things are a lot different when many of these animals are of a comparable size or even larger than yourself. Hunting is like a duel with nature, and your reward is the food to keep going for the next day\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see, it's more intense for you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yup\"- Blake replied -\"Maybe it's a perk of not being a giant, but we have to keep a fire at night so we don't get attacked by wild beasts at night... but otherwise, it's just a different way to see the world\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe there are also some perks to being giant, or you know, being with one...\"- Joana said with a seductive tone and picked Blake up and placed him on her head, her silky hair, recently washed, was something very nice to land on for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I agree... Maybe I'm starting to understand my father...\"- Blake said, and Joana giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... Claire sparked my curiosity this morning...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Blake was completely caught off guard by this question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you spent some time with her, and by what I saw, she seemed quite fond of, um, sitting on you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh god...\"- Blake mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Her conversation with you and me well, seemed to imply that some of you like women's backsides...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana, that was just Claire's twisted mind...\"- Blake said, unable to see that Joana was blushing more and more as she spoke, and then she just suddenly picked him and brought him behind her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... what about mine?\"- Joana said slightly embarrassed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...good lord...\"- Blake mumbled, Claire was NOT kidding when she said the Princess' had a much more voluptuous figure than her own, and her butt was significantly larger, which just overwhelmed his mind a little as Claire's butt was the literal biggest thing he had dealt with before, however, Joana's voice snapped him out of it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not insane, of course I'm not going to sit... but maybe like this, you could tell me if you like it...\"- Joana said as she slowly brought him down and dropped him a short distance on one of her actually very large cheeks. The feel was very similar to that of her breasts, except it was maybe a bit warmer, but just as soft, and Blake sank easily past knee deep, he was blushing madly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"- Blake tried to maintain his footing, but it was difficult<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know if she was right... but in any case... you shouldn't go to anyone else for anything you may want...\"- Joana said with a strange mix of seriousness and seductiveness in her voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry, I'm not really into this...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why? Too big?\"- Joana said a bit worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By this point it's obvious everything is big on you, but it doesn't look bad... this... just feels wrong on my part...\"- Blake said with some stutter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I recall some of my friends touching or slapping some ladies in this part... and none took it well... so, I kind of learned myself that I shouldn't even come remotely close to touching this...\"- Blake said embarrassed, and Joana giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should stop worrying about that, I'll be your wife in like 3 days, and I don't mind\"- Joana said, and lightly wiggled her hips so Blake tripped face first, she shuddered when she felt him though, but just giggled more -\"So... worries aside... do you like it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I mean no offense but this is very similar to your breasts... about the same softness, and perhaps this is a bit warmer, but it doesn't feel bad other than my head telling me I shouldn't be in here\"- Blake said once he managed to stand up again, he looked around, and he could barely believe that this was his future wife, her hips pretty much occupied most of his horizon, and he could see the other large cheek like a small mountain or hill in the distance, he shuddered a bit, this time Joana had a red version of her underwear clothing, which did nothing but accentuate the sensual element to this all, he gulped a bit and mumbled -\"I can barely believe it... if Claire's were like houses these must be like freaking hills or something... I shouldn't be surprised...\"- He almost jumped from getting startled as Joana giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll take that as a compliment, I guess\"- Joana said again seductively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"For some reason, I'm not entirely sure about this...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nothing bad is going to happen Blake... I would have to be completely out of my mind to hurt you for no reason\"- Joana said in a soothing tone, and Blake took a few steps, without any real idea about what to do, when he suddenly found himself sliding down, and he just cringed at the idea of recognizing where he was going. Surrounded by even bigger, yet softer walls than he remembered from his time with Claire, Blake still managed to hear Joana moan noticeably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's with these girls?\"- Blake mumbled, and before he could move, Joana's butt involuntarily clenched on him, enveloping with its softness and warmth, he sighed, and hoped Joana wasn't planning to keep him for long in that place. He heard her giggle, however...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake was blushing insanely and tried to push Joana's gigantic cheeks apart, but this only made her moan in pleasure again, and she clenched even harder, imprisoning him again. He sighed and tried using even more strength, and again, Joana seemed to be enjoying the feeling 'I really hope she doesn't grow fond of this...' He said while trying to climb out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Karina was surprised to vaguely hear Joana moaning, and considered opening the door, however, Claire caught her hand -\"Maybe her future husband is starting to get the concept... let them be...\"- She said with a giggle, and Karina stared at her in disbelief, but sighed, and headed elsewhere, as she was still ordered to rest for the day. Claire just smiled and whispered -\"Please your queen, my lord\"- and headed to do some other task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Joana's room, she shuddered, which only made things even more difficult for Blake, and with her clenching again, he was completely held still, he was going to shout to Joana that this was getting out of control, but remembered what Claire had told him about pleasing her, and, other than his own embarrassment, he wasn't really harmed, so, against his initial instinct, he stopped trying to climb out, and instead started trying to massage the walls surrounding him, they shook every time he touched them, and he could hear Joana trying to muffle herself with her pillow, he was still a bit baffled himself about why this seemed so pleasurable to both Joana and Claire, but seeing that thinking more about it made him want to stop, he decided to try and think of something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana couldn't believe that Blake would be capable of something like this, when he first slid down, she thought it was an accident, but it also felt strangely nice, and after a while, he has started massaging her, and she couldn't help but moan, and tried to muffle herself by using her pillow, while enjoying the surges of what felt like weak lightning that ran up her back and onto her shoulders 'Ok... maybe Claire is right sometimes, despite her weird behavior...' Joana thought while enjoying the feeling 'However sitting on him is just mean, and outright insane...' she told herself, more like to prevent herself from getting tempted than anything else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Blake was starting to get tired, and stopped to take a break, he estimated he had been doing this for nearly an hour, and given his full power was once again restricted, his arms were starting to respond more slowly, and his muscles ached, he just stopped and started catching his breath, while resting on the smooth and soft walls that completely enveloped him. Just then, Joana's fingers picked him out of there, and she placed him on her pillow, roughly at her face level, she was blushing deeply -\"That was amazing, Blake...\"- She giggled, but Blake just gulped nervously and took a step back, Joana just smiled and leaned closer to him, Blake took another step back, but he heard something... purring? He looked at Joana in confusion, and realized that she was indeed purring<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do you even do that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What, humans can't?\"- Joana asked, still with seduction in her tone, and she leaned even closer to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... no... as far as I know...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, we can only make this sound after we've felt... pleasure... that's what I was told...\"- She was very close to Blake -\"You made me purr for the first time...\"- She licked him slowly, and then started kissing him repeatedly -\"I want to kiss you a lot, I don't know when I'll stop...\"- Joana said between kissed, while Blake was a bit surprised to be reminded that despite the similarities, they were indeed, of different species... although he was a hybrid himself. However he felt strangely happy for making Joana feel good, and he somewhat enjoyed more being kissed and licked. She kept on licking him for at least 10 minutes before she stopped and purred a bit, while looking a Blake in a loving manner, maybe with a more lustful hint to it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana then simply picked him up and rolled, now laying on her back, and she placed Blake in her cleavage and pressed her breasts lightly to feel Blake fully surrounded by her soft flesh, and she purred while at it. The sound was stronger in that place, but it didn't even feel like a noise, and Blake actually felt relaxed by it. She smiled, feeling Blake getting relaxed, and his heartbeat was in tune with hers, it appears that since she felt that surge of pleasure her senses sharpened even more, but this was only noticeable regarding Blake... She remembered when she was younger and Claire and Karina and some other ladies instructed her about getting married. They referred to this as bonding, and that process would mark that whoever she developed it for was going to be with her for life. She smiled at the memory and continued to purr gently, even feeling a bit maternal herself, she was lulling her future husband, and it was only slightly different from a mother lulling her child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped pressing her breasts on him and relaxed as well, but continued to purr as both were just laying there, relaxing, Blake couldn't even remember when was the last time he could truly relax like this, without having to worry about anything else, right now, his future wife was almost literally his world, and he didn't mind. Their heartbeats were synchronized, and her purring kept him in that relaxed state Blake perhaps never knew, but always knew he needed. He vaguely wondered if these hings were getting to him because of the giants' blood in his veins. They simply continued with this, and again, they didn't realize when they drifted off to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Claire's room, she was truly amazed, and while she had Blake's 4 friends in her cleavage herself, she was paying attention to what happened in the Princess' room and to Blake's thoughts. She smiled satisfied and wrote some notes. 'It appears that she finally managed to get to Blake's giant heritage side' Claire giggled 'And he also made her purr already, they're going to be together for life...' Claire also realized that technically, Blake had done the same thing to her, but she didn't purr that time 'Maybe I wasn't destined to having a hybrid husband anyway' She thought, sighing with a hint of sadness. She finally dispelled both the mind reading and the surveillance spell, and closed her notebook 'My job with them is done' She thought, and jiggled her chest to wake the guys up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell? Can't a mercenary sleep?!\"- Ferdinand shouted angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're better off awake, we shouldn't have missed the sight in here\"- Gustave said joking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What sight? It's dark, and it's beginning to get hot, and not in your perverted way...\"- Caesar said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're right, we need a bath\"- Claire said -\"I almost forgot I've been doing tasks around the house and with 4 'guests' at my nice place\"- She jiggled her chest again, and apparently, two of these guys hit their heads with each other due to the sudden movement -\"You guys still have a long way to learn... your friend Blake is already getting far on his own\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!\"- They all said, and Claire simply walked to her bathroom and closed her door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, somewhere else, 9 days prior...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious man that wandered into Kildevar asking questions is once again out of the town, on his own. He declined to meet the duke, and simply headed outside following the wind and his instinct. He headed back to where the battle happened, then snapped his fingers, and a powerful sabretooth with white black striped fur and sky blue eyes ran to his side. It wore a marine blue collar, and it had a rather humble leather saddle on his back, and the man hopped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Try to get a good whiff... let me know if you find anything like my own scent\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sabretooth feline walked to the large crater and sniffed around, then he went to the other craters and did the same, as if to confirm, and the giant feline then did a low growl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anything vaguely like my own scent and we're good to go\"- He said, and the sabretooth starting running at full speed. Heading for the northwest, after a few hours, he noticed that they were heading to the desert 'Obviously, the bandits...' The man thought, and had his mount stop, they went to a nearby river to drink all the water they needed, and filled as many things as he could with water, then, he rode on the sabretooth for a while, until reaching about the end of the grassy area, which actually took them the rest of that day and another full one of running, with some brief breaks, until they got to where the desert began. He started setting up camp, he mounted a tent he already carried among his equipment, and skillfully lit up a fire with some woo, grass, a small knife made of a black metal and a rock he picked from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're going to sleep for now... we'll ride into the desert at night... let me know when the sun sets\"- The man said to his pet, and went inside his tent. The sabretooth obediently laid down and closed his eyes, he would nap, but still be on alert... Hours passed, and when the sun was starting to set, the sabretooth stood back on his 4 paws and roared lightly, the man came out of his tent and unmounted it just as quickly as he had assembled it -\"Let's go...\"-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The man rode on his powerful sabretooth for hours under the night sky, in the cold desert, with only the moon and stars to illuminate their path. Even though the desert all looked the same, the sabretooth looked confident in his path, and he galloped at full speed through the bluish looking sand. The man was looking around for any hint of the Sand Bandits, he knew they were nomadic, and routinely changed their location, but always remained within the desert, which was their natural defense for the most part. He then noticed the distant light of what could only be a fire, but before he even said anything, the sabretooth was heading towards the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So that's where they are, nice on your part, Stortann\"- The man said quietly, and patted the feline on the head. They continued to advance until the Sand Bandit camp became more evident, and while normal one would be cautious when getting near these people, both the feline and its rider advanced at full speed with no fear. Camels and Elephants could be seen resting around the camp, while many other exotic beasts stayed in cages to be sold. They ran into the middle of the camp, and immediately about 6 bandits stood up with a jump and stood in a fighting stance, some prepared to cast magic, and others gripped their weapons, mostly daggers and scimitars, although some used weapons they robbed themselves from someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them, with long straight red hair, with most of his body and his face covered in light brown clothes, spoke -\"A sabretooth rider? What is a man from the Far North doing in here? Got lost?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems I may have business with you...\"- The man said, hopping off his ride, and briefly locked eyes with a long white haired, smiling pale bandit, whose eyes were actually covered by his hair, but quickly looked back at the one who spoke to him. The other bandits started to draw their weapons, however, another man, taller than the others, with medium length very dark red hair, again, mostly covered in light gray clothes, walked near them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let this man speak. It's obvious he came a long way, and I doubt he'd go on a suicidal attack\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You sound calm and confident, Mr. Big Bandit...\"- The man said with a half smile -\"But let me get this straight... If I were to attack you, I doubt it'd be suicide...\"- The other men growled in anger and the sound of their fully drawing their weapons was heard -\"Stortann, over there, can eat one of your elephants for breakfast, or a bunch of your men... make no mistake, however... if you cooperate, things shouldn't get ugly...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're provoking my men\"- The bandit boss said, still calmly -\"Your business better be worth this\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's pretty simple...\"- The man said -\"I happened to pass by Kildevar, and observed what seemed to be a really intense battle, and 2 of your own were dead... I then asked around in the village and I was told of an impressive battle between the local mercenaries and one of your squads. I'd like to see such impressive fighters\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boss bandit laughed -\"So, you wanted to buy gladiators? I'm sorry, but they were all sold already. However, you can contact us in a few days and see if we have captured more, you must know, capturing strong fighters is not exactly an easy task\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah I know, I even heard you captured 2 very rare people, a dark magician and a light one... I wonder, who could have paid such a high price?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...what...\"- The bandit boss said flatly -\"I never mentioned what kind of warriors we captured...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was told by some people that there were great displays of dark power, and the mercenary leader was known to be a light magician himself. I doubt you'd have sold such rare exemplars for cheap, which makes me wonder who could have been rich and or desperate enough to buy them on the day they were caught\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boss bandit laughed again -\"Well, I wasn't in the village myself, but I heard that 4 of them were sold to some other man, maybe for use as slaves, or for gladiator fights, he was a mysterious man, like you all seem to be. I can't tell you more, as not even we even knew where he was from\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If I recall correctly, they were 5...\"- The man said, crossing his arms, and the bandit laughed heartily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The leader was exceptionally strong. Actually, too strong to be a mere slave, and was perfect material for a top tier gladiator, maybe even on champion level. However, we were commissioned to find such an exceptionally strong person, and I can't give you any more details, it was a confidential work, and a very highly paid one, so, I'm sorry, but what you're looking for is not here, and as for the 'champion' don't even think about it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man simply clenched his fists in anger, and swiftly punched the bandit boss in the stomach, the others promptly charged at him, and he unsheathed a long, slightly curved sword he carried on his back, doing a spinning motion, parrying them all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fighting more than one Bandit at once, and in the middle of the desert? You must be a special kind of stupid\"- A large muscled man, with a bald head and metal knuckles said, and charged at him, however, the man seemingly disappeared, and while he looked around, the man did a high roundhouse kick on the back of the large bandit's neck, knocking him to the ground. The bandit with long red hair, armed with a katana, tried to slash him from behind, but the man elbowed him in the liver, and punched his jaw with a powerful uppercut punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bandit swung his scimitar at him, but when the man parried it with his own blade, the scimitar broke in half -\"What the...?\"- He was knocked out with a powerful punch to the stomach and a low sweeping kick. The bandit boss then unsheathed a sword, unlike those of his men, this one was straight, and its handle was red, adorned with gems, and the blade wasn't the usual silvery color of iron, but instead it had a more blackish tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I could use magic, but I respect a good fighter and swordsman. I'll fight you with just my sword and skill alone\"- The bandit boss said, and started slashing at the man, who easily blocked every single attack with his own sword. Every time their sword clashed, the sand beneath them blew around a little, and the sparks shone brightly through the otherwise dark night. They kept up this ferocious sword fight for about 20 minutes, inadvertently walking into a more open area, illuminated by the moon, after which, seemingly at a stalemate, the bandit boss said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Impressive, your boss really made a good choice to hire you as his envoy. It seems you're looking for very powerful fighters, but sadly, there is none at the moment. Currently we have simple peasants that would serve as slaves at most. We won't chase you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I am not leaving until you tell me where is the light magician\"- The man said, unlike the bandit boss, he was barely sweating, and his breath was normal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Give me one good reason for me to do that...\"- The bandit boss said, and suddenly, his own hand's shadow turned against him, strangling him, and the rest of his own shadow bound his body tightly, he tried to scream but even his mouth and nose was muffled, more bandits ran to the place, and drew their weapons, however, the man laughed, and spoke calmly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"ONE wrong move, and I snap your boss' neck... ONE is all it takes...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How can he use someone else's shadow like that?\"- One of the bandits mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is not a question, it's an order. Tell me where the light magician is!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit boss struggled to breathe but nodded in angst, and the bandits all unsheathed their weapons, and the shadow that muffled the boss' nose and mouth allowed him to breathe again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're crazy and stupid... The light magician you look for is probably no more... He was bought by giants, GIANTS, YOU HEAR ME?!\"- The bandit boss said between heavy breaths -\"Well, specifically, giantesses, but I doubt they were nice to him... The most likely outcome is that they turned him into a gourmet dish for their King and Queen...\"- He said and laughed, but after a minute, he calmed a bit -\"Well, they actually paid a lot of money for him, and they requested a strong individual, maybe your light magician works as a slave that literally attends gigantic tasks\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Giantesses, huh...\"- The man said quietly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't believe it if I were you either... In any case, the village is pretty far, well fortified, and is guarded by freaking giants, even someone as skilled as you would be no stronger than an ant to them, if you go there you're going to die...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Funny you say that, because you're going to take me there\"- The man said, and noticed that the white haired bandit abstained from even fighting, and sa him walk away as if nothing had happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>[Author's Note: Sand Bandits do have a King and even a village of their own. However the many teams that actually do the dirty jobs to bring wealth there live in nomadic camps while they're at work, as they usually jump from a mission to another, and tend to have a seasonal rest, some rest in the summer and others in the winter, at the village. Basically they're nomadic for 3/4 of the year and settle back in the village for the one season they're allowed to rest.

I don't have many ideas about what to do...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I can think of one...\"- Joana said seductively -\"But, do you trust me?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you trust that regardless anything, I'm not going to hurt you?\"- Joana said with puppy eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"- Blake's mind flashed with the memories of Claire, and he imagined Joana herself trying to sit on him, and as he already had seen himself, not only she was taller and heavier than Claire, but her butt was also much bigger, he gulped -\"Uh... as long as you're COMPLETELY SURE that I won't be physically harmed, yes... please don't try anything crazy...\"- Blake said, and he mumbled the last part<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you could say it's a bit crazy... but the point is, you trust me or not?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... what do you have in mind?\"- Blake sighed and extended his arms as a sign of giving up, however, instead of answering, Joana simply picked him up and stuffed him in one of her bra cups, she readjusted it and shuddered at the new feeling. Meanwhile, Blake found himself in a dark place, his back resting on fabric, and Joana's enormous breast resting on him and the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...my god...\"- Blake said muffled, however, Joana still heard him, and giggled -\"Joana this is seriously crazy, borderline dangerous... I'll get crushed really easily...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I already saw you lifting Claire up on your own\"- She commented, and glanced at her chest -\"And as big and heavy as my chest may seem, it can't be heavier than Claire\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate it when you're right...\"- Blake replied, which made Joana giggle more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is it really that bad?\"- Joana asked with some genuine concern<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No... but this is strange... why am I even here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana blushed deeply and laid back on the bed -\"Well... this is another thing I heard from some of the older ladies...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm afraid to know more, but go on, by this point, I feel like I must know...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Several years ago, like, the times of our grandfathers,  most of the human kingdom was ravaged by the wars, and even in here, with the death of many male giants, our village went into chaos and many things were unattended, and even though the King and Queen worked to restore order, resources like food were rather scarce...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Interesting story, but I fail to see what does that have to do with you stuffing me in your bra...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana giggled -\"Let me continue... well, the thing is, this was around the time the widow giantesses had started to marry some of the men widowed by the war to attempt to restore our population. Many humans declined to have food, allowing their wives to eat whatever they could buy, or whatever they could harvest or hunt, but obviously, the humans also needed to eat, and were becoming emaciated. Out of love, the wives decided to feed their husbands... the only way they could...\"- Joana blushed more and giggled, but took a deep breath and continued -\"...I think you may have an idea how that happened...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake analyzed what he just heard, and stood there thoughtfully, and then, the answer hit him like a brick on the head -\"Oh god... no... just... no... no way...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It wasn't gross, Blake. It was a very loving way those wives fed their husbands during difficult times... and from what I heard, those men were actually well fed, although, just like you, they found the idea very strange and even a bit shameful...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake gulped -\"And you brought me here because...?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We haven't had dinner...\"- Joana said giggling, and felt Blake trying to push her breast apart from himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorry Joana, but, no... that's too strange, even for me, I know it's another culture but there is a limit on what I'd tolerate on a reasonable margin...\"- He said while trying to push Joana's breast to get out of the bra, but not only it was very big, but also soft, and his hands just sank more into the soft flesh the harder he tried to push, however Joana liked the feeling, while at the same time, she was saddened with Blake's answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, in all honesty, what's so bad about it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It doesn't seem natural to me... too weird...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I already let you eat from what I eat, and drink from what I drink... is it really so wrong that I want to feed you on my own?\"- She said, and felt that Blake shuddered -\"Besides, the moment this marriage was arranged, we were already sort of going against nature...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed -\"...I hate it when you're right...\"- He could have argued with her logic, but he was aware of the cultural difference and that overall, Joana had no ill intent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's supposed to be a very intimate love gesture\"- Joana said sweetly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... alright...\"- Blake felt this was the most awkward moment of his life, and sighed in defeat. It was true that this was something from a culture different from his own, and it even had a historical context, but Blake was still feeling uneasy about the idea, and observed Joana's breast. He started to climb up and after about a minute, he found the areola and nipple, the areola was roughly as tall as he was, and the nipple was at the very least the size of his head -\"This becomes more awkward by the second\"- He muttered and observed the nipple. He knew from watching newborn animals that basically they just drink from the nipple as it fits in their mouths, but this didn't seem to be the case here -\"Uh, this doesn't look like it'll work... Joana, seriously, this is too strange...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, you're already there, no need to be shy\"- Joana said -\"You can even bite, a little...\"- She said and shuddered herself, which didn't help him much, as he lost his grip and grabbed into the nipple itself with both hands, and Joana moaned a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I really hope I don't get struck by lightning for doing this...\"- Blake commented and after taking a deep breath, climbed up until he faced the nipple, and tried to squeeze some of it into his mouth, much to his surprise, despite the somewhat rough texture, it was very soft itself, and he managed to fit the tip on his mouth, although he had to bite slightly to keep it compressed enough, and his nervousness just increased when he heard Joana moaning more. He thought that hopefully, this wouldn't work, and before he could do anything else, he felt liquid in his mouth, and while his first reaction was shock, he couldn't immediately spit it, which gave him time to notice that it was actually very sweet, and much to his dismay, it outright tasted way better than the cow milk he was used to drink, more liquid filled his mouth and he had to swallow, and he was with this personal paradox, objectively, it was good, but knowing what this meant was very weird. At least the milk stopped flowing for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was blushing deep red from the recent pleasure she felt, and just looked down at her cleavage lovingly, and started purring. Blake could obviously hear this as well, and his surroundings vibrated with it, and more milk flowed from her to his mouth, and he just had to keep swallowing, each time admitting to himself that it didn't taste bad, and that culturally this wasn't wrong for her. he also noticed that her purring had increased the flow, and he continued to drink until he felt his stomach full, and the milk stopped flowing on its own. Blake finally took part of the nipple out of his mouth and took a deep breath... technically, he was satisfied regarding hunger, but the whole experience was still strange. He rested in there but Joana gently picked him up and brought him to her face, he saw that she was still blushing deeply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How was it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... it's better than the usual milk I know...\"- Blake said shyly, scratching the back of his head, but Joana smiled lovingly and kissed him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll think of that as a compliment\"- She giggled, and kissed Blake a few more times before setting him on one of her breasts -\"I won't force you or anything, you're free to eat anything, but you could consider having this as 'dinner' \"- She said sweetly while Blake had a small sweatdrop on his forehead 'She wants to do this every other day?!' He almost fainted...</span></div></div>",

However, he remembered the fight he had with that mysterious man who made short work of him, although he was pretty far from his full strength. He had told him there was no fighting destiny, and he could infer that somehow that guy wanted him to get married to Joana, but why... He also wondered if that man was actually just that strong, or it was just due to him being wounded, worn down and not in a really good state. Another kiss from Joana made those thoughts fade away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, somewhere in the forest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mysterious man in a brown cloak sat on a tree's branch, and Rick's messenger, who had stayed around so far, suddenly appeared, jumping from a nearby tree<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, do you have any news?\"- The man in the cloak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Quite a lot more than expected... First of all, Blake did not go through with the plan to kill all the giantesses, however, they were counter ambushed. He kept piling up the knocked out soldiers he had brought, and lastly, he prevented their leader from actually killing one of them. However, they were caught, and Blake gave up his freedom to have the soldiers and his friends spared... But due to word play, his friends were captured as well...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sighed and facepalmed -\"This is going a nightmare to pull off...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake spent two days with one of the servants for *ahem* educational purposes regarding their culture and such, and to get him somewhat used to the idea of marrying a giantess... Afterwards, he was given to the princess and they've spent the time so far together...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh? I don't believe Blake is one to be easily tamed...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know, but, it seems that the Princess genuinely loves him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah, wait, what?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As surprising as that sounds, sir. The Princess has been nothing but sweet and even supportive of him... early, he seemed to suffer a breakdown, and she comforted him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A breakdown?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes... I'm not giving further details out of respect, but what I can tell you is that the princess did comfort him. Sir, she did not tame him with force...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't have expected Blake to change like that, but I guess, he was already too mature for his age, and was dealing with a lot of things none of us can ever get close to know... but still, how hasn't he tried to escape yet?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By what I saw, it's mostly because his friends are captive... and as for how the princess has managed to win his heart, well, there's a bit of strange news about that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I find it hard to believe myself, but, they say Blake is a hybrid... son of a giantess and a man...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmph, I actually knew that... so, it seems that the princess managed to get to his giant half...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Seems likely. His friends have much more difficult adapting\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... I think I'll pass by and see for myself. Good messenger, you're free to go back to your village...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe messenger bowed respectfully -\"With all due respect, I personally want to see this through, all the way. Blake and his mercenaries did a lot for my village, and I don't feel like abandoning them just yet\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, let's go then...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the castle, with Claire...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was teasing the guys, and placed them on her back, although she placed Gustave on her butt and giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Seriously... you go from telling us stuff solemnly and the next second you put us on your body...\"- Ayrton facepalmed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe it's a cultural thing, but we are kind of fond of physical contact with people we care about. It's likely that your future wives would have you on her bodies for most of the time. Whether on their back or their cleavage or even the shoulders and head depends on personal preference\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...uh... alright, I guess...\"- Ayrton said, while Gustave simply laid and let himself sink a bit into Claire's cheek<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least he enjoys it\"- Claire said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course! This is better than any pillow, and believe me, I once slept with some of the best pillows there are, they are nothing compared to this\"- Gustave said, relaxed, with his eyes closed, and he playfully smacked her cheek. Claire blushed intensely while the other 3 guys stopped in their tracks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did he just...?\"- Ferdinand said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh god no...\"- Caesar muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Gustave, you idiot!\"- Ayrton was preparing to attack him, when they heard Claire had moaned but mostly muffled it with her own pillow, and all 3 of them had completely baffled faces<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is where she crushes us with a slap like mosquitoes?\"- Caesar wondered and shuddered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not really...\"- Claire said, and she picked the 3 guys and placed them inside her cleavage, then she picked Gustave and brought him to her face, she was still blushing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have been complimenting me and doing this sort of things since yesterday... Do you like me for real? I don't belong to nobility though...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I never cared about nobility. Even my father just told me this: 'When you're choosing a woman to share your life with, just remember that the most important thing is that you love being around her, that you can enjoy together even the simplest things in life. It doesn't matter if she's from a noble family, or if she's just a working girl, if you like being with her, that's a good sign' And then he would add with a wink 'And if her beauty manages to keep you captivated just like the first day, well, that's even better' My point is... yeah, you're fun and you're beautiful. I've dated many girls and most tended to be fairly boring... Not to mention that none of them had a body like yours\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"... I... I can't take it anymore...\"- Claire said, blushing her deepest red yet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Gustave wondered when suddenly she started kissing and licking him, unlike before, when she was just teasing, this time she did it with true passion, and after a few minutes, she said softly -\"You just have earned yourself your future wife. I don't care what I have to do, you're officially mine...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...god...\"- Ayrton muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He had it coming\"- Caesar said facepalming<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Gustave, what the hell?\"- Ferdinand shouted, but Gustave just smiled and gave them a thumbs up -\"This guy...\"- Gustave then threw a crumpled paper at them, and Ferdinand caught it, it was written by burning each letter very finely onto the paper, and it read 'I've dated many girls, and didn't like any of them for a long term thing, who knows? maybe my destiny was here all along. Other way to see it, at least now you don't have to worry about this wild girl anymore' Ferdinand felt his heart sink a little -\"He acts like a damned idiot, but his heart is not evil\"- He showed the note to the other guys while Claire kept on kissing and licking Gustave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's quite the sacrifice...\"- Caesar commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least he likes her...\"- Ayrton added, trying to not feel bad about him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, then, tomorrow, you 3 will be given back to Karina, but you, my red haired prince, will stay\"- Claire said sweetly -\"For now, time to sleep...\"- She used small drops of water to put out the candles, however, Gustave climbed to her shoulder and climbed on her ear and whispered, Claire giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Wait a minute...\"- She had a more concerned look -\"I liked it when you were laying in there, but your other friend barely lasted 2 minutes inside, you can't really ask me to put you in there for about 10 hours...\"- She whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just give me a minute...\"- Gustave said and jumped off her ear, and went to her cleavage -\"Hey, Ayrton, can you make an air bubble for me?\"- And he noticed that all 3 of them already already had their heads inside one each -\"I knew you'd use this not to suffocate, heh\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyrton just nodded and using his hands, he generated a  round air bubble, slightly bigger than someone's head, and handed it to Gustave, who promptly put his head inside of it and gave him a thumbs up. However, they were surprised to see him leave. He went to Claire's pillow to be at her face's level -\"See? Air bubble, it will let me breathe. We have been able to even breathe underwater thanks to this thing\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, yeah, that solves one thing...\"- Claire said, and glanced back at her behind -\"But that bubble doesn't protect you from... the sheer weight... I don't want to crush you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're not giving me enough credit\"- Gustave said, sliding down the pillow, climbing on her ribs and walking to her butt and slid between her cheeks, Claire shuddered at the feeling and purred almost silently, she opened her eyes wide upon realizing, but her blush just increased and she smiled sweetly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... have a nice sleep then\"- Claire closed her eyes, and enjoyed the feeling, while Gustave himself got comfortable, even though the soft walls surrounding him were fairly heavy, he just let himself sink into that softness, and eventually everyone fell asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>[Note: Referencing the events here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1556425-Shrunk-with-your-girlfriendGTS-AS/action/view/chapter_map/15211111111111111111111111111111111111\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a> ] </b></font></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back to Joana's room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had almost fainted at Joana's proposal, but she just giggled and lovingly kissed him. Seeing that he wasn't moving, she decided to drop him in her cleavage and push him in as deep as she could, and purred when she felt Blake completely enveloped by her soft chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see that you're getting fond of putting me in here\"- Blake said, while feeling himself massaged by Joana's soft flesh all around him, vibrating due to her purring, and he heard her giggle again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You weren't reacting, might as well put you somewhere safe\"- Joana said, and giggled even more as Blake climbed up on his own, he was still not completely used to the soft 'terrain' and slid down her stomach, and again, due to her smooth skin, he slid all the way until he fell into her navel, Joana even linked twice in surprise -\"How did that even happen? I thought I was clumsy\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Soft and smooth skin is nice to the touch, but difficult as hell to walk on, I'm used to rough terrain or even plains...\"- Blake said, trying to stand and grabbed onto the 'walls', and Joana blushed and purred a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It tickles\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really...\"- Blake said seemingly flatly, but he started to intentionally tickle the walls that were the inside Joana's belly button, and she laughed more and even tried to dig him out with a finger, but the tickling didn't allow her to focus well. After about a minute, Blake stopped, and climbed on Joana's finger, he was once again on her stomach, and laid on it, he felt it moving up and down from her breathing, she still laughed a bit until she felt her stomach rumbling, and a rather loud growl was heard, even Blake jumped from sheer surprise. Joana just giggled and picked him up to bring him to her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Unlike you, I haven't had dinner yet\"- She said and her stomach growled again, even Tabitha ran out of the bathroom to see what was going on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm fine\"- Blake said to her, and she simply went back inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess that if even your cat comes to check it out, that means my stomach must make a scary sound\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It just took me by surprise, and well, it's a bit intense for us, but nothing otherworldly...\"- Blake commented -\"I even heard someone once say that regardless of languages, everyone knows what a growling stomach means\"- He said laughing a bit, and Joana sat up, setting him on one of her breasts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who said that? It's a funny way to see it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"An old man, a gardener I think, during one of my earlier travels, when I hadn't even founded the mercenary squad, it was just me, Tabitha and Ferdinand...\"- He replied, and Joana's stomach growled again -\"We better go get your food before you start thinking of me as a snack\"- Blake joked, and Joana decided to play it up by bringing him to her lips and playfully licking him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know, you don't taste bad at all...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...what...\"- Blake was baffled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just kidding, I wouldn't eat you\"- Joana licked him a few more times -\"If I did I wouldn't be able to kiss you, or lick you, or feed you...\"- She said the last part blushing a bit, and Blake looked away awkwardly, however both laughed, and Joana put him in her cleavage while she got up to put on some clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see that this became the routine way of transportation\"- Blake commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Walking by my feet would be dangerous. This is safe, and I like the feeling of protecting you\"- Joana answered sweetly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Can we bring something for Tabitha? I doubt she has eaten well in several days, and I want to treat her with nicely cooked meat\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course we can, but, don't all animals only eat raw meat?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They can, but just like us, they enjoy cooked meat more. A priest I met sometime ago told me that cooked food is in general far easier to digest and more nutritious, and that even animals would enjoy such food if they have a chance, I confirmed it with Tabitha, she takes cooked meat over raw any day\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You seem to meet interesting people on a regular basis\"- Joana said while still putting on her clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, right now, I'm with the most beautiful girl ever met, and she's not even exactly of the same species as I am... and I'm currently living among her people... trying to learn their customs and stuff... does that ring any bell?\"- Blake said, while Joana blushed and giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's one way to see it, I see myself as just the princess of a small boring village, of, well, giantesses... Not very interesting from my point of view\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you are. You're taller than the best fortified castles I've seen, and yet, you can put any princess or noble woman to shame with your sole appearance, and unlike those old legends, you're nice. The giants I heard of in tales were always primitive and seeking to eat people and their animals...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...And this one even fed you herself\"- Joana completed Blake's phrase with her own touch, making him blush<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My point is, you're impressive. That priest would have been amazed with you all, and would have wanted to study your species\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He was a man of science, despite being a priest. He told me: 'As a priest, I learn the word of God and try to live up to what He tells us leads to a good life, but as a man of science, I try to unfold the mysteries behind creation, and by understanding all these wonderful mechanisms that make up existence itself, and ourselves, my faith only grows stronger, for I can see that only someone with supreme intellect could have designed all of this' And that's why he loved studying everything, but specially how we, living creatures work. He would've been impressed to see giants, who look like us, and yet have some differences... because seriously, we can' t purr... and as far as I know, only mothers with newborn could make milk...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana just laughed and finished getting dressed, and headed downstairs to the dining room, Karina and Claire were surprised to see her, as they were about to go and call her. She greeted them and sat on her chair, and looking at her cleavage, she asked Blake if he wanted something, and he replied that he'd just have some water. She asked one of the servants to bring her one human sized cup as well as a cup of water for herself. Karina noticed this and smiled a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, you finally tamed this wild hybrid...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"First, this wild hybrid has a name... and Second, if she were still trying to 'tame' me, as you say, I wouldn't be here\"- Blake replied with his arms crossed, even though he was still in Joana's cleavage from his waist down. Karina frowned a bit, but admitted in silence he had good points<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Karina, the Princess conquered him with love, much more effective than force...\"- Claire said, putting an arm around Karina's neck in a friendly yet playful manner, and winked at Joana, who blushed at her comment. Karina then noticed the servant only brought a human sized cup for Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Isn't he going to have any dinner?\"- She asked a bit surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's say he already has had dinner\"- Joana said still blushing a bit, and while they got the food brought to them, Karina and Claire were thoughtful for a short while, until the realization of the answer hit them in the head like a bucket of cold water, and they blushed intensely themselves, even Claire, who just quietly started drinking some wine, while Karina sipped some tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake simply jumped out of Joana's cleavage and grabbed his cup, he already knew what to do, and climbed Joana's cup with a jump and scooped some water for himself, however, Joana frowned slightly -\"You should let me know you're going to do that... What if I didn't see you in my cup and I'm going to drink?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can just jump off\"- Blake said shrugging and drank his water, but Joana had a worried and saddened look -\"Look, don't worry ok, I'll tell you next time, I just didn't think you'd worry too much about it\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I do worry about you\"- Joana said looking down, and Blake just finished his drink, jumped off the cup and put it away, then he jumped to Joana's chest and from there he got all the way to her ear, while also caressing one of her hair locks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorry, I'm not completely used to have someone worry about me\"- He held onto her ear with one hand and leaned as much as he could to kiss her cheek. Karina and Claire were surprised to see this behavior on Blake, by his own free will, and Joana smiled, grabbing Blake and holding him against her cheek affectionately, she purred slightly, and once again, Claire and Karina almost spat their drinks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He made her purr already?!\"- Karina said confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems that your 'wild hybrid' has gotten to do some serious work\"- Claire said in a more teasing tone, having regained her composure faster than Karina<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana didn't really mind that Karina and Claire were seeing and she passionately kissed Blake before putting him back on the table, and then started eating, with a happy look on her face. Karina still watched in disbelief, and Claire again nudged her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know, for such a rough, random and unreliable method to get the Princess a husband, you still managed to get her a good one\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess, but now that you put it that way, this looks more like destiny, or the work of God...\"- Karina said laughing a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I like to believe that too. Blake gets a beautiful loving wife, the Princess gets a faithful and considerate husband, and our kingdom has a chance to avoid extinction...\"-  She said, but she sighed in her mind, thinking that while they seemed to be all winning, Blake's friends with the exception of Gustave were still held against their will.</span></div></div>",

Blake chuckled at Joana's look, which prompted her to pout for a moment. After a few minutes, Joana was done with her food and drank her chocolate milk rather quickly \"That was faster than I expected\" Blake commented, and Joana giggled \"I was hungry\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty... would you mind if I...\" Claire said, but before continuing, she glanced around for any signs of Karina \"...if I borrowed Blake for a moment?\" she asked \"It's fine by me, but you have to ask him too\" Joana shrugged, and Claire's eyes looked at Blake's, almost as if they had a silent conversation. Blake sighed \"Fine...\" \"I'll go back to my room, please bring him back after you're done\" Joana said and Blake jumped out of her cleavage before she stood up to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire giggled and extended her hand, Blake sighed again and reluctantly walked towards it until he climbed on her palm. She smiled and blew him a kiss before she stood up herself and walked away from the dining room as well. Even though his knowledge of the castle was fairly limited, he knew Claire wasn't heading for her room. He noticed that in fact, she went to another room, and unlocked its door before walking in and closing the door behind herself. Without a word, Claire put him on a chair and swiftly turned around \"I don't like where this is...\" Blake mumbled as a huge shadow was cast over him \"...going...\" Blake said with some trouble, since Claire's enormous butt had just sat on him \"Claire, what the hell?!\" He said, as he struggled against the massive weight pressing down on him, its warmth and softness annoyed him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake could hear Claire giggling and just sighed while trying to get a grip beneath her soft, jiggling flesh. \"I know you're fine\" Claire said while slowly grinding her butt on him \"Did you miss me?\" She said with a sing-song tone and giggled more. Claire then bounced a few times on the chair and stayed seated for a few minutes while happily humming to herself, however, she gasped when she felt that she was rising up above the chair's cushion \"Whoah, so you really can lift me up when you're at your full strength\" Claire chuckled. Meanwhile, Blake remembered a sculpture that he saw a long time ago, of a man that had to lift the entire world on his back 'Now I know what that guy felt like' he thought while he struggled a bit to maintain his balance, as well as a decent grip on Claire's pillow-like flesh. A minute later, Claire leaned to the side and took Blake out from under her butt, then she hugged him, lightly pushing him into her chest \"I know that you're going to protest, but I just wanted to do that for old times' sake\" she said in a somewhat more soothing, less flirty tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Blake hugged her back, and as he felt the warmth from Claire's chest, he heard her heartbeats, and reflected on what happened since his arrival. While it was true that Claire tried to tease him right from the start, she didn't appear to mean any harm, and even when she fought alongside Karina and the other guards, it didn't appear as if she had any killing intent. Blake also remembered that he did punch her at least once. \"You know... in hindsight... I may have overreacted to all of this...\" he said, reluctant about telling this to Claire of all people, but something inside him made him feel that it was the right thing to do. He didn't see, but Claire's eyes widened a little when she heard him, and she had a sincere smile \"It's alright. I think I took your situation way too lightly\" she replied, and slightly pushed him further into her breast \"I thought I'd solve it just by charming you\" she giggled \"I didn't know exactly how much you went through, so, it's no wonder that didn't go so well\" She chuckled and remembered how easily she got him flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way... Sorry about that time I punched you...\" Blake apologized. He felt bad about indirectly causing Joana to break her wrist, and about hurting Claire, whom he somehow still perceived as innocent in comparison to Karina and Taylor. \"Awww\" Claire cooed and kept hugging him for several more minutes. \"So... I'm guessing you didn't bring me here just to apologize...\" Blake said, and Claire finally let go of the hug. She stood up and placed Blake back on the chair \"Nope. I just happen to be on break...\" She replied as she spun around, her rather ample behind jiggled from the sudden motion, and its shadow covered Blake again \"And these chairs are SO uncomfortable sometimes\" She said with an obvious flirty tone as she slowly massaged her butt, presumably to tease Blake, who gulped, more from a sense of dread rather than from being flustered. \"If only a noble and kind man would offer to ease this situation for me\" Claire said as she lowered her butt until she almost sat on Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure you have more than enough cushioning for that\" Blake replied with his arms crossed, and he half-smiled when he saw Claire pouting while looking at him from over her shoulder. She grabbed Blake before she sat on the chair and set him on her chest \"You're right. But I would've appreciated a little more pampering\" she replied \"Jokes aside. I did bring you here for a more serious reason\" Claire said, sounding truly serious for a change \"Are you aware of what's going on in here?\" she asked, and Blake scratched his head, slightly confused at the rather cryptic question \"Time continues to pass... the Princess is growing more attached to you... Are you aware of what you're doing? You'll marry the Princess and become our King. That's a commitment for life\" She added, and Blake sighed \"I would have preferred not to think too much about it\" Claire then petted his head with a finger and giggled a little \"I'll put it in another way\" Blake noticed that somehow, it looked like Claire's eyes became sharper for a split second <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, I have you with me... and your friends are in my room. Although risky, I could sneak you all out of the castle, and maybe out of the village... This would be your absolute last chance at getting your freedom back and the life that you were used to...\" Claire said, and Blake scratched his chin in thought \"...I hate to make you feel bad, but the truth is, this would greatly disappoint and sadden our Princess. I can tell she's beginning to love you. But I'm not forcing you to anything. Maybe freedom is even more valuable. How much it's worth will be up to you. What I want to point here is that, you are the only one, right here, right now, who can choose his destiny... You can choose to leave, and by my honor as a royal servant, I will get you and your friends out of here... Or you can stay, and face a new life, and new challenges... You can leave, and forget about Joana, about us all, and move on with your life, or you can stay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you had asked me this exact question 3 days ago or earlier, it would have been much easier to answer...\" Blake growled, as he continued to go over the implications of either choice. Claire giggled \"I didn't have such a chance until right now. However, I felt like I needed to make sure that you knew what you're getting into, and, if you're not up to it, I can help you leave, and live as you see best\" \"Wouldn't that be treason or something?\" Blake wondered \"Only if I get caught\" Claire smiled, and both laughed a little \"Still. After interacting with you and your friends, I got a better grasp at what humans are really like. Our cultures may be different, and our sizes too, but otherwise, we're practically the same... our minds aren't all that different, so... I can see the point you had about not wanting to be enslaved for life\" Claire said, back to her serious tone \"I have to say I'm impressed... I've come a similar way... I had a rather tough time at seeing you all as more than just enormous monsters\" Blake replied \"I hope your change of mind was thanks to the Princess and me\" Claire giggled \"You know it...\" Blake chuckled. Even though it had only been a few days, something about Claire felt as if they had been old friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to say it, but, my life outside would be just as uncertain as my life here... I have nothing, besides my friends. But, not a place to call my own, and not really any family besides my friends...\" Blake said \"That's where you're wrong\" Claire playfully poked his stomach with her fingertip \"Here you have a beautiful girl that loves you and will take care of you as best as she can. You'll have a kingdom... even if it's just one village, full of people that will swear allegiance to you. You also have your mother who happens to live here too\" Claire said \"And, of course, you'll always have a loving, beautiful maid at your service\" she winked at him and giggled some more. Blake looked down \"That's not fair, you're trying to make it look like staying is the better choice...\" \"I'm not doing such a thing\" Claire faked a gasp but kept smiling \"I'm merely presenting you with facts. How you see them is entirely on you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides... if I were to choose to leave, how are you going to get us all out without getting caught? If you carried a bag it'd look suspicious, and you can't just have us all on your shoulder or head without being noticeable\" Blake said \"Well, I think I can fit your friends right here\" Claire pointed at her cleavage \"And as for you, you'd have to travel safely hidden between my special pillows\" Claire said softly while using a hand to squeeze her butt. Blake facepalmed \"Why must always be a catch of sorts...\" \"I'm just being practical, if you're all hidden on my body, nobody will find you... and by what we know, only you can survive back there\" Claire said, although she couldn't help but giggle \"So, what is it?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I don't know... let me think about it some more\" Blake said, and Claire grabbed him before walking to the bed and laying on her stomach. She giggled as she put Blake on her butt \"I've heard that resting on a soft pillow helps when one needs to think deeply about something\" Claire said, and she giggled more when she heard Blake facepalming. However, he stayed, and actually laid on it, Claire's gentle warmth, and the softness of her flesh helped ease his mind somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so sure Joana does in fact love me?\" Blake asked after a few minutes of thinking \"I've known the Princess all my life, and I've seen how she looks at you, how she treats you. She sincerely wants to help make your life better. The forced marriage sucks, but she genuinely wants it to work as best as possible for you\" Claire explained \"And I'm pretty sure you're aware that her heart is already yours\" She added with a smile, and looked at him from over her shoulder. Blake blushed and stuttered a little before clearing his throat \"What's that supposed to mean?\" \"I know that you've made her purr already\" Claire whispered, and Blake almost fainted \"So, you DO know that she's pretty much yours already. Do you have the heart, or actually, the lack of a heart to abandon her?\" She said, and Blake sighed \"I don't\" He slowly stood up, but Claire wiggled her hips and made him trip and fall on his face. He could hear her giggling \"Don't rush it. Take your time to think about it\" she said, rather sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just want me to stay on your butt as long as you can...\" He replied as he turned on his back \"I'm just serving my potential future King\" Claire defended herself, but her smile made it evident that she knew she was guilty \"As a royal servant, it will always be my pleasure to provide cushioning and warmth for my King, whenever he desires\" She winked at him, and enjoyed a good chuckle as she heard him groaning in sheer annoyance. However, Blake did listen to her suggestion, and continued to think deeply about the implications of staying or leaving. He felt like pangs of guilt when he reviewed the idea of taking Claire's offer and leaving the giants' kingdom. And even though staying was looking to be the better option, he didn't want to surrender his life away. He got a little lost in his thought process, and suddenly slammed his fist on the 'ground' in frustration at not reaching a satisfying conclusion, a faint yelp from Claire, followed by a flirty laughter reminded him of his current location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple more minutes passed, and Claire wiggled her hips again \"Haven't you decided yet?\" She asked \"I'm afraid of reaching a final decision...\" Blake replied, and stood up \"I think I want to talk to my friends about it. Can you give me a hand on that?\" He added, and Claire giggled \"Not just the hand, my whole beautiful body is at your service\" she replied, which prompted Blake to facepalm yet again \"Don't let Joana hear you...\" he said, and before he knew Claire grabbed him, sat up, put him in her cleavage and proceeded to leave the room. She went back to her room, where Blake's friends were resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, back to my humble room\" Claire said \"...your Majesty\" she whispered, and Blake, who had just jumped to her open palm, gave her a deadpan look for a few seconds \"Guys, someone's here to see you\" Claire said, a bit more loudly in order to wake Blake's friends up. They had been allowed to rest while she was outside of her room. \"Huh... what's it this t-Blake!\" Ayrton said, groggily at first, but then he was really surprised to see Blake standing on Claire's palm. He observed as the other guys woke up as well, yawned and stretched their arms, and jumped to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to interrupt your sleep, but I have something really serious to talk about\" Blake said \"Guys... this might be my very last chance... we could escape right now...\" Ferdinand and Caesar gasped and their eyes seemed as if they glowed with hope \"Well then, why aren't we leaving?!\" Ferdinand stood up \"Yeah, about time! I'm sort of missing Kildevar already\" Caesar said \"Blake... if it were that simple, you'd be the first to jump in\" Ayrton said \"Your hesitation makes me think that there's something you're not telling us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed \"That's true. I personally, no longer feel that good about leaving...\" \"Oh my god... You really DID fall in love with the giant princess, didn't you?\" Gustave said with a smug half-smile, and Blake blushed furiously \"I-It's not quite like that!\" he blurted \"Blake, you should be honest to your friends\" Claire said, with a tone that sounded almost motherly. Ferdinand and Caesar gasped \"Are you saying that you actually want to stay and marry the princess?\" Caesar asked \"It's complicated. It's not that I want... but, at this point, Joana has come to show me some degree of affection, and I feel wrong abandoning her just like that, okay?!\" Blake replied, still somewhat angry and embarrassed \"Blake, I like tall, and well fed girls, but I think you've gone way to the extreme\" Ferdinand chuckled \"Goddamnit, Ferdinand!\" Blake threw one of his metal rings at his face, right between the eyes \"Ouch!\" Ferdinand complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My point is, you guys don't have to stay here just because of me. Once I'm made King, I will be able to release you, and you'll be free to continue with your lives\" Blake said after taking a deep breath \"Our squad will be no more, unless you want to continue without me, which is fine\" He added. The room became silent for a while \"But where would we go then?\" Ayrton raised his hand \"Yeah. It's not the same without you. Besides, you're our leader\" Caesar said \"I can't ask you guys to stay here because of me. Besides, I don't think you would want to be married to some giantess and settle here\" Blake said \"That's where you're wrong, Blake\" Gustave replied \"I've got my eyes on a giant beauty already\" he said, while Ayrton, Ferdinand and Caesar facepalmed \"Hey, maybe it's a little too much to ask, but if you become King, can't we be your knights?\" Ayrton said \"We swore to stay together years ago, remember? If you stay, marry, and become King of the giants, I think that at least, I want to stay at your side on this new adventure\" He added, and his words filled everyone else with hope \"I guess Ayrton's right. I can't really see my life without you guys anymore\" Caesar added <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, we all know that without ME, you're nothing!\" Ferdinand said with a smug laughter \"You're gonna need tons of advice just to survive your wife, and who better than the closest thing you have to a brother to help you?\" He said \"Yeah... right... the guy that hasn't landed a single date in his entire life somehow is gonna help me with a wife that's larger than a goddamn castle... sounds about right...\" Blake replied, which made the rest of the guys laugh while Ferdinand facepalmed from embarrassment \"As for making you my knights... that's actually a pretty good idea...\" Blake chuckled \"I never thought you guys would be this optimistic\" \"As long as we're all together, I guess we'll find a way to live, or survive\" Gustave said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... then... I guess I... no, we'll be staying\" Blake said as he turned to face Claire, who respectfully bowed to him \"I'm happy to hear that you made the right choice, my King\" she said \"Just keep your promise of not flattening or smothering them, please\" Blake said, and Claire couldn't help but giggle \"Of course\" she said. Then she glanced at a nearby clock \"It's been a while, your Majesty. I think it's best to take you back to your future wife\" Claire said \"Please don't say it like that, I'm starting to regret my choice\" Blake facepalmed \"You'll be fine\" Ayrton walked towards Blake and put a hand on his shoulder \"In any case, you know we'll always support you\" he added with a smile, and gave Blake a thumbs up, to which he replied with a thumbs up of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake hugged his friends, and said goodbye to them. Then he climbed into Claire's hand and left the room. He noticed that Claire went back to the room they had been in before \"Now what?\" He asked \"Please don't tell me you plan on sitting on me until you feel like taking me back...\" he said \"No\" Claire replied \"Although, that's a tempting idea\" she giggled \"I just wanted to ask you something else\" she added, and Blake nodded \"Go ahead... what is it?\" \"I know the Princess already carries you in her plentiful cleavage, but... has she done <i>something else</i>?\" She almost purred the last 2 words \"What the hell?\" Blake raised an eyebrow \"I wonder... if she's had you massage her royal bottom, or if she's let you rest on it\" Claire said, and Blake narrowed his eyes \"She's not you, you know?\" \"But it would be wonderful for her self-esteem. Ever since she learned that Karina was getting her a human husband, she became worried about her stature and weight\" Claire replied \"You wouldn't want her to get depressed and starve herself, right?\" Blake sighed, but shook his head \"Then let her know that you like her just the way she is. She needs to hear it from you...\" Claire whispered \"And if you massage her as you massaged me, I swear she will love you even more\" she giggled. Blake facepalmed again 'She's kind of right...' he thought, and blushed intensely, Claire observed this and giggled more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you've done that already! Good!\" She petted Blake's head with a finger \"Still, compliment her when you can, or offer to massage her sometime. She might be taller than human castles, but her heart is quite fragile. Please take care of her\" she added, which surprised Blake, who nodded, despite that \"I promise that you won't regret it\" she said with a genuine smile, and strangely, her eyes flashed in a blue light for a split second. Then, a light blue runic mark appeared on Blake's right palm \"If you need anything, just focus a bit of power on that mark\" Claire said \"It'll serve to call me. Feel free to request for my services whenever you want\" she whispered \"Thanks...\" Blake replied hesitantly</span></div></div>",

Blake facepalmed and decided not to push his luck any further. He noticed that Claire's chest didn't bounce as much as Joana's 'At least it's a quieter ride'  he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire went upstairs and went to the Princess' room, but before knocking on the door, she picked Blake out of her cleavage and gave him a quick kiss, then she knocked on the door, and Joana was rather quick to answer \"Oh, hi Claire!\" she greeted her \"I was just going to see if you were done with Blake. At least I had enough time to prepare our bath\" she giggled \"I just needed to ask him a few things\" Claire replied, and her look implied heavily that they needed a private talk, so, Joana invited her in and she gently put Blake on the bed \"Would you mind giving us a moment?\" Joana asked \"I don't mind. Go\" Blake replied, keeping a straight face to hide his embarrassment, as he could practically predict what their little private talk would be about. Joana and Claire walked out of the room and Joana closed the door behind herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Joana asked with a more serious voice and look \"I just asked Blake if he was truly aware of what he was getting into. Marriage and ruling our kingdom are commitments for life\" Claire replied \"Oh...\" Joana feared this conversation would go in a direction she wasn't going to like \"But don't worry, my Princess. He's ready\" Claire giggled \"I... I did offer him a last chance to escape together with his friends\" she confessed \"And he hesitated right from the start\" Claire added, and Joana raised an eyebrow \"He cares about your feelings, your Majesty. He didn't have the heart to abandon you after what you've been through. And we both know how much he valued his freedom\" She said, and Joana nodded in agreement, she had a slight smile \"I can tell he knew the right choice from the beginning, but didn't want to look weak-willed. He struggled against the idea, and against his own conscience, and couldn't take the decision to leave at all. In the end, he requested to go talk to his friends to tell them that he no longer felt like escaping, but that he'd free them upon becoming King\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hadn't thought about that\" Joana replied, surprised \"But his friends refused to leave him. They said that if Blake was making the choice to stay, they'd be by his side\" Claire then giggled some more \"They asked to be made his knights, and Blake agreed with that\" Joana smiled \"That's kind of beautiful... those guys have no obligation to stay here, and they know they'll be married to giants here, and yet, they prefer to stay together\" She commented \"The thing is, Blake has chosen to stay\" Claire remarked, and Joana blushed \"Your love and kindness did win him over in the end\" she said, and Joana blushed slightly harder \"But... as a personal suggestion... I think you should try and please him with your beautiful, plentiful curves\" Claire winked, and Joana's face was even redder \"Trust me. He'll love it. I've found that, at least some humans can become fascinated by our feminine anatomy\" Claire added with a slightly smug smile \"It must be even more so in the case of one that has giants' blood in his veins\" Despite her blushing, Joana nodded in agreement. Claire playfully patted Joana's hip and smiled \"I'm sure you'll be a wonderful Queen and wife\" She said \"Alright, I won't disturb you anymore. Have fun!\" Claire giggled as she left. Joana waved goodbye at her while her blushing returned, after a moment to cool down a little, she walked back to the room, and found Blake petting and playing with his cat, Tabitha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha was purring as she rubbed her head on Blake's torso while he petted her and scratched the back of her ears, she appeared to be in a bliss. However, when Joana closed the door, Tabitha got startled and looked at her with wide eyes, and her ears pointed straight up \"I guess she still doesn't trust me\" Joana chuckled \"Well... She's clearly not used to seeing giants... it'll get better over time. Heh, I'm not even one to speak... I'm still a little overwhelmed by seeing you\" Blake replied. Being surprisingly clever, even for a riding cat, Tabitha noticed the situation and got the hint, she reluctantly jumped off the bed and went to lie under it \"I hope that she didn't feel forced to leave you\" Joana said softly as she walked towards the bed with an extra spring to her step and noticeably swaying her hips. Blake's jaw almost dropped, but he quickly snapped out of it and looked away, deeply embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana stood right in front of the bed and Blake, she observed how she towered over him with no real effort 'I can only guess what is like to see things from his perspective' she thought, and gently picked Blake up in her hand 'I really hope Claire was right' she thought and put Blake in her cleavage \"I take it this will be your de facto means of transporting me, right?\" Blake said, and Joana giggled \"Well, I could try and think of <i>somewhere else</i> to put you in\" she whispered, and he gulped 'I really hope Joana isn't getting Claire's \"funny\" ideas' he thought \"I-It's fine. This is... pretty comfortable...\" he said, to try and stop her from thinking up more 'dangerous' things \"Thank my lack of a will to diet\" Joana giggled, and slightly pushed him into her cleavage with a finger before heading for her bathroom. The bathtub, which was closer to being a small pool, and a lagoon to Blake, was filled with cool, pristine water, scented by various essential oils from different kinds of flowers, some unknown to humans. A couple of strange glass orbs could be seen on the walls, they radiated a faint light, just enough to allow anyone to see, but without being too intense \"You know, we humans use something called candles for light\" Blake commented \"We use candles too, sometimes. But, Claire invented these things a few months ago and are much better. They only need a tiny amount of magic power and can illuminate for a very long time\" Joana explained \"Claire INVENTED those?\" Blake said in utter disbelief \"Yeah. She's our unofficial researcher, on her spare time she either studies or tries to come up with things to make our lives easier\" Joana said, and noticed where Blake was getting too \"She's a lot smarter than you probably believed\" she added \"Now that just got 10 times scarier\" Blake shuddered 'Could have she have coldly calculated everything? She seemed sincere when I was with her... but then again... if she's that smart, maybe she managed to fool me..' Blake thought \"She does have her quirks, I know, but she's a good friend\" Joana added and put Blake on the tub's edge (the 'tub' itself was more like a pool, Joana could fit comfortably there with room to spare).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sat at the edge of what looked like a fancy, yet absurdly enormous pool, and dipped his feet in the water. The temperature was just nice, fresh, but not too cold. Suddenly, a huge shadow covered Blake and his surroundings. The sheer size of the shadow gave Blake an idea of what it could be, and gulped hard, then he hesitantly turned around looked upwards \"What the friggin...?!\" He shouted, and yet, he covered his own mouth with his hand. Joana was bent over, right above him, and far closer than he'd be comfortable with \"...I hate Claire SO much right now...\" he mumbled and braced for the impact. He had endured Claire's full weight, but he had no idea how much heavier Joana would be. A few tense seconds passed... nothing... Blake opened his eyes and noticed that Joana was happily humming to herself, and apparently, she was taking her shoes and underwear off. He let out a very long and relieved sigh, and wiped some cold sweat off his forehead \"...I swear my heart skipped a bunch of beats just now...\" he mumbled and turned back to the pool. However, its reflection of Joana's gigantic butt above him didn't help him feel better at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though every second felt like several minutes, Joana finished fairly quickly, and took her shoes, stockings and underwear off. The moment she tossed said underwear aside, Blake almost fainted, and fell into the water. Due to being underwater, Blake failed to hear Joana giggling, although he was quickly taken out of the water by her hand \"What happened?\" Joana asked, trying hard not to laugh \"Nothing... I just wanted to swim a little\" Blake replied. Joana's eyes made it evident that she wasn't buying it \"W-Well... I... I just saw you naked...\" Blake said while looking away in shame \"I wasn't even looking on purpose, it was reflected on the water!\" He added, and Joana's look softened \"Why does it sound like you're defending yourself?\" she said \"Uh... because I am defending myself...\" Blake replied in a matter-of-factly tone \"Why?\" Joana asked again, and leaned closer to the edge of the bathtub, making her (bare) chest very visible to him \"...Because I'm trying to be a decent person...\" Blake said with some stuttering \"Are you still aware that we'll marry in like 2 days?\" Joana raised an eyebrow while Blake facepalmed \"I'm far from ready for this\" he said, and Joana lightly petted his head with the tip of her finger \"We're on the same boat. But it'll be something both of us will explore together\" She added, whispering rather seductively. Then she slowly, and gracefully, got into the bathtub, and placed Blake on her left breast \"Let's just relax and enjoy the bath\" she said \"If there's anything you want to talk about, I'm all ears\" she giggled. Blake gulped and glanced down at the water, it looked like he was on a fleshy island of sorts. He sighed and looked up at Joana's face...</span></div></div>",

Because when I was a kid, I knew about Megaman as the X Snes titles first, and even after I played some of the original Megaman series' games, I don't feel like knowing too much about it. I got to play the Zero saga as well, but it would be almost the same, and for some reason, I feel better with the X saga. Never played ZX, Legends or Battle Network. So, Megaman fans, please don't be angry at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leave the third choice free, since I didn't come up with another one.

But Blake doesn't like James and even feels angry when Joana acts protective toward James...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Joana (Blake's girlfriend)</b>: 18 years old beautiful girl (dark brown long wavy hair, hazel eyes,D-cups and a very big ass, fair skin). She met Blake in the first day of 7th grade and they've been together since 10th. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepending of the storyline she had become a giantess or she had found a way to get Blake to normal (shrink). She believes James jr. at first as her son and acts very motherly.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nJames (A.k.a James Jr., not Blake's father)</b>: Blake and Joana's future son. 17 years old. Identical to Blake excepting skin color (white as Joana), eyes and hair (hazel and light brown, as Joana). Slightly weaker than Blake and has a few less muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to the past to save his father from death (Blake sacrificed himself to save him and Joana, as his father did when he was very young) and finds that Blake actually isn't interested in parenting and in fact, Blake doesn't like very much James. Joana is very protective with him, almost as she is with Blake. He also has his own story (In the future) which is the special #1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Blaze</b>: Age unknown. Maybe centuries... A weird demon who likes to fight and has found in Blake a tough rival. He looks like a 16 years old boy with long white hair which cover his eyes. (Dark red but they can glow when Blaze's furious).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvil, sadistic, unresponsible and somewhat strange at his methods. He has the power (or technology) to shrink people, or also to make people giant (only works with females). He has superhuman strenght as he demonstrated when he fought giant Joana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso he has a lot of stamina and is difficult to hurt him. He also posseses dark powers and magic. Most of time he isn't serious at fights, But when Blake gets angry he reaches a level enough to cause damage to him (even when Blake doesn't get the same strenght, just adrenaline's effects). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe always looks the same and doesn't get old. He also appears as the enemy or villain in James' story, being the only one who knew Blake besides Joana, Karina and Ayrton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Future Joana</b>: 36 years old (Exclusive James' story). James' mother. She's very sad because Blake's death long ago. She's still a sexy woman and even she could have gotten sexier. Very motherly and protective, she might mistake James for Blake if the circumstances allow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Beatrix</b>: 16 years old, almost identical to Joana but she has longer and black hair, straighter, almost the same body (she possibly had more butt and less bust). Black eyes and a darker skin. James' girlfriend and Kyle's younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kyle</b>: 17, Strong muscular guy and James' best friend. He has blond hair and green blueish eyes (a strange color). Ayrton and Karina's son. He is somewhat stronger than James but has less skills. Anyway, he's always willing to help his friend. He uses to call him \"bro\" most of times. Beatrix is his little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondary Characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Karina (18 years old)</b>: A good friend of Joana and Blake, she's cute but isn't Blake's type. She doesn't seem to have more interest about him than friendship and she probably would help if Blake was in trouble (But Joana was the one who has done that the whole time). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlonde with green eyes and short hair. She's Ayrton's girlfriend. Longest female friend of Blake, they met at 4th grade and she was a fighting since those days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has still fighting skills depite she fights less to be more feminine, and helps Blake in fights where he's losing by physical disadvantages or numerical...Her body is possibly B cups and slim hips. Green eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Cinthya (19 years old)</b>: Beautiful and very popular latino girl who wanted Blake for herself and almost did it once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her feelings toward Blake now may go from still wanting him for her to hating him (she hates more to Joana). She has black hair, small boobs and a nice butt (Joana's is better but almost everyone in school drool for Cinthya's). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark brown eyes. Evil and likely to ally anyone to get Blake or to get vengeance on him or Joana, willing to everything. She has gone almost crazy since last year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Claire</b>: 18 years old. Blake's friend (since 3th year, second longest one since Karina). Very beautiful and the only one even Blake has thought could rival Joana. C-Cup breasts and a big butt (slightly smaller than Joana's, still better than Cinthya's). Her differences with Joana are that she has Asian-like black eyes which look very sensual, while Joana's are big, light brown and cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso,  though Joana's thighs are thicker, Claire's seem slightly thinner and longer, the other difference is that she has a bit of tummy (and Joana not, because she played volleyball and basketball, and not enough to be called fat, in fact, it makes her to look cute). She has black straight hair worn as a ponytail. She hugs and kisses Blake (in cheek) more often than Karina, causing Joana to be jealous of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she's aware Blake has a girlfriend, most of times she doesn't pay attention to it, as she only acts friendly. Her feelings to Blake have never been clear as she acted as protective as Joana in the time they didn't know each other. Some times it seems Joana wants to just kill her (And Blake has to appear to prevent it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's very likely to help and taking care of Blake, but due to her relationship with Joana, it's not very probable she'd give him back to her (She also acts some times jealous as Joana has a better body and is Blake's girlfriend)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ayrton</b>: 18 years old boy. Blake's second best friend (since secondary). Short and tanned. He fights along Blake sometimes but he really isn't a fighter, just an average guy. He's the one Blake trusts the most, only excepted by Joana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ferdinand</b>: 19 years old boy. Some sort of mixure between a goth and a nerd (He has practically the same intelligence level as Blake but he's better in Math and Physics while Blake's better than him in the rest of subjects). He's Blake's third best friend. And is STILL stupidly in love of Cinthya (Physic: a bit shorter than you,thin,dark brown curly hair).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Karen</b>: (18 years old): Nerd/Geek girl. Cinthya's friend and accomplice. she hasn't practically own will and does every thing that Cinthya tells her to. (red hair, small breasts and a very big butt. She's not really pretty because she's flabby and a bit fat). Blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Thania</b>: (17 years old): Average popular girl, Cinthya's friends but she's the least evil one. She is just a friendly girl (light brown wavy hair and body like Karina's, but she's shorter). Hazel eyes darker than Joana's<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lillian</b> (17 years old): A Joana's, Blake's and Ayrton's friend. She still has a crush on Blake. She's the tallest girl with long black hair, small but round breasts and a HUGE ass (biggest of those characters). Brown eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\n-No gay/lesbian stuff<br>\r\n-Joana's not evil.Even if she turns into a giantess.(The other characters can go free about their behavior to Blake or James)<br>\r\n-In James' story is allowed Joana to mistake James for Blake and treat him like that, but only because a drug or Blaze did it.<br>\r\n-No parents (Except special stories)<br>\r\n-If it's about ass just butt cheeks.<br>\r\n-Feet are ok but take on count that Blake and James don't like them more than an average boy.<br>\r\n-NO male interaction unless the male characters are both shrunk.<br>\r\n-In the special story #2 most of rules don't apply and just keep a understandable grammar and some content in chapters (not 3 lines-chapters please). Gay/Lesbian stuff is still NOT ALLOWED, but you can still do whatever in that line. I won't be editing much of it unless it's necessary.</td>",
