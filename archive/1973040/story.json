We have landed at Coordinates 50.26.60.05.07. just a ways from the temple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Journal Date 4M69.3-16#2: We have gained an strategic advantage by landing near a cliff overlooking the temple and the temple yard. The Research Team has set up riggings so we can get down the cliff. I am now descending the rigging. I have reached the bottom. We are in the yard and the temple is is dire need of repairs, hehe. Oh wait, these things will write down anything I say. CRA...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Journal Date 4M69.3-16#3: The Research Team found a way inside through the top of the temple. Now inside the temple, we now see that the material used by whoever used them is very complex. Getting readings of high amounts of helium along with aluminum and some other element even not found on Earth. The second in command is assembling a team to go deeper into the temple's lower levels. I am going with 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Journal Date 4M69.3-16#4: I just received word that the day is almost over. Feels like we've just been down here for hours. We will continue to explore and examine the temple tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Journal Date 4M69.3-17: New day, new discoveries. We continue to finish up our work from tomorrow. We are currently twenty-eight levels into the temple. Jesus, how many levels does this temple have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Journal Date 4M69.3-17#2: We have reached a massive door that appears to be locked. We will try to. FIRE IN THE HOLE! *boom* DAMNIT Jan, do you know how valuable this temple is worth to science? Nope. Great Jan, now you ruined the entire journal entries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Journal Date 4M69.3-17#3: Jan blew up the door and we now are seeing what we are not believing. The civilization that used this temple must of used it for less than religious reasons. Looks like the inside of a ship's bridge combined with a lower level that looks like the rest of the temple containing these weird pods. Further analysis indicate, Jan you screwed up one thing today, you better not screw up anything else. Further analysis indicates that, JAN DON'T PUSH THAT BUTTO<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Journal Date 4M69.3-17#4: Jan screwed up yet again. He pushed a button and then all electronics, even the strange ones, turned off. Jan what were you thinking. Hey guys, come look at this. What is it? One of the pods is broken, freshly broken too, like something was trying to escape. It wasn't like that when we found it. In fact, all of them weren't like that, except that one. What were those being using this stuff for anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Journal Date 4M69.3-17#5: OH CRAP! JESSICA'S DEAD! OH GOD! OH GOD! SHIT I'M OUT OF HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Journal Date 4M69.3-17#6: OK, so Drake bailed on us. It's ok, along as OH SHIT! What is it, oh, my, god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Journal Date 4M69.3-17#7: Something is trying to kill us. It is best to. AAAAAAAaaaaaaaaa.

Oh god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Journal Date 4M69.3-17#9: I AM RUNNING BACK TO THE LANDING SHIP! IT, IT KILLED EVERYONE! HOW, I'M OUT! DISTANCE ME FROM THE TEMPLE!

I'm trying to go with a 'NASA' style real world feel, with just a form of FTL drive the one 'magic' tech. So no gravity plating, shields, tractor beams, teleporters etc.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight sparkled gently in the distance as the metal object in view slowly grew. The faint sparks of light were the main attention, the gentle blues, greens and browns of the planet below barely noticed. The bubble canopy did at least give a great view as Peter Langstrom's transfer pod was manhandled by the remote guidance of the station's traffic control, though he had seen Earth from orbit too many times to be awestruck as most were whenever they saw such a world from up here. This kind of view was a stark contrast to his time on a Peregrine asteroid patrol boat. Those things were, like most pseudo warships of the Inner belt, a brick with all inhabited sections sealed in the center, seeing out only via cameras on view screens. It was nice to get the civvy 'full view' for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he leaned against the wall next to the canopy, one foot in a restraint to keep him stable against the gentle thrust of the pod, he kept his view ahead. Still hard to believe this was happening. Over a century and a half in space, dozens of probes to nearby systems, and the first alien they meet was actually more primitive than Earth. Hard to fathom really that they'd both developed to that position in so close a time period considering the age of the universe, though still so little was known about the Lenk. He sighed, knowing at least three quarters of his job would be managing relations. He'd been over the notes, the first contact reports, the scientific journals the lab boys back on Ceres had done, but actually being here? Working with these 'people?' This would be... different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course the eyes of all of Sol would be on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Final approach. All crew fasten seatbelts.\" Came the automated soft toned voice from the control system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanstrom snorted. He'd flown all kinds of ships in his sixty years in space and he'd be damned if he'd clamp down now. He stayed up against the wall but did loop one hand through another strap to keep him in place along with him resting on the wall itself. Three points of contact and all. Besides, he was the only one on this pod. It was hardly mandatory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the tiny glints of light coalesced into a visible form. Mostly it wasn't being so far away, it was just the angle of the light made it difficult to make out much. Now, as he got closer, more of the curve of the station's hull came into view, a dull cylinder, slightly shorter than it was wide, spinning slowly. That was deceptive he knew. The thing was over a kilometer wide, though a lot of that space was the autofacs, cargo shunts and storage depots. The thing hadn't been assembled here, the frame had been brought in by jump freighter then fitted out. The official line was it's purpose was joint meeting spot and orbital rendezvous for trade. He still felt odd about that. The locals had been in space for less than a decade. Them trading for advanced Sol gear? Sounded awful fishy to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes the pod closed in, slowly decelerating the entire time, then puffs of vapor filled his view as it circled. He chuckled as the pod jinked, twisted, then bobbed in place, aligning to the docking bay in the center. He knew those maneuvers hardly needed to be that awkward. Someone on the control board over there was trying to dislodge him. He tightened his grip and tensed his foot and managed to keep stable. Who ever it was seemed to calm down once he'd seen nothing was resulting from his antics. He made a mental note to check the logs later to see who was in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light dimmed as the pod entered the bay, sliding slowly inside then gently turning to present it's rear to the inner wall. With a soft clunk the pod sealed against a connection airlock and the 'Docked' light popped up overhead. He chuckled at that too. For some reason no matter how advanced the displays, holoprojectors and other gizmos got, emergency displays were still two color back-lit panels. Supposedly for redundancy and making it almost entirely solid state. 'Can't fail' were words engineers hardly ever used for fear of the Titanic effect. 'Unsinkable' indeed. However in this case those things were claimed to be able to run with the whole rest of the ship shattered and ripped apart. They didn't quite claim they could survive a nuclear blast, but close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tap on the wall the hatch gurgled as the airlock cycled, then the inner door popped out and slid into the ceiling. With practiced grace Langstrom pushed forward and floated across the airlock. The thing swung shut behind him and cycled, surprisingly quickly in fact. In barely two seconds the far hatch was opening. He hoped corners hadn't been cut on systems. Hazard checks should be standard during the cycle. Another note for later checking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain on deck!\" Came from inside as he nodded and floated inside, seeing the three people in the standard deep blue Sol Navy uniforms waiting for him. He grabbed the side rail and pulled himself to the floor, his grip soles contacting the central walkway and sticking as the welcoming committee saluted him. He saluted with his free hand and gave the formal greeting since time immemorial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Permission to come aboard Commander?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Permission granted sir.\" The tall blonde man said smiling \"Commander Archibald Flemming, acting commander of Space Station Alpha.\" He motioned to his left to the woman with the white shoulder patch who nodded politely \"This is Doctor Drishti Chakrabarti, head of medical and bio-research.\" He then indicated the stocky man to her left. \"And this is Phillipe Anders, Anthropology and Linguist. Chief Engineer Masters wanted to greet you too, but we have some issues with the filtration system. It seems there is some kind of semi-annual pollen bloom and the last shuttles up from the planet brought too much up with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLangstrom blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. This place had been operational, what? Three months? There are quarantine procedures still active aren't there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlemming coughed and licked his suddenly dry lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We. Ah... have been pushed pretty hard by Central command to get things going quickly. We're supposed to have a full spaceport just outside the city of Keerasto up and running within the week. We had a grade four site going up till a month ago when we started upgrading and it's been shut down since then limiting us to light shuttles. Now... well, suffice to say things are behind schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. It would seem there has been a great deal missed from my mission briefing. Commander, schedule an hour for full update on the current planetary situation ASAP. Bring whatever experts you need in, virtually or in person, I don't care. But make sure you have all needed information available.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension was definitely higher as he was escorted to the main elevator down to the artificial grav sections on the outer rim. It looked like he'd have his work cut out for him even before he met the locals!</span></div></div>",

They don't use chairs at all and we've had to adapt most of our bathroom fittings to be compliant... and comfortable. It's safe to say so far all of the zero-g facilities on the shuttles are not safe for Lenk in the slightest. We've updated all access panels to show flashing 'Not Lenk Compatible' signs until the lab boys get things sorted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the political scene?\" Peter asked. \"Last I heard they had managed some form of coalition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... not exactly.\" Professor Anders said, blinking a few times rapidly to himself. Probably updating his tab on something. So many people still used reflexive controls for their tab implants. Langstrom's were fully mentally controlled. Allowed him to keep eye contact firmly while still shifting through data on his internal HUD. \"Shortly after First Contact a year ago they did get an organization together from fifteen of the twenty odd nations on Alpheese. However it was hardly a success. Seven pulled out a few months later, attempting to contact us separately. Things have not gone well since. I'm honestly surprised you don't know all this already sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLangstrom sighed. This meeting was getting a lot of sighs it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comms on the SIG have been restricted. Outgoing from here at least. Surely you keep up to date on the networks? Have you seen any news regarding Alpheese and the Origaniss system?\" The scientist frowned and shook his head. Peters sometimes wondered how these 'experts' kept at the head of their field they were so out of touch. \"The Grid has been clamoring for info on the aliens for the last year. Very little beyond physiological data and a few nation names has come out. The Inner Alliance and Earth Operations both have clamped down hard. I have no idea how they managed to persuade the belts and outer system to comply, but they apparently have. So far none of the Sol governments have been questioning the silence, just the populace.\" He glanced slowly around the room, filled with eighteen specialists of one form or another, some hear in person, others projections. \"I don't suppose you have any idea the reason for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe various faces looked puzzled, and mostly just shook their heads in silence. Doctor Chakrabarti shook her head more vehemently, though sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Sol leaders are clamming up huh? Why does that not surprise me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have an angle on this Doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only that it's the same thing anything new comes around. The Co-Ecs, the Sens, the committees. They all have been trying to stamp on the SIG networks since it was founded. Up till Higgs they never were successful. The last fifty years though... well, probably thirty. Before that Higgs drives were just too expensive to do much for most folk. Now? They've been cornering the market connecting the local networks with FTL jump transfers and establishing choke points. Now they have their grubby little mitts on all the info they need, and keeping it out of the proles hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh. One of those. Her accent sounded like one of the Outer Belts, or perhaps Outsystem. Where ever she was from (it was blank on her resume, Peter had checked) they obviously had no love of the in-system governments or controls on the System Information Grid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, I'll thank you to curtail unsupported rumors to yourself.\" Langstrom said with a scowl, making another note in his tab to look closer in on her background.  \"However in some regards you are correct. I know that at least some Government organisations are directly blocking information coming from the Higgs jumps from Origaniss. Others aren't, but still information is lacking. As I said I'm not sure how these blocks are being enabled, but they are. Honestly I understand why. People already over-reacted when contact was made, even with the sparse info available. Now they fear various organisations using data on the Lenk as leverage for their particular soapbox or policies. You know how the Earth Coalition is, let alone the defense grids and Earth Operations. They don't want any funding pulled from their corner. No-one wants another Ellison Incident, but they also keep attempting to cut funding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asteroid Defense 'Earth Operations' field was one of his personal gripes, and it's perpetual lack of funding. With so much of the populace now in Habitats around the system you'd think they'd be more open to spending to map and re-direct asteroids that were dangerous? But things had never been easy for Operations, despite some nasty incidents, that some scaremongers still insisted weren't real but faked up just to give credence to Earth Operations' necessity. Idiots! Probably still Flat Earthers. How those people still existed in this day and age still bemused him, even off Earth apparently! Claimed the transports were faked with holographic windows to hide the truth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. It was too easy to get his mind focused on such stupidity. He'd had to deal with too much of it in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as that affecting us... I'm told the Alliance will be maintaining current funding so that shouldn't be an issue... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommander Anders was looking decidedly frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maintaining funding? Our budget has been cut three times in the last month, the resupply ships have been coming less frequently, and all requests for a dedicated jump transport here have been denied. This was supposed to be a shining beacon of our interaction with our first neighbors! Now we're being starved of resources and told to 'make do' until things are sorted out. What needs sorting out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was news to Langstrom. He knew things would be a little tight here, but to cut funding so soon after setting up the station? This place was supposed to eventually have a full station with out-rider facilities handling larger transports directly. A complete stop point for any in coming transports. Had that all been put on hold?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh he continued with the meeting. It seemed his time in charge here would be more political than he expected. And he hadn't even met any of the locals yet!</span></div></div>",

She can be happy, perky, giggly, hyperactive, excited and very enthusiastic. However she's capable of great focus, diligence, patience and understanding, and uses her high intelligence to assess the situation rationally, calm and composed as a Government scientific representative. She enjoys some 'girly' things, like pink, fashion, unicorns, and dolls, however it tends to mesh with her more lively pursuits, those of science and technology, robotics, machinery and invention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInventions she has patented: <br>\r\n-Flexitech, the stretchy sleek material for a skin-tight nano tech suit for stealth, it can bend light but can also contort and alter itself to fit the wearers needs. It sometimes malfunctions.<br>\r\n-A helmet with a program that lets one access peoples mind and see inside their thoughts and memories and possibly do more, currently missing.<br>\r\n-Programmable Investigative Nano Kernel, or P.I.N.K. is the experimental AI system she created. Currently in testing and subservient to the Ship's main computer, does not have access to all it's functions or controls.<br>\r\n-Delta-7, an advanced automated sentinel robot made for security. Bulky and large, it remains in storage and would only be accessible through PINK. Is also mountable with a co-pilot if they have access to ride in it.<br>\r\n-And finally, a top-secret satellite system embedded in all international software around orbit. When given the codes, the user is allowed full control to all protocol and databases. This can include world-wide control of all intercontinental weapons circling  around the planet, and unlimited information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfile: Melanie was always a bright starchild from her earliest days, always tinkering around with her toys and gadgets, making moving parts and teaching herself how to build. A child prodigy, she didn't fit in with other students, especially girls who only cared for games and dolls. The only dolls she built, had gears and later knives to match. This distressed her lone mother greatly, but the child's genius was able to bring money and sustain them for awhile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, International officers showed up at Malloy's residence one day, confiscated and gently interrogated Melanie. They found it a security risk, and rather unsound for a 10 year old girl to have stockpiles of weapons and machinery manufactured in the sanctity of her own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom than on, she was recruited by a highly secretive and advanced research department where she could channel her skills and uses for the world, instead of against it like they feared. Transferred from base to base for four years, she now joins the Station Alpha research team in space to pursue her own research, and is allowed free access and board to it aswell so long as she's employed there. </span></div></div>",

The first was rather short, just under a meter and a half, and they wore a pair of worn cargo pants and a bulky jacket whose sleeves swallowed their arms in blue fabric. An old, somewhat tattered cap with a bear on the front rested atop a short, scruffy head of brown hair; their face was smudged with such an incredible amount of dirt and dust and oil marks that their blue eyes stood out brightly against the rest of the mess. It was hard to decipher whether this person was male or female, but they seemed quite at home as they looked about with an air of observation and examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is even better than I thought it would be. Everything's all shiny and top of the line. I wouldn't be surprised if the big tech giants have contracts for all over this place! And any place this big will need plenty of well-to-do hands to keep it running, of course. Let's get this bio thing over with so we can look around before the big crowds come rushing in.\" The person shifted the old, worn backpack on their shoulders and motioned to their companion to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis second person was a towering brute of a man, just over two meters and muscled like a bodybuilder. He wore a standard blue jumpsuit, the basic uniform offered to all engineering employees, and his black hair was trimmed very short and out of his brown eyes. Though he had some dirt about him, too, he was significantly cleaner than the shorter person that he plodded after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first arrived at a terminal, they pushed up their sleeves so they could enter the required information. \"Name... Birth place? Whatever...Uh, age... Current job? Engineering...\" They turned and squinted up at the man. \"I, uh, better enter your information too. Don't want you to break the keyboard, you big brute.\" He shrugged indifferently and looked out the window at the moon in the distance in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Taylor Wood<br>\r\nBirth Place: United States<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nCurrent Job on Station: Engineer, General Class (specializations in wiring, robotics, and machine regulation)<br>\r\nTalents: Repairs, Upgrades, Engineering, Robotics, Mechanics, Tinkering<br>\r\nBackground: Born to an average family in the slums of the East Coast, Taylor spent their youth amidst metalworking and electronic factories, and came to develop a fascination for all things technological. Their short stature allowed them to get into tight spaces no one else could fit in, and they quickly became a mechanical savant with an eye for repairs and upgrades and an appetite for engineering knowledge and next-gen tech. Taylor came to Space Station Alpha to work and learn and to find a place to perhaps call home.<br>\r\nFeatures: 142 cm tall, blue eyes, brown hair. White skin, quite pale.

He took factory jobs and physical labor work as early as 10 in order to pay bills and help his single mother put food on the table for everyone. He still sends half of his earnings back home to help keep things going, though he's become very attached to Taylor as an older brother and protector.<br>\r\nFeatures: 208 cm tall, brown eyes, black hair.
