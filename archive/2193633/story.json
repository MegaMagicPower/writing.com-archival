She knows that the only way that her feet are going to get cleaned is if someone does it for her. She throws you to the ground and demands that you get to work in licking her feet clean. Her feet are very big, probably around size 12 and she had been wearing no shoes the whole day. She tells you to start at the heel and work your way up to the toes, licking up all the sweat and dirt as you go! You comply in fear of your life and clean the whole sole of  her foot lick after lick. The sole itself takes at least 20 minutes to clean and you\u2019re already on a full stomach because of all the sweat you have digested. </span></div></div>",

After about 30 minutes of smelling her dirty stinky toes it\u2019s time for you to get to work in cleaning! She tells you to start by licking in between each toe and collecting every bit of toe jam, before swallowing it like a good boy! When she spreads her toes for you you can see huge lumps of toe jam lodged in between them and it\u2019s your job to eat it! You get to work and start eating the toe jam one by one, but there is so much toe jam there that you don\u2019t know if you can eat it all at once.

It also seems all the other nasty executions The Entity's minions are not able to suffice. It has just the solution, The Entity referred to it as the Voracious Memento Mori.

What could be more miserable then getting slowly digested alive within a killers stomach. It was simply genius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow onto the hard part, there was only one for now and there are so many candidates to choose from among the roster.
