It would be cold.  Finding work would keep her warm.  She left messages on both Penelope's and Venetta's phones.  She would have a short, quick meeting where she would give them the copies of her itinerary. at 8:30.  While she waited, Chrystal returned phone calls, read correspondence, and other busy small tasks.  She also chose Arletta Symons to step into her shoes in her absence.  It was Arletta who arrived first.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"Good Morning, Miss Porter,\" Arletta said on her way to her office.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"Good Morning Arletta.

Chrystal saw her but wasn't able to get her attention.  Within minutes, Chrystal's phone began ringing.  Two lines simultaneously.   The first line was Arletta.confirming her attendance at the meeting.  Within seconds,she answered another line.  On the other end was Penelope.  She also confirmed her attendance.  Vernetta came to Chrystal's office early for the meeting.  Soon the other women arrived.  After closing the door, Chrystal sat behind her desk and began to speak to Arletta.  While they were immersed in conversation, Penelope and Vernetta talked quietly among themselves. </font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">Arletta left and returned to her office.  After she departed, Chrystal closed the door and returned to her desk.  Opening a drawer in a file cabinet, she entered a combination and opened a safe that looked like a pickle jar.  She took out the copies of her trip's itinerary.  Handing one each to Penelope and Vernetta, she told them she would  be leaving the next morning.  She would be in the air by 8:00, barring any delays or cancellation </font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">The rest of the day went on without incident.

Maybe it was too little sleep or the stress of everything, and excess caffeine had not compensated for it...obviously! Her hands shook with her knees keeping them company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I shouldn't be driving,</i> she thought. She turned the ignition off and pulled the key out of the lock. She stood by the car for a while, trembling. <i>I'd better go back in, and calm down a bit.</i> She locked the car and stumbled on wobbly legs, back into the building, into her office. Just as soon as her fingers found the light switch, she felt her knees buckle. Then everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came to, she saw her handbag next to her, its contents spilled on the parquet floor: lipstick, blush, hand sanitizer, wallet, cellphone, her passport and airline ticket to Austria. She raised herself on all fours and shoved everything back into her pocketbook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she sat on the floor and listened to her heart beat.<i> I need to calm myself</i> She shut her eyes and thought of her destination, Linz, Austria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe somehow felt she knew a lot more about the place than she gave herself credit for. Linz, now a modern, successful city by the Danube, on the north-central Austria, had been a key location in the Austrian Civil War. It was the town where Hitler had spent most of his childhood. She shivered and opened her eyes. Hitler's name alone was enough to give her the chills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, Linz was said to be a wonderful city. There always was something in the air of such places that gave the impression of temples of age, faith, and power, but at the same time, fright and terror. This puzzled her. What was it about religion, or worse yet, any extreme belief that scared her? Maybe power scared her. Religions had always been about, at some level, about power. Yet, in Linz, power had manifested itself in great art and civilization, to be paid by the blood of millions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid to go there,\" she murmured. Was her fears were because of a repressed memory or the effects of what she read in historical fiction? She stood up, grinning at her own silliness. Surely, she, too, had some powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had beauty, intelligence, good heart, and despite this unexplained panic attack, a cool mind. Once, a palm reader had told her she was psychic, also. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrystal acknowledged inwardly that she was too smart, too practical, and that she knew how to wield her powers. She could survive anywhere. She would go on this trip without any second thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched her hand to the light switch to turn the light off, but before she could do that, she heard rapid footsteps outside. She whirled around to the door, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What if the plane crashes? What if I get run over on the way there? What if it's a-a-a trick!\"<br>\r\n She sat down on her sofa and breathed quite heavily, trying not to let herself pass out. She plopped her head to the left side and it lay crooked on her shoulder. She looked at her watch. She gasped.<br>\r\n   \"What if I get up there and my luggage isn't there? Oh, that would be the end of me!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n          It was now 8:45 PM as she lay on her couch with a bag of ice on her head. The doorbell rang.<br>\r\n   \"What the heck do you want?\" she yelled out, facing the ceiling. <br>\r\n  The doorbell rang again. She shuffled over to the door unsteadily. She reached out to open the door, but was startled to see a face that she was fairly familiar with scrunched up against the window. She opened the door.<br>\r\n   \"Penelope?\" she asked, staring at the figure in front of her. \"What are you doing here? I just want to be alone.\"<br>\r\n   \"I sensed you needed my help when you sent me a text message saying, <i>I'm going to die. Just let me DIE!</i>.\" She smiled unsure whether Chrystal was about to kill her there and then. \"Why do you look so angry and upset?\"<br>\r\n   \"Oh, I'm just an emotional wreck who's turning fifty.\" She gasped again. \"What if everyone makes fun of me for being an old lady? What if they use the stupid 'Over the Hill' joke! What will I do? God, why am I going through this! I'm going to stay here!\"<br>\r\n   \"No you are not! You need a vacation. Who cares if someone calls you fat or something?\"<br>\r\n   \"Why would someone call me fat?\" There was an awkward silence. \"You think I'm fat?\" Penelope watched, ashamed of herself, as Chrystal's tears rolled down her cheeks, but got mad at Chrystal for wiping her nose and her tears on Penelope's brand new shirt. <br>\r\n Penelope patted her on the back and whispered in her ear, \"You're going.\"<br>\r\n</font></span></div></div>",

In a moment, she turns the ignition and starts the engine, setting the GPS on for her trip to the airport. and heads out of the parking lot onto Tairs\u2019Avenue. <br>\r\n She noticed the freeway wasn't as busy as she thought it would be, as if a way was being smoothed out for her.  Her tummy was still in knots but was feeling more excitement than anxiety now. She arrived at the airport in good time, parked and went to check her ticket. Even that line was quick moving.  She found a Salad Bar Caf\u00e9 and decided she better try to eat something .  She had a croissant with salmon and a salad, rather surprised that she was that hungry.    As she sat, she observed other travellers, some alone and others in pairs or groups.  Some were rushing as she usually did when doing business trips.  Others were sauntering while waiting.  She wondered if any, like her, had inner voices that urged them on to adventure.  By 7:30 pm she was in the  first class lounge  just in time to hear the call to board.  She was amazed at how smoothly everything was going. <i>It's really happening.</i>She whispered to herself, half in awe that she was actually going! She passed her ticket and passport to the gate attendant, who greeted her with a smile. Then she walked down the rickety tunnel that joined platform to her plane. She felt giddy and almost tripped on the uneven step into the plane.  A blue uniformed flight attendant steadied her and pointed her to the first class section, where she stowed her bag, minus her journal and a pen and mp3 player full of inspirations, in the compartment and took the window seat C15. She breathed out as she realized she had been holding her breath. In half a hour they were in the air for the transatlantic flight. <i>No way to turn back now.</i> She breathed, smiled and put her hand to allay the butterflies in her stomach.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At various intervals, pleasant bell tones indicated various milestones: internet usage, the dimming of the seatbelt sign, the captain activating the intercom to advise everyone of the flight's status as they started to cross the Atlantic. As the captain discussed their arrival in Vienna, Chrystal opened her eyes and stretched her left leg into the aisle. She knew she'd be spending a lot of time sitting before arriving in Linz and made a note to stretch whenever possible. When she felt more settled, she reached into the bag near her feet and pulled out a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say cover art is so much better when it's printed on an actual book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrystal turned to face the source of the voice, which happened to be the gentleman sitting next to her. His brown hair was combed to one side, a style that drew attention to the minimalist black eyeglasses and warm hazel eyes. She couldn't tell his age from his looks, but she did wonder what he was doing in first class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" she finally responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm John, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gentleman extended his hand, and despite her hesitance Chrystal shook it. \"Chrystal. Where are you headed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vienna. Business meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn half-chuckled. \"Well, I'm a oil futures analyst by day, and by night I study letterpress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" Chrystal hummed. \"That's certainly an unexpected combination. What got you into letterpress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was helping a friend with wedding invitations, which his fianc\u00e9e insisted had to be letterpress they did themselves. The problem is, my friend had been in a car accident and had a broken arm. It took him quite a while to rebuild the strength needed to do all the work for letterpress. Too bad bad that all went to Hell when he found his wife cheating on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, John shrugged. \"I'll be honest, I didn't like her much and think my friend got the better end of the deal. As for the letterpress stuff, he bought all the equipment and gave it to me after he broke up with his fianc\u00e9e. Since I had all that stuff lying around my apartment, I decided to keep working with it and run a small operation on the side, about a couple dozen orders per year at the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose your work in the oil industry keeps you plenty busy with little time for hobbies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can. The business meeting is being held in conjunction with OPEC's summit, so I won't actually get to see much of Vienna aside from various conference rooms. How about you? I imagine your plans for the city are much more entertaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually headed to Linz,\" Chrystal told him. \"It's my first stop in a world tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any reason for the tour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just turned 50 and needed a break from my job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the CEO of New Heights Magazine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow. That's got to be a job and a half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, indeed, which is why I'm getting away for a while. I started there just over 30 years ago, shuffling papers and scheduling meetings for the health editor. Rewarding work, but exhausting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like neither one of us understand the concept of getting rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrystal laughed then covered her mouth when she realized how loud she was. John gave her a small smile as she settled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...why Linz?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of music. I've always been a big fan of music but was never any good at it. When I was in school, I befriended a number of musicians, and they played recordings of symphonies and operas performed in Linz. It was wonderful. Now I'll have a chance to experience these performances for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating. Any other plans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't decided yet. I'll see when I get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn smirked. \"Well, I went to Linz once when I was in college. I was backpacking with a few friends, and they all wanted to go to an electronica festival there that summer. I wasn't especially thrilled about it but made the most of our stay. From what I can remember, I'd say you ought to consider...\"</span></div></div>",

She didn't have any reservations booked, she had planned to play it by ear, so maybe she could check out the Haltestelle z'Oftering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailing a taxi from outside the airport, she asked to go to the Oftering. She was glad she spoke a little German from her many business trips. She was even happier to discover the taxi driver spoke good English. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Yannick,\" he said as he pulled away from the taxi rank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrystal.\" Her stomach tied itself in knots. She had no idea how to do this as herself. Usually, she was Chrystal Porter, CEO of New Heights Magazine, and it was a role she played really well. But as just plain old Chrystal Porter, middle aged woman, travelling on her own, things were different. She felt as though she were a failure because she was on her own, and it made her anxious. She swallowed, in an attempt to quell the butterflies that filled her tummy. If only the driver could just drive and not speak. If she opened her mouth to reply, she might not be able to control what comes out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taxi weaved its way through traffic, and the smell of petrol fumes coming through the driver's open window churned her stomach even further. Eventually the taxi came to a long, straight road with tall oak trees, overhanging and making it feel like they were entering a tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are nearly there now,\" said the driver, looking at her in the rear view mirror. His green eyes sparkled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" She nodded and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is your first time to z'Oftering?\" His voice was low and rich and reminded her of her father's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelaxing her shoulders a little, she shuffled in her seat. \"Yes. It's my first time to Linz, actually. I've been to Austria many times on business, mostly Vienna. But never Linz.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I see. And it is business why you are in Linz now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. No, I'm going on an adventure, actually. I've reached a certain . . . age . . . and I decided if I didn't see the world now, I never will.\" The butterflies disappeared as she spoke of her round the world adventure. The taxi driver nodded and listened to her plans. \"I guess that sounds pretty silly,\" she said at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Miss. Not silly. I think it sounds brave. I once travelled a lot. I drove the yellow taxi cabs in New York for a year. Until I moved on to London and took  the test they call 'The Knowledge.' Yes,\" he laughed a throaty, smoky laugh, \"I've driven the taxi all over the world in many cities. But now I am home, and here I will stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrystal leaned forward in her seat, with the seatbelt digging into her neck. \"Wow. That sounds so exciting. Tell me, where is your favourite place to drive? I bet they're all really different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are, Miss. But everywhere I drive, people have their story to tell. I hear so many stories, I could write books. Tragedy and joy, excitement and sadness. People all over the world, they are the same, you know. Different versions of the same.\" He paused, lost in his thoughts. \"In answer to your question, my favourite place is here. Home. I was born in Linz and I will die here. Home holds you heart dear\u2014oh, here we are. The Halstelle z'Oftering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of Chrystal, sat a two storey building in an L-shape, with burgundy cladding all around the lower level. \"Thank you,\" she said to the taxi driver, as he retrieved her bags from the boot. A trickle of excitement ran thought her veins as she opened the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her friends at her job threw her a surprise birthday party at her favorite restaurant,<i>Valenti's</i>, last weekend.  If she didn't do it now, she'd lose her nerve.
