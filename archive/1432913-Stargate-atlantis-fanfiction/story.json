The trees were thick around them, but he could make out the lights of a nearby village. \"All right,\" He adressed the team, \"Let's get over there before the sun sets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team made good time traveling through the forest, and soon they reached the moderately large village. A young girl stood at the entrance. She wore slightly tattered clothing and cloth boots that were much to big for her. Her eyes widened as she spotted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Elieen. Are you the people Weir spoke of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheppard nodded, and the girl clapped to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Here,\" A boy, no older than thirteen and who looked as he could be Elieen's older brother, slowly walked up to them and stood next to her. \"This is Raye. He can take Beckett to Cristi. Erm... Which of you is Beckett?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson gave a slight wave and smiled. \"Here.\" He said with a thick Scottish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Raye will take you to Cristi. She's sick.\" A faraway gleam entered her eyes. \"I just hope you can make her better.\"<br>\r\nAfter a second, she continued. \"I can take the rest of you to the Tavern, you look tired from your long trek through the woods. Come!\" And Elieen hurried away. Raye took Carson's hand and was pulling him onto one of the smaller cobblestone streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you then,\" Carson said, before turning a corner and dissapearing from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaye let go of Carson Dr. Beckett. \"We're almost there. Cristi's house is just up here.\" They came to a stop at a slightly small house. It wasn't particularly fancy, but it was friendly-looking, with flowerboxes in the windows. Raye opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeckett stepped through. In the middle of the room, a teenage girl lay in a bed. She appeared to be asleep, but she was sweating and her face was very pale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson dropped his medical supplies bag beside him and checked her pulse. It was irregular. As he opened his bag, Carson heard a noise behind him, but he firgured it was Raye following him in.<br>\r\nThen a sharp pain exploded near the base of his skull and Carson fell unconcious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
