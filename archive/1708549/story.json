            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>'Life just seems determined to keep me from having any sort of happy ending.'</i> Sakura thought sourly. Despite being the only woman on the most powerful team of three in existence at the time, having been invaluable at multiple points during the fourth shinobi war and having unwaveringly backed both of her fellow teammates through thick and thin... neither one of them would give her the time of day anymore. <i>'Well, in all fairness Sasuke never really gave me the time of day anyways, so that shouldn't come as a surprise.'</i> And if it came down to it, what had caught Sakura off guard wasn't that Sasuke was ignoring her. Rather it was WHY he was still ignoring her that got under the medical ninja's skin.  As soon as he had been absolved of his crimes Ino had been all over him. The poor boy had fallen under her charms so fast that Sakura wished she could blame it on some kind of genjutsu. No such luck, and Sakura would know. She'd always had a good sense for the mind trickery of genjutsu... well after that first embarrassing brush with Kakashi-sensei at least. No, Sasuke had been taken in by nothing more then a beautiful body and clever feminine wiles utilized by a spoiled brat who had started to flirt with anything that had a dick and a heartbeat the moment that Sasuke left the village! <i>'Breathe Sakura, it's alright. You always knew Ino was targeting him, you shouldn't be so mad that she took advantage of the situation the moment that an opportunity presented itself.'</i> It didn't really help much. Sakura had only ever yielded to Naruto's requests for a date on extremely rare occasions, and had made no effort whatsoever to actually pursue anyone else while Sasuke was gone. She had shown infinitely more patience and loyalty then the pig ever had. But as a direct result of her own abstinence from the dating scene as a whole and Ino's endless practice, Ino had the skills to capture the heart of Sasuke while Sakura was closer to a clumsy bull in a china shop in comparison! <i>'I need to stop thinking about those two. This stress and anger cannot be good for me.'</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her mind was still stuck on the whole infuriating situation.  Sakura and Ino had actually gotten fairly close while Sasuke was... out of town. They had shared all kinds of secrets, gone on more then one shopping spree, and spent so many girls night outs together that Sakura could have picked out Ino's best \"dress to kill\" dating outfit blindfolded. And a pitiful part of that knowledge was an understanding of just how much better of a body Ino had. Sakura looked dejectedly down at her own, still nonexistent chest and sighed. <i>'I could actually get away with not even wearing the A-cup bras I buy. I should know too, I've done it on more then one occasion and even with the Sharingan or Byakugan, it doesn't matter, nobody has ever even suspected.'</i> By comparison, Ino almost always used her cunning to minimize the presence of her rather large rack. Most would think her a C-cup at best, and Sakura couldn't even count the number of stores she'd seen start off by offering Ino that size... but the boar is hiding a set of breasts that require E-cup bras to hold them. Add in the pig's sizable rump and the difference in their figures couldn't be any more clear. In spite of every trick and tip known to medical ninjutsu for improving her figure, Sakura's own three measurements are still absolutely boyish. <i>'Well, that killed all the rage at least... but now I'm just depressed.'</i> Needing something to do, Sakura picks herself off of her bed and picks up the latest in a long list of scrolls for jutsus that are supposed to have miraculous effects for improving a woman's figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reads it her mind turns to her other teammate. While Sasuke himself wasn't a shock to find acting cold toward her, Naruto had shown a crush on her which Sakura had thought would never end. For years she had been praying for the idiot to just give it up, and now that he had she found that she missed the attention and the confidence that it had given her to know that no matter what happened she could always rely on Naruto's affections. <i>'Never giving up was supposed to be your ninja way you useless idiot. And you almost had me too... After Hinata confessed during Pain's attack I felt so jealous that Naruto reacted to her so strongly. I couldn't believe that she drew that kind of raw emotion out of the man who had always followed me around like a puppy.'</i> If Sakura were to be completely honest with herself, she had developed quite the crush on Naruto in return for his old one. His persistence, charm and kindness had changed her view of him more then it had effected anyone else's heart regarding the kuckleheaded ninja. But she had waited far too long, by the time she'd realized this she'd already lost the boy to Hinata... the shyest and most reserved woman in the entire village. <i>'Of course, she made some really good moves... For example, how on earth was I supposed to compete with that confession!?'</i> Sakura finished the scroll she'd been reading and put it up in frustration, knowing another dead end when she sees one. She picked out another scroll from the stack, this one a B-rank medical ninjutsu. It easily had the highest rank among all the scrolls that she'd taken to look over this time, but she'd seen others at its rank or higher that were a bunch of lies. Still, it's worth a look over at the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she starts to read she continues comparing herself with Hinata... a comparison that quickly grows even more frustrating then the comparison with Ino. Ino at least has to know how to make the most of her body to be considered one of the most beautiful women in Konoha, but Hinata could roll out of bed and beat Ino's very best effort. <i>'If Hinata were to take making herself beautiful as seriously as Ino does, forget Konoha, she'd be one of the most beautiful in the world.'</i>  From the pretty eyes to the shy smile to the F-cup... or bigger... breasts to the silky hair to the slender feet.  It really doesn't matter, go ahead just pick a feature, and Hinata's got Ino beat hollow. It was sad enough trying to compare herself with Ino, but in terms of physical attractiveness, Sakura doesn't even belong in the same sentence. As the Hyuga princess that is now dating her Naruto. <i>'DAMN IT ALL!!!! Why won't anything actually work!? I just want to find a way to get at least some kind of curve going for myself. Is that really too much to ask!?'</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile raging in her own mind, Sakura reaches out into the pile sitting beside her again, desperate for some kind of solution. What she finds as she pulls this blindly selected out of the pile gives her a considerable shock. The distinctive color and seal on this scroll indicate that she's holding an S-rank forbidden jutsu. She drops it as though she'd been bitten by a snake, confident that she didn't purchase anything like that. But still, it was in her pile, and all S-rank jutsu's are powerful. Even if it won't help her with her primary problem it'll be worth the effort of learning. As long as it's not a fake. But that part's easy to verify. If this is a real S-rank forbidden jutsu then it will have a chakura seal on it that will have to be undone. Wow, that was an impressive seal, Sakuta had never seen one that strong before. Alright, let's open this thing up and take a look. So, this is called the \"Vore jutsu\" is it? Interesting name.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakura read from the scroll, which had a lot of information on it. Making it harder to understand it was written in an archaic dialect so old that she couldn't even place the age anymore. So, in order to help herself out she copied down the gist of it, and it reflects Sakura's own best understanding of the detailed ancient scroll. Below is the finished product of her work to translate she scroll from the archaic dialect to something understandable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The primary jutsu of this scroll, the Vore Jutsu, is a combination chakura absorption, medical, and lethal jutsu. While the conditions for this jutsu to be usable are tricky to come by, the results are better than practically any other technique. In terms of chakura absorption, the results are permanent. For medical purposes, as long as the patient survives to the end of the surgery it will cure any injury, even regrowing limbs. And as a lethal jutsu... once performed the odds of the enemy surviving boil down to the strength of they're taijutsu and chakura. So long as the enemy has no exceptionally powerful taijutsu, like Gentle Fist, it will 100% kill enemies with less then 10 times the chakura of the patient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Which basically means that if I used it against someone like Ino, or even Kakashi-sensei, they wouldn't stand a chance. Naruto, Sasuke and Hinata would probably be best off. After all, it mentions that with a powerful enough taijutsu the required ratio of chakura becomes more demanding on the patient... and Hinata's Gentle Fist is pretty much as powerful as a taijutsu comes. Well, I guess there's also my own and Tsunade-sama's unique taijutsu as well as Might Guy and Rock Lee's 8 gates.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For this jutsu to work there must be at least two parties, though 3 is considered the norm. Those parties are defined as; the Medical Ninja who knows the jutsu and makes it possible, the Predator who performs the Jutsu on the final party, which is the Prey. It is possible for the Medical Ninja to also be the Predator, and that has direct effects on the jutsu. As the reader is assumed to be the Medical Ninja, it will be noted what differences will be made to the effects if you were to use it as the Predator yourself.  For this jutsu to work you must manipulate the chakura of the Predator along the entire digestive system in order to allow it to withstand a meal of far larger size. It will work best if you use their own chakura for this, and therefore requires extreme skill and care if you are not performing the Jutsu yourself. This is phase one. Once the Predator is prepared the Prey must be completely devoured and placed into the digestive system of the Predator. This is phase two. After this has taken place you activate the hand seals ********** and the Predator's body will begin to break down the Prey's into nutrients that you can use to restore the Predator to perfect health. This is phase three.  Once the Predator has been completely restored you may freely use the leftover nutrients to increase the muscle or fat content of the Predator and place it wherever you wish on their body. Note that if you are acting as the Predator that the control of this aspect will be several times more difficult. This is the final phase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I knew that part sounded too good to be true. Sigh, looks like I could help Ino use this and could send it all to her gut and make her actually a fat pig.'</i> Sakura laughs to herself for a minute at the mental picture of Ino raging at her for giving her a gut. <i>'But if I use it myself there's no garentee that I wouldn't turn into a fat bellied whale myself.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While there directly controlling the final phase when you are the Predator is extremely difficult, it should be noted that there already exists a noticeable tendency, over 80%, for this resulting addition to the body to happen in a highly beneficial way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh'</i> Sakura thought. <i>'So it would at least be extremely strange if I were to end up like that. I guess that's something at least.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once phase two is complete the jutsu of the Prey will be sealed, leaving them with only the most basic uses of their chakura and their taijutsu. In addition, the stomach is placed close to the very center of the chakura network, mean that it benefits tremendously more then any other part of the Predator's body from the strength of their chakura. These two facts give the Predator an overwhelming advantage over the Prey, allowing extremely powerful Prey to be killed by rather weak Predators during phase three. This is even more pronounced in the case where you are the Predator yourself. It is also worth noting that the only way that you can aid a Predator besides yourself to digest their Prey is to somehow either increase the Predator's chakura or decrease the Prey's. Any Prey that is capable of putting out more then 10 times the chakura of the Predator, unless you yourself are the Predator, should not be selected unless you have a means on hand to do one of these actions. If you are the Predator, the limit should be considered 20 times instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'That means that Sasuke is actually still an option... Naruto would be risky if he entered his Sage mode though. But baised on the reason that you can deal with those with so much stronger chakura, someone who can directly attack the chakura pathway system, like Hinata, would be the technique's Achilles's heel.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The absorption of chakura and the total amount of the Prey's mass available for healing wounds and improving the Predator's body are linearly related, and although the figure varies from case a good rule of thumb for first time users is that they will absorb 20-30% of the chakura and 5-10% of the body mass of the Prey. According to how the Predator trains themselves they can either raise or lower those figures, but no training has ever been able to seperate them. I. E. no training has ever allowed them to increase chakura absorption while decreasing or even holding body mass absorption equal. This allows for a number of convenient uses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'And of course that's where it becomes absolutely unintelligible. As old as this scroll obviously is, maybe I should be happy that I got this much out of it. I'm gonna have to be training for quite some time to learn this though. Who knows, maybe I'll even find someone to use it against.'</i> Sakura thought to herself as she began to practice moving her chakura through her throat, learning to mold the chakura for the required body parts one by one. <i>'Still, I have to wonder why this one is a forbidden jutsu. It is plenty ruthless, but it looks like who has to worry about paying a price for it's use is the enemy anyways. Or... the Prey rather.'</i> Sakura blushes as she imagines the most infuriating of her 4 fold problem as her first Prey, punishing them for their treatment of her while giving her the body she deserves at the same time. Who did she imagine as her prey?</span></div></div>",

She sighted loudly as no one was there at the moment, she was all alone as the rest of her teamates was on diffrent missions and being a D rank mission the hokage had said she needed no help. \"This is sooo Boring! This library is so old, dusty and stuffy! Ugh why did i acept this mission?\" <br>\r\nShe sighted again and continued dusting off shelves and sorting books, she was almost done Before suddently she found an odd small hole in a wall, just big enough for one finger, hidden behind a false piece of wall. \"Huh what is this?\" Ino said surprised and curious as she leaned closer to the hole with a Little candle and peaked into it. Deep in the gap there was a small button, she gently pressed her index finger into the hole and pressed the button. Suddently the ground shook slightly and two pieces of the floor slid open reaveling a stair down too some sort of basement level, gulping slightly Ino desended the stairs far, far below the ground into a dark chamber, her Candle barly lighting the room. There, on a small pidestal an old scroll thightly wrapped in ribbons sat. \"A scroll here?\" She said puzzled and carefully removed the scroll holding her breath when removing it from it\u00b4s place, when nothing happened she started Walking back up closing the opening after her.<br>\r\nBurning with curiousity she removed the ribbons around the scroll and started opening it staring at it\u00b4s content, it the scroll was the very detailed description of an old forbidden jutsu called Ura-Tanjou (\"Lit: Reverse Birth\") used by Kunoichi to devour other ninjas via their vaginas, sucking them in into their bellies melting their body\u00b4s and absorbing the victims chakra,chakra nature as well as absorbing their flesh and blood adding it to their own giving them the victims element and even Kekkei Genkai (\"Bloodline Limit\") as well as physical characteristics making the user more beautiful and curvacious as well as well endowed. \"Oh my god such an jutsu exist?!\" Ino exclaimed in a mix of astoundment and horror, dark thoughs started to spin in her mind and a malicous grin started to form over Ino\u00b4s lips. \"This jutsu\u00b4s sound Amazing, too Amazing in fact, it can\u00b4t be real but.....maybe i should give it a test?~\" she purred getting a bit aroused at the thought, she needed a guinie-pig, and who would that be?~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ino could see Hinata's eyes shine at the though of dipping herself in the hot water, she started to undress into her underwear while folding her slightly sweaty clothing and putting them in a plastic bag all the while making shure to pull out fresh clean clothes to change to afterward from a small backpack. \"Thank you for inviting me Ino, i really needed this after the training\" Hinata hummed happily while unhooking her white bra and pulling down her white panties leaving her large breasts and untoched, virgin vagina exposed.<br>\r\n\"No problem Hinata, going alone would be ok but it's way more fun and relaxing with company\" Ino said sweetly while undressing her clothes untill she too were completly nude. She started caressing herself slightly while oogling Hinata's body, her beatiful ass, supple smooth skin and large breasts. \"Soon they belong all too me, all your beauty if this technique works\" Ino thought while fingering her vagina, getting more and more wet at the second. \"By the way Hinata, i have a new, powerful technique i really wanna show you, wanna see~\" Ino said with a purr. \"S...Shure Ino\" Hinata said and smiled at Ino.<br>\r\nIno grinned and started weaving multiple handsigns in rapid sucsession while focusing her chakra. \"Here we go! KINJUTSU: URA-TANJOU NO JUTSU!! (Forbidden technique: Reverse-Birth)\" Ino grinned evily and shouted, she could feel her own vagina opening and expanding while three thin, invisible tentacles wriggle and shoot out from Ino's vagina and wrap themself around Hinata's legs janking her off balance and making her fall on her back while she yelps and shouts in surprise. Starts to quickly pull Hinata feet first into Ino's vagina, sucking her in bit by bit. Moans loudly and delighted at the strong overwhelming, orgasmic feeling. \"Aaaaaah!! It feels soooo! Good!\" Ino moans while pinching her nipples and groping her own breasts. \"INO W....W...WHAT IS THIS?!!! STOP!!!!\" Hinata pleaded in shock and horror being pulled in to her hips now while she struggles to break free, wriggling back and forth.<br>\r\n\"Fufufufufufu! No way Hinata! You are not going anyway, except inside me!\" Laughs and continues pulling Hinata deeper inside herself, sucking her up to her stomache, pulls her arms behind her back making shure she can't use her gently fist technique. \"Your chakra, your body and your Byakugan will be all mine thanks to this forbidden technique\" Ino cooded and started to suck up her breasts. \"I will become even more Beautiful and Powerful while you become nothing more than food for me!~\" Ino laughed making sucked in Hinata to her neck savoring her panicked and terrified expression of despair. \"Ino no....d...d...don't do this!\" Hinata stuttered and pleaded in despair while Ino put her hand on the back of Hinata's head. Ino licked her lips in absolute satisfaction and drunk on the feeling of absolute power and dominance, laughs as Hinata pleads for mercy and can feel her body quivering inside her. \"Bye-Bye Hinata~\" Ino says while grinning before shoving her head inside her own vagina, moans and her stomache have stretched and bulged immencely to fit this tasty morsel, can feel Hinata twitching and moving inside her making Ino giggle and moan \u00e4r h\u00e4r helplessness. \"Now then....\" claps her hands together. \"Kyushu! (\"Absorb\")\" floods her stomache with stomach acids and melts down hinata and absorbs her chakra, flesh and bloodline-limit making Ino squel and moan in pleasure as the new sensation wells over her like a river. \"Aaaaaaaah!!!!!!!~\" feels her own chakra level spike and grow as Hinata's chakra resevs are added to Ino's, her breasts and body morphs and grows to add Hinata's body-type to her own making her breasts, hips and ass more velopious and Beautiful. She can also feel how veins pops out around her eyes as she steals the Hyuuga bloodline-limit, her eyes starts turning milky white and giving her near 360 digree vision. All of this give her such sensory overload that she orgasms time and time again, making her shout and moan before passing out.</span></div></div>",
