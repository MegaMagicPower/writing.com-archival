The local food is probably the best place to start exploring anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking on in you are greeted by a headless hostess. Not having interacted with any headless people yet, you approach rather awkwardly. <br>\r\n\"Uh, table for 1\" you ask almost as a question, doubting she can hear you. You are proven wrong as she grabs a single menu and gestures you to follow. As you follow her deeper into the restaurant you see a surprising amount of normal people eating, though many are accompanied by bodiless or even headless guests. The hostess stops as you arrive at a nice, quiet table. You sit down, as she leaves you with your menu. Looking over it, there isn't really anything unique, disappointing you a little. Weirdly enough, none of the items had any prices listed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, what can I get you to drink?\" A voice says snapping you out of your focus on the menu. You look up to see a woman whose head obviously doesn't belong on her body. <br>\r\n\"Just water please\" you reply, still caught off guard by her strange appearance. Makes you wonder what sorts of weird you will be after staying in Mead Town for a little. <br>\r\n\"Still need some time to decide?\"<br>\r\n\"Actually I'll order now\" you reply, before ordering your normal go-to, not really expecting too much.<br>\r\n\"Thank ya\" she remarks as she heads to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to people watch while waiting for your food. The heads, bodies and whatever weird combination existed sat around you. You wondered if there was a place in town where you could get your head detached, or just how it even worked in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon your food came around. Quickly digging in you were taken back, it was the best meal you've ever had. For what the residents lacked in menu originality they made up for with crazy good cooking. You quickly finished your whole meal, stealing yourself of the usual leftovers tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too long after, the mismatched server returned with an empty platter.<br>\r\n\"How was your food?\" <br>\r\n\"Amazing, this place is ridiculously good\" you say still surprised.<br>\r\nShe giggled, \"We only serve the finest food, only a fair trade.\"<br>\r\nFair trade, what did she mean? You start worrying about the price, hoping you had enough in your wallet. You start to pull it out only to be met with more laughing from her.<br>\r\n\"Oh, sir, we don't accept money\"<br>\r\n\"Is the meal free?\" You ask hopefully.<br>\r\n\"Oh, no\" she continues laughing, \"we accept our guests' heads as payment\". You now realizing what the platter is for.<br>\r\n\"My head?!\" You ask just to make sure.<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, I've been told by most the meal is beyond worth the price. Now, if you wouldn't mind placing it here\" she says as she holds the platter forward.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to say, but my head doesn't come off. I'm an outsider\"<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, once you enter Head town, all it takes is a solid tug, now please, I do have other tables\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking about the consequences you reach your hands up to the sides of your head, grab and pull. With a satisfying 'pop' sound it comes right off. Expecting to control your body instead your body turns you around and places you on the platter itself. You can no longer feel it, now you are simply a head, starring at your now vacant neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid, thank you, sir. I hope you have a nice night\" she tells your body as it stands up to leave. As she spins around to bring you to wherever it was she was taking you, you watch as your now former body leaves without a care in the world for the head that commanded it here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having had expected to lose your head in here, you decide it's time for answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, could you tell me what you do with us heads?\" You try asking the server.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course, my bad\" she apologizes, \"We...</span></div></div>",

What do we do off shift, and what if we don't want to?\" You try getting a few basics out of the way.<br>\r\n\"Well off-shift heads either stay in our head dorms or some of our server bodies volunteer to take so many home, but that'll be your choice. As for if you don't want to, I can tell you its the best job I've ever had, but otherwise we'll just sell you to the nearby head shop. Anything else?\" she replies as entering the kitchen with you on her tray.<br>\r\n\"So the bodies are fine on their own? Why do they need heads for waiting?\"<br>\r\n\"Eh, I'm not the brains of that, I think its just for fun and show. How many places hire like us?\" she asks back.<br>\r\n\"Fair\" you reply as you see other mismatched servers heading in and out, \"What about that body then?\" you gesture as much you can to a suited up headless woman, checking things off her clipboard.<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's not a server. That's Maria, she's the afternoon manager\"<br>\r\n\"Then where's her head?\" <br>\r\n\"Funny you ask, she's the head of marketing, all this head business was her idea, she grew this company like crazy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a bit surprised, but think it won't hurt to work here for awhile at least.<br>\r\n\"So, when do I start?\"<br>\r\n\"Next shift\" she says before setting you down on a shelf among several other heads. She then spins around and heads back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chat with some of the other heads for a little while, learning their former lives and bodies while waiting for your shift.<br>\r\nFinally though it was time. All the servers came back in, one by one, taking their heads off and placing them on the shelf above yours. Then the bodies went to grab their new heads. It seemed completely random, or at least the bodies' preference. The body that grabs and attaches your head is...</span></div></div>",

You then turn the head to face you as their body walks up, having been also chasing its lost head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I didn't mean to knock your head off!\" you apologized.<br>\r\n\"Oh no, its okay, happens all the time\" they brush it off, \"Where's the fun is having a detachable head if you don't go for a surprise stroll every now and then?\"<br>\r\nYou chuckle in response before getting up to hand them their head back. The body promptly grabs its head back, but doesn't place it back on yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, I'm actually a big fan of your head\" they inform you. You're a little surprised as you let out an awkward thanks.<br>\r\n\"Not a bad head yourself\" you attempt to return the compliment. <br>\r\n\"Glad you like it, my body here went through a lot to find me. Would you want to trade?\"<br>\r\n\"Trade?\" you reply, taken back.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you take my head, I take yours. Or rather our bodies do\"<br>\r\nYou think for a moment. In head town you don't doubt there's a way to easily get your head off.<br>\r\n\"Ya know what, sure\" you agree, deciding to switch things up a bit.<br>\r\n\"Awesome\" the head replies. You two then politely exchange heads. Yours tucked in their body's arm and theirs tucked in your body's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then part ways. But are you your head or your body? And who exactly was the trader?</span></div></div>",

Headless bodies walking around the streets still very much alive, heads without any vocal cords or lungs or larynges talking without a care in the world, bodies with heads of different races and genders and ages mounted on their shoulders, none of this should be possible.  Not without a bunch of massive scientific breakthroughs.  And yet here you were, standing at the bus stop at the edge of Head Town when just yesterday you'd been in your typical lecture hall learning about the Napoleonic Wars.  Life truly had a way of changing on a dime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're new here!\"  A peppy voice says right in your ear, causing you to stumble back in surprise.  Turning to face the voice you saw a woman of abnormal height (well... abnormal in a normal context.  Considering everything else it was quite normal indeed), dressed in a pair of tight short shorts and a lowcut top, running attire judging from the way she was sweating.  She was rather dark in complexion, her skin the color of a chestnut's shell and her hair short cut but curly.  Her height was further accentuated by her long, slender, muscular legs and compact chest, her build befitting an athlete.  Giggling she says \"Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you or anything!  We just don't get a lot of new people here, and I love meeting new faces!\"\"  She slapped her forehead \"Oh, silly me!  Where are my manners?  I'm Jeanette!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, nice to meet you.  I'm Clara.\"  You say, shaking her hand.  \"Yeah, I'm new around here.  Just came here to see what all the fuss was about.  I thought my friends were just pulling my leg when they told me about this place but... here I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it can be a little overwhelming at first.  It's not your average town is it?  You want me to give you a little tour?\"  She offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I guess it couldn't hurt.  Sure.\"  You agree.  Jeannette begins walking you around town, pointing out local landmarks, interesting stores, good hotels, and some general sights.  You're hardly even paying attention however, nodding vapidly and giving some occasional confirmations as though you'd heard what she said.  Your attention is fixed almost entirely on the people around you, you simply can't stop staring at the oddity of the people around you going about there daily business with detached heads or no heads or mixed heads or no bodies or mismatched bodies.  Most of them didn't seem to mind your staring, but-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\"  You shout as you run face first into something, falling onto your butt as your rub your sore chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a hand on your shoulder and the voice of a young female.  \"I'm so sorry!  I was looking at my phone, I didn't see you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up you see the person you bumped into, a woman around your age with porcelain white contrasted with dark black hair that sat atop an adorable round button nosed face.  She was quite pretty, her hips wide and her chest ample, the sort of woman you imagine would have guys hounding 24/7.  She was about a head shorter (figuratively, not literally like some of the other people in this town) than you, her forehead only coming up to your chin.  \"Uh, hi.  I'm Sunny.  I'm not sure I recognize you.  Are you new here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First time in town, yes.\"  You answer, rising to your feet with Jeanette's help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny smiled.  \"Oh!  Well then, I guess you want to learn how to do this!\"  With a quick tug her head popped off her shoulders, Sunny holding it under her arm like a ball.  \"I could teach you, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, I'm fine just watching right now.  I'm still trying to wrap my head around this.  No pun intended.\"  You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, c'mon!  It'll be fun!\"  Sunny begged.  \"If you let me teach you, I'll let you borrow my head!  Just so long as you let me borrow yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't... wait, don't you mean you'll let me borrow your body?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on how you look at it.\"  Sunny answered with a shrug of her blank shoulders.  \"But from my perspective, I see the opportunity to have a ton of fun!  I've been looking for a cute new head to wear for ages, I was on my way to the head store after all, and then I run into your adorable noggin like it was fate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no fair!\"  Jeanette butts in \"I was going to ask her to trade heads too!  I saw her first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to your guide with raised eyebrows.  \"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette blushes.  \"Well... yeah.  I mean, that's why I job past the bus stop every day.  I like checking for new bodies to wear, and yours is pretty sexy!  I was going to take you around town to get you used to the idea, then ask to trade bodies when we got to your hotel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny frowned.  \"Well I asked first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I saw her first!\"  Jeanette retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's my head and my body!  So I get to say if I trade anything at all!\"  You shout, angry that these women were talking like you weren't there and assuming you'd just say yes to whatever they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"  They said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, just give me some time to think alright?  This is a whole lot of information to take in, an hour ago I didn;t even know people could trade body parts, now I've got two people fighting over mine!\"  You say, though in all honesty it did make you somewhat proud that your looks were good enough to attract this sort of attention.

Normally if you take your head off, you are the head. If you concentrate enough, you become the body. Just imagine yourself sinking down into your heart. Your head would either go unconscious or develop her own personality sometimes.\" said Sunny as she takes off her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head blinks and made a neutral look. Sunny's body got out her phone and text, \"Now you try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held onto your head and try to feel yourself sinking as the magic of this town lets your head pop off. Suddenly your vision has changed as you can sense your surroundings but it is a bit dark and blurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi body!\" said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the voice sounds familiar. You felt something moving around your hands as the voice said, \"It's me, your head silly! You forgot to turn my conscious off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny's body shook her head a bit and the head is awake again, \"I see that your head has her own personality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, you must be Sunny.\" said your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou as a body is still confused as to what is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of, I'm just relaying messages from the body's thoughts.\" said the head as she went back to a neutral look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you get to put me on!\" said your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then trades heads with Sunny with each head saying something sweet to their new bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A message from Sunny, please take good care of me.\" said Sunny's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too Sunny.\" your head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both put your new heads on as you felt the sensation of a face again. You grabbed a mirror and you now got Sunny's looks and head. Your new doll like head looks out of place for your plain looking body. You look at Sunny who has your old head as it looks as if they don't belong but it still looks cute. Though it really contrast with the pale porcelain body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With a little make up, your head will look very cute. Do you find my own head cute? I got a few copies of that one so don't feel so bad.\" said Sunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette added, \"It was nice meeting you. I hope we can trade bodies someday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette leaves as you look at Sunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, want to come to my house and give your old head and yourself a makeover?\" asked Sunny, \"I mean I got to get this cute head in style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided...</span></div></div>",

Why don't you two trade with each other?\"  You say.  \"After all both of you want a new body, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny uses her hands to shake her detached head side to side. \"No, I said I wanted a new head.  She wants a body.  There's a difference.\"  She sees you raise a confused eyebrow and says \"Alright, I guess you have a point.  You should really know how this stuff works before you go crazy with it.\"  She looked over at Jeannette.  \"Would you help me show the tourist the different kinds of detachment?  Ms...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me Jeannette.\"  She answered  \"And sure thing Sunny, explain away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny looked back at you.  \"Alright.  So, basically there are three kinds of detachment and you can choose whichever one you want before you detach just by thinking about it.  Each one changes where your 'consciousness', basically your point of view, is located.  You can be in your head, your body, or both.  Right now I'm in my body, meaning that while I can still control the last head I had attached to me if I were to put a new head on I'd take control of that head while my old one went into a sort of \"hibernation\" state.  If someone put my head on they'd take control of it since that's not where my consciousness is.  Also if I lose control of this head my body will still be able to see and hear just fine from the spot where I used to be.  Watch!\"  With that Sunny hands her head over to Jeannette, who takes it and turns it around to face her old body.  Sunny turns around and begins to walk away, much to your confusion.  \"If you only have consciousness in one of your two parts then you can only be so far away before the connection breaks, like an RC car.\"  Sunny explained.  \"Once you get too far away fro...\"  You watched Sunny's body get about two and a half blocks away, the small woman turning into a small pale ant on the horizon, before it happened.  Suddenly Sunny stopped talking, her jaw going slack and the light leaving her eyes.  After a few seconds her jaw returned to a neutral position and her eyes were focused but empty, like the glass eyed stare of a doll  Jeannette slapped the head's cheek firmly, its expression unchanging.  It really was just an empty head.  Looking up you watched as Sunny's body turned around and walked back towards you, stopping at every crosswalk and stepping around every other pedestrian with ease, confirming that she could indeed see just fine.  Once she got back to you she pulled out her phone and typed.  \"<b><i>If u put conciousness in head then opposite happens.  Attach u head 2 body and you take control of that body, put someone else head on your body and you lose control of body but keep head.  Move too far away and body goes sleepy.  Jeannette show plz.</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\"  Jeannette says, handing Sunny back her empty head.  Reaching up to her neck Jeannette pulled her own head off, handing you her noggin with a cheeky wink.  Turning Jeannette's head around to face her body  you watch as the athletic brown body begins walking down the street the same way Sunny's did.  And just like Sunny Jeannette managed to make is about 2 and a half blocks (maybe a little bit further than Sunny) before the connection broke.  However, unlike Sunny who lost control of her head Jeannette's head remained perfectly perky.  Instead her body stumbled slightly like a wounded bull, then slumped its shoulders back and dropped to its knees on the pavement.  \"Shoot, I hope I didn't scrape my knees.\"  Jeannette says with a frown. Sunny tugs on your sleeve and the three of you begin walking towards Jeannette's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's it like being just a head?  I can't imagine it being as fun as having a body, what with you being helpless and all.\"  You say, turning Jeannette around in your hands to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed a little.  \"Actually, it can be pretty fun being just a head sometimes.  Getting carried around, pampered, not having to worry about how you're dressed or what you eat since food only goes to whatever body you're connected to.  Plus when you're not attached to a body or controlling one with your consciousness you actually unlock a few psychic powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Powers?\"  You ask.  Despite holding a living severed head the idea of said head having magic abilities still managed to make you skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  Two of them, to be precise.  For one, all heads can generate a sort of 'tactile force field' around their skin.  This makes them both really difficult to damage and also really bouncy!\"  She explains.  Noticing that your eyebrow was still raised disbelievingly Jeannette said \"Go ahead, throw me!  I'll bounce just like a ball and won't be any worse for wear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna throw you.\"  You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself, I'll just throw myself!\"  She said.  Before you can say anything Jeannette's head suddenly rockets out of your hands, sailing up five feet above your head before floating in mid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEADS CAN FLY?!\"  You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!  And they can alsooo\" she allowed herself to drop from the air, her head sailing towards the ground and smacking into the hard concrete.  Just like she said however Jeannette bounced off the ground like a basketball, her hair flying in all directions as she laughed.  You caught her before she could hit the ground again.  \"Bounce.\"  She finished her sentence.  Checking her all over you didn't see a single bruise, confirming her story.  \"Yeah, a lot of sports around here are played with heads instead of balls.  Personally I prefer to be one of the players but every once in a while ball duty is fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you arrive at Jeannette's body, which you are surprised to see is now standing up straight with its arms at its sides like a soldier.  You were so focused on Jeannette's head that you must have missed it, but you suppose it made sense.  Sunny's head returned to a neutral position when it lost connection, why wouldn't a body do the same?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny holds out her phone to you, a message already typed up from when you were walking.  \"<i><b>If u attach 2 parts w/o concious then they connect but don't move.</b></i>\"  She connects her head to Jeannette's body and both remain motionless and unresponsive.  \"<i><b>If u attach 2 parts w/ concious then they have 2 decide who gets control</b></i>\"  She takes Jeannette's head from your hands and connects it to her own body.  \"We can communicate telepathically while connected, and feel or see whatever the other person feels and sees no matter who is in control of what.\"  Jeannette said.  \"If we both agree on who takes control then that person controls everything.\"  Her smile faltered momentarily, then she spoke again.  This time, however, Jeannette's head spoke with Sunny's voice.  \"Like so!  If we can't come to an agreement then both of us just control whatever part we had originally, body or head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing!\"  You say.  Now you understood why Jeanette asked for your body while Sunny asked for your head  there really was quite a big difference.  You then remember something else Sunny said.  \"Wait, didn't you say there were three kinds of detachment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny nodded Jeannette's head.  \"I see you were paying attention!  Yes, while detaching you can also choose to split your consciousness.  This will make both your head and your body able to act and think completely independently of one another, not seeing or feeling what the other does.  While they'll start off with identical personalities and thought patterns, and will return to just one collected consciousness if they reattach within a few days, prolonged separation can cause them to become their own people and reattaching them will be just like me and Jeannette attaching, with both people having to agree on who gets control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\"  You say, trying to wrap your head around that one.  \"But, hang on.  If both are are separate parts of the same person... but  who's the 'real' you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny shrugs.  \"It's a matter of perspective really.\"  Jeannette's face smiles mischievously.  \"Let me demonstrate!\"  Without warning Sunny lunges at you, fingers wrapping around your neck and pulling up.  Suddenly...</span></div></div>",

Sunny... SOMEONE holds you at waist level.  \"Did you... did you just do what I think you just did?\"  You ask, shock overriding logic as you looked up at Jeannette's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See for yourself.\"  Jeannette said, her voice coming out of her mouth now her own again.  You feel a set of fingers touch your scalp and the tender skin under your neck, very familiar feeling yet very alien feeling fingers at the same time.  You'd felt them every day for your entire life yet never FELT them while not feeling them.  The hands turn you around and you are left face to neck with your body, now controlling itself as your consciousness had been split in two.  \"Oh yeah, should've mentioned this earlier but if you don't choose how you want to be split before it happens then you'll default to split consciousness.  Hence why you're now in both your body and head without cross control.\"  Jeannette explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're me, but not me?  Like, we think all the same but don't actually control or feel what the other is?\"  You ask your body.  She gives you a thumbs up of confirmation.  \"Wow, that's trippy.\"  You tilt your eyes back trying to face Sunny and Jeannette again and your body obligingly turns you around to face them.  \"Speaking of which how do I use my whole psychic power dealies?  While I think me and body would like to reconnect pretty soon I might as well try it out while I am like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your subconscious naturally generates a protective barrier along the surface of your skin that protects you from major impacts so you don't have to do anything to activate that power.  If you concentrate on your skin you can turn it OFF but I don't see why you'd want to, it doesn't stop people from touching you it just makes it so you won't get seriously hurt.  As for flying you just have to focus on the direction you want to go and will yourself towards it.  The harder you concentrate, the faster you'll go, though there is a set speed limit and you can't fly too high or you'll get lightheaded, no pun intended, from oxygen deprivation.\"  She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's try it!\"  You exclaim.  Concentrating all your thoughts on the space one foot above where your body was holding you and willing yourself to move you suddenly feel yourself getting higher, your fingers sliding off your cheek as you rose up.  \"Yeah, awesome!\"  You say, focusing on turning your view begins rotating 180 degrees until you can see your body clapping its hands and hopping up and down in excitement.  Focusing some more you float up a few feet higher and begin surveying the street from your new vantage point.  Turning around you see Jeannette giggling and an idea pops into your head (which is currently all of you).  \"Say Jeannette, I was wondering something.  In cartoons and stuff a character could get their head knocked off if hit hard and they'd have to go looking around for it blindly.  Can that happen in Head Town or is that still restrained to the cartoons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannette thinks.  \"Well, it's not all that common but it can happen under the right conditions.  If a person's not expecting to be hit or they're distracted, if they're struck at a weird angle, if they're not on their original body or if  they just recently detached since the bond isn't as strong earlier on, it really depends o-\"  Jeannette is cut off as your forehead slams into hers, her body tilting back until her neck splits like a seam along the line separating black from white skin until her head pops off and slams into the ground, bouncing twice before rolling to a stop a few feet away as Sunny falls flat on her butt from the surprising impact.  While you felt the force of the impact it didn't hurt in the slightest, though you were slightly disoriented.  You laugh and you hear your body slapping its knee with equal glee as you float down into her (your) hands.  Meanwhile Sunny's body is holding a hand up to the empty air where Jeannette's head was just a moment ago, having felt the initial pain of you smacking her borrowed skull but nothing after that.  Meanwhile Jeannette floated off the ground with a frown on her face, a small bruise already forming on her forehead where you smacked her but no other injuries to speak of as once detached the psychic field automatically switched on like she said.  \"WHAT WAS THAT FOR?!\"  She demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For taking me off without my permission!\"  You say, your body patting you on top of the head in agreement.  \"I already told you I was still getting comfortable with this stuff, that was so not cool of you to just pull a gal's head off!\"  You look down at Sunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sunny did that!  I was just the head!  In fact, I wasn't even controlling the head half the time.  She was talking through me, remember?\"  She retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny quickly whipped out her phone and typed \"<b><i>Don't U pin dis on me!  &gt;:(  It was ur idea in the 1st place!\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the-\"  Jeannette began, then sighed .  \"Look, I'm sorry I did that Clara.  WE'RE sorry, right Sunny?\"  She asked.  Sunny sagged her shoulders as though scoffing, then gave a thumbs up of agreement.  \"I just thought it would make it easier if you just jumped right in.  Like getting into a cold pool, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout your control your body walks over to Sunny, cradling your head under left armpit as it offers Sunny its right hand up as a show of apology.  Sunny hesitates for a moment then takes the hand, hoisting herself back up.  Sunny and your body shake hands and mirroring your body's response you tell Jeannette.  \"And I'm sorry too, I guess I... lost my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.  So, what do you two want to do now?\"  She asks, causing you and your body to think.  You and your body decide to...</span></div></div>",

It was a bit of a doozy.  \"Whatever.  Don't care for it.  I want to reconnect.  Body, do you, I, me, WHATEVER agree to that?\"  You raise your thumb up in front of your head, also preferring to be one person and worrying about what would happen if you drifted too far from yourself and couldn't become one again.  \"Glad to see I'm on the same page.  So, I'm ready to go whenever I'm ready.\"  Your head said.  Lifting your head up over your shoulders you press it down AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH!\"  You mumble aloud, stumbling back and forth as you... you're not sure.  You didn't regain control of your body, nor did you regain control of your head.  You always were your head and always were your body, both sets of memories overlapping in your brain (which one of the two of you didn't even have for a few minutes) at the same time and making a confusing jumble of the scene that just transpired.  After a few seconds of dizziness however your head cleared, the memories stitcheing themselves into a single sequence of events, and you felt like you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I should've warned you about that!\"  Jeannette said.  \"It can be a bit confusing when you split into two thought streams then go back to just one.  Luckily for you you were only split for a few minutes and had relatively similar experiences, so the headaches only last a few seconds.  I remember one time when I split myself to go on two dates and didn't reconnect until the next afternoon I had to lie on the floor for an hour before the room stopped spinning!  Thought I was gonna throw up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face twitched, then Sunny spoke out of her mouth.  \"That's nothing!  One time I split my consciousness and body me didn't want to put head me back on!  Kept wanting to trade new empty heads for days on end, thought there was gonna be two of me permanently!  Eventually my head talked my body into putting it back on after FIVE DAYS apart and let me tell you, I had to call in sick from work the next day and have my boyfriend take care of me in bed.  Still felt pretty groggy the day after that but three days after reconnection my brain finally sorted everything out and I was back to normal.  I'm never splitting my consciousness again though, that I can tell you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannette took back control of her head and said \"That's crazy!  I guess you can't trust anyone, not even yourself.\"  Turning her attention back to you she asks \"So, do you have anything else you want to try in head town?

Which also means it'll be the only one with the map.  How am I supposed to find this place?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I can show you the way!  I'll escort you around town, show you some of my favorite stores, and then we'll head back to my place to meet up with your body!\"  She said.  Reaching up Sunny's hands detach Jeannette's head before she walks over to the numb body.  Standing on her tippy toes to reach the top of her old head, Jeannette's body being quite a bit taller than Sunny's, she pulls off her cute little head and sets it back down on her neck.  Jeannette's head meanwhile floats out of Sunny's grasp and sets itself down on her old neck, the two women now back in their original states as though nothing strange had ever happened.  \"Come along Clara's head, we'll take the scenic route by the park!  Sunny says, her voice now coming back out of her old head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Say, Clara's body, mind if I tag along with you?  I know some really fun spots to hang out!\"  Jeannette asked your body, which was now even more dwarfed by the giant woman since it was a full head shorter.  Your body gave a thumbs up and the two of them walked away, Jeannette taking your body by the hand and practically dragging it behind her as she led the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meanwhile floated beside Sunny, the two of you talking about the town and its sights while walking past a beautifully groomed park filled with all sorts of strange sights, though since you were currently a floating head and your body was thinking for itself you suppose you had to consider yourself one of those sights for any other passing tourist.  Still, it felt odd watching a thirteen year old girl with the body of a thirty year old male weightlifter playing fetch with her tiny purse dog while a few meters away a middle aged businessman and his wife chatted casually to one another while both were mounted to the same body, with that body clearly not being either of their original bodies and instead being that of a much younger woman and built in such a way that it seemed genetically engineered to be wrapped around a stripper pole.  Then you saw a group of teens, all between the age of 14 and 16 by the looks of it, playing a casual game of soccer with one of their own detached and sentient heads as the ball!  By the looks of it the head was having the time of his life, and all the kids seemed to be having fun kicking their friend around though you do notice that the teams are uneven.  While they both had four players with an even mix of boys and girls on both sides since one of the players was having their detached and sentient head as the ball he couldn't perform  any headers himself leaving him at a clear disadvantage when the 'ball' was kicked high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clara?\"  Sunny says, realizing you'd stopped.  \"Come along, I have this amazing shop to show you!  It sells gorgeous heads and bodies at super low prices, you might find a new head to call your own before you head home, or maybe a new body to drive the boys wild!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her confused.  \"Wait, I can swap once I leave?  I thought only people Head Town can do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny nodded.  \"Well, you're half right.  You can only detach, reattach, and swap parts while within the city limits.  BUT if you make changes inside the city then walk out like that the changes you've made will stick.  And if you wanted to switch back and forth between parts you could always store your unused bodies and heads in one of the city's Part-Banks for a nominal fee, then just drive back into town and switch out whatever you want before leaving again.  I do it all the time for business trips, just switch up my parts here, fly out as a new me, then switch back when I get home.\"  She explains.  \"Now come on, the store is closing in twenty minutes so we have to hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about this.  On the one hand getting a new body or head and wearing it back home to impress your friends sounded like a great idea.  On the other hand picking something out without consulting your body first did feel a little weird, even if both of you were 'you' and would probably make the same choice.  You didn't want your body to get the wrong idea if you 'replaced' it or if you came back with a new head for it to wear that it didn't want.  Looking back at the park you also noticed those kids were still playing soccer and that the headless boy was still struggling.  You decide to...</span></div></div>",

I'll show you a place that's often missed by your average tourist. Come!\"<br>\r\nYou followed Sunny across the square and further, through narrow streets, flooded with all kind of folks. You even spotted a few two-headed, both girls. One of them had very different heads. Thinking about this, you forgot to track your way, but soon Sunny slowed and stopped before a door to a basement. \"Marcy's Lavishia\" said a glowing colorful sign over the porch. <br>\r\n\"It's here\". Sunny smiled almost noxiously. \"I go here myself, but, sadly, it's not well-known among newcomers. Marcy does some fantastic things\" she stepped down the stairs and opened a door. <br>\r\nYou floated in. The room was pleasant and clean, with some fleeting scent in the air and atmospheric music playing in the background. <br>\r\n\"Marcy?\" called Sunny. <br>\r\n\"Sunny, finally bored with your head?\" a raven-haired floating head appeared near your guide. \"I was almost missing you\"<br>\r\n\"Some other day.\" Sunny nodded to you. \"Marcy's head, as you already guessed. And it's Clara over here\"<br>\r\n\"A newcomer to see my treasury?\" Marcy smiled, flying to the counter.<br>\r\n\"She lured me with promises of something very special\" you answered.<br>\r\n\"Do you already have something in mind?\"<br>\r\n\"Emm... Nope. I hoped to see something that I will immediately want for me or my body. She's on her own for a while\"<br>\r\n\"Well, Marcy shall show you\"<br>\r\nA door opened and Marcy's body stepped in.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like a switch being flipped everything above your neck goes numb, your view remaining the same but watching as a ball covered in familiar light brown hair was pulled away from you. Jeannette... Sunny... SOMEONE holds the object at waist level. \"Did you... did you just do what I think you just did?\" It asks in an all too familiar voice, shock overriding logic as you refused to believe what they were holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach out for the object, your view shifting down naturally even though you don't have eyes to focus.  Noticing your gesture Jeannette says, now in her original voice, \"See for yourself.\"  Your fingers gingerly grasp its scalp and the fresh patch of skin under its chin as you pull the object out of Sunny's reach, the hair feeling all too familiar to the hair you washed just this morning yet the new smooth skin feeling alien. You'd run your hands through your hair every day of your life yet you never FELT your scalp without feeling it. Taking a deep breath to brace yourself (well, a deep movement of the chest anyway.  You didn't actually have a mouth or nose so it was mostly just a reflexive action) you turn the head around, coming neck to face with your head, now controlling itself as your consciousness had been split in two. \"Oh yeah, should've mentioned this earlier but if you don't choose how you want to be split before it happens then you'll default to split consciousness. Hence why you're now in both your body and head without cross control.\" Jeannette explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're me, but not me? Like, we think all the same but don't actually control or feel what the other is?\"  It ask you, perplexed. The head said everything you were thinking exactly how you were thinking it, so you raise your thumb in confirmation. \"Wow, that's trippy.\" Your head tilt your eyes back, and realizing it wanted to talk to them again you turn your head around. \"Speaking of which how do I use my whole psychic power dealies? While I think me and body would like to reconnect pretty soon I might as well try it out while I am like this.\" Your head asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your subconscious naturally generates a protective barrier along the surface of your skin that protects you from major impacts so you don't have to do anything to activate that power. If you concentrate on your skin you can turn it OFF but I don't see why you'd want to, it doesn't stop people from touching you it just makes it so you won't get seriously hurt. As for flying you just have to focus on the direction you want to go and will yourself towards it. The harder you concentrate, the faster you'll go, though there is a set speed limit and you can't fly too high or you'll get lightheaded, no pun intended, from oxygen deprivation.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's try it!\" Your head exclaims. You watch your head furrow its brow in concentration, then suddenly feel it rising up on its own! You're so excited you don't even try to hold onto it and allow it to slip out of your fingers until it is floating one foot above your grip. \"Yeah, awesome!\" You hear yourself say.  You can't help but clap in excitement and amazement as your floating head rotates 180 degrees, easily controlling its movements despite only learning about head flight mere minutes ago. Getting cocky your head floats a few feet higher and begins floating around the street in small circles. You tracked your heads movements easily, the lack of eyes and a neck meaning you could effectively look in any direction you wanted to, though your point of view was locked in the spot where your eyes once were, had the same field of view width as before, and the more \"unnatural\" the angle got (like looking straight over your back) the more fuzzy and out of focus your vision became, forcing you to turn from time to time to get a good 'look'.  Hearing Jeannette giggling you turn your focus to her.  While you were still very excited at your headlessness your face would be frowning if you had one.  She tricked you and pulled off your head without permission, even if you were enjoying yourself now it wasn't exactly a polite thing to do and now she was laughing at you getting used to it.  Your head suddenly asks \"Say Jeannette, I was wondering something. In cartoons and stuff a character could get their head knocked off if hit hard and they'd have to go looking around for it blindly. Can that happen in Head Town or is that still restrained to the cartoons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannette thinks for a moment. While you know exactly what your head is getting at Jeannette and Sunny seem completely clueless.  \"Well, it's not all that common but it can happen under the right conditions. If a person's not expecting to be hit or they're distracted, if they're struck at a weird angle, if they're not on their original body or if they just recently detached since the bond isn't as strong earlier on, it really depends o-\" Jeannette is cut off as your head swoops down and slams into her, the neck she's mounted to tilting back until it splits like a seam along the line separating black from white skin.  Jeannette pops off Sunny's neck and slams into the ground, bouncing twice before rolling to a stop a few feet away as Sunny falls flat on her butt from the surprising impact.  Your chest heaves as you silently laugh, slapping your knee as your head laughs aloud with equal glee before floating back into your hands.  Sunny's holds a hand up to the empty air where Jeannette's was just a moment ago, having felt the initial pain of your head smacking into her borrowed skull but nothing after that. Meanwhile Jeannette floated off the ground with a frown on her face, a small bruise already forming on her forehead where your head smacked her but no other injuries to speak of as once detached the psychic field automatically switched on like she said. \"WHAT WAS THAT FOR?!\" She demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For taking me off without my permission!\" You heard yourself say, patting the top of your head as it spoke for you. \"I already told you I was still getting comfortable with this stuff, that was so not cool of you to just pull a gal's head off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sunny did that! I was just the head! In fact, I wasn't even controlling the head half the time. She was talking through me, remember?\" She retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny quickly whipped out her phone and typed \"Don't U pin dis on me! &gt;:( It was ur idea in the 1st place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the-\" Jeannette began, then sighed . \"Look, I'm sorry I did that Clara. WE'RE sorry, right Sunny?\" She asked. Sunny sagged her shoulders as though scoffing, then gave a thumbs up of agreement. \"I just thought it would make it easier if you just jumped right in. Like getting into a cold pool, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou internally frown, maybe your head had taken things a bit too far.  They were only trying to help you after all.  Tucking your head under your left armpit you walk up to Sunny and extend your hand to help her up.  She hesitates for a moment then takes the hand, hoisting herself back up. Mutually apologizing the two of you shake hands, and your head takes after your lead and tells Jeannette \"And I'm sorry too, I guess I... lost my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. So, what do you two want to do now?\" She asks, causing you and your head to think. You and your head decide to...</span></div></div>",

You think about this, you and your head were still technically the same person just split between two points of view, but it would be pretty confusing to address yourselves as 'I' when you each controlled your own actions and had your own thoughts, even if those thoughts were very similar for not.  You shrug your empty shoulders, then gave a noncommittal thumbs up.  \"For now we'll say we...  Anyway, if we want to see as much of this town as possible before we head back to school then I guess it'd be best if the two of me split up and explored separately.\"  Your head floated up out of your hands and spun around to face you.  \"I obviously won't have a cellphone on me, so how about we meet back up at the bus station that brought us here in like two hours?  We can grab dinner together and then find a motel for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give your head another thumbs up and the two of you are about to go your separate ways when Sunny quickly puts Jeannette's head back on and shouts \"Wait!\" in her own voice.  For a few seconds the two conjoined girls are silent, staring off into space and twitching their lips slightly as they had a mental conversation with one another.  When they next spoke it was Jeannette's voice coming out of her head.  \"Me and Sunny just talked for a bit we both agree that...</span></div></div>",

We'll just need to drop off our unused parts back at our respective houses and then we can show you around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to pull out your phone when your head asked the same question you were thinking of asking.  \"Wait, drop off your parts?  You're splitting up but you're not going to return to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny took control of Jeannette's head and answered in her own voice.  \"Nah, we figure that if you two are going to be wandering around without a head and without a body, we might as well join you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, and your head answers \"Alright, if you insist.  We'd love to have you as our tour guides!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\"  Jeannette says, once more with her own voice.  Without Sunny even raising her hands Jeannette floats off her neck, hovering over to the uncontrolled body and head belonging to her and Sunny respectively.  Sunny reaches over and takes her dormant head off Jeannette's body, placing it back on her shoulders while Jeannette hovered herself back onto her old neck.  Sunny's head blinked twice, life returning to the once glassy eyes and a smile spreading over her flat expression as she regained control.  Likewise, Jeannette's body shuddered, then stumbled a bit as she regained control, fingers flexing and back stretching as she regained sensation.  \"Come on, my house isn't too far off!  We'll be in and out in ten minutes.\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My place is a bit further, but don't worry!  I live in the downtown area near a bunch of cool shops!  Once I drop part of me off at my condo we'll be in the perfect spot to start our tour.\"  Sunny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your head seem to both have the same idea on who will pair up with which girl.

To tell you the truth its both me and Sunny's first time sharing control with someone else and we both think it's actually kind of cool.  Talking to one another telepathically and deciding who gets control of what is pretty fun.  Plus, while it's not how we were originally planning on doing it we DID end up getting what we wanted.  Sunny got a new head and I got a new body, even we are sharing it.\"  Her body language shifted and she walked over to her old body with an athletic stride, Jeannette taking control of Sunny's body and Sunny going along with it.  Jeannette removed Sunny's old dormant head and held it out to you with one hand while patting her old motionless body's neck stump.  \"So, what do you say?  Care to wear us for the evening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your head, who is looking at Jeannette's tall athletic figure.  While not particularly out of shape you were never dedicated enough to build up that kind of figure, you knew your head was seriously considering that proposal.  You yourself were looking at Sunny's perfect little blue eyes, rose red lips, and perfectly straightened black hair with a little bit of envy.  It was a really pretty head.  Then again, you  knew you'd always wanted to fly so your head giving up that power would be a tough bargain, and feeling the breeze on your neck and being able to see, smell, and hear anything without a head was a fascinating state that you'd love to experiment more with.

This part of town will be more popular once you get that report going,\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For sure,\" Kim said, \"First off, why are there so many heads here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good question! Think of this place as a safe haven for disembodied heads or a place where we can feel safe being bodiless. It's either here or being sold in a store or end up with someone else. Some of us are here because we lost our bodies to who knows where. Others ended up losing the ability to attach to any body. Then there are those who just wants to rest as a head here,\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Kim said, \"Mind telling me about your life here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure,\" Anna said, \"As I said before, I work as a tour guide of this place.

There are some other heads that work around here despite the lack of limbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To think this was all possible,\" Kim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, look at me! I'm technically working as a tour guide here and my body is off working at the gift shops,\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any recommendations for us to visit?\" Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well you can visit the local shelves and detach your own head,\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I don't think I'm able to do that,\" Kim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can, only here though. The detachment stuff triggers when anyone comes around here,\" Anna said, \"I got a history lecture to go in detail, but it's excessive. Maybe the new museum here might help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim thought about what to do as she wants to experience detachment, but at the same time she is interested with the so called history that Anna mentioned.

She saw hands between the sides of her head as she assumed that it belonged to Anna.

Now you can finally experience the best part of this town,\" Anna said, \"So how you like being a head?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim blew some hair off her face.

I do not want to degrade any heads in the room, I am simply discussing the topic at hand,\" Dr. Goodman explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do keep in mind that this town is exclusive in this case as most of the head detachment started with us. Some people come here to see our mismatched state as they say,\" Dr. Riley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head shops are perfect to gain companions or for bodies to have heads, but we got adoption centers for heads without bodies. Some tourist like head shops so that they can either swap places or have proof of our state. However, there has been news of heads sold in the black market, stolen for profit, and misused. This often happens in many head shops either behind the store or the store itself. Some of these shops are shady while some are questionable at best. Some people bought heads and resold them for a higher price. So I ask you all, what is your stance on the matter and the value of a head's rights?\" explained Dr. Goodman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey's head thought about it for a bit and when she had permission to speak, she...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You'd had a bad week.  A VERY bad week.  It started with your girlfriend of three years dumping you, and it only went downhill from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn complete fairness to Rebecca, she was honest with her reasons and did her best to let you down easy.  She wanted to be with someone who had greater aspirations than to work at an arcade for the foreseeable future, if not the rest of his life, and had met a guy who fit the bill at her own job.  You understood her reasoning, but it didn't make it suck for you any less.  What made it unbearably awkward, however, was when she actually tried to leave your place her body threw a fit.  As it turns out, Rebecca's body still loved you and didn't give a shit about your work so long as she could be with you, so when the time came for Rebecca to leave, her head pulled her off and, quite literally, kicked her to the curb.  Now, having Rebecca's hot body certainly seemed like a nice consolation prize at first, though you did miss the long deep conversations (which Rebecca's body was too slow a typist to keep up with) and the kissing (which was impossible for obvious reasons).  However, as Rebecca's head angrily called you day in and day out, demanding to speak with her body to try talking her into dumping you and coming back to her, it certainly wore your nerves thin and made getting a good night's sleep difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHEN, halfway through the week, the next gut punch was delivered.  The arcade you worked for burned down.  According to the official report, some frayed wiring in an old <b>Indiana Jones</b> pinball machine had lit up the ratty old carpet and since the arcade ran on the sort of profits that made the manager regularly choose between \"paying his electricity bills and his employees\" and \"paying for preventative maintenance on his fire sprinklers and his insurance bills\", the place went up like a matchbox and there was no way in hell it'd ever be rebuilt.  This was a crushing blow since Mead Town only had 2 arcades and the other one wasn't hiring, leaving you out of work and with nowhere to look for one in your field.  For the time being, you'd have to live off Rebecca's body's salary, which was only half of what she formerly made seeing as how her head and body were both entitled to half their shared paycheck since neither had legally 'divorced' the other yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THEN</b>,to end your week, you lost your body and car.  You'd been driving around town looking at every place with a 'now hiring' sign in its window, when a truck going down a hill had a brake failure and t-boned the hell out of you.  The impact launched your head off your body and sent you sailing out the open window (your car didn't have an A/C).  Your head, luckily, skidded across a freshly watered soccer field and apart from some light bruises was unharmed.  Your body, on the other hand, had been completely <b>Final Destination</b>-ed, as the truck that hit you had been carrying a bunch of scrap metal from a construction site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in only a week you'd lost part of a girlfriend, most of a self, your job, and your car.  Also, while the insurance companies were still dueling about who was at fault and how much you were owed for your maiming, what was already certain was that it would be a LONG time before you ever saw a dime in compensation for your loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot all was lost, however.  Your girlfriend('s body), taking pity on you, had allowed you to wear her until you got back on your feet.  Or any pair of feet you could afford, that is.  While the gesture was certainly touching, it did feel pretty weird.  While mis-matched heads and bodies weren't too odd a sight in Mead Town, it still provoked some gossip, snickers, and disapproving looks from the less open-minded members of the town and especially around tourists.  It wasn't like you could hide your condition, either.  Your head was an angular olive skinned block with short cropped black hair and a goatee, a predominantly Spanish and Italian mix with small traces of Moor and Native American thrown in.  Rebecca, meanwhile, was a pale skinned, red freckled, and extremely curvy Scot who's body reacted to sun exposure the same way a space shuttle reacted to atmospheric reentry.  IE it burned bright red and flaked like crazy.  So getting your skin-tones to match would be impossible and hiding the huge T&amp;A that had first caught your eye at the pub all those years ago also wasn't an option (That probably made you sound pretty shallow.  You didn't fall in love with her for her body!  That's just what got your attention!... whatever.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up to a brand new week, a week which surely couldn't go worse than last week... right?... you and Rebecca's body...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey ETHAN, how's it going?\"  Jodie asked, tossing her jacket aside as she entered your shared apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'alright.\" You respond, not bothering to move from the couch which you were currently sprawled across.  \"Wish you'd give up on the whole 'Ethan' thing already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJodie's reflection in the TV frowned, which probably meant that Jodie was frowning.  \"Whatever do you mean ETHAN, MY DARLING BOYFRIEND, ETHAN!\" She said, not really asking so much as she was reaffirming her stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes.  \"Seriously, I know I said that I'd play along with your little game, but when I made that promise I thought that this would just be some sort of weird transitional phase or something.  Like we'd do this for a few weeks, then you'd get over yourself and just admit that you're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ETHAN.\"  Jodie said, her soft hands firmly clasping themselves into either side of your head.  You could tell by her tone that if you didn't cut off your current line of dialogue, you'd be spending yet another night on the couch.  It was a comfy couch, true, a couch that you were fine spending all day on, but given the choice between the lonely couch and the nice warm bed with the nice warm girlfriend that allowed you to do nice warm girl... sorry, 'boyfriend' on girlfriend things to, the couch suddenly lost its luster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned, then put on the deep gravely voice you used for your Ethan character and responded \"Yeah, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled.  \"I love you!\"  She bent down and upside-down kissed you, closing her eyes and losing herself in your soft, 'almost feminine' lips.  Before long, you lost yourself in her 'actually' feminine lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Esther Madsen, a sophomore enrolled in Mead Town University and a raging lesbian.  You'd been assigned Jodie Kim as your dorm-roommate, and within days of having her as your roommate you knew that you wanted her as your girlfriend.  Jodie was funny, smart, hot, Korean (you had an Asian thing), and was majoring in the same field as you.  Problem was, Jodie was straight.  Or, rather, she kept telling herself that she was straight.  It was painfully obvious that she was a closeted bisexual, from the way she eye-fucked both the hottest boy and girl in Calculus class, to the way she would ramble about how hot her (female) friends were while drunk, to the way she would accidentally leave tabs open on her laptop depicting some very not-straight 'fan art', and just the general way she acted and dressed.  But, Jodie refused to acknowledge this fact and when you had made your advances she shot you down over and over again on grounds of \"I'm just not into chicks!\", despite eyeing you with greater and greater intensity over the weeks, and 'forgetting' to lock the door when she was changing more and more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, you persisted.  Week after week, month after month, and eventually halfway through the year you were able to secure a date with her.  On three conditions.  One, you had to buy or borrow a male body and wear it at all times when in Jodie's presence.  No problem, your good friend Conner and his fiance were both fans of female bodies and they were both happy to swap with you as long as you needed to borrow his.  Two, you couldn't wear makeup and had to style your hair like a dude's.  Not a deal breaker, while you'd never been a butch lesbian you didn't hate the look or anything and you didn't wear a ton of makeup anyway so going without it wasn't a huge loss.  Third and finally, you were to address yourself and be addressed as 'Ethan' and talk like you were a guy.  That was a bit childish.  Was she really that self conscious that she couldn't STAND the idea of people knowing she was bi?  Everyone who knew her probably already knew, they were just too polite to tell her they knew.  And besides, anyone who knew you still recognized you with your hair jelled up and your face un-made-up, so it's not like it was fooling your mutual friends.  Why did she have to make things so difficult?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, believing that after the first handful of dates, a few long conversations about your mutual feelings, and a couple of shags, you agreed to her terms and became 'Ethan'.  And boy, how wrong those assumptions were.  Two months after you two had started dating, and Jodie STILL insisted on pretending you were a dude.  She refused to address you by your real name, got passive aggressive as all hell whenever your hair or eyelashes started to get too long, and if you didn't put on the stupid gravely voice (that really hurt your throat, by the way) she'd pretend she couldn't hear you half the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapped out of your trip down memory lane by the feeling of Jodie breaking off the kiss, you ask her...</span></div></div>",

My voice hurts when I had to do that deep voice and it just hurts overall now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJodie looked at you for a moment and thought about it some more. She took a seat on the couch and tried to think about what you said as you sat next to her. Your girlfriend started to look guilty as she gave a big sigh and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Jodie said, \"If it really is a problem now, I guess I need to grow up and accept the fact that I'm bi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never really yelled at Jodie in this entire relationship, not to this extend. You did argue, but it was never harsh criticism as you know that Jodie is a nice girl despite her passive aggressive behavior here and there. Perhaps it was best if you were aggressive as well to make this work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if we were to do this, I kind of need help making small steps,\" Jodie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any suggestions?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I first need to slowly acknowledge you as a female first of all,\" Jodie said, \"Maybe slowly become more feminine as time goes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. How about I just take my head off and you take care of it?\" you suggested, \"My gender is confusing when I'm only a head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took your head off and gave it to Jodie, \"So am I a guy or girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm liking this plan, you still look like a man but you can still be yourself,\" Jodie said, \"By the way, you don't have to use that voice anymore. It's starting to sound less convincing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god!\" you said with your original voice, \"It feels so nice to be able to use my regular voice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just imagine it being a guy with a girly voice like that anime I watched,\" Jodie said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" you said, \"You're making progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then gave a look at your old male body and whistle it to go back to it's original head. You are now just a head with Jodie and it will take a while until you regain your original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any conditions my little noggin?\" Jodie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of want to make my hair long and maybe put on some make up again,\" you requested, \"And of course, take care of me well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Ethan, I mean Es... Elena?\" Jodie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call me Ethan for now,\" you said, \"Small steps remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Jodie said, \"Perhaps I can treat you like a plant. I will allow your hair to grow and I'll slowly get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would take a while,\" you said, \"But it's enough time for me to show you my true self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!

They were hanging out with each other at Dan's house when their bodies took their heads off and left them on a table in the dining room. The bodies took off and left them there, bodiless. Frightened by the fact that they were just heads, they could do nothing but sit and wait around for something, or someone, to help them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after waiting around for what seemed like hours, something opened the door to the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?

They heard footsteps heading for them, making them expect that someone was coming to help them. But, they were shocked by what was coming to \"help\" them. What came around the corner was a nude body without a head! It seemed to be the body of an 18 year old male. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. This isn't gonna help at all!\" Dan sighed. \"Well, we'll just have to take whatever help we can get, even if it's a... naked... headless... body.\" Stan said. The body just stood their motionless, however, and it would stay like that for a few moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Dan said, annoyed. \"Just gonna stand there, huh?\" Just after Dan spoke, the body began to slowly move toward Dan and Stan's heads. \"I think you made it mad, Dan.\" Stan said. \"What do you mean? I got it to start moving, you should be thanking me!\" Dan retorted. \"How do you know it's actually gonna help us, Dan?\" Stan questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but at least we'll get a chance to find out!\" Dan responded. The body reached the table where the men's heads rested. It reached out and picked up Stan's head in its hands. It then placed Stan's head just to the right of where his head should've been placed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he's trying to help me, Dan! Although he was a little bit off with the placement of my head.\" Stan said, happy that his head was on a body once again. \"Well what about me? There isn't another body for my head to be placed on!\" Dan said dissappointedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body, still controlling itself, then turned to Dan's head. It picked up Dan's head, and placed it down next to Stan's head, both of their heads now attached to the body. Both men's eyes widened in fear, seeing as both of their heads were on a single body. \"What the hell? Why did the body place both of us on it?\" Dan said. \"I don't know man! Either way, I still have no control over the body.\" Stan responded. Dan shook his head before saying, \"Yeah, I don't have any control either!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body walked itself over to the couch, and sat down on it. It then immediately went limp, relinquishing control to Dan and Stan. Who has control of the body now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whatever unknowable force had made the head swapping possible also allowed Sandra's snake body to be able to digest anything her human head could eat, meaning she didn't have to subsist on things like raw rabbit (though she had developed a distinct taste for meat, where she had once been a vegetarian). Sandra was lucky in that regard, as particularities such as that seemed to vary greatly among the swaps - Mila knew of a man who had ended up with the body of a dairy cow, who could now only eat grass and hay. Meanwhile, Mila had inherited Sandra's former vegetarian lifestyle. Not long after the swap, she'd tried a burger from her favorite burger place and was throwing up for the rest of the afternoon - after that she'd decided to stick with the food her new body was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila called the nearest pizza place and ordered a half-pepperoni, half-veggie lover's. When the pizza arrived, she tipped the delivery boy (a pimple-faced teen with the hairy, obese body of a much older man) and set it down on the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I am starving!\" Sandra exclaimed, slithering up onto the table. Along with her newfound love of meat, she'd also acquired the slow metabolism of a reptile, and consequently rarely ate more than three times in a week. She couldn't swallow food whole the way a regular snake would, however, so Mila held a slice in front of her face while she took bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon only one slice of veggie pizza remained. \"I don't think I can eat that last piece right now,\" Mila groaned. \"You can have it if you want.\" Before Sandra could answer, they both were startled by the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now who could that be?\" Mila wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she entered she saw a man with a luscious female body doing a striptease for a surprisingly large (for the daytime) crowd. Olivia noticed that more than a few in the crowd had bodies that actually matched their heads - out-of-towners, no doubt. Since the \"Great Rearranging\", as some called it, this formerly unassuming little town had become a hotspot for tourists. Olivia usually felt that the whole thing was kind of voyeuristic, but she supposed that here at the club, where bodies had always been a commodity, it made sense. And these days the crowds were more diverse than ever, since there was bound to be something appealing for everybody on display. Olivia picked her way through the crowd until she found a seat. Then she stared at the stage and waited.</span></div></div>",

I hope no one in the house is ophiophobic! Ladies, gentlemen, and everyone in between, I give you\u2026 The Sultry Serpentine Sirens!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was a mix of masculine hoots and feminine cheers as a spotlight came on and Mila stalked into it, Sandra draped around her shoulders. Olivia nearly did a double take when she saw her \u2018girlfriend\u2019. The glittering outfit she wore was very revealing, but Olivia had seen her in skimpy clothes before. What was different was the attitude. Mila normally seemed somewhat awkward, maybe even a little meek, but there was no trace of that now. Her every move exuded confidence and smoldering eroticism. Olivia thought she knew Mila, but she had never seen her so\u2026 <i>sexy</i>. The music started and Mila began her dance. Her beautiful body gyrated as Sandra swayed in time with her motions. It was amazing how they worked together; normally a snake was little more than a prop, but Sandra was actively dancing along, sliding and slithering around Mila\u2019s voluptuous curves in a way that accented them and complemented her own dance moves. Olivia was enthralled. Soon Mila began removing pieces of her outfit, much to the approval of the crowd. Olivia felt a little embarrassed, but couldn\u2019t look away if she tried. A familiar feeling edged its way into her awareness. She did her best to ignore it. When Mila was wearing nothing besides a thong, the act reached its climax. Sandra went over her shoulder, down her back, and came out between her thighs, jutting straight forward at least a foot. Mila accented this with a couple of hip thrusts so the symbolism wasn\u2019t lost on anyone. Then Sandra began to work her way up, dragging her tongue along what had once been her own stomach. She slithered between her breasts, pausing to tease the nipples with her mouth, then darted around her shoulders and met Mila face-to-face in a kiss. The cheers reached a crescendo and then the light went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Olivia caught her breath as applause erupted around her. Reluctantly, she glanced down. Yep \u2013 fully erect. She\u2019d been rock hard since the act started. She sighed. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d She said softly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girl even has a darker shade of green for hair as it's long and a bit shaggy. The mother looks at Cindy's head as the head looks afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should ask if you want her as a pet. I know it's for a deal we made, but you have to consider the human's feelings.\" said the alien mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" said the alien girl as she read some description about Cindy's head, \"Your name is Cindy and your are about my age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, nice to meet you.\" said Cindy nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy felt that this is what could have happen if she never had her head abducted. Her mother promised her to get a pet the next day, but sadly this happened. Now she is going to be a pet for a girl in a similar situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise to take care of you Cindy.

All that does matter is that Arg has died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout the god of bloodshed around, weapons cannot kill their targets.  Clubs simply knock people about without doing any damage, swords cleave through the flesh without drawing a spec of blood or inflicting an once of pain, arrows and spears pass through the body with a light tickle.  While some still tried to do battle, every conflict quickly devolved into aimless slap fights where neither party could gain an edge.  Eventually, war ceased to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to wage war on each other like they used, a great game was formed to keep the bickering races of the world occupied.  The humans, centaurs, dwarves, naga, and orcs all began to participate in the game of heads.  While cutting off someone's head would no longer kill them, it would at least make things more difficult for them.  Their heads could be stolen and carried away from their bodies, if someone else placed a different head on their shoulders and had a wizard \"heal\" the wound then the new head would take control of the body, and even if one could keep their severed head and body together they'd still have to carry it around everywhere until they could find a wizard (who often charged exorbitant fees for their services) which was just a hassle.  Because of all this, it became popular for warriors, adventurers, bounty hunters, and people who simply had nothing better to do to hack one another's heads off.  Some made collections, some pawned the heads off as toys to the the rich and the lonely, and some just hacked people's heads off then ran away for shits and giggles.  The five sentient races all found this game to be great fun, and a wonderful alternative to slaughtering one another like they used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, who are you in this world?</span></div></div>",
