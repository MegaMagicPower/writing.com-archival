You were in a train car of some sort along with other strange creatures and people.  You look at the reflective metal on the ceiling to find that you were a human male wearing a green T-shirt and blue jeans.  Your blond hair had a golden hue while you couldnt help but look at the other people who were just as curious.  You stuck your hand in your pocket to feel a card and took it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt read \"YOUR NAME IS: Frend  PRONOUNCED LIKE: Friend\" in a (insert name here) kind of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frend... Frend\" you repeated to yourself, getting used to having a name.  You also noticed that everyone had a card containing their name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome new creations\" you heard a voice over the loud speaker \"as you get used to your names I would like introduce myself as Hudson Speaker.  A little info about our destination Centertown, Centertown is like a Lobby connecting all five diffrent worlds together, Fantacy, Sci-Fi, Historical Fiction, Anime, and Speed Worlds.  You are the creations of many minds, drawn in paper you have been created and now will reside in this world, if you have any questions please visit the library at Centertown.  Now a few rules before we get to Centertown, one, no fighting in Centertown or we will have to punish you severly.  Two, you are only allowed into worlds that you are compatable to and centertown, so no going into other worlds that you were not made for.  Three, have fun and pro...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHudson was cut off as an explosion racked through the entire car, everything shook as black things broke through the windows and started to grab some of the people.  You stood up to try and fight off the creatures but someone or somthing slammed into you, sending you breaking through the window and falling in a white world.  You got a glance down at what looked like a pencil drawing of a town, but it ended quickly as you fell through the roof of a house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning, you opened your eyes to see the white bridge that the train was on in the roof of the house you just made.  Getting up, you rubbed the back of your head and looked around the room you were in.  You couldnt help but yawn as the bed room was as bland and as vanila as it could get, there was absolutly no color.  Going down the stairs you found yourself in the living room just as void of color as the bedroom.  Sitting on the sofa watching static on the telivision was a person who was in a robe and holding a pen, he too was void of all color, like a pen drawing.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you asked, waiting for a responce, but the man didn't ancwer.  Hesitantly you reached out and poked the man, and instantly color flowed into his body, changing his apperence drasticly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man had black hair that looke like it was dunked in black ink while the man was now clothed in a strange robe with what could be described as the sleave version of bell bottoms, bell bottoms, and a beret on his head.  Parts of his clothing covered in black splotches.  He also wore a red and blue scarf around his neck that covered up his mouth very effectively, and the man was now missing his right arm, only a mangled up sleeve left in it's  place.  The pen he was holding turned into a giant green and twisted fountain pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I LIVE!\" The man yelled as he erupted from his seat and turned to you.<br>\r\n\"THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING ME MY COLOR BACK!\"  He then caughed and said \"sorry, my name is Splotchy Ink, and yours?\"<br>\r\n\"Frend\" You replied, kind of caught off guard by the sudden outburst of energy, \"and what happened to you?\"<br>\r\nSplotchy smiled (or at least you thought he did) as he said \"remember what Hudson said about fighting in Centertown?\"<br>\r\n\"I think he said somthing about punishment\" you said \"and I take it that this is punishment\"<br>\r\n\"Yes it is Frend\" Splotchy said \"and unfortunatly I was bound to be colorless forever, but thanks to you I AM FREE!!!\"<br>\r\nYou stepped back and said \"please don't go out and start killing everyone.\"<br>\r\nSplotchy looked at you surprised and said \"why heck no, I learned my lesson thanks to you.\"  He then bowed down \"how may I be of service.\"<br>\r\n\"Taking me to Centertown would be nice\" you said hoping that you can get out of the colorless void.<br>\r\nSplotchy laughed \"why of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen unexpectedly, the scarf that hung down his back wrapped around the giant pen and drew a large hole right under you.  You fell through and landed into the grass, with Splotchy landing right next to you.<br>\r\nLooking up you first saw five large doors, but your attention was diverted by Splotchy turning your head back to what looked like a large kingdom.  But...</span></div></div>",

The strange monsters that were chasing them though were obvious, completly black like walking ink blots.<br>\r\n\"SPLOTCHY!\" yelled what looked like a dragon, and by the sound of her voice it was a girl dragon.<br>\r\nOne of the black creatures leaped on top of the dragon and started to suck out the color, the creature in question becoming larger and larger.  I then saw Splotchy leap up on the dragon and stuck the tip of his pen into the black creature.  It screamed as it was then sucked into Splotchy's pen.  The dragoness colapsed on the ground, her color faded out a little.<br>\r\n\"Shela\" Splotchy gasped as he then touched the dragoness with the tip of his pen and started restoring her color \"what in the world is happening here?\"<br>\r\nShela took a gulp of air for a second before saying \"those black creatures, they seemed to come out from nowhere.  At first they only roamed the corners of the other world, but then they grew in power untill entire worlds were taken over.  It was so bad that we had to lock the doors, but they were able to leak through.\"<br>\r\nSplotchy then started to draw somthing and threw it towards you.  It looked like cross between a paintbrush and a sword.<br>\r\n\"Frend, get the little ink blots while I try and take on the larger ones\" Splotchy said before running into the village.</span></div></div>",

I've never used a real sword before, unless you'd could the occassions I swung a stick around.<br>\r\n\"Don't just stand there you have to fight.\"<br>\r\n\"But I've never-\"<br>\r\n\"Now's not the time.  If you don't, the world will fall apart.\" replied Splotchy in an unusually sharp voice.  \"You have the choice to either stay and fight or run away, but they'll find you and your color eventually and then you'll be all alone.  I'd recommend going with the first option.\"<br>\r\nI was at a lack for words then I took a deep breath and charged in.  I came upon on another person being drained of color from the creatures.  She looked human at first, but here wings gave her an angelic appearance.  I dispatched the creature with ease, its body burst into black droplets or paint.  I thought it was dead, but then it started to reform itself again.  I was about to panic, but the Splotchy shouted to me.  I turned to see him engaged in combat with several of the creatures, but kept a deal of his attention on me.<br>\r\n\"Stab the inks with the hilt of your sword to vanquish them.\"<br>\r\nI quickly did so and the creature began to be drawn into the sword.  As it happened, color dripped down the blade and dripped off the end of the sword.  Instead of merely falling to the ground it curved and splattered on the woman who still laid on the ground drained of her natural hue.  The color absorbed into her and with it her state returned to normal.<br>\r\nI didn't have time to stay for a thank you as my actions alarmed more of the creatures.  They came from all size and soon a dozen surrounded me.  Three melted into the ground and rushed at my feet, but I jumped backwards.  One came at me from behind, but I heard the grotesque shriek it made and twisted my body cut its body in two.  A second pair came at me, but I cut the first and dodged the second.  After it landed it prepared to come at me again, but it didn't have the chance as I was already coming at it and cut it down.  I turned to the remaining creatures and they began to sink into the ground.  I thought they were retreating, but they began merging together.  Even the ones I cut down had pulled themselves together to merge.  The creatures emerged as a single jugernaut of the creatures.  It was a head over me and twice as vicious.  I didn't give it a chance to attack and sliced its arm off.  The creature roared, but it wasn't defeated.  The arm merely returned to an ink state and returned to its body and a new arm formed.  It then came at me, claws swinging fiercely.  My heart was pumping, I couldn't fight something like this.  I wasn't a warrior.  Suddenly...</span></div></div>",

Instantly you met color less women and men in the same white robes standing in the street doining nothing.  There were even what Frend thought to be little dinosaurs but were also colorless standing on the side of the street doing nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you saw a black creature run toward Splotchy.<br>\r\n\"WATCH OUT!\" you yelled as the creature was bound to take down Splotchy.<br>\r\nSwinging his giant pen that was almost as large as you at the monster, Splotchy took down the creature as it wriggled on the ground.  Getting a good look you noticed that the creature looked like it was made out of a black liquid, forming into anything it needed.  The monster was about to stand back up but Splotchy stuck his pen into the beast's gut and sucked it up inside the pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplotchy then started drawing what looked like a sword, except that it also looke like a large eyedropper filled with multi colored ink.<br>\r\n\"Here Frend, take this and help restore the color in some of these people\" Splotchy said \"just touch them with the end of the dropper or squert ink on them, don't bother restoring the buildings, the people will more likely be of more use.\"<br>\r\n\"Why can't I just touch them like I did with you?\" you asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"Well, you can\" Splotchy said \"but you would drain your own color and become a mindless black and white mannequin like everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Splotchy ran around restoring the people in the village and...</span></div></div>",

A strand of toilet paper hung from beneath his tail.<br>\r\n\"No more pork stew for me!\" the dragon muttered to himself with a thick British accent as he excited the stall. He then noticed the four people who were staring at him with confusion. <br>\r\n\"Oh, hello there!\" said the dragon cheerfully, \"I'm Elruze, and who might you be?\"<br>\r\nThe group introduced themselves.<br>\r\n\"You have a little, um,\" Splotchy began, gesturing towards the dragon's rear.<br>\r\n\"Oh!

Everything seemed relatively normal at first, then they passed a few peasants cooling themselves with miniature fans and a minstrel with an electric guitar. <br>\r\n\"Hear ye, hear ye!\" shouted a crier, \"The king would like to make an announcement!\"<br>\r\n\"It's about time he got away from that silly telly,\" said the dragon.<br>\r\n\"So,\" you begin, \"It seems relatively peaceful here...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's very peaceful,\" said Elruze, \"No real fighting, hunger, or disease.\"<br>\r\n\"I wonder, \" Splotchy mused quietly, \"Could these drastic alterations to the stereotype be affecting this world's resistance to the ink creatures somehow?

Soon enough there was a rythmic tap that slowly increased in volume as a large square of blanks marched around the moutain lead by a person drained by all of there color playing a drum.  There was an obvious trait that stuck out about the person, was that his shoulders were about to touch the bottom of his ears.<br>\r\n\"I can't beleve that they brought Rave.N all the way here, he must have put up one heck of a fight\" Splotchy said as he chuckled at his friend's fate, \"it surprises me that I can still recognize him.\"<br>\r\n\"What's so funny about seeing your friend turned into a colorless being\" you asked with a bit of distaste.  That was when you heard the tap start to burst out in a storm of complicated rythms and patterns before returning to the single series of taps.<br>\r\n\"That's what's funny\" Splotchy said.  \"Rave is one of those people who don't know how to quit... strike that, CAN'T quit.  It's pritty much hard wired in his brain.\"<br>\r\nSplotchy then pointed at the drained person and said to Elruze, \"get that person and bring him to me, he's all the backup we need.

There was a large explosion as the armored blot fired a large glob of ink at the escaping dragon.  Elruze flew left and right dodging the blobs of ink, but felt one of his legs go numb as a blot of ink hit and surounded his leg.  He felt week as his scails started to become dull and pale.  Still, with a last few flaps he was back at the top of the basin before collapsing on landing.<br>\r\n\"I don't feel very good\" Elruze said with a groan.<br>\r\n\"That's because you underestimated them\" Splotchy replied as he tended to the grey indavidual saying to you, \"help Elruze regain some color, we are going to need his help later.\"<br>\r\nYou went up to Elruze and started to recolor him, not noticing that the surrounding area got a little brighter.  Finnishing up Elruze you looked to see how Splotchy was doing to see what seemed like a walking neon sighn.  Acutaly he looked like a colorful band director with his wide shoulders shoved almost all the way up to his ears while his entire suit seemed to light up like it was made of neon.<br>\r\n\"Let me introduce you to Rave-N\" Splotchy said as Rave-N bowed.  \"He's kind of like me but with music, so I think he can help us.\"<br>\r\nThat was when a bubbly roar rumbled the ground.<br>\r\n\"There about to attack\" Splotchy said</span></div></div>",

Rave-N does not hesitate. He strums the electric guitar furiously and plucks a few strings on the harp, then jams a low cord on the piano. A force field appears around you, and not a moment too soon. The cannons fire, but their shots are absorbed by the force field. The field dissipates after the cannons power down.<br>\r\n\"Well, that was close one, now its our turn!\" Splotchy says.<br>\r\n\"Alright, like I said: you guys on the blob, this brother's got the cannons. You dig me?\"<br>\r\n\"We've got it,\" Elruze says.<br>\r\n\"Okay then, let's Funk these guys!\" Rave-N says. He jams out a rock medley on his guitar, and angry red chords fly through the air, slamming into one of the cannons, causing it to explode in a shower of sparks and wires. <br>\r\nThe five of you rush towards the blob, as Rave-N continues to blast the cannons with rock-n-roll. When a cannon takes aim and prepares to fire, he jams out a smooth Reggae blend and a string of notes surround him, causing the ink to deflect off harmlessly into the mountains.<br>\r\nYou dash into the ranks of the armored ink soldiers at the base of the canyon on your way to assault the blob. You slash out with your pen, Renamon attacks with Diamond Storm, Elruze whirls about, scratching with his massive claws, and Splotchy attacks by hurling colored pencils like arrows.<br>\r\n\"There's too many!\" you shout as the soldiers begin to overwhelm you, thanks to their powerful armor and superior numbers.<br>\r\n\"We'll have to retreat!\" Renamon says.<br>\r\n\"I've got you!\" Rave-N shouts, \"This oughta unbalance the odds in your favor!\" <br>\r\nHe strums a Salsa beat, then plays the Blues.

Problem was, it was filled with both the colorless citizens of that world but also with hundreds of the ink blot creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RIKA!\" Renamon yelled in horror as she saw her trainer's colors begin to fade.  You also saw that Renamon's colors were fading too, traveling the ground like colorfull shadows towards the factory.<br>\r\n\"Now that's how they do it\" you said to yourself as you watched your own color drift away, but oddly enough you didn't fade near as quickly as either Rika or Renamon.<br>\r\n\"Renamon\" you commanded \"tell Splotchy that I found a good vantage point and direct him here.  He should return the color of both you and your trainer.\"  Renamon nodded, grabbed Rika and started darting towards Splotchy in a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you had a problem, how to get up the side of the seam less side of the building.  Climbing was out of the question, but an idea came to you while you looked at the eye dropper like sword.  You placed the tip on the ground and dragged it and sure enough, a black line was being drawn on the ground.  A few more lines later and you had a ladder, but the real question was if it was just a real ladder or if it was a drawing of a ladder.  Grabbing the black rungs, you struggled to pull it off the ground, but after some work you were able to lean the ladder up the side of the factory.  With one arm around the canvas you quickly scailed the ladder up the factory wall, but the ladder shook violently.  Taking a quick glance down you saw more of those shadow creatures climbing up the ladder behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh blast\" you muttered before scrambling up as fast as you could.  One of the shadow creatures lached on to your ankle, but a quick swipe of your sword took care of it but also almost sent you falling off.  Finaly, you reached the roof of the factory, and with great satisfaction you pushed the ladder off, sending the ink creatures splattering on the ground along with the ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then waited, but in no time you heard a pair of feet hit the roof of the factory.

When he finally gets to your location, he looks up at you and Splotchy on the roof, and calls out, \u201cCome with me if you want to live!\u201d You recognize him as a T-800 Terminator, a powerful cyborg killing machine. You get on the back of the motorcycle, and Splotchy climbs into the sidecar. You peel off, pick up Rika and Renamon (whom Splotchy draws another sidecar for) and head off...</span></div></div>",
