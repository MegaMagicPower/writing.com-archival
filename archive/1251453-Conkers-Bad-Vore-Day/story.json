However, a migrane is nothing compared to a hangover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker slowly opened his eyes, but doing so sent bolts of pain through his head, so he shut them again. Lazily, he brought his paws to his head and rubbed it hard, trying to stop the pain flowing through his skull. If he were to tell someone how he was feeling, he'd surely say \"like a badger's ass\". The pain was unbearable and virtually undescribable. How could one describe the pain Conker was feeling? There was no word for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he moved a bit, hazy memories flowed through his mind, but the only thing he could remember clearly was going to his favorite pub, still depressed over the loss of Berri, his former girfriend who was on the wrong end of a Tommy gun. After that, things were a drunken blurr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he gathered the courage to open his eyes, but not before expelling some of the poisen inside him through his mouth. The acidic taste of his vomit littered his mouth and he wanted nothing more than to get the taste off his tongue. As his bloodshot eyes finally opened up, the squirrel took a look at his surroundings.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't tell where the light was coming from, but he had more pressing matters to worry about...like, who was beating on a drum so goddamn loud so early in the morning?  His surroundings didn't tell him much..nor did his mind since he was in the fog of the mother of all hangovers.  After a minute or two, Conker decided to stand up on the squishy ground.  He was able to get up, but his short legs were unsteady.  He felt like throwing up more poison, but Conker managed to keep it down.   It took him another minute to realize where he was;  he was in a stomach!  The lack of  sunlight and of windows told him that much...not to mention the squishy ground and that drum beat that was the heartbeat of whoever...or whatever...had eaten him.   He tried to remember who or what had eaten him....but his memory was still fuzzy.  He did remember playing poker with a snake at one point....but the stomach didn't seem to belong to a snake...unless it was a BIG snake.   If he was in a stomach, Conker didn't understand how he was still alive.  <br>\r\n               The light he saw earlier was coming from a lamp post about 15 feet away from him.<br>\r\n                 \"What is a lamp post doing in here?\" asked Conker aloud.<br>\r\n                Right at the bottom of the lamp post, stood a rather short man in a black robe.  He walked unsteadily to the lamp post and towards the little man.<br>\r\n                   \"CONKER!\"  said the man in a deep booming voice.  \"YOUR TIME IS.....\"  suddenly, the man was overcome with a coughing fit.    \"goddamn cat!\"<br>\r\n                 \"Who're you?\" asked Conker.<br>\r\n                \"I'm Gregg\" said the man.  \"and don't laugh at my size!  Anyway...this is for you\"  Gregg held out a pill.  <br>\r\n                 \"What's this do?\" asked Conker, taking the pill and looking at it.<br>\r\n                \"Just take the bloodly thing and you'll understand\" said Gregg,  \"and now...if you don't mind..I'm out of here...I can't stand cats....\"  Here, Gregg vanished into thin air, but the lamp post was still there. <br>\r\n             Conker shrugged and took the pill.  In a matter of seconds, his hangover was gone...but his memory was still hazy.<br>\r\n               \"That fills loads better!\" said Conker happily.  \"now...I suppose I need to get out of here\"  <br>\r\n                </span></div></div>",

At least now he knew how to easily get rid of his hangover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squirrel reached over for his dresser and pulled out a draw, containing bottles of pills. Taking one, he popped it into his mouth and swallowed it, his hangover instantly going away. \"I love those things.\" he said to himself before he hopped out of of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick breakfast of cereal, the red furred squirrel sighed and placed his head on his fist, missing Berri and wishing she was sitting across the table from him like she usually would. His tail wagged slowly behind him and he watched the clock tick away. \"I have to do something. I can't sit around here all day.\" He said out loud, getting away from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he headed out the front door, he stopped, not really knowing where to go. \"Hmm...I could go down to the Cock and Plucker and see the guys. I'm sure there's a huge party to celebrate the war's end.\" He said in his mind, looking down the path towards the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I could go for a walk in the park or something.\"</span></div></div>",

He paid no attention to the squirrel as he made his way into the bar, and just as Conker thought, a massive party was going on inside, drunken squirrel soldiers singing off-key to the band playing, Gregg asking a female soldier what she thought of cats, cavemen being chased by the drunken Sergeant who thought they were Tediz, and someone Conker hadn't seen before was sitting at a table drinking water. Conker thought it might be good to sit next to what he guessed was a dragon after he got his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squirrel approached the huge bartender and ordered his usual. A drunken Rodent stumbled over and ordered another drink. \"Hey, *hic* Conker! This...this stuff is great!\" He said, not even knowing that Conker had just arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker nodded and sipped from his beer. \"Yeah, it is..\" he replied with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodent burped and took another swig, wrapping his skinny arm around Conker. \"Hey, come sit with us!\" He slurred, stumbling towards his table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker broke free and looked towards the dragon sitting by himself, then looked over to the table filled with vomitting, drunken squirrels. He didn't know whether to join them, or the dragon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unlike the Tommy Gun that Conker was used to seeing, this one had a block grip instead of a pistol grip on the barrel, and a stick clip instead of a drum clip. \"I'm Major FT of the 202nd Airborne Infantry Division. We dropped behind the beach you squirrel guys stormed tonight. Unfortunately, most of my squad was killed.\" The dragon said, sipping his water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker nodded and sighed. \"It was like that on the beach as well. Were your guys all dragons?\" He asked, taking another chug of his beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT nodded and leaned on the table some. \"The squirrels allied with us, but were pretty untrustworthy of  us, so they sent us behind the lines. Our unit was scattered all over the coast and I found about 20 or so of my guys. By the time we reached the beachhead, there was about 9 of us. By that time, we met up with the squirrel's 99th Airborne and cut off the Tediz retreat, but I lost the last 8 of my squad in the gunfight.\" FT continued, almost finishing his water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker looked a bit shocked and ordered another beer. \"Sounds like a tough fight. Why are you drinking water? You might feel better drinking a beer.\" Conker asked, reaching out for his second mug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT shook his head. \"Nah. I don't really drink.\" He explained, wagging his arrow-tipped tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squirrel nodded his head and quickly finished up his second drink. \"After I got back to Windy, I met up with my girlfriend and were forced at gunpoint to rob a bank.\" He began, lying a bit to make him seem more innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon smirked and held up a picture of the weasel who killed Berri. \"By this guy?\" FT asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker looked away from the photo. \"Yeah, he later killed my girlfriend when the heist turned into a trap set by the Panther King.\" Conker finished, sighing sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Major grinned and petted Conker on the head. \"Yeah, we picked him up as he was escaping the bank. He tried to fire on us, but I acted first and filled him full of lead with this.\" FT said, patting the Thompson on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker smiled and gave the dragon a hug. \"Thanks, I was hoping something like that would happen to him.\" He replied, then asked for another beer.</span></div></div>",

I'll make it slow as possible.\" FT replied, licking Conker's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker whimpered and relaxed himself, pushing his tail aside a bit. \"Ok...I'll try it...but if it hurts, I want you to stop right away.\" Conker said, sipping from his beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to, FT thrusted his hips, the dragon's cock slowly sliding into Conker. \"Hey, I'm trying to drink here....oooh, that does feel good...\" Conker exclaimed, spilling his beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT grinned and held Conker close, purring as his cock slid deeper into the squirrel's tailhole. \"I told you it would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir act had been spotted by the bartender, who became angry. \"Hey!

I don't want to get shot again!\" He shouted, noting that the slightest movement would have knocked the gun right off the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT sighed and hilted, letting Conker get used to the feeling of his cock inside his furry rump. \"You wanna stay here or go back to my place?\" FT asked, kissing Conker's cheek.</span></div></div>",

Plus, I really doubt that any of the losers I helped out last time would really be in such a vindictive mood. And even if they do, what can they really do to me?\" Conker then began to walk off toward the waterfall. \"Danger - what a laugh.

He came to the fork in the road and took a survey of his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh here we go again,\" he said. \"Wait, why did I even come here? In fact, I'm almost certain that this is nowhere near where my home is...Course I'm not going home. I got to get back to the castle; they probably want me to sign some new treaty or something boring like that.\"<br>\r\nConker was back to feeling sorry for himself again; he missed his home, he missed Berri. Ever since he became King he didn't really get a chance to just be himself anymore; aside from sneaking off and going to the Cock and Plucker. But at least Conker knew that the Castle was close to here; in fact it should be just over the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever when Conker went to look up, he noticed that many things in this little crossroads had changed. The windmill was still gone, but they cleaned up all of the debris that it left. He saw that the small Beehive was gone; Conker had a moment of pause as he remembered the state of the hive and the Queen Bee when the windmill got hit. But its not like it was his fault; it was War after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut many other things had changed. It looked like Dunghill mountain had gotten bigger; fecking dirty Dung Beatles; disgusting. He also noticed that the farm area seemed a bit more...overgrown than last time with wild vines and more sunflowers. And most astonishing of all, the Wasp's nest was enormous, towering over the skyline and blocking the view of the castle. In fact the giant yellow structure looked more like a castle itself, and was overflowing with honey. There was more buzzing sound coming from out of there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...looks like those wasps have been doing well for themselves,\" Conker said. \"I guess without the Queen Bee's hive to steal they've really had to step things up for themselves. Probably won't be too happy to see me though; so I better avoid 'em for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Conker realize that he was actually being watched very closely by someone nearby. And while Conker was busy pondering to himself out-loud, they slowly crept up behind him.<br>\r\n\"Let me see,\" Conker said. \"The best way to the castle; I certainly don't want to go the long way around; don't want to end up at Rock Solid in Ooga-Booga or that Creepy Zombie village again. So maybe I should go to the Feral Reserve Bank; that seemed to get me to the castle last time. Hopefully they fixed that damn rickety bridge; what do they think their taxes are going towards?\" Conker then had a sudden moment of realization. \"Hey...wait a minute; wasps don't produce honey...what's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than he'd said that, he suddenly heard a faint buzzing sound from right behind him. But before he could turn, he was suddenly hit over the head from behind and he fell over. He was a bit stunned and his head hurt but he wasn't fully blacked out. But he noticed a slender yellow and black body appear over him, and many different legs wrapping around him. He was about to struggle when suddenly he felt a stabbing sensation in his stomach. He'd just been stung. A warm drowsy feeling came over him and he blacked out completely. The last sensation Conker had before falling asleep was being lifted off the ground and carried off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Conker wake-up?</span></div></div>",

What are you doing?!\" Conker screamed, splashing in the water as the shark gulped Conker up to his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark did not say a word, just savoring Conker's flavor as the tail whipped his face. He liked the smell it carried and continued swallowing, his tongue slipping under Conker's hoody to continue tasting his fur as the squirrel slipped further inside. \"Hey! Stop eating me! I'm not food!\" Conker protested, punching his paws into the shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had no effect and one sharp bite forced Conker to stop. No blood had been drawn, but it mentally told Conker to submit...for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker whimpered as another swallow forced his head into the shark's mouth. The tongue wrapped up his head, coating his head in saliva. Conker flipped the shark's jaws, grabbing onto its teeth for dare life. He could see the world outside slowly disappearing as the shark slowly closed his jaws, taunting his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue tickled Conker's paws, forcing him to let go. Finally, the view of the world was no longer available as the shark's jaws snapped shut. All the squirrel could see were rows of teeth sealing him inside the shark. Conker, in one last desperate attempt, wrapped his arms around the shark's tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this added to the shark's pleasure as Conker's wonderful taste was pushed into his tongue. The shark suckled on the squirrel, absorbing his flavor before taking the final swallow that forced Conker into his throat. The orange-red squirrel screamed as he slipped down the smelly and wet gullet, curling up in the rotted fish scented stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squirrel sobbed quietly as he pushed and shoved against the shark's stomach walls, squirming madly as he tried to make it vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark, however, was in paradice. He watched his bulging gut squirm and shake as Conker fought inside him, sending bolts of pleasure through his body. The shark licked his lips, rubbing his round stomach with his paw as he swam around slowly, unable to move much with such a large meal. The shark slowly found a place to rest while his meal worked himself to exhaustion, planning to work off Conker himself. It was almost a shame to know the shark was about to lose Conker to the process of digestion.

Conker let out a scream and watched himself plunge to the ground below.

The squirrel did everything in his power to stop himself from landing in those jaws, but there was no use. Conker landed butt first into the jaws, his tail slipping down into the croc's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker struggled in the croc's jaws, trying to keep them from snapping closed around him and crushing him inside. Though the croc had no intentions of crushing the poor, delicious squirrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe croc's tongue slapped Conker, tasting the already wet fur of the squirrel, finding the hoody to have a fine flavor itself. Conker whimpered each time the tongue smacked his body, forcing a little more of him into the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker's strength wore down and the crocodile was able to close its jaws further around Conker. The squirrel moaned and started to sob quietly, wishing he had more strength to prevent himself from becoming croc food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the croc had learned that he had defeated his meal, the croc titled his head back. With a powerful swallow, the squirrel was reduced to a series of lumps in the croc's neck as Conker slid down the pulsating gullet and into the waiting stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe croc licked over its scaley lips as it relaxed in the water, looking at its round tummy, purring softly once Conker began to squirm. The croc let out a satisfied belch, flipping over onto its back and rubbing the bulge with a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker curled up as much as he could in the rancid smelling stomach, the flesh surrounding him and hugging him tightly. He pushed the walls away from him as much as he could, but they kept coming back. Soon the stomach gurgled and Conker knew what was coming next. He looked sick and vomitted for the third time in less than an hour. Finally, it came.</span></div></div>",

In retaliation, the squirrel struggled to get away from the rising liquid, pleasuring the predator surrounding him greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker screamed again and pounded on the stomach walls. \"Help me! Get me out of this damn stomach! Let me out you rotten little whelp!\" Conker protested, letting out a yelp as his tail was slowly dissolved into bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shoes came next, breaking away from his feet before the fur and skin were eaten off his flesh by the acidic fluid surrounding him. Conker whined as the rest of his fur began to fall out, burning up inside the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe croc belched again, his breath smelling of digesting squirrel as it laid back to sleep off its meal, not caring for the life ending inside him. With another slurp of its lips and a burp that shook the earth, the croc fell into a deep sleep, and so did Conker. Unfortunately, it would be a sleep Conker would not wake up from. Well, actually, he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker's eyes opened up as he found himself in a place he recognized. It was a dark, blue-gray stone structure. He called it Gregg's place. And sure enough, the tiny Grim Reaper with a gold tooth stepped out from the darkness. \"Oh, it's you again. What the bloody hell do you want?\" He shouted, clutching his scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker blinked and wagged his tail a bit. \"Um, how about telling me what's going on?\" He replied, scritching behind his flappy ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregg scoffed and produced a piece of paper from out of nowhere. \"Let's see here. Conker. Died from digestion inside a crocodile's stomach. What a way to go. Well, at least it was better than how I died, bloody cats. Drowned me in their piss they did! That's why I hate those bloody things! They tried to kill me with the smell of their shit, but it didn't work! Their piss did it though!\" Gregg proclaimed, swinging his scythe around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker semi-listened to Gregg's rant, just brushing himself off and waiting for him to finish. \"Yeah, ok. Cats killed you. So, what about me?\" He asked, tapping his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you sodding squirrel...alright. Now, it seems that something is going on in your world. Someone's turned the inhabitants of your pissing little world into hungry-for-squirrel monsters. So, if you want to stop from getting eaten, you need to find out who it is and stop them. But before you do, see if you can get those monster to eat some of those bloody cats! Wait...then I'LL have to deal with them! Forget the cats! Now. You'll want to stock up on those bloody squirrel's tails because you're going to be food many times on this little gay quest. Speaking of gay, some of these monsters are horny, so prepare your ass to be pounded.\" Gregg explained, reading off his paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker's eyes went wide. \"Wait, I'm going to be eaten and f*eep*ed by...dammit, I hate these sensors, creatures from all over? What the f*eep*?!\" Conker shouted before pulling out a gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shot went off, followed by a scream. \"There, that should take care of those fucking sensors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregg cleared his throat. \"Can we get back to the matter at hand, squirrel?\" Gregg asked, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker nodded slowly. \"Sorry. I'm having trouble getting what you're telling me into my head.\" Conker explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregg replied by smacking Conker on the head with his scythe. \"There, now it's in your head! So, your job, kill the guy responsible. That should stop the spell. Also, the Panther-type king has been revived. Seems he was brought back to life by duct taping his chest back together.\" Gregg said, scratching his noodle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker turned away, as if looking to a camera facing him. \"Well, they say duct tape fixes everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregg looked more confused. \"Who are you talking to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one.\" Conker replied, turning back to Gregg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to put you back on Earth now. But take your time. The longer you take, the greater the chance those bloody cats may skip an appointment and use one of their extra lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker nodded and pretended to move in slow motion towards a squirrel's tail hanging off a hook. When he finally hit it, a large skeletal hand grabbed him and pulled him out of Gregg's lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Conker came to again, he was...</span></div></div>",

He began to wonder if he had even opened his eyes, and if he did, had he become blind due to the alcohol. He was also feeling wet from his chest down to his feet, and he was sitting on something hard and warm. His surroundings were warm and getting hotter, and the water, now mixed with vomit began to bubble some. The confused squirrel moved his limbs to find he was entirely surrounded by the thing that he was sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA number of things ran through Conker's mind as he tried to figure out where he was. The sound of a fire crackling all around him filled his ears as the water's temperature rose higher, causing Conker to pant and sweat. \"Oh God...I'm in a cooking pot!\" he shouted, slamming his fists on the sides of the pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Someone! Help me! Get me out of this thing!\" Conker screamed as he smashed his paws into the side of the pitch black cooking pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice, muffled from being further away came into range of his hearing. \"Ooh...sounds like my delicious meal has woken up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lid of the pot lifted away, the sudden light causing Conker to wince and close his eyes. Whatever it was sniffed at him and sprinkled what he guessed was salt over his head. \"Oh, it seems my tasty squirrel has vomited in the water!\" said whoever was cooking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConker whimpered, wondering what more could happen now.</span></div></div>",
