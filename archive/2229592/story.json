Her decision to dress in robes helped further the impression. And, when she spoke, it completed the picture. \"I feel that God has touched me,\" she said. \"He wants me to spread His message far and wide, to rouse a sleeping world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about a week, people wondered if she really had been transformed by God. Then, another Angel came: a boy, with dark brown hair and wings. Not only didn't he share Grace's faith, but every sentence out of his mouth had at least one word that didn't fly (pun unintended) with the censors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a month of these and other cases, scientists announced a partial answer: There was a new virus out there. For the vast majority of people, this virus had no effect whatsoever. For approximately 1% of the teenage population, however, it caused a body-wide mutation, the most obvious sign of which was the growth of wings. They had no idea where this virus came from, or how it spread, but they now knew it was there, at least. They had a scientific name for it, but most people just kept calling the changed kids Angels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis stuff was interesting to me, mostly because I wanted to be a news reporter, and I had to know what was going on around me. About three months after that first case, though, the story of the Angels became more personal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am Ariel Mills, and this is my story.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't hard to convince her, since I had spent the morning throwing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I could leave the bathroom, she gave me a cup of tea. As I sipped, she asked, \"Ariel, you know you can talk to me about anything, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" I replied, sensing where this was headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't have to keep any secrets from me, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just say it, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, are you pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"I've been on a dry spell since Zach and I broke up. Maybe that girl in the movie last week got pregnant without sex, but it doesn't work that way in the real world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was feeling much better at dinnertime, but Mom and Dad weren't. \"I've seen a lot of things,\" Dad said, \"but I've never seen anyone put ketchup on broccoli.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Green and red,\" I replied, putting a ketchup-covered floret into my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ariel,\" Mom said, \"I'm taking you to the doctor tomorrow. Maybe something happened that you don't know about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're not pregnant,\" Dr. Rossen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you,\" I said to Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's causing her symptoms?\" Mom asked, refusing to let go of that bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be nothing,\" the doctor explained. \"It could be something serious. Or there's a slim chance that it's the new one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The new one,\" of course, was Angelism. In the three months since it arose, a lot had happened. There were some people who wanted to be Angels, but hadn't changed. In their desperation, they had resorted to taking the blood of those who had begun the change, with some of those kids dying from blood loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, either there was a chance that I was dying, or there was a chance that someone out there would want to kill me. What a time to be alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, I thought I felt something in the shower. Toweling the fog off the mirror, I turned and looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two ridges under the skin on my back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no longer any doubt: I was now a Fledgling.</span></div></div>",

Now, here I was, and the guard had insisted that I agree to a blood test. I agreed, since he had an AR-15, and my bulletproof backpack was at home, waiting for me to figure out how I was supposed to wear it with a pair of wings sticking out. Now, we were waiting for the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, an Angel came out of the forest, placed a hand on the guard's shoulder, and gave a gentle squeeze. He turned, and she nodded. The guard then opened the gate and motioned for me to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was all of this necessary?\" I asked. \"I mean, one look at my back should have told you I was a Fledgling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We heard about a Coop in Florida,\" the Angel replied. \"What we know is, every single Angel and Fledgling there died. There was a rumor that someone got in claiming to be a Fledgling, and had a makeup prosthetic to make him look the part. We can't take chances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shivered, now thankful for the guard and the delay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Dina,\" she said. \"Welcome to the Coop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ariel.\" I checked my phone. \"There's not a single bar out here. Don't you think that would be helpful? Y'know, just in case?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're forgetting the Halo Effect, Ariel. Electronics don't work for Angels, and having them around for more than a few minutes makes us sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I didn't know it was like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's part of why you're here: so we can teach you, and you don't have to find everything out through trial and error.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting all of my electronics into a wastebasket (even my watch, for crying out loud), Dina showed me around the compound, introducing me to everyone. Then, she led me to the bungalow that would be my home away from home. \"Any questions so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the big one: What if I'm... What if I turn out... Could I be... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a chance you could wind up as a Penguin, but it's a slim chance. Tests seem to indicate a link between anemia and Penguinism. Is that a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, assuming you haven't been giving more blood than you should, there's not much chance of you having to get around on a wheeled platform. Get settled in, Ariel. Supper's at six, and your first lesson is tomorrow. Keep 'em flying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, too.\" I chuckled at how a slogan from World War II had been appropriated and repurposed by the Angel community.</span></div></div>",

I was glad I had brought something that wasn't connected to the cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDina approached, carrying a pair of blue foam rubber wings. \"Are you busy?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not very,\" I replied, closing the book. \"What's with the wings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're for teaching you how to dress yourself. Shall we go in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I closed the door behind us, she said, \"Your first lesson in Angel fashion is, you can't wear anything you pull over your head. So, if you brought anything like that, now's as good a time as any to phase them out of your wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense. What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put on the wings, and I'll show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I had the wings on, she gave me a blouse with two zippered openings in the back for wings. \"Get this on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some doing, but I finally got the wings through the back holes, and I put on the blouse. \"How do I look?\" I asked, buttoning up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you want to catch cold, you need to close up the back. Now, - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of listening, I just tried zipping up on my own, until Dina said, \"Stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If those were your wings, you'd have just given yourself a greenstick fracture on your left wing, grounding yourself for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI certainly didn't want that. \"What's the right way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got two choices: Either ask your mom for help, or ask her for a wire hanger.\" She showed me one, bent out of shape into a hook. \"Try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried it, and it worked pretty well. \"Better, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than breaking bones. But you rushed it. See those flecks of foam rubber? On your wings, those would be feathers you pulled out. But that's why we're doing this: If you screw up now, you're less likely to damage yourself when it's time to leave the nest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes me feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, I should tell you that your feather color will match your natural hair color. So, if that red comes from a bottle, the world will know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No , I'm a natural redhead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be the first firewing I've ever met. I'm sure your wings will be beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Firewing? Well, it's better than what my ex used to call me.\"</span></div></div>",

And, if I get too close to the camera, I'll erase all the footage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDina rubbed my shoulder. \"Even the crow has to turn sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how people say 'as the crow flies' to mean a straight line? Well, crows have to turn, just as much as anyone else. Nothing's ever a straight line. Your life could take any number of turns, but you'll find your way. We never get lost for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If nothing else, you can always get a bird's-eye view of the action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she was right. Maybe I would find my way to TV reporting somehow. Maybe I'd find some way of fulfilling my dream.

I knew that meant one thing: I would soon be covered in it, then emerge as an Angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, I could not separate my fingers and toes, as the green bound them together. Luckily for me, Dina knew what was going on, and she came to help me. Beginning that day, she fed me, read to me, and helped me to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also answered the last of my questions. Like: \"How will I sleep, when I can't lie on my back anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of us lie on our stomachs. But many of us sleep sitting up on a barstool. See what works for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept my spirits up any way she could. \"You've got a birthday coming up, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be 18 in three weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations. Looks like you'll be celebrating the big day with your wings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of each day, Dina would kiss my forehead and wish me goodnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as each day passed, the green crept farther up my limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second-to-the-last day, the green began covering my torso. Dina only gave me ice chips then, but she still read to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the last day, the green covered my ears, and began to cover my face. I couldn't hear her anymore, so she held the book so that I could read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, Dina kissed my nose, and I went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

I felt muscles stretching and flexing, gathering strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with one last crack - no, several cracks at once - the constraint was broken, and my limbs were free. But my arms were still at my sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when I remembered: The ridges. The Coop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I was now an Angel.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started flexing all my muscles, moving everything, breaking out of my shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized I was lying on my stomach, though I had been lying on my back. <i>Dina must have rolled me over,</i> I realized, <i>so I wouldn't hurt my wings.</i> I pushed myself up, breaking off more of the shell, the weight on my back somehow strange and familiar at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked to the bathroom, and saw my new self in the mirror. My wings were beautiful. <i>I</i> was beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, don't get me wrong. I knew I was pretty, and I had no problems with my self-esteem. But, when I saw my wings, it was like they'd been missing from me before. I felt whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a shower, to wash off what was left of the green. Then I got dressed, and I stepped outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a clear and beautiful day. A perfect day for flying. With one flap, I took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Dina, standing on the roof of the main building of the Coop, and I flew to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, she pointed deeper into the woods. I had no idea why yet, but I decided to see what she wanted me to see, so I turned and flew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of seconds, I saw it: a lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air currents over the lake were amazing. It was like ice skating, but with my whole body.

My bed was pushed into the far corner, with my new high desk and another barstool dominating the room. \"Thank you guys so much,\" I said, hugging them the Angel way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish there was more that I could do for you,\" Mom said. \"They've come out with car seats that are supposed to be Angel-friendly, but they seem awfully dangerous to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me more,\" I said, picking up a small notebook and a pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a steel rod with a headrest on it,\" she continued. \"Plenty of room for your wings, but it looks like it would kill you if you got more than a fender-bender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know,\" I said. \"I'm sure future Fledglings will want to know about it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, I had the story written into a note I could put on Uriel's leg, and I sent her back to the Coop.</span></div></div>",

My homeroom teacher took one look at me and ordered me to march to the nurse's office and have them call my parents. I did not see what the problem was until I reaced the nurse's office, where the staff gasped upon seeing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heavens, child!\" Worried, the nurse exclaimed. \"Why on Earth did you come to school looking as pale as you are?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Taken aback, I asked. \"I don't feel that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you look three days dead.\" Serious, Mr Samson, the principal, said. \"I'm calling your parents and having them take you to a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mr Samson walked back into his office to make the call, a boy with golden blond hair and a very pale face sat down next to me. No one in the room seemed to notice him but me. I turned to the strange boy, and he gave me a sad smile. \"You should not have come here today.\" Softly, he said. \"They now know you exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,... who?\" Confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Vampires, as we call them.\" Calmly, the boy said. \"Those who long for what we have, and what you will soon obtain.\" He sighed. \"Go see the doctor, then go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Unnerved, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy again gave me a sad smile before revealing a set of white wings, before vanishing before my eyes. I could not help shudder as a cold chill ran down my spine, causing the hair on the back of my neck to stand on end. I jumped as the nurse lightly touched my shoulder. \"Your parents are here to take you to the hospital, Miss Mills.\" Gently, she said. \"I'm sorry if I startled you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm a little more sick than I thought.\" Trembling, i replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up, then froze, as I spotted an owl perched near a window looking directly at me. In some cultures, spotting an owl staring at you was a bad omen: but, in others, it was a warning sign of trouble in the future. Not wanting to think about it, I followed Mom and Dad out of school to the family car.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There, a curtain was drawn to keep me out of view, before a young doctor entered with a heavy look of concern. She introduced herself as Doctor Stone, then began her examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did this discoloration start?\" Serious, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This morning, I guess.\" Wincing, I replied. \"I wasn't feeling the greatest, but I wasn't feeling too sick either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you experienced any nausea, motion sickness, headaches?\" Pressing, Dr Stone asked. \"Any discomfort in your back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do feel a little nauseous.\" Honestly, I said. \"I also have a headache, but no motion sickness or backaches, though my back does itch a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going with these questions, Doctor?\" Curious, Dad demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your daughter is showing the exact same symptoms in the exact same order the first individual with Angelism expressed before her wings sprouted.\" Serious, Dr. Stone explained. \"Since the first case, the symptoms had remained the same, but never in the same order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much like the symptoms of the flu.\" Softly, Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Stone nodded. \"Exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only how did you know Ariel had Angelism so quickly?\" Unnerved, Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her eyes.\" Simply, Dr. Stone replied. \"Did you not notice the color change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to a mirror on the wall and gasped. My eyes had turned deep purple in color, with white jagged lines running through them. It almost looked as if there was a storm raging within my own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried, Mom turned me to face her and looked into my eyes. She, too, gasped upon seeing the color change, then turned to Dr. Stone. \"Is that the first sign of Angelism?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Stone shook her head. \"It is the last sign before the vomit fits happen.\" Serious, she replied. She then turned to me. \"You are in for a rough night, young lady. I will write you a note keeping you home for the remainder of the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The whole week?!\" Taken aback, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Stone nodded. \"You are going to be vulnerable for a while.\" Calmly, she said. \"It is best if you lay low until your wings fully sprout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed. \"I had better see if I can locate a nearby Coop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know of one.\" Softly, Dr. Stone said. \"I will give you the information.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was vomiting most of the evening, sometimes violently, making my stomach and throat hurt to the point of crying. Mercifully, they stopped near dawn, but that was when my back began to ache, bad enough to force me to cry out. At first, I was certain I was beyond the point I could not take any more, but then I heard a loud crack in my back. Just as that had happened, the pain was instantly gone. A strange feeling came over me, I somehow felt complete... reborn.  It was not a euphoric feeling, as some people might describe in a rebirth, but more of a sense of relief. Turning to a mirror, I found that I had two strange raised lines between my shoulder blades. Upon seeing it, I knew...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have officially become a fledgling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do not know how long I was staring in the mirror, but I jumped upon seeing Mom standing behind me with a sad look on her face. \"Your father found a Coop.\" Softly, she said. \"They have agreed to take you in until your full transformation takes hold.\" She sighed. \"They will be teaching you everything you need to know as an Angel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming back, though.\" Trying to be comforting, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Sadly, Mom said. \"It's just that... I promised you the day you were born that I would protect you, and now you are going where I can't follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled Mom into a hug. \"I will be taking yours and Dad's teachings with me.\" Softly, I said. \"It will be those lessons that will protect me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Just be careful, Ariel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Dad entered my room. \"Ariel,... it's time.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
