You alone could wield and control the legendary sword known as Arondight, and your agility and skills as a warrior were great, but you had almost no memory of your past. One day, you were walking alone when some kind of claw grabbed you from an alley and pulled you towards the one who possessed the arm. You were quickly thrown to the ground and you tried to draw your sword, but you were forced against the wall with no way to reach your sword. <b>\u201cAt long last, the mighty Uchiha family dies.\u201d</b> the Ayakashi said as he began to crush your head. But then, from out of nowhere, a large blast of flame struck the demon and sent him away from you. <b>\u201cWho dares?!\u201d</b> And appearing right in front of you was a very beautiful young woman. She had long, silver hair and wore some kind of black dress. She had a crescent moon on her forehead, beautiful purple eyes, and her breasts were at least a DD. <b>\u201cThe Jinguji girl! I will not allow anyone to stop me from killing Yoru, not even you!\u201d</b> he said as his power began to grow. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAnd I will not let you touch him.\u201d</span> You then rose to your feet and drew your sword. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cLook, I think we should work together, whoever you are.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOh Yoru, I might not be able to forgive you for forgetting me.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cLook, we can discuss this later, right now we need to take care of this guy.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAgreed.\u201d</span> You then charged and drew your sword. You jumped into the air and sliced the demon's arm off with no trouble. The girl then followed suit by creating a large fire blast and incinerated him. You knew she was strong, but not this strong. You put your sword away and said <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThanks. I owe you one.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cNo. It is the least I can do for my fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWait, what?!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI see you truly lost a large portion of your memory.\u201d</span> she said as she walked up to you.

You didn't understand why you could feel her feelings nor did you even remember having a fianc\u00e9e.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose this will help you remember some things of the past.\", she said pulling you closer to her face. She then pressed her lips against yours and gently kissed you with tender care and passion. You then started to have a flashback of a lake and you and some girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember that she used to have black hair at that time. You two were only children no more than around 8 years old. You remembered how at first you had a crush on her but she didn't return those feeling, at least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried making her laugh on numerous occasions and tried being a bit of a romantic with her. But it was only when you were both at that lake that she finally returned your feeling and kissed you by the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the full story but you could definatly tell that she was a friend and your childhood crush. It's safe to say her feelings for you never faded, but perhaps they even were even stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuesu broke the kiss feeling like she was high in the clouds having the feeling of your lips on hers. \"Do you remember me Yoru?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do Kuesu. I can't believe that I'd have forgotten you. I'm sorry for that but I have no idea why that happened.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me, I'll explain everything I know ounce you get settled in. After all it's a usual custom for a future husband and wife to be living in the same place isn't it?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in response and walked with her. You felt like a part of you was just released and now you feel free inside. Your feelings for her started to return. You held her hand on the way, to which she blushed in response. She was happy that you still felt the same way about her.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps we could make our way to the hotel?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. You followed her to the hotel where you made it to the best rooms in the entire hotel. The room was huge and fancy. You admired the change of scenery and let yourself get settled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may sleep in my bed if you like.\", Kuesu offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were nervous for a second since you've never slept with anyone before but you wanted to take it a little slow since this is the time where you have reunited with Kuesu. She walked toward you an said, \"It's only natural for a future husband and wife to be sleeping in the same bedroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I want to spend time with you that's for sure. And I trust that us being a future couple was made with good intentions but maybe for a while we should take it slow. Just until I fully understand the whole thing.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. Today has altered your path. But let me ask you something. What did that Ayakashi mean when he brought up that Uchiha clan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. you see my family had placed me under the care of one of the families there for a while. They gave me this sword as a trophy and I am merely an honorary part of that clan. When it the clan was destroyed I spent some time on my own after that. But they allowed me to defend myself against those demons. Which I think was the reason my family sent me there in the first place.\", you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoru I'm glad your ere now. Your safe with me now, and you'll never be alone again.\", she hugged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt the feelings you had when you touched my cheek. I never knew you would've kept loving me after all this time.\", you mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoru, before I met you. I thought nothing was worth living for other than murdering demons. Even when we were engaged I still didn't think you were meant for me. But even when I tried to push you away you still tired, and it made me feel special. Like I had something else to do other than slay demons and such. I never forgot that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish I didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find out one day perhaps but for now our lives will be a bit unpredictable. But for now this will do.\", she kissed you again on the lips making you remember parts of what she mentioned. They were precious memories that you hold dear and true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed there would be time for you to reconnect but now you found each other again and it's all that matters...</span></div></div>",

Let alone the same room. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuesu's heart sped up when she heard your reply and blushed,  \"But I thought you wanted to take it slowly so I thought it was what you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did want it to. But after thinking about it, I don't want to be away from you. After what happened earlier I don't want to waste anytime trying to falling for you all over again.\", you said wrapping your arms around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoru......\", she paused in surprise for a moment but the next was turned into passion as she evily grinned. She grabbed your head and smoothered you in her cleabage. \"From now on I live for only you, and as you may have noticed I'm the firecly loyal type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried getting yourself out of her grip but she wouldn't let you. You started to lose your breath but thankfully she let you go. \"Was that nessicary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wella was it all that bad? Now that there's nothing to hold me back from showing how I feel, I can make tonight be a little more interesting.\", she seductivly hinted. </span></div></div>",

You spent this time alone just as you do the rest of the time. You have kept yourself distant from others due to your powers But you did manage to let one girl named Himari become your friend. She was an Ayakashi who kept calling you master.. Though you had almost no memory of your past. About 20 minutes later, you were walking with Himari near the river when you heard someone following you. You turned around to see a very beautiful woman. She had a crescent moon on her fore head and long silver hair. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"It's good to see you again. Yoru-kun.\" </span>You were surprised by the fact that she knew who you were. Himari drew her sword and prepared for battle. She just smiled and got ready herself. Himari charged at her, but she dodged the strike with ease. <span class=\"cblue\">\"So fast.\"</span> you thought to yourself. Himari got ready to attack again but she created some kind of barrier keeping you in with her. Himari tried to cut through but to no avail. You were about to use Chaos Control to escape, but she grabbed your face and somehow suppressed your powers. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Now, quit dragging your feet and come with me. That's an order.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Who are you to order me around?\"</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Your grandfather asked me to look after you.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Grandfather?\"</span> <span class=\"cred\">\"Do not listen to her master!\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"W-what do you mean? Why would my grandfather do that?\"</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\"I was told that you would join my family. He and my family arranged for us to be married. Can your mind understand that?\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Married?\"</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\"You really don't remember anything, do you?\"</span> She then began to pull your face closer to her own. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"The protective charm placed on you must have been extremely powerful.... But I'll make sure you remember.\"</span> she said as she kissed you on the lips. You then had a little flash back about her as a young girl and how she kissed you before. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Could she be the girl I thought was Himari?\"</span> you thought. She broke the kiss and looked into your eyes. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Y-you're..\"</span> <span class=\"cred\">\"YOU BITCH!\"</span> Himari yelled as she cut through the barrier. The girl dodged and you ended up falling backwards. She then caught you and kissed you in front of her. But this time she slipped her tongue into your mouth. <span class=\"cred\">\"Did you really need to kiss him a second time?\"</span> The girl broke the kiss and licked her lips after a transparent line of saliva trailed from your lips to her own. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Second?\"</span> she said as you fell on your ass. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Don't be foolish. That was the third. That's probably enough for today. I'm sure he needs time to think things over. I'm staying at the Shin-Takamiya Hotel in the neighboring city. Visit me whenever you feel like it. After all, you are my fianc\u00e9e, and you can expect me to treat you as such. However, it's a rather high class hotel. Please leave your pet at home. Of course, if your family does not cut its ties with the Ayakashi.... a certain demon slayer may have to destroy it along with the demons.By the way, my name is Kuesu Jinguji. Farewell.\"</span> she said as more pages from her book surrounded her and she was gone in an instant. You and Himari went to your home shortly after that.</span></div></div>",

Although, you were mostly thinking about one little event; The time Kuesu kissed you. You began to blush slightly as this thought passed though your mind. But what you didn\u2019t know, is that as you continued to think of the sure bliss of that moment, Kuesu appeared behind you.<span class=\"cviolet\"> \u201cI can tell you really did enjoy that kiss. Though I wonder, do you remember the first time we kissed?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI do actually. But the other stuff, I have no memory of.

I do plan on making you remember.\"</span> She said as she placed her hand around your face once again. But the peace of the moment was interrupted when you heard something coming towards you. You grabbed Kuesu and jumped out of the way. Whatever came at you sliced the small spire and the cut was clean, real clean. You gently set her down and looked for the one who shot that at you. You stood at the top of the spire again and created a small energy barrier around you. As you continued to look for the one who attacked you, you didn\u2019t hear another energy blade coming at you. You thought your energy barrier would stop it, but the bade sliced through the barrier and made a deep slice in your side. You began to fall but you managed to land on your on your feet, but you then fell on your knees as you held your side from the pain.  <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYoru! Are you alright?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m fine Kuesu. Now who is the one who broke through my barrier?\u201d </span><span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cI believe that would be me.\u201d</span> a voice said.

You were never that powerful before.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cI am glad that you are impressed. Now I will destroy you and absorb your powers for my own. Ah, who is this? I can see she has taken a s great liking to you. No matter, when I am finished with you, I will kill her as well.\u201d </span>But then you appeared in front of Nightmare with a rage filled look and landed a powerful kick which sent him into a near-by building. Nightmare stood up and looked at you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou stay away from her! If you ever lay a hand on her, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYoru.\u201d</span> she said touched by your words. But then, Nightmare chuckled and said \u201cI guess I will leave you two alone this time. But the next time we meet, you will not be so lucky.\u201d he said before he disappeared. You slowly landed on the ground in front of her and asked if she was alright. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI\u2019m fine Yoru-kun. Thank you.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m glad that you are ok.\u201d </span>But then, the pain from Nightmare\u2019s attack along with the blood you lost made you pass out.

You knew the time would soon arrive where they would rise again. Some of the minions of the underworld have already started to rise, such and the Hideaks, who were foot soldiers of the underworld. One day, you were in England fighting some of the Hideaks and their general. The Hideaks were easy enough, but the general was a different story. He was actually quite strong. You clashed with him for a while before you began to tire. <i>\"Sasuke Uchiha, you will die in the name of Blackheart!\"</i> the demon said. <span class=\"cblue\">\"I will not fall by your hand. Nor by the hand of Blackheart, the Ten Terrors, or the Master himself. I swear I will avenge my clan, no matter what!\"</span> you said as you began to rise.

As the guards were about to fire their guns, they were called off by someone. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Stop!\"</span> They all pulled their guns back.

You got up and noticed your entire upper torso was wrapped in bandages. You looked around the room and saw your sword next to the bed. You also noticed that the infirmary was unlike any you have ever seen before. It was almost like a bedroom. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhere am I?\u201d</span> you said to yourself. Just then, you heard the door open and the one who entered was a very beautiful young woman. She had long, silver hair and wore some kind of black dress. She had a crescent moon on her forehead, beautiful purple eyes and her breasts were at least a DD. You had never seen such a beautiful woman before in your entire life. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI see you\u2019re awake. I am sorry my security was so rude. They overreact at times.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI can\u2019t argue with you there. Now, mind explaining what is going on? Who are you?\u201d</span> The girl giggled a little and said <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cJust as I remember you Sasuke. You waste no time do you?\u201d</span> You were surprised by the fact this girl knew your name. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHow do you know me?\u201d</span> The girl shook her head and said <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cMy goodness, what an unforgivable sin. Forgetting me like that...\u201d</span> she said as she walked over to you. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAllow me to reintroduce myself. My name is Kuesu Jinguji.\u201d</span> As soon as she said that name, some of your memories passed before your eyes. You remember a girl with black hair and a crescent moon on her head a long time ago, long before your clan\u2019s demise. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cJ-Jinguji?\u201d</span> you said, still trying to remember. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI see, you still are having trouble remembering.\u201d</span> She said as she got next to you. You were unsure if you could trust her, so you jumped out of bed and halfway across the room. Kuesu smiled and got in front of you in an instant. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSo fast.\u201d </span>you thought to yourself. She then gently grabbed your face and somehow suppressed your powers. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat the hell, why can\u2019t I summon my strength?\u201d</span> you thought. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cNow calm down and listen to me. Your family asked me to look after you.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMy Family? What do you mean?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI was told by both our families that I would join the Uchiha.

But I'll make sure you remember.\u201d</span> she said as she kissed you on the lips. You then had a little flash back about her as a young girl and how the girl from your past kissed you before by the lake near your clan\u2019s home.<span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cCould she be the same girl from back then?\u201d</span> you thought. She broke the kiss and looked into your eyes <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cY-You\u2019re\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI see you are beginning to remember.\u201d</span> She let you got and you felt a flood of memories return to you.

You were still not ready to sleep in the same bed with her, but you were comfortable with sleeping in an actual bed at least. And it does seem that you felt closer and closer to Kuesu over the last few battles. But one night, you  looked at the sky while lying on the roof just above Kuesu\u2019s room, you could hear her groan a little. You could tell it was the type of groan which means she is uncomfortable at the moment. You used the power of darkness to become one with the shadows and slip into Kuesu\u2019s room through the window. You then returned your body to normal and asked what was wrong. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOh, Sasuke. It\u2019s nothing. I guess my feet are a bit sore, that\u2019s all.\u201d</span> You gained the tinniest blush you could ever imagine. You see, in the time you spent with Kuesu, you remembered one teeny tiny little fact about yourself. You have a foot fetish, to be more specific, a foot fetish to only Kuesu\u2019s feet. You even remembered you giving her a foot massage when you were kids. But you snapped out of it by Kuesu\u2019s voice. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSasuke.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cUh, yes?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cIf it\u2019s not too much trouble, can you massage my feet please?\u201d</span> You gulped a little and said that you would. You walked over to her and created a small stood made out of air and sat in her feet, which were not too far from your face, about 6 inches. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBefore I begin, would you like me to take off your stockings Kuesu?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOh, yes thank you Sasuke.\u201d</span> You blushed a little brighter and you were just hoping Kuesu didn\u2019t notice. You then reached up and gently pulled off her stockings, revealing her beautiful bare feet. She wiggles her toes a little bit and you blush a little brighter now. But what you didn\u2019t know is that Kuesu saw the blush and knew what was going on, she just decided to play dumb, for now. (wink wink). <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cCome on Sasuke. I am looking forward to your massage.\u201d</span> You gained your composure and began to massage her feet. She may be a demon slayer, but she took really good care of her feet. They were silky smooth and everything. You massaged every single inch of her feet, from her heel, to her soles, up to the toes. You hit a couple of pressure points which caused her to moan a bit, and got you a little bit aroused. Luckily, you managed to keep Kuesu from noticing that. And as you were about ready to finish this up, you heard Kuesu speak. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSasuke~\u201d</span> she said in an almost seductive way. You got a little nervous at that point. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI know that you want to do more than massage these feet of mine.\u201d</span> she said wiggling her toes to tease you. Now you began to sweat and blush a bit. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAnd I am fine with it, but just for this one time, I want to be a little dominating.\u201d</span> she said as she snapped her fingers. And from the ground, two energy shackles came from the floor and pulled your hands to the ground. You were both aroused and a little worried. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cNow, what should I do first?\u201d</span> she said as she ended up tapping your chin with her toes, teasing you further. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI think you should start by getting used to the smell of my feet.\u201d </span>she said with a seductive smile. She then moved her feet towards your face, but very slowly in order to ease you further. This was just torture now. After what feels like forever, she gently plants both of her feet on your face. The balls of her feet covering your eyes. She scrunched her toes playfully and said <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI want you to breath deeply Sasuke. And no kissing or the like yet. Just smelling. I want to hear the first inhale. Now sniff.\u201d</span> You were happy to oblige and took a very deep inhale, which Kuesu could hear easily. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThat\u2019s it Sasuke, just like that.\u201d</span> she said with a slight purr in her voice. You continued to smell her perfect feet or about an hour before she told you to stop. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cNow my dear Sasuke. Pucker up for my feet.\u201d</span> she said putting her left foot in front of your face. Once again, you obliged and planted soft kissed on her feet, starting with the heel. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cVery good. And no tongue, yet.\u201d</span> You continued to plant soft kisses on her feet. But once you got up to the toes, you could feel Kuesu try and push them into your mouth, starting with the big toe. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOpen wide Sasuke.\u201d</span> You opened your mouth and welcomed her toe into your mouth. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cNow suck.\u201d</span> she said in a flirtatious manner. You sucked her big toe pretty hard and used your tongue to drench it in your saliva. She then told you to open wide which you did. She then placed all of the toes of her left foot in your mouth. You sucked on each and every one while snaking your tongue in between them. You thought things were pretty good, but then you made a slight gasp when you felt something on your crotch. You noticed Kuesu\u2019s right foot.<span class=\"cviolet\"> \u201cNow I think you could use a little massage yourself.\u201d</span> she said as she began to stroke your dick though your pants with her free foot as you licked her other one, drenching it in saliva. She then switched feet and you did the same thing to her right as you did to her left. You were in absolute heaven. But just when you were about to blow, she pulls both feet away and waved her finger back and forth with a seductive smile. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSorry Sasuke. But if you are going to burst, it wont be from my feet. It will either be by this\u2026\u201d</span> she said pointing to her lips. You blush a little brighter than before. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cor this.\u201d</span> she said slowly moving her finger down her body and all the way to her pussy. You blushed the brightest shade of red in that moment. You even had a small nosebleed. The energy shackles disappeared in that moment <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWell, ahem. I understand. I am glad I could help you relax.\u201d </span>you said as you began to walk out the door. But before you left the room Kuesu said in a very seductive way <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cIf you ever want to see my bare chest, I would be happy to show it to you~\u201d</span> You had another nosebleed at that moment and you just continued walking after you got it together. That night,, the only thing you could picture was Kuesu in all her glory, nude.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You spread your arms to the sides and sent energy into your hands. Then you used that energy to create Crescent moons and threw them forward. Whatever got in their path was sliced like a knife through butter. And the surface of the sliced object was smooth and pure marble.

You blushed even brighter if that was possible. But after a quick giggle, she let you go. After you regained your composure, you and Kuesu began to talk about your plan for when you get to Japan. She told you she had a suite at a hotel there. You could get there easy enough, you just needed Kuesu to get packed a little. Once that was finished, you used Chaos Control to teleport to the hotel. Luckily, you appeared in an alley right next to it, so you don\u2019t freak out the citizens. Kuesu checked into her suite and you followed her. The place was actually pretty fancy. The first thing you did was go onto the balcony to look at the city. And from there, you could see your old home, the birthplace of the Uchiha Clan. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMy home\u2026\u201d</span> you thought.

She got in front of him and landed a powerful attack which sent him into the side of a mountain. But as the dust cleared, Kuesu saw that he was actually laughing. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI will admit, I didn\u2019t think you had this much power. But playtime is over now.\u201d</span></b> he said as he instantly got in front of Kuesu and landed a powerful backhand which sent her flying a little bit. He then grabbed her by the head and said as he created his Negative Chidori <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You won\u2019t die alone. Sasuke is next on my list.\u201d</span></b> <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cCHAOS MOON BLADE!!\u201d</b></span> Just then, a Moon Blade (for short) Sliced Blackheart\u2019s arm off and forced him to drop Kuesu. As he grabbed the spot where his are used to be, you yelled out <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHey Blackheart!\u201d</span> Blackheart turned and saw you, only you looked a little different. Your hair grew long and it was a silver color, just like Kuesu\u2019s. You had a golden aura around you as well. Blackheart knew what this meant; your true power had finally awakened. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cGet away from my fianc\u00e9.\u201d</span> You then got Kuesu away from him with such speed, neither of them could follow it. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSasuke\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSorry I\u2019m late my love.

Both Blackheart and Kuesu were speechless at what they just saw. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIs that all you got?\u201d</span> you asked in a calm and collected tone.

It still remained it\u2019s silver color. England had recovered from the tragedy it had suffered under Blackheart. And even though you still had the occasional Hideak attacks, it was no problem. You had some allies in Japan as well as other parts of the world. You made friends with one Yuto Amakawa and a few of his friends who were Ayakashi. Himari Noihara, Ageha, Sasa and Shizuku helped out with any other Hideak attacks in Japan. And that was what was odd, the only two places they showed up were wherever you and Kuesu were, and Japan.

Kuesu was reading books on magic, and you were training to the fullest extent. Using your powers, you were able to increase the gravity around your body to five times Earth\u2019s normal gravitational force. Your body was in the air as you tried to do push ups on your knuckles. Though you were having a lot of trouble. You had to get to 100 or you start over. But you were having enough trouble getting to 80. But about an hour later, you reached one hundred and you returned the gravity around you to normal. You then fell onto your back and began to pant heavily. Just then, A shadow was cast over your face and you knew it was Kuesu. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYou really push yourself to the limit don\u2019t you?\u201d</span> she said with a smile.

We\u2019ve been so busy with Hideaks and stuff, we haven\u2019t had a chance to have a little fun. So how about it?\u201d</span> Kuesu smiled and said after placing a tender kiss on your lips. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI\u2019d love to. But I think you need to change. You should probably get in the shower as well.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cFair enough, that will give you a chance to change as well.\u201d </span>You walked off to the indoor springs. You had used your powers to create a waterfall spring and you used that for your showers. As you stood in the waterfall, Kuesu picked a change of clothes for you before she changed herself. She brought you the spare outfit you had, which looked the same as the other. She changed into her casual outfit and waited for you.

You started this off with a little lunch. Once that was done, Kuesu pulled you along to the next location, the movie theater. You agreed to see whatever movie Kuesu wanted to see, which to your surprise was an action film. And just like before, Kuesu pulled you with her, this time to do a little shopping. You rolled your eyes with the knowledge you would be carrying a lot of stuff, and boy were you right! You ended lifting so much stuff that you needed your sharingan just to see where the hell you were going. Luckily you were able to find a spot to use Chaos Control in order to drop the stuff off at the manor, much to your relief. You the returned to where you last saw Kuesu but couldn\u2019t find her, at first. You ended up walking in front of the door of a photo booth and Kuesu grabbed your arm and pulled you inside. Turns out you had one crafty wife. She set it up to take one picture first, and it was of her locking lips with you with her arm around your neck. In the picture your eyes were wide open in a surprised way. Both you and Kuesu laughed at the photo, before you set it up to take several others. These were the type a regular couple would have on their first time in a photo booth, the last one ending with you holding Kuesu close to you and the two of you giving the camera a warm smile. Of course, Kuesu wasn\u2019t done. She then decided to do one last shopping spree, only not for normal clothes if you get my drift. She ended up taking you to a  lingerie shop. You about had a blast nose bleed with the first choice she had. She then found about another few. But when she came out in her tenth choice, you had a blast nosebleed so strong it sent you falling to the floor. She had picked out a pure black lingerie outfit that could make any man drool. Of course, she bought it, just so she could tease you, at first. The two of you went back home shortly after that, only you walked this time, enjoying the scenery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The moon truly did make the lake shine. The two of you were at peace for now.

Luckily you didn\u2019t have to wait long. A pillar of fire came from  the mountains, which made you realize that Magma was the one to fight this time. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cKuesu, Magma is affected by dark fire. I doubt water will to much to him. Unless I throw him into the ocean.\u201d</span> you said as you and Kuesu made your way to the mountains. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI understand.\u201d</span> Soon, the two of you found yourselves standing in front of Magma, the head coming from his body was melting the rocks around him, even though they are about five feet from him. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cI see you survived the poison Hekatoid put into your body. But you will have to deal with me now!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBring it on!\u201d</span> you said as you and Kuesu separated and began to attack him. Kuesu attacked with her dark fire attacks, while you called on the power of water and poured your power into the attacks. The two of you were hurting him no doubt, but he was far from being destroyed. He then sent out a shockwave of heat and sent you and Kuesu back a few feet. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cYou fools cannot defeat me. I have way to much firepower to lose!\u201d</span> You looked Kuesu in the eyes and she knew what you were thinking. As the two of you began to stand up, you said to Magma <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDon\u2019t take us too lightly you walking furnace. You want firepower? I\u2019ll show you firepower!\u201d </span>You then began to call upon the power of fire and began to spin at an incredible rate. The heat was so intense you were just under supernova. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cYou think your Wildfire Tsunami is going to harm me? I am made of fire you fool!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI think you\u2019re forgetting me!\u201d</span> Magma turned around and saw Kuesu building up a large amount of dark fire into one blast. She then fired the blast and to Magma\u2019s surprise, right at you. And just then, the dark fire merged with your attack, making it stronger and more deadly than before.<span class=\"corange\"> \u201cImpossible!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cTake this! DarkFire Tsunami!!\u201d</span> you said as you stopped spinning and kicked the attack at Magma. The attack was incredible effective  not only destroying him, but most of the mountain was burned away. You fell onto the ground form the heat and Kuesu knew she couldn\u2019t touch you for a bit. The two of you went home and you went to the hot springs, only this time you cooled the water down to keep your body from turning to ash. Once that was done, you decided to return the water back to normal and enjoyed the springs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your clan was destroyed because you didn\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s all your fault.\u201d </span>You fell onto your knees and your body began to sink into the darkness. Oculus thought he had won but then, a memory of your past appeared before the two of you. It was the day you met Kuesu. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cSasuke, I want you to meet Kuesu Jinguji. The two of you will end up being future partners one day.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cFuture partners?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cYes.

And just from that memory you remembered everything else that happened after that day. From the time you landed outside her manor, to the battle with blackheart, all the way to that little bit in the bath. Kuesu had entered your dreams in that moment and pulled your body out of the darkness. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNo! I was so close!\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cOculus. You have failed in more ways than one. As of now, I put the past behind me. Now I think it\u2019s time to cast you out of my dreams and out of my house!\u201d</span> you said as you thrusted your hand forward, sending a burst of energy that shot him out of your dreams and through the wall of your bedroom. Kuesu woke up and you told her to just stay there and that you would handle this. Luckily you had the pants of your outfit on and jumped out of the hole. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cLet\u2019s just finish this!\u201d</span> you said as you created your Chaos Rasengan. You used your powers to create a fist of wind that came from behind Oculus and sent him towards you. You thrusted your arm forward and slammed him with your Chaos Rasengan. He was sent high into the air and your Rasengan created a large explosion, destroying him. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cGood riddance.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSasuke, come back to bed.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cComing my love.\u201d</span> You then walked through the hole in the wall and used your powers to repair it in an instant.

She broke the kiss with a trail of saliva coming from each other\u2019s mouths. She then grabbed your head and forced in in between her cleavage, and started to massage your face with them. You had to admit, you were in a state of pure bliss at the moment. And form what you could tell, Kuesu was as well. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYour face feels so good in my cleavage. I might have to put it there more often.\u201d</span> she said with a giggle. You could not help but move your hand down to her ass and give it a good grope.

But I\u2019m not done with you yet.\u201d </span>she said as she began to kiss your body, with a little tongue of course. She soon made her way to you dick and gave it a very gentle kiss on the head, causing you to twitch a bit. She then started to lick the head, swirling her tongue around. And even though you knew very well this was her first time, she was a pro! She then licked up the length of your shaft before taking the whole thing in her mouth. You could feel the back of her throat touch the tip of your dick. But once again before you could climax, Kuesu pulled your dick out of her mouth. You knew she was still far from finished. She grabbed your hands and placed them on her breasts. Making you give them a slight massage. But then, you flipped her under you and she was now pinned by you. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOoh, what are you going to do Sasuke-kun?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou\u2019re about to find out, my love.\u201d</span> you said as you began to kiss her neck with tongue. You moved down to her breasts and gave them another massage, only you gave her erect nipples the occasional lick and suck. She moaned in pure pleasure as you continued down her body. You made your way down to her vagina and stuck your tongue in there, causing Kuesu to moan much louder. She was in the purest ecstasy, as were you. And now you move back up to Kuesu\u2019s face and looked her in the eyes. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cPlease Sasuke-kun, be gentle at first.\u201d </span>You complied and gently pushed your erect dick inside Kuesu. You both moaned from the feel of each other. As you thrusted into her you pierced the hymnea, which caused her some pain at first, but the pleasure soon overpowered the pain. It didn\u2019t take too long before you both exploded on one another. As the two of you lied next to each other while panting from what just happened, the two of you looked each other in the eyes. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI love you so much Sasuke Uchiha. Never leave my side.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI would never do that Kuesu. I love you to.\u201d </span>The two of you embraced each other before you fell asleep. Kuesu\u2019s head resting on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the underworld, the Ten Terrors felt what just happened. Megahorn pulled out his weapon and blasted a few Hideaks. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cNo!

You found out this terror was in the city. You found that the terror was Megahorn. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cOh this isn\u2019t going to be good.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cAt last, it\u2019s my turn to fight you. And you had better believe I will not be as easy to defeat as the others.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWe will see.\u201d</span> she said as she fired a blast of fire at Megahorn. But even though she scored a direct hit it did absolutely nothing. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cNice try. Now how about you Sasuke?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAlright, try this on for size!\u201d</span> you said as you created your Chaos Chidori. You then charged at him and like Kuesu scored a direct blow to his chest, but you did no damage to him as well. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh!\u201d </span>he said as he fired a blast of green fire at you. Being so close to him, it hurt quite a bit. You were sent flying through a couple of buildings, leaving Kuesu alone with Megahorn. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cNow, it your turn.\u201d</span> he said pulling his weapon out. Kuesu knew this was going to be trouble. She had to attack from a distance and she did just that. But no matter what she tried she could not hurt him. She was starting to tire and Megahorn saw this as a chance to attack. He fired small energy blasts at Kuesu but he made them explode before they hit her, causing her to fly backwards. As she stood up, she thought to herself <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI see. Megahorn is the type to play with his prey before finishing them off.\u201d</span> Megahorn continued to walk towards her as he pulled out his weapon. But just  then Megahorn was shot in the back of the neck with a blast of lightning, which cause him to fall onto the ground. Kuesu then realized he did have a weak spot. As he turned around, Kuesu then fired a powerful fire blast to his neck, nearly killing him. He had a massive amount of rage release at that moment and charged for her. He pinned her against the wall of a building and had the tip of his sword at her stomach. <b><span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cDarkness shall never die!\u201d</span></b> he said as he was about to thrust his sword though her. But you tackled him from the side and stopped him just in time. As the two of you went at it inside a building, Kuesu thought about what he just said. She then placed her hand on her stomach and realized what he was talking about. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cChaos Chidori!\u201d</span> you yelled from inside the building. Kuesu heard Megahorn roar in pain and the light faded. You came walking out of the building with a few deep cuts on your arms, but you would live easily. You then used your powers to repair everything and you walked up to Kuesu. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSo, shall we go home?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYes.

The two energy aura\u2019s began to create lightning against one another. The two of you then charged at each other and slammed your fists against each other, created a massive gust of wind. The two of you fought at close range for what seemed like hours, until the Master began to tire, and truth be told, so were you. But you knew you had far too much at stake to lose. <b>\"I will not lose to a mortal like you! Now die!\u201d </b>he said shooting his tendrils at you. Thanks to the Mangekyo Sharingan, you managed to see the weak spots of the tendrils. You dodged each of then and focused your energy into your first two fingers like a needle, and struck them there, severing the tendrils. <b>\u201cNo!\u201d</b> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou will have to better than that!\u201d</span> <b>\u201cWith pleasure!\u201d</b> he said as he charged at you with a great rage. He then made a single swipe of his claws and sent you through about ten buildings and into the ground. But you came charging back and landed a powerful punch to his stomach, and then used your elbow to slam him in the back, sending him falling towards the ground. But before that you got down to the ground and landed a powerful roundhouse kick, sending him flying just as far and through just as many buildings. You knew he was far from finished and charged at him. He then did the same and a massive explosion came from the impact. The two of you slid a bit though to stop himself, the Master had to sink his claws into the ground. This battle would definitely go down in history as the ultimate battle. The Master then began to grow frustrated at first, but then he calmed down and said with a laugh <b>\u201cExcellent. Your new power shall provide me a feast!\u201d</b> He said as he grew to his massive size and began to suck all the energy from you and everyone around you. You then jumped towards him and landed a powerful punch that sent him to the ground. He then returned to his normal size and he began to stand up. He once again took to the air and in a moment, got behind you and sent you deep into the Earth. He was tenderizing you at this point. You stood up and said <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou want my power?\u201d</span> you said as you began to charge your energy. A large energy aura began to surround you and everyone was amazed by how much of it you were calling upon.<span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cHere take it! Chaos <b>BLAST!!\u201d</b> </span>you said thrusting your hands forward and unleashing a very powerful beam. The Master opened wide and began to devour the beam.  <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cHang in there!\u201d</span> <span class=\"corange\">\u201cIt\u2019s up to you!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYou have to stop him!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDon\u2019t give up!\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou can do it!\u201d </span><span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cYou\u2019re strong enough, we know you are!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cindigo\">\u201cNow show this guy who he\u2019s dealing with.\u201d </span><span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cAnd kick his ass!\u201d</span> <b><span class=\"clilac\">\u201cSASUKE UCHIHA!\u201d</span></b> The crowd continued to cheer you on as the Master continued to devour your attack. <b>\u201cW-what?! This is impossible! I have eaten all I can eat and still it comes!\u201d</b> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThis ends <b>NOW</b>!\u201d</span> you said as you poured even more power into the beam. The Master could not take this much energy into his body all at once. <b>\u201cNO STOP!!\u201d</b> But you were not about to be stop now. Soon the concentration of energy was too much for him and he was sent deep into space by the force of the blast. And once that happened, he became one of the biggest explosions to ever be seen by humans. In fact, the amount of energy ended up creating a new nebula though a small one. It resembled the Mangekyo Sharingan,, so it was known as the Eye of the Uchiha. As the people turned their eyes away from the new spectacle in space, they wondered if you were alright. But then, you walked out of a huge cloud of smoke with your hair back to its silver color, though just as long as it was a minute ago. Kuesu ran up to you with everyone else soon following. Kuesu ended up giving you a tackle hug, though it did make you grunt from the impact, you still managed to keep your footing. The others gathered around you and in that moment, Matoombo returned and Himari gave him a hug. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cEveryone, I hope you will welcome Itassis and Matoombo into your lives as well.\u201d</span> Everyone gave a big cheer as soon as you said that. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cAnd how about we give Sasuke and Kuesu a big round of applause for the fact their going to be parents?\u201d</span> Everyone, including the Ayakashi cheered even louder after that.

He and Kagome were the best of friends, and like her mother with Yuto, did make Itachi nervous from time to time (wink wink). But still, life was actually very peaceful. You and Kuesu were still the strongest couple around, but you had a feeling that would not be the case forever. Itachi was born with both your powers as well as Kuesu\u2019s. One day, he had just finished a training session with you and Kuesu. He had to head for school as well. Though luckily for him and a few other students, uniforms no longer applied. As he traveled to school by his usual means, the rooftops, he slowed down for Kagome to catch up to him. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cHey Itachi! Good Morning.\u201d</span> she said wearing an outfit similar to what her mother wore when she went to school. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cGood morning to you to Kagome.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cYou always manage to keep that cool and collected attitude with me, at least most of the time.\u201d</span> she said holding onto his arm. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cH-hey hold on now.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?

And also, mind if I ask you something?\"</span> <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Sure, anything.\"</span> You then placed your hand behind your head and said with a blush <span class=\"clblue\">\"Do you, I don't know, want to go out sometime?\" </span><span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Are you asking me out on a date?\"</span> You blushed a little more when she said that, which confirmed her answer. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Sure. I'd love to.\"</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\"Okay, how about tomorrow?\"</span> <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Sure thing. See you then.\"</span> she said as she went back inside. You were cheering a little on the inside, but you still had the feeling that you would have to train harder than ever before to prepare for what's coming.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that night, after walking home from school with Kagome, you went to the training hall and started training. You were able to do many of the things your father and mother could do, for example the Chaos Moon Blades, the Chaos Rasengan and Chaos Chidori. But you started off with the type of attacks that the Uchiha were best known for; fire-style attacks. Your fireball jutsu was the strongest one you had, though you prefered to use the Phoenix Flower Jutsu. You managed to hit the targets true enough, but it was still not a perfect bulls-eye. You continued to rain for a couple of hours before your dad entered the training hall. He saw you were on the ground from exhaustion. He walked over to you and extended his hand. <span class=\"cblue\">\"You really do push yourself just like your old man.\" </span>He grabbed your hand and you helped him up. <span class=\"clblue\">\"Yeah, I guess I do.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"You know you would have given your uncle a run for his money.\"</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\"I could?\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Oh yes. Your uncle was strong, but you were able to use the sharingan at half the age he was. I bet he's very proud to have you share his name.\"</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\"Thanks dad.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Now you go relax with your mother. I have to do some training of my own.\"</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\"Okay dad.\"</span> you said as you left the training hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Switch to Sasuke-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Itachi left the room, you used your powers to increase the gravity around you to 500 times Earth' normal gravity. Even though you were almost flattened right there, you dstarted with some push-ups with your body in the air. It took you two hours just to get to 100, and you continued until you reached twice as much. You returned the gravty to normal and you decided to lie there on the ground for a moment to catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-with Itachi-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your mother were sitting down in the clan library and you continued to read books on the Uchiha and Jinguji clans. You were very interested in your heritage, and you found some pictures of your uncle, who looked almost exactly like you, with the difference of the crecent moon on your forehead. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Itachi, I heard you have a date with Kagome tomorrow.\"</span> You blushed a little when she brought it up. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"You are like your father in so many ways.\"</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\"What do you mean?\"</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, even though we were engaged, he didn't ask me out on a date until about a year of living with me.\"</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\"Why did he wait so long?\"</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\"You have to understand Itachi, you father went through a lot before he arrived at my manor all those years ago. So he was not the kind of guy who knew how to ask a girl out. But I remember how magical that date felt. I still have the pictures from that date.\"</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\"It sounds like you cherish that moment mom.\"</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\"I do. And I cherish every moment with your father. And I hope you do the same with Kagome.\"</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\"I will.\"</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Good, now I think you should get in the hotsprings, you want to be all nice and clean for Kagome.\"</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\"Alright.\" </span>you said as you walked for the springs. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"So Kagome can be dirty with you later.\"</span> You about fell over when she said that.<span class=\"clblue\"> \"Mother!\" </span><span class=\"cviolet\">\"I'm just kidding. I'm going to get your father.\"</span> she said as she walked for the training hall.</span></div></div>",

But even though you were the best of friends with Kagome, you knew that you would like to be more than friends one day. But you decided to enjoy each and every moment with her just like your mother advised you to. You went to bed later that night with Kagome in your dreams. But as you slept that night, deep within the mountains, the evil you and the others had been feeling was getting ready to reveal himself at last. <span class=\"cnavy\"><b>\"It is time.\"</b></span></span></div></div>",

You put on your usual outfit, being it was only the first date and all. You told your mother and father where you were heading and they wished you luck. You once again used the rooftops to travel to Kagome's house. Once you got there she was wearing her usual outfit as well. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Looks like we both went casual here huh?\"</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\"True but no need to get super fancy for the first date.\"</span> <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Agreed. Now come on, let's go!\"</span> she said as she grabbed your hand and pulled you behind her. You began to wonder if your dad had to deal with this sort of thing. The first thing you did was go to a movie, which was actually pretty good. You then decided to grab some lunch. Once you did that, the two of you got some pictures taken together.  The two of you were having a lot of fun, though you had to carry a few things Kagome bought. But as you were shopping, you decided to buy a special necklace. This was one of those necklaces that was actually two. It was a Yin-Yang where the two could be worn by different people. You took the Yang and Kagome wore the Yin. This seemed like an awesome first date. But then, a massive explosion came from the mountains and you knew that it was the evil you had been feeling for so long. You knew you had to do something about this and so did Kagome, so the two of you rushed off to the mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sasuke-<br>\r\nWhile Itachi and Himari were on their date, you Kuesu, Himari and Yuto ended up having a double date. But during the middle of it, you all felt that massive energy. Yuto knew he couldn\u2019t keep up, so he stayed behind while you, Kuesu and Himari rushed off to the location of the explosion. But along the way, you and Kuesu felt so many familiar energies. You both began to shudder. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThat one energy feels like a combination of all those we have ever faced!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cBlackheart, The Ten Terrors, even the Master, all their energies seem to be rolled up into one being!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cOne thing is for sure we are about to meet the ultimate enemy.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cAnd knowing Kagome, she is rushing off to fight this thing.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSame with Itachi. We better hurry.\u201d</span> you said as the three of you began to pick up the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Itachi and Kagome-<br>\r\n As the two of you approached the cause of this, you and Kagome began to talk to each other about this. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cKagome, no matter what happens, we need to keep our guard up!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cI agree. This is an energy like no other.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYes.

And as for my name, call me Naraku.\u201d</span></b> he said as he lifted his hand and sent a huge burst of energy at the five of you. You were all sent flying a little, but you didn\u2019t waver. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAlright, I say we get this started!\u201d</span> he said as he took on his super form. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cRight!\u201d</span> Kuesu and Himari got ready to fight as well.

Chaos Spear!\u201d</span> e said as a shower of energy spears came from the sky towards him. He managed to dodged every one of them, which was quite a surprise. Kuesu and Himari attacked as well, but their efforts were about as successful as your fathers. Naraku did the same thing as he did before and sent the three of them in the air. But then, he brought his hand down and three fists made of negative energy send them deep into the ground. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI was hoping for more of a challenge.\u201d</span></b> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDon\u2019t forget about me.\u201d</span> you said as you appeared behind Naraku. He was surprised by this which allowed you score a direct blow to him with your Phoenix Flower attack. He felt very little pain, but he was still impressed by you. Kagome got behind him and slashed at him with her claws. Once she did that, she jumped next to you and the two of you took a stance. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI am impressed. You are both worthy to be the heirs of your clans. I shall let you enjoy this taste of victory for now.\u201d</span></b> he said as he disappeared into the darkness.

The Sharingan will not always be able to help you.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI understand.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clilac\">\u201cNow before we begin you will need to learn the attack known ad the Gravity Slam.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cGravity Slam?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clilac\">\u201cYes, its where you can increase the gravity around you and focus it all into one attack. For example, you can focus energy into your fist and fire it towards an opponent. Watch.\u201d</span> she said as she called on her powers. This was a simple enough technique, but only you could turn it into a weapon powerful enough to harm Naraku. She then fired a blast of gravity out of her eye and created a massive hole in the wall. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhoa.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clilac\">\u201cNow you try.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAlright.\u201d</span> You said as you focused energy around you to increase the gravity. You then sent it into your fist and thrusted it forward, making an even large hole than Sasa created. <span class=\"clilac\">\u201cVery good Itachi-kun. Now put the blindfold on. You will need to score a blow to me and pin me down, as well as avoid all of my attacks, without the use of your eyes.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cVery well.\u201d</span> you said as you put the blindfold on. Everyone else left the room and entered the only part of the hall they could observe you safely. <span class=\"clilac\">\u201cThe first move belongs to you Itachi.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cVery well.\u201d</span> you said as you threw a few shuriken at her, she easily dodged, but you fired back at her in an instant with the Phoenix Flower. She managed to avoid that attack as well. She then dropped pillars from the sky towards you. You were able to avoid a few but one of them sent you into the air. Sasa then fired a blast of gravity from her eye again. You barely avoided that one though. You then used the power of earth to create spikes made of rock rise from the ground and move towards her. She then jumped into the air to avoid it, but you got above her and threw a punch at her. She was able to dodge, but she didn\u2019t notice your other hand and you hit her with a gravity attack. As she hit the ground, you used the power of earth to make shackles out of earth to pin her to the ground.<span class=\"clblue\"> \u201cLooks like I win.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clilac\">\u201cIt seems so Itachi.\u201d</span> You then took the blindfold off and released Sasa. You knew that Shizuku was up next to face you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then followed by sending a bust of energy at you, sending you flying. Once you got near the ground, you created talons made of energy and sank them into the ground, slowing you down. But your father was not about to let you off easy. He made another charge at you, but this time you managed to catch his fist. The two of you began to clash with such speed only those with the sharingan could follow it. The two of you separated for a moment and both of you fire a large fireball at each other. Once the two clashed, the heat was incredible intense. It was almost at supernova. The two of you had to stop before it got so hot the atmosphere would be set on fire. Once you stopped your father got behind you with his Chidori, but you managed to grab his wrist and send it into his own thigh. You then landed a powerful kick to his head, which caused him to be sent flying. You then used the gravity slam Sasa taught you and sent him into the ground. You then used the ice needles you learned from Shizuku to pin him to the ground, even though you had to send them through his arms and legs. Once you landed, you had him pinned with your own Chidori at his neck. He then began to laugh and said <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou really are a chip off the old block. You definitely have what it takes to surpass me and your mother. And I say congratulations Itachi.\u201d </span>He then created a little heat around him to melt the ice needles and you helped him up. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThanks dad, you might want to go to the hot springs and heal up.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cGood point.

But as he got ready to strike with his tail, you landed a powerful kick to his side, causing him to release one of your arms. You grabbed his left pincer and used your raw power to tear it off. As the general screeched in pain, you forced your chidori into his stomach and made a very loud screech before his body grew limp. You pulled out your chidori an he fell to the ground. \u201c<span class=\"cblue\">Foolish demon.\u201d</span> you said turning around. But then you felt something grab your leg. Amazingly the general was still alive. <b><i>\u201cYou\u2026will\u2026pay for that!\u201d</i></b> he yelled standing up and lifting you off the ground and the slamming you on your back. He did the same thing several times before throwing you into the air a bit and grabbing your neck. <b><i>\u201cNow die!\u201d</i></b> he said stinging you in your stomach with his stinger. You then stuck your sword through his body and ran your chidori through it. The electricity back-lashed onto you too and caused you to be sent lying through the air. You crashed landed at such high speed you were in a mini crater. But before you could try and get up, some security showed up with guns pointed at your head. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cShit\u2026\u201d </span>Just when they were about to shoot, someone stepped in and saved your ass. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cStop!\u201d</span> The guards pulled back their guns and you tried to see who saved you, but the venom in your veins was causing you to lose consciousness fast. But before you passed out, you heard the woman say to the guards <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cTake him to the infirmary now!\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

You turned your head to see your shirt and sword on a small dresser. After a minute or so, you slowly began to sit up, finding your chest was covered in bandages. You also noticed that the infirmary was more like a bedroom. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhere am I?\u201d</span> you thought. Just then, you heard the door open and the one who entered was a very beautiful young woman. She had long, silver hair and wore some kind of black dress. She had a crescent moon on her forehead, beautiful purple eyes and her breasts were at least a DD. You had never seen such a beautiful woman before in your entire life. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI see you\u2019re awake. I am sorry my security was so rude. They overreact at times.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI can\u2019t argue with you there. Now, mind explaining what is going on? Who are you?\u201d</span> The woman giggled. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYou haven\u2019t changed a bit, have you Sasuke?\u201d</span> You were surprised this woman knew you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHow do you know me?\u201d</span> The girl shook her head and said <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cMy goodness, what an unforgivable sin. Forgetting me like that...\u201d</span> she said as she walked over to you. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAllow me to reintroduce myself. I am the heiress to the Junguji family, one of the twelve demon slayer clans. My name is Kuesu Jinguji.\u201d</span> As soon as she said that name, some of your memories passed before your eyes. You remember a girl with black hair and a crescent moon on her head a long time ago, long before your clan\u2019s demise. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cJinguji\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI see, you still are having trouble remembering.\u201d</span> She said as she got next to you. You were unsure if you could trust her, so you jumped out of bed and halfway across the room. Kuesu smiled and got in front of you in an instant. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSo fast.\u201d</span> you thought to yourself. She then gently grabbed your face and somehow suppressed your powers. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat the hell, why can\u2019t I summon my strength?\u201d</span> you thought. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cCalm down and listen to me Sasuke.\u201d</span> You looked her in the eyes. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYour family asked me to look after you.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cMy Family? What do you mean?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI was told by both our families that I would join the Uchiha. They arranged for us to be married.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMarried?!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYou really don\u2019t remember do you?\u201d</span> She then began to pull your face closer to her own. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYou may have forgotten your past\u2026 But I'll make sure you remember.\u201d</span> she said as she kissed you on the lips. You then had a little flash back about her as a young girl and how the girl from your past kissed you before by the lake near your clan\u2019s home. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cCould she be the same girl from back then?\u201d</span> you thought. She broke the kiss and looked into your eyes <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cY-You\u2019re\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSo you\u2019re beginning to remember.\u201d</span> She let you go and a few memories began to come to light. It wasn\u2019t much, but you were happy to recover some of your memory. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cKuesu\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSasuke, you remember.\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI remember some things. I remember you, an the arrangement our families made, and a few things we\u2019ve done as children, but nothing more.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI will help you recover your memory, Sasuke.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThank you Kuesu. I\u2019m going to get some air.\u201d</span> you said walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, you were standing on the roof as you enjoyed the night sky. You were still getting used to the idea that Kuesu was by your side. It would take a while before you were used to the idea she is your fianc\u00e9. Your thoughts were interrupted by Kuesu as she stood behind you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIs there something you need Kuesu?\u201d</span> you said turning around. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI was about to ask you that Sasuke.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive me, as you can imagine, this day\u2019s been a little confusing for me.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI understand Sasuke. And if there is anything you need, no matter what it is, you can come to me.\u201d</span> she said walking up to you and gently placing her hand on your cheek. You placed your hand on hers and gently took it off your face. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI know, but this a whole new thing for me Kuesu. I\u2019ve lived on my own for the last eleven years. I am used to being alone.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cNot anymore.\u201d </span>she said as she gave you a very gentle kiss. You calmed down in that moment, and you had no idea why. But you loved the calmness of the moment, and you knew that as long as Kuesu was at your side, you felt at peace. She gently broke the kiss and looked into your eyes. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI will always be there for you Sasuke.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThank you, Kuesu.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now I think you should get some sleep. The guest room is prepared for you. And when you are ready, you are more than welcome to sleep with me.\u201d</span> she said walking off with a smile. You blushed at that image and enjoyed the night for a little longer. Then you went into the guest room that was prepared for you. You walked towards wall and slept against it. Something you were very used to.</span></div></div>",

You also could smell something very delicious. You stood up and walked downstairs to the kitchen. There you saw Kuesu had prepare a delicious breakfast for you. She turned her head and smiled at you. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cGood morning Sasuke.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cGood morning.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYes, I did.

One thing was for sure, Kuesu was an amazing cook. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThis is unbelievable.\u201d</span> She giggled sitting beside you. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI\u2019m so pleased you  enjoy my cooking.\u201d </span>You continued to eat and Kuesu joined you, watching how much you loved the taste of her food.

These are the soldiers of the underworld. They are not to be underestimated.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI see.

As soon as I get those guards away from those people, cover me until I can get them all out of there.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAlright.\u201d</span> You drew your sword and used your speed to slice down the guards. But as soon as you I that, the rest of them turned their attention towards you. But then, Kuesu used her magic to trap some of them in a seal that fried their bodies. Before the others could attack you, she jumped beside you and the pages of her book began to spin around at high speeds creating a powerful barrier. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAll of you are going to be fine. I will get you back to the city.\u201d </span>you said as you focused your power around them. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cChaos\u2026Control!\u201d</span> Almost instantly, the hostages were returned to the city, leaving you and Kuesu to face the Hideaks. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSasuke, do you remember the promise we made to each other?\u201d</span> In that moment you had a small flashback to when you and Kuesu were kids. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSo, you\u2019re a Demon Slayer like me Kuesu? Then let\u2019s work hard together.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI-I can do it by myself. I\u2019m different from you.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHow boring. Working together is better for sure.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d </span>she said her back facing you. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cIt takes a few seconds to cast a spell.

And like I promised, I will protect you.\u201d</span> She smiled. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cGood. Now let\u2019s go.\u201d</span> she then made a single swipe of her arm which caused the barrier to fire pages at the Hideaks like bullets. This destroyed  quite a few of them. But plenty still remained. As you and Kuesu were back to back, the Hideaks did all they could to kill you. But you and Kuesu fought in perfect synch. The Hideaks kept their distance after a little while, but you knew they weren\u2019t finished. Using your Sharingan, you saw that they were building up their energy for an attack.<span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cKuesu, jump!\u201d</span> As soon as you said that, every single Hideak fired an energy blast at the two of you. You were both able to jump into the air just in time. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cLet\u2019s finish this.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cLet\u2019s.\u201d</span> You brought your right hand close to her left.

As the two of you fell to the ground. You used the power of water to put out the flames before they burned the forest to the ground. You landed side-by-side then turned towards each other an smiled. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWe make an amazing team.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI completely agree Sasuke.\u201d</span> The two of you walk back to the mansion with a smile on your faces.</span></div></div>",

You were also still getting use to the idea of having a fianc\u00e9. But you were starting to regain more of your memories. And even though there were still  a Hideak attack every now and again, it was nothing you an Kuesu couldn\u2019t handle.  One day, you stood on the roof and thought it was time for some training. You focused your powers and created a large training field next to the mansion. You then surrounded it with an indestructible barrier that only you and Kuesu could enter and exit. Making sure none of your attacks could get out. Once you finished, you jumped right into the field and used your power to increase the gravity to five times Earth\u2019s normal gravity. This was not an easy task. You had to get used to this in order to increase your speed. You stood there for a couple minutes and once you were able to keep your balance, you used the power of darkness to create a warrior that wasn\u2019t effected by the gravity, making him more nimble than you are. Kuesu stood on the roof watching this. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSasuke seems to take his training to whole new levels.\u201d </span>You then created warriors of fire, wind, lightning, and ice as well, also unaffected by the gravity. You drew your sword and the shadow warrior charged for you. You blocked his attack with your sword and pushed him back, every warrior came at you when they had the chance. But you managed to keep them at bay for a while. You started off simple for now. But then things became difficult when they came at you with the intent to kill. They were working in such perfect synch that they had you on the ropes.<span class=\"cviolet\"> \u201cWhat will you do now, Sasuke?\u201d </span>You thought it was time to get serious and charged at them with your sword. Using your sharingan, you were able to see the attacks of the warriors vividly clear. You managed to slice them down one by one until they were on the ground. However, you knew there was one last test. All of the warriors combined and created a super warrior. You knew this was not going to be easy. But despite that, you charged for the warrior and he did the same. The two of you clashed blades and as soon as you did, he used lightning to send electricity into your body and send you back a ways.. But he extended his blade wrapping it around your leg and brought you over his head and slammed you over the ground. Kuesu watched closely. You then combined darkness and lightning sending it through his blade and began to fry him a bit. You then jumped into the air and created a massive number of Chaos Spears. You then caused them to rain down upon the warrior at extreme speeds, while more Chaos Spears formed and fire towards him. This continued for ten minutes before you stopped the attack. But the instant you did, the warrior used all of the energy in his body to fire one last energy blast at you. It scored a direct hit to your chest, causing you to slide back to the edge of the barrier. You then returned the gravity to normal and walked out. However, that training session pushed you to where you could barely stand up. Kuesu walked up to you and got under your left arm and walks inside with you and setting you on the couch. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI\u2019ve never seen someone train so hard. You really are something Sasuke.\u201d</span> You chuckled a bit. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThank you, Kuesu.\u201d</span> She smiled and sat beside you. You sat on the couch for a while, due to the fact you felt pretty worn out from that training session. You sat there for so long you ended up falling asleep.</span></div></div>",

You embraced her in your arms feeling happier than you ever have. But then, your dram became nothing but pitch black.

You also noticed that the sun was up and the smell of Kuesu\u2019s cooking filled the air. You let out a sigh of relief that she was okay. You pulled yourself together and went to the kitchen.

And most of their car were in flames while others were in pieces. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI don\u2019t know. But be careful. The one who caused this is still around.\u201d</span> She nodded and both of you took a look around. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThis kind of destruction isn\u2019t something Hideaks could do so quickly.\u201d</span> The two of you continued to look around. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThe air is thick with dark energy.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI noticed that too.

The demon soon appeared before you and the instant you saw him, a huge amount of your memories came flooding through your mind. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cHello Sasuke!\u201d </span></b><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNightmare!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYou know him?\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThat bastard was one of the demons that butchered my clan.\u201d</span> <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI am so pleased you remember me Sasuke.\u201d</span></b> You drew your sword and charged for him at lightning speed.

Kuesu rushed to your side to help you. You were extremely weak an tried to stand. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDamn\u2026it\u2026!\u201d</span> you said before you lost consciousness.

You noticed parts of your body were wrapped in bandages. You saw your sword leaning against the wall. You tried with all your might to stand up, but to no avail. You were in way too much pain. Despite the fact your powers increase your recovery speed, you needed more time to heal. But time isn\u2019t something you have. As you continued to try and stand up, Kuesu walked in and saw you trying to get up. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSasuke you need to rest.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI cannot afford to rest. Nightmare is somewhere in Japan and I must stop him.\u201d</span> Kuesu got behind you on the bed and pushed down on your shoulders forcing you back on the bed. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI\u2019m not asking you. Just relax.\u201d</span> She started to massage your shoulders, her soft and gentle hands working out all the stress. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOh Sasuke, you\u2019re so tense. When was the last time you tried to relax?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cTruth be told, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever made the attempt.

She continued to massage your shoulders, you could feel years of stress begin to melt away. You were extremely grateful Kuesu was back in your life. But as she continued, your eyes began to feel very heavy and Kuesu could see this.<span class=\"cviolet\"> \u201cSasuke, its okay. You can sleep. I\u2019ll stay here with you.\u201d</span> she said with a warm smile on her face. And almost instantly, you fell asleep and your body resting against hers. She smile and got comfortable and placed your head on her chest, running her fingers through your hair ever so gently. She soon began to feel sleepy as well and fell asleep with you in her arms. The two of you were thoroughly enjoying each other\u2019s company. And for the first time in your life, you had someone sleep by your side.</span></div></div>",

You then noticed that your head was right on Kuesu\u2019s breast. You blushed a bright red, and gently tried to pull yourself away. But in that moment, Kuesu gently woke up and pulled you back onto her. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cGood morning, Sasuke~.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cGood morning Kuesu.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI hope you slept well.\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI did, thank you.

She giggled and said <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI bet this your first time being this close to a woman\u2019s breasts.\u201d</span> she said in a teasing tone. You blushed even brighter if that was possible, an you tried to regain your composure. But after a quick giggle, she let you go and went to make you breakfast <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cKuesu, I\u2018ll make breakfast.\u201d</span> you said smiling. As you made her breakfast the two of you began to discuss getting to Japan. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSo I think after breakfast we should get packed and head to Japan and start our search for Nightmare.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAgreed. Once we get there, we can head to a hotel where I have a suit reserved.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cGetting there will be easy enough, all I have to do is use Chaos Control.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cChaos Control?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBasically, we travel through time and space to get to any location.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cVery impressive.\u201d</span> You smiled. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThank you. Here I hope you like this.\u201d</span> you said presenting her with an omelet.  <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI had no idea you were such a good cook Sasuke.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m am happy to hear it. This is my triple pork omelet. It has an even amount of bacon, diced ham, and sausage, along with some cheese and a little seasoning.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSounds great.\u201d</span> She too a bite as you sat down at the table. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThis is delicious Sasuke.\u201d</span> You smiled eating your omelet as well.\u201d <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI am so glad you like it.\u201d</span> You both continued to eat until you ate every single bite. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019ll do the dishes, you go pack up. Oh and once we leave you need to tell me exactly where the hotel is.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAlright.\u201d</span> She went upstairs and packed her stuff. After a few minutes you went upstairs and you noticed Kuesu was all packed. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cReady to go?\u201d</span> you said walking to her. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOf course.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAlright then.\u201d</span> Once she told you where the hotel was, you offered your arm our like a gentleman. She smiled and hooked her arm in yours. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cChaos Control.\u201d</span> And in that moment, you, Kuesu, and her luggage traveled through time and space and within a few seconds, you arrived at the hotel Kuesu told you about. You transported the two of you to an alley right beside the hotel so people wouldn\u2019t notice. The two of you walked into the lobby and Kuesu checked into the suit. The two of you walked up to you room and you took a good look around. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNice place.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThank you. Most of the furniture is my own.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWow, didn\u2019t think you could do that.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cIf I am going to have a suit reserved, I might as well make it my own.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou have a point there. I\u2018ll let you get settled in.\u201d</span> you said walking outside to the balcony. You had a great view of the city and the forested area not too far away. Not only that, but you could see a sight you never thought you would see again; Your old home, the birthplace of the Uchiha Clan.<span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cMy home\u2026\u201d </span>you thought. But then you looked inside to see Kuesu settling in. You smiled and thought <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBut wherever I am, as long as I\u2019m with Kuesu, I\u2019m truly at home.\u201d</span> You thought smiling. You went inside and settled in yourself</span></div></div>",

You walked through the gates to find the place the same as it was back then; battle-scarred. You noticed a few of the Uchiha clan crests had slashes through them. Even though they were carved into the stone, you knew this when Nightmare invaded your home. But you ha the feeling he didn\u2019t do this alone. You placed your hand on the crest and remembered what your brother once told you. It was the Uchiha that brought peace and law between the demon slayer clans. You continued your little nostalgia tour. You noticed the spot where both you and your brother practiced your shuriken skills. The log your brother used only had holes in the middle of the log, all in a single column. Yours on the other hand had holes all over the place. You smiled at the memory of you trying to catch up to your brother Itachi. You passed your aunt and uncle\u2019s home and you remembered how they always cheered you up. There was a smile upon your face with all these happy memories of the past. You continued until you found yourself in your old house. You entered the house and noticed that everything looks the same as back then. You walked through the halls and saw your old room. You then noticed Itachi\u2019s room and remembered how he used to jab you in the forehead with his first two fingers when you were a kid. You chuckled at that memory. Itachi was a good brother when he was alive. You then walked into the living room and you remembered how your mother managed to make people around her happy with just that warm smile of hers. You went outside and said to yourself. <span class=\"cblue\">\"I cant believe I had forgotten.\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

You stared each other down and you drew your blade and pointed it at him. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cSo, you want to fight?\u201d</span></b> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou know I want you dead.

The instant your blades clashed, you both began to use everything you had. But he was too strong, and sliced your chest. You sent a small signal to Kuesu, one that she noticed before rushing towards your location. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSasuke, please be okay.\u201d</span> she thought. But while she rushed to help you, Nightmare had pinned your arm to the ground with his sword. He then stepped on your right arm with great force, causing you extreme agony. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cYou are weak. I almost don\u2019t find pleasure in killing you\u2026almost.\u201d</span></b> he said grabbing his sword and twists t in your left arm before pulling it out. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to end this. Say good night Sasuke.\u201d he said bringing his blade up. But before he could finish you off, a large magic blast sent him back a ways. Kuesu appeared and helped you up. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSasuke, are you okay?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cK-Kuesu\u2026\u201d</span> Nightmare laughed as he walked towards you both. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cSo you\u2019re the Jinguji heiress huh? I must say that did sting a bit.\u201d Kuesu glared at him. \u201cConsider yourself lucky Sasuke, I will let you live for now.\u201d</span></b> He said vanishing. Once he left you completely lost consciousness. Kuesu took our body back to the hotel, and used the balcony to get inside, so no one would freak out at the sight of your wounds. As you lied there on the bed, Kuesu wish she could have been there to prevent the pain you felt during that battle with Nightmare. She decided it was time to confront Nightmare herself. But before she left however, she gave you a kiss on the cheek. She then went off to find and defeat Nightmare. She searched for a little bit and sound him in the middle of a valley. The clouds grew ark as the two of them stared each other down, ready to fight to the end.</span></div></div>",

But to his surprise, the fireballs weaved around the bolts and struck him. The caused him some pain, but he started to chuckle. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI\u2019m impressed.

Nightmare waited until they were close enough to jump. But as he was in the air, Kuesu continued her assault, only this time, what looked like pages from her book were shot at him. He managed to dodge a few of them, but some of them did a little damage by slicing his skin. And he was beginning to land, Kuesu slammed her hand on the ground and an attack traveled under the ground and scored a direct hit at Nightmare. Fire began to burn him which did cause a large amount of damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Back with you-<br>\r\nAs you lied in the bed, you began to sense what was going on and you thought to yourself <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNo! Kuesu is fighting Nightmare. She doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s just toying with her.\u201d</span> You then had a flashback to the last time you talked to your brother Itachi. The two of you were sitting on the porch of your home looking at the sky. This was a couple days after you met Kuesu. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHey big brother.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cYes Sasuke?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat do you Kuesu is up to right now?\u201d</span> Itachi chuckled and said <span class=\"cred\">\u201cYou like her don\u2019t you Sasuke?\u201d </span>You blushed a little, but you didn\u2019t deny it. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYes, I do. I think she\u2019s really pretty.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cSasuke, let me tell you this. You know I won\u2019t always be around to look after you. But if you ever need someone to turn to, you can always turn to Kuesu. I bet she likes you too little brother.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cReally? You think so?\u201d </span>Itachi then placed his hand on your head. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cYes. And no matter what happens, I hope you consider her a member of the Uchiha.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI will big brother.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cGood. And remember, even if I may not be around, I will always be with you.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clred\">\u201cAnd so will we honey.\u201d</span> You turned to see your mom and dad. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMom, Dad.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cYou can always count on us to be with you in your heart son.\u201d</span> Just then you opened your eyes and you felt your power grow. You got out of bed and said as you jumped off the balcony and onto the rooftops as you rushed off to Kuesu\u2019s location. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMom, Dad, Itachi, Thank you.\u201d </span>you thought to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Back with Kuesu-<br>\r\nThe battle continued as Kuesu thought she had Nightmare on the ropes. She got in front of him and landed a powerful attack which sent him into the side of a mountain. But as the dust cleared, Kuesu saw that he was actually laughing. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI will admit, I didn\u2019t think you had this much power. But playtime is over now.\u201d</span></b> he said as he instantly got in front of Kuesu and landed a powerful backhand which sent her flying a little bit. He then grabbed her by the neck and brought up his blade. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cGame\u2019s over.

You grabbed her using great amount of speed. Kuesu looked like what she saw was only a blur. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAre you okay, Kuesu?\u201d</span> She looked up and saw you, but she noticed some changes. Your body gained a little more bulk, and your hair grew as long as her own. An the legendary Mangekyo sharingan was ablaze in your eyes. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSasuke?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m here, my love.\u201d</span> Kuesu blushes when you said that.

Nightmare then fired off multiple energy slash attacks at you, and you deflected all of them too. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cNo way.\u201d</span></b> You vanished for a moment before appearing right in front of him. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWhat the?\u201d</span></b> Before he could react, you slammed your palm on his chest, causing him to slide back quite a ways. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cHe\u2018s stronger than I expected.\u201d</span></b> he said to himself as he looked at you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWell?\u201d</span> <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cHmm?\u201d</span></b> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIs that the best you can do?

And in a few moments, a sphere of energy began to form at the tip of his blade. You stood your ground as the sphere grew in size until it was the size of a tank. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cTry this one!\u201d</span></b> he said as the sphere fired off large energy blasts at you. You evaded the attack at full speed, as it continued to fire at you. The attacks kept following close behind you until the sphere eventually all of the energy inside the sphere was exhausted. As soon as you saw your chance, you charged at him with full speed and slashed at him. For the moment, it looked like nothing happened. But as soon as you put your blade inside its sheath, his human arm severed form his body, causing him to scream in pain. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou are no match for me Nightmare.

You didn\u2019t even make any effort to dodge the flame, you just let it hit you, just as you planned. Kuesu gasped as she saw the flames swallow you. Nightmare laughed triumphantly. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cNow there is nothing to stop us!\u201d</span></b> He continued to laugh as you spoke up. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cA little early to celebrate isn\u2019t it Nightmare?\u201d</span> He looked into the flame and saw you were still alive. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cImpossible!\u201d</span></b><span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cNow Nightmare.

The flames soon died and Nightmare was barely alive, falling to the ground. You waked to him knowing he was helpless now. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou have lost Nightmare. Now, Who was with you that night? The night my clan was slaughtered.\u201d</span> he chuckled in pure pain. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cYou will meet him soon enough.

Of course, the Hideak attacks were still happening, but our powers continued to grow. You also learned how to use the Mangekyo Sharingan as well, mastering the Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi as well. However, even thought your eyes were eternal, you know both of those jutsu drained you immensely. But you never had reason to use them before, so you stuck with your other powers to fight. And life with Kuesu was as good as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a warm summer morning, and you and Kuesu had once again checked into Kuesu\u2019s suite. You decided to relax for a while on the couch enjoying the day. Listening to the birds outside was also very relaxing. And as you listened to the birds you became lost in your thoughts. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThings have gotten much more peaceful lately. Still, even though I am getting much stronger and so is Kuesu, I cant help but feel this is the calm before the storm.\u201d </span>Your thoughts were interrupted by the news. They said something about the Black Comet passing over the Earth in a few days. But there was something about that name that gave you the chills. But Kuesu walked in and sat down beside you. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSomething on your mind Sasuke?\u201d</span> You snapped out of it and looked at her. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s nothing Kuesu.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cDon\u2019t give me that.

You blushed a bit and returned the kiss. You both held each other close as you kissed. After a couple minutes of kissing, you laid back on the couch and you took a nap with Kuesu on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, down in the underworld, Blackheart ready to make his next move. Using his dark powers, he transported himself to the heart of the Black Comet, inside was an alien race called the Black Arms and their leader Black Doom. <b>\u201cWho are you? Why are you here?\u201d</b> Blackheart chuckled. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI am here for you Back Doom.

I accept your challenge.\u201d</b> <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cThen let us begin.\u201d</span></b> Both of them remained silent for a moment before attacking each other. As they did, the Black Arms watched to see who would be their leader. The two of them were evenly matched for the longest time, but in the end, Blackheart was able to defeat Black Doom. As he walked to him, Black Doom looked up at Blackheart. <b>\u201cHow can you be this powerful?\u201d</b> <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI would tell you, but you wont be around much longer.\u201d</span></b> he said grabbing his head. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cFarewell.\u201d</span></b> He then absorbed Black Doom\u2019s body into his own and in turn, the jewels that were on Black Doom were now around Blackheart. He too in a deep breath and exhaled, feeling a great amount of power. He then looked at the Black Arms who were roaring in a way that shows they accept him as their leader. Blackheart couldn\u2019t help but laugh in pure excitement. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cSasuke Uchiha, enjoy your worthless life, while it lasts!\u201d</span></b> </span></div></div>",

Though the day the Uchiha clan was slaughtered by your brother, you lost contact with the cat. Itachi had died from his last attack against you. You did not seek revenge due to your teachings that revenge leaves you with nothing. You were enjoying the peace and quiet when you heard something come up to you. You opened your eyes and said <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIs there something I can do for you?\u201d </span>You turned your head and noticed a very beautiful girl with long dark hair and beautiful eyes. Though you had a feeling that she was not normal. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, master.\u201d </span>she said. You stood up and asked what she meant by that. She walked up to you and said <span class=\"cred\">\u201cYou do not remember me?

The fact that she was in your room at all surprised you, let alone in your bed. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I\u2019m not a monster.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cUh, but\u2026\u201d</span> you said as you looked at her breasts.

The girl then starts to lick your neck and though you were in pure ecstasy, you needed answers. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHold on! Can\u2019t you explain to me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</span> you said pushing her away. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cVery well.\u201d</span> The girl began to explain how that being it was your seventeenth birthday, the Ayakashi could sense your power, making you the prime target. She then said that this was your destiny. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBut my destiny\u2026\u201d</span> the girl began to get really close to you again. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDo not worry. By an ancient vow, I will protect you starting today. Actually\u2026even without the vow\u2026I would never leave my young master\u2019s side.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMaster?\u201d</span> she then proceeds to lick your neck again. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHey wait. I still haven\u2019t asked you the most important thing.\u201d </span>She then looks into your eyes and visa versa. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWho are you?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cHimari. My name is Himari. I am also an Ayakashi\u2026 an adorable cat.\u201d</span> she says as a pair of cat ears pop out the top of her head. But then Rinko and Yuto came in and saw what was going on. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHey guys, I can totally explain.\u201d </span></span></div></div>",

If I let you live, you will come after us in the name of Humankind.\u201d</span> she said making a needle out of ice. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOne hundred years ago, my family\u2026was wiped out by the Jibashiri family, one of the 12 demon slayer families. ~Nano\u201d</span> She then pointed the needle at your neck. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWe were just living peacefully. The demon slayers are evil. ~Nano. Die!\u201d</span> But then, Himari came bursting out of the water and stopped her. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHimari!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cIce needles. You must be a Mizuchi.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSword of Noihara, you are still siding with the Uchiha in this era? Traitor.\u201d</span> Just then the creature that grabbed the two of you before appeared behind you. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cTwo of them?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhatever it takes to kill you.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cQuiet!\u201d</span> she said charging at her, but when she struck her, it turned out to be a water clone. The creature then grabbed her and even though Himari sliced through a few tendrils, she was not able to escape when Shizuku create a water vortex around her and the creature. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHimari!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry! This is nothing!\u201d</span> She held her breath for a while, but she ad to exhale at some point. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cStop! Please stop!\u201d</span> Shizuku looked at you with the same emotionless look as before. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHimari!\u201d </span>you said charging into the vortex. You tried to get the creature to let go, but it wrapped a tendril around you as well. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHe\u2019s charging himself to his own death. Foolish demon slayer. Now you won\u2019t be able to leave. ~Nano. That saves a lot of trouble. I\u2019ll kill them both at once.\u201d</span> she said as the vortex got much stronger. You and Himari reached towards each other. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s pointless. ~Nano. The shaved ice increased my powers threefold. I can even drown a fish.\u201d</span> You grabbed onto Himari\u2019s hand and pulled her close to you. Shizuku was surprised at what she saw. You were running out of air yourself at this point. Himari then noticed one of the ice needles. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDie! ~Nano.\u201d</span> Himari took one of the needles and stabbed herself in the thigh, filling the vortex with blood. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhat did you do cat? ~Nano.\u201d </span>In that moment, the vortex was dispelled, and Himari sliced the creature in half. As the two of you were gasping for breath, you noticed what she did to her leg. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHimari\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI can\u2019t believe she did that. ~Nano.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cYou can only control normal water. You can\u2019t control water that is mixed with the blood of another Ayakashi.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhat of it?\u201d</span> she said as water from around the cave turned into many different vortexes. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of water here. ~Nano.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cIt looks like it.\u201d</span> she said as she tried to stand up, but the pain forced her back down. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHimari!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cRun, Master. I\u2019ll hold her off while you escape.\u201d</span> You gasped lightly. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI\u2019m your bodyguard. Protecting you is my duty. Hurry!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNo\u2026 How can you expect me to leave you here?!\u201d </span>Both Himari and Shizuku gasped a little. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou\u2019ve suffered a serious injury trying to protect me. If something happens to you, I would ever be happy even if I escaped!\u201d</span> you said placing your hand on her shoulder. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cM-Master?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDon\u2019t sacrifice yourself for my sake. That is not what I want!\u201d</span> Himari looked at you in amazement. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDemon slayer of the Uchiha\u2026This cat and this man\u2026There\u2019s something wrong with them. ~Nano.\u201d</span> she thought as the vortexes vanished. She then jumped to the opening of the cave and said <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIn compliance with the simpleton demon slayer's request, I'll withdraw myself for today. But next time, I'll kill you.\u201d </span>she said as she turned into water and left. You used your powers to heal Himari\u2019s leg and the two of you returned to the beach after that.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though over time, you had gotten much stronger. You had no trouble with the soldiers, and the gernerals were always a nice warm up. But you had something you had forgotten.

You had a really bad feeling from that question. Shizuku said that she would teack her using you as an example partener. \"Whoa, hold on a second here. Don't I get a say in-\" you  were cut off by Shizuku's tongue again. You cannot believe that this was the second time this had happened. Sasa watched as Shizuku continued to kiss you. Soon, Shizuku asked Sasa to give it a try. Sasa then walked up in front of you and began to lean in towards you. Your heart began to beat faster when Sasa's lips locked with your own. Lucky for you she did not use tongue the first time. But just as she did this, you got a huge chill down your spine.

She then decided to get you to leave by putting a poision in your tea that would ewaken you. She gave you the tea and told you that it was on the house. Shizuku tested it for poisong and she could tell that there was poison. So she switched it with another customer and he drank it. Everyone else in the shop got out of there whille you and the others satyed. The girls knew it was her and they attacked. Himari managed to stick her sword through her, but she lived. But then the girls figured out that the girl would be destroyed if a  certian object was destroyed. The figured out that a tea cup which was her true body. They did try to break it, but it slipped out of their hands and the girl tried to catch it. She failed and thought she was going to die. But to her surprise, you caught the cup without a single scratch. Even though you were poisoned by her, you still saved her life. \"But why?\" the girl asked. \"Look, I can tell just from looking at you that you had no evil intentions. You were just acting out of fear. Besides, anyone who makes such good tea cannot be evil.\" you said. You handed the cup back to the girl. \"Thank you. My name is Liz by the way.\" she said. \"My name is Yoru. Pleased to meet you Liz.\" you said.

They were talking about how you would become a great threat to them and all other Ayakashi. But Shizuku stepped in and told them that you were no threat. \"Shizuku, I thought you would have killed him by now. Why do you show emotion towards him?\" one of them asked. She told them how you hated to kill ad about the kindess in your heart. But they did agree to one thing; Kuesu was a major threat to them. Shizuku decided to fight her, bt not for the reason as a threat. She decided to fight her because she was causing you all sorts of emotional problem. \"Shizuku, you might perish if you go to fight her.\" one of them said. \"I don't care. I will do anything for Yoru-kun.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout two hours later, she found Kuesu on the roof and told her the trouble she was causing you emotionally. And as soon as she said that, her hair began to grow, showing her anger towards Kuesu . Although Kuesu would not listen to anything an Ayakashi said about you. She got ready to attack and so did Shizuku. Kuesu made the first move with a water attack ad Kuesu used fire to attack her. She jumped into the air and attempted to land a burning punch at Shizuku. But she managed to create a water barrier around her, canceling out Kuesu's attack. Then Shizuku created four powerful water dragons at attacked. She then made an attempt to secape, but Kuesu managed to hit her with a blast of fire. But she survived esily and told Kuesu that she must have been the weakest of the demo slayer clans. That really pissed her off and she used a super powerful attack on Shizuku. Shizuku knew how much power was in that blast and thought that she was done for. But then, you arrived and got in front of the blast. You then used your own power to block the blast. Kuesu saw that you were blocking the blast and stopped the attack. She then noticed that you were only using one hand and your eyes showed how much you desired to protect her and the others. But before Kuesu could say a word, you grabbed Shizuku and went back to the portal.</span></div></div>",

You thought to yourself \"OMan, if this is what it's going to be with Kuesu just coming here for this kind of thing, I have no iea what it will be like if she starts living here as well.\" All of the girls decided to take turns taking care ofyou.

I'll kill her.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Himari!\" </span>you said giving a strong look. <span class=\"cred\">\"Alright alright. Ageha or whatever! The current head of the Amakawa Family is a person seeking peace between Humankind and Ayakashi. Won't you abandon your agression and withdraw?\" </span>Ageha looked and laughed a little. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"He wants me to leave peacefully? I can't believe my ears. What I wish for is to raise my status by killing demon slayers! His desires are no concern of mine!\"</span> <span class=\"cred\">\"This is more like it. Now I can cut you down with an unburdened mind.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"W-wait! What are you trying to say?\" </span><span class=\"cred\">\"It's exactly as I said. All she wants is to kill you and raise her status among Ayakashi.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"No way.\"</span> <span class=\"cred\">\"Let's see if your bark is worse than your bite, air demon!\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Wait, Himari!\"</span> <span class=\"cred\">\"Master, you need to leave. I know you can fight, but you have just remembered your past with me. That alone gives me strength. I would fight the world for you.\" </span>When she said that, you felt another power inside you unlock and your body felt very hot. You had unlocked the power of fire! <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Keep your head in the battle fool!\" </span>she said as her arm streached out to attack. Himari blocked it and told you to leave. You started to run for the house to get the others to safety, but then, some kind ofgiant came out of nowhere. <span class=\"cred\">\"Daidarabocchi!\"</span> The creature attacked the both of you and you both dodged. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Himari!\"</span> <span class=\"cred\">\"What are you doing? Take this chance and run away!\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"But-\"</span> <span class=\"cred\">\"GO! I wil be alright!\" </span>You had no choice but to run. As the fight continued, you got second thoughts and ran back. You also saw that Ageha was about to cut Himari in two, so you jumped in front of the blade. <span class=\"cred\">\"Master!\" </span>she was surprised that you took the attack. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Himari...\"</span> <span class=\"cred\">\"Are you an idiot?! Why haven't you run away?\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"I can't let girls protect me all the time. \"I've got to act like a man sometimes, right?\" </span>but when you turned around, your chest was slashed and blood came from it. As you fell to the ground, Himari was going to lose it. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"What an unexpected turn of events. You were saved by the one you were supposed to save. His blood is beautiful. It really looks delicious.\" </span>but then, Himari lost control and her heart sank into a darkness. She attacked and cut the giants arm off. She was about to kill Ageha when you stopped her with a blade made from pure energy. The collision not only unlocked the power ofdarkness, but a huge blast came from the point and destroyed the giant and crated a huge clearing. Shizuku saw this and went to the point of the blast. <span class=\"clblue\">\"This is the power, of chaos.\" </span></span></div></div>",

You told her that you remembered the time she kiessed you when you were young, but she told you that never happened, because the first time she appeared to you in human form was when you and Rinko were walking to school. For the last weak you were trying to figure out who that girl was, but you let it go beacuse of the fun you were having with Himari. One day, the two of you were walking from school and you enjoyed the sunset. But then, a girl in a black dress with long, siver hair and a crescent moon on her head appeared and atytacked Himari.

Reception told me you were coming, so I prepared some tea.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019ve never been in the top floor of a hotel before. It\u2019s a bit different from what I had imagined.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cIs that so? Most of the furniture is my own actually. I intend to stay here quite a while, so I made changes as I saw fit.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIs she allowed to do that?\u201d</span> you thought to yourself. She then asked for your cell phone and you gave it to her. Just then, you heard something break. It turns out you were bugged, which was odd. You are usually more careful than that. The number she placed herself on is under \u201cLove Love Kuesu-sama\u201d which was quite the title. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWell? Have you decided to join me as a demon slayer?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cFirst, I want to thank you for what you did to Himari.\u201d</span> you said sarcastically. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNo master keeps quiet when someone torments his cat. Did you think I wouldn\u2019t be angry?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\"We were just playing. Besides, she attacked me.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t an issue of who attacked who.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWhat then?\"</span><span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cHimari said she couldn\u2019t help it if I joined the Junguji Family. She said she wouldn\u2019t stop me. But what about you? You fundamentally reject Himari and Shizuku\u2019s desire to coexist. You want to destroy them only because they are Ayakashi. I don\u2019t want to lose my current life\u2026and if we can live together, I can\u2019t reject the Ayakashi. I\u2019m not like you. I cannot follow your path. You are not my ally.\u201d</span> When you said this, Kuesu gasped a little and your questions echoed through her mind. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhy are you obsessed with me?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWhat is this man saying?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWe haven\u2019t met for years, and now you claim you\u2019re my fianc\u00e9e?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYou don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve felt.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cShizuku told me that the Amakawa and Junguji Families were both persecuted by the other demon slayer clans. You want the Amakawa Family\u2019s Chaos Power, don\u2019t you? The Chaos Power is able to cause great destruction or great protection. You need that power to revive the Junguji Family. Am I wrong?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cIt\u2019s all for the Junguji Family. You\u2018re wrong.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI don\u2019t intend to use a power that brings unhappiness. I can\u2019t agree to a marriage of calculation. It would only make us unhappy. That\u2019s why\u2026\u201d</span> you were cut off by Kuesu cutting your cheek with a dagger. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t my voice reach you? You\u2019ve changed. It may be too late for you. At the very least, let me be the one to take care of you.\u201d</span> She then tried to stab you and you avoided each attack. You were then back against the wall and you could not use chaos control. She must have done something to the tea to keep you from using it. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI don\u2019t need you. You\u2019re unnecessary.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cKuesu!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can do it!\u201d</span> Just before she stabbed you, the power of lighting was released and a huge thunderclap knocked her through the window. You then remembered your promise with her all those years ago. As you remembered this, you saw Kuesu fall and you were horrified. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat have I done? I was the one who wanted to fight demons. I forgot my past. But Kuesu, she never\u2026 she never forgot the promise we made that day.\u201d</span> you said with tears in your eyes. But then Kuesu appeared behind you and leaned against your back with her own. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI never showed my back to anyone until you protected me. But you were always protecting cats and snakes. To be honest, I was disillusioned.\u201d</span><span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cI was terrible.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYes, you were. Do you remember? If you broke your promise, you'd give me all your sweets and desserts...I could ask you for anything morning, afternoon and night...and you'd give me a present and treat me to an expensive dinner on my birthday.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat? That\u2019s quite a heavy punishment.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI\u2019m kidding. We never promised that. If I kill cats and snakes for the Junguji family, I would undoubtedly become your enemy.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIs that why you tried to kill me?\u201d </span><span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cNo, I could never kill you. But I did intend to stab you. If I didn\u2019t your power wouldn\u2019t manifest and you would not remember our promise.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou tried to stab me for that? I was actually scared.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThat is what an idiot like you deserves for forgetting something so important. I suppose I can forgive you though. When I fell out the window, I saw the concerned look on your face. If you can still show me that expression\u2026I can\u2019t let you down either.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cKuesu\u2026\u201d</span> just then the final element was unlocked and the power of light was yours to command. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your upper torso had been combined with the dark blue Chaos Emerald and the lower torso was combined with the light blue Chaos Emerald. That left your head and legs nroma. As you honed your new powers, you then noticed a young man with a scarf around his neck and black hair. There was als a young blond woman with him.<span class=\"cblue\"> \"Can I help you two?\" </span><span class=\"cteal\">\"Yes, are you Yoru Amakawa?\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes.\"</span> <span class=\"corange\">\"We are Androids 17 &amp; 18.

I do not want anyone getting hurt.\"</span> <span class=\"corange\">\"Fair enough. Lead the way.\"</span> You then used your powers to fly to the islands and the androids followed. You then got a call from Kuesu on your cell phone. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Kuesu, this is not a good time.?\"</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Why is that, Yoru-chan?\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"It seems the Androids have found me.

He charged at ou and you did the same. You threw the first punch and landed a direct hit to his face with your left arm, which was a much more powerful punch. 17 then used his energy attacks ad you deflected them with attacks of your own. There was one great difference between the two of you. 17 had an unlitited supply of energy, while you did not. You decided to combine the powers of water and lighting. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Let me show you what I learned from Shizuku, 17.\" </span>you then raised your arms into the air and a massive amount of water rose around the island. You then turned all that water into multiple water dragons and attacked 17.

He was a little banged up, but he was about to attack again. But as he was about to do this, you turned your head and saw Cell. <span class=\"cblue\">\"No, I thought I had more time.\"</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Ah, Yoru, thank you for bringing 17 &amp; 18 to me.

He landed on a boulder in front of you and 17 and increased his power greatly. As he walked by you, you just froze up and Cell continued to walk on. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHow man thousands of people did you absorb in order for you to get this strong?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cOh, a few.

I made them one with perfection.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat?!\u201d </span>As he walked on to absorb the androids, 17 told him to wait until he was done with you. But he managed to slam him into the ground and before he could absorb him, you had no choice but to attack. Combining the powers of water and lightning, you made a devastating attack against Cell. But sadly, that barely slowed him down. He then charged at you and he managed to do some major damage to your legs. He then threw you into the ocean and you were in a situation now. You used the red and purple chaos emeralds to make your legs. But then, all of the colors began to mix together like the northern lights and your power increased even further. You then called upon the white Chaos Emerald to create a helmet around your face. And like the rest of your body, it shined like the northern lights. But you did not have it\u2019s full power, or even 50%, but you had to try and kill Cell before he could absorb 17 &amp; 18. As he had his tail right about him, you landed a powerful punch and sent him flying from him.<span class=\"corange\"> \u201cWhat? Yoru? How are you still standing?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThe power of chaos is very powerful 17. I do not wish to destroy you or 18, but Cell is a different story. You both need to leave now!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cYoru, now I see you\u2019re getting serious. Bring it on!\u201d </span>The two of you charged at each other and you both attacked with lightning speed. Shizuku was also watching from a distance and was very impressed by your power. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cTry this Cell. Chaos Ice Needle Barrage!\u201d</span> You shot many ice shards at Cell, which did a little damage by cutting his skin. Then you grabbed him and then sent Cell deep into the ground and charged your energy into your hands. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cChaos Cannon\u2026FIRE!\u201d </span>Just then, a large blast of energy was sent into the crater and the energy was sent all over the island. Seventeen and Eighteen thought he was destroyed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were about to use Chaos Control to get to 18 and get her out of there, but he managed to land a powerful punch before you could even blink. You  once again got in front of 18 to keep Cell away from her.

You decided to rest in the living room leaning against the wall to keep Eighteen company. What you didn't knoow is that in the middle of the night, Eighteen walked up to you, kissed your cheek, then left to hide from Cell. The next morning, you found the note from Eighteen and told the girls to pack their stuff. In a few moments, they were ready and you used Chaos Control to go to Kami's lookout. There, you were greeted by Yamcha, Tien, Trunks, Goku, Gohan and Piccolo.  Vegeta just stood there in the corner again.</span></div></div>",

You had a feeling she was hidden on an island somewhere, so you, Vegeta, Trunks, and Krillin split up in groups of two in order to find her. You and Krillin were together and Trunks and Vegeta went another direction. While Goku and Gohan went to train in the time chamber. You used all the speed you could call upon, but you were still pretty drained from the last time you fought Cell. As you were both flying at top speed, you noticed Krillin looked like he had something on his mind. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Kirllin, I know you have emotions for Eighteen. For the time being, we need to shut her down. Once Cell is gone, we can reprogram her to not attack Goku on sight. I promise you.\"</span> <span class=\"corange\">\"Thanks Yoru.\"</span> You then felt a strong energy near-by. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Cell. It seems like he is closing in. I will keep him busy, you shut down Eighteen.\" </span>He nodded and you tackled Cell as soon as you saw him. But as you thought, he is much stronger than before. The two of you were in a massive battle while Krillin was going to shut her down. But he lost his mind to his emotions and destroyed the switch meant to do so. Cell saw this and landed a powerful punch and sent you into the ground of the island. He used the solar flare to get to Eighteen and he absorbed her. And with that, his power grew by a massive amount. His perfect form had been realized.</span></div></div>",
