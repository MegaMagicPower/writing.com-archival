When you brought it up to your Mom she actually made an excuse for him! She said he was \"probably just curious\" since he seemed to have hit puberty pretty early. Of course. Now they're taking a trip, leaving you home with the little perv for a few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it's only a few days.\" You quietly thought to yourself as you laid down for bed the night before your parents would be leaving. They told you they'd be leaving very early in the morning, so they'd be gone by the time either you or Mikey woke up. They also made sure to remind you at least a dozen times to be nice to your little brother. Whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up after a nice night of sleep, your alarm clock said it was around 10:00 AM, and you closed your eyes to get another few minutes. A second or two later your eyes snapped open in shock as you realized your alarm clock looked very different from last night, for one thing: it looked like it was as big as your whole house! You looked around the room in a panic, everything was gigantic! Your bed must have stretch for half a mile! \"Oh my god... This is a nightmare...\" you say to yourself, slapping yourself in the face a few times, hoping to wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this is not funny anymore, I want to wake up. 3... 2... 1...\" You say to yourself in a shaky voice. It suddenly starts to sink in that you're not dreaming. Your heart nearly stops and you let out a desperate scream for help, but your minuscule voice couldn't hope to be heard by anyone else in the house. You stop screaming after a few attempts, and another realization kicks in, \"Oh no. Mom and Dad are gone by now... That means I'm stuck here for half a week with...\" you shudder at the thought of your massive brother stomping around, completely unaware of you at this size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were hurried and panicked, but after forcing yourself to take a few deep breaths, you decided to needed to get help from someone. As difficult as it will be, that someone will have to be Mikey. But how will you get his attention?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided not to wait around for a rescue, so you began a long journey to your little brother's room. Climbing down from your bed to the floor wasn't as hard as you thought it would be, thankfully. You were able to safely slide down on the threads of your blanket until you hit the carpeted floor. Once you started walking you didn't stop, trekking for nearly an hour before getting to the closed door of Mikey's room. You easily fit under the door, and something about that makes you uneasy. How would your little brother react to finding you shrunken down like this? At least you were still in your pajamas, so you didn't have to be tiny AND naked in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you pass into Mikey's room from beneath the door, you see him still lying in bed. \"Oh man, he sleeps like a rock!\" you whine to yourself as you start walking to his bed, having to step around his toys on the floor. Some of them were more than twice your size! You'd never felt so vulnerable in your life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you came to a low-hanging section of Mikey's blanket, and you found that you could climb it just as easily as you had slid down yours earlier. Once you got up over the edge, you were in awe of how enormous your younger brother was, compared to you; and you noticed you were at the foot of his bed, just a few inches (feet to you!) from his gigantic, socked feet! You had to get up to his ears so he could hear you, and that would be another long hike. How are you going to get there? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you were trying to decide which route to take to your brother's head, you felt the air around you suddenly get colder! The air conditioner must have turned on! And at your size, the cool air blowing into the room felt like it was freezing! You hurried under your brother's blanket and immediately felt the heat radiating off of his body warming you up! It was almost relaxing to feel that kind of warmth, had it not been the source of it was your little brother's humongous leg! The pocket of space between the blanket and his leg was getting tighter and darker, until you could only feel your way forward! This continued for quite some time, getting darker and hotter and far more cramped as you pressed on, determined to get help from Mikey at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like forever of wading through the darkness, you felt yourself pressing against something soft and silky... it was clothes! You felt the somewhat loose fabric and figured that you made it to your brother's shirt! Excitement filled you as you stuffed yourself under the fabric, hoping to get his attention sooner by walking straight up his belly to his face! As you pressed on, you felt something in the back of your mind bothering you, like something you forgot about that would be really important to know right about now. This thought keeps you distracted as you crawled more towards what you thought was the center of your little brother's torso... but something was wrong, you could definitely hear him breathing in the distance, so if you were on his belly or chest, the \"ground\" beneath you should be slowly rising and falling, shouldn't it? Absentmindedly, you keep moving through the darkness as the thought sticks with you, making you feel like you should be realizing something by now; and just as it hits you... you hit it! You feel something soft and warm and squishy pressing against your face as you moved right into it, and the faint smell of this flesh told you exactly where you were... And you realized what your mind was screaming at you about: Mikey only sleeps in his underwear. You just mashed your face right into the soft skin of your younger brother's cock! As humiliating and disgusting as it was, you saw this as an opportunity to get Mikey's attention MUCH faster... But it seemed so wrong and so gross! Would she do it, to save herself the long walk up to Mikey's head?  </span></div></div>",

Did you have an affect the first time you touched him? It seemed like at least <i>this</i> part of him noticed something! Just as you were about to move again, you felt the ground beneath you shaking and gravity shifting, Mikey was rolling over in his sleep! As he turned, you fell towards his young cock, being forced to grab onto it for dear life as Mikey got comfy in bed. You felt him stop on his side for a second, and you heard a distant, but loud yawn, \"Is he finally waking up?!\" you thought, as your grip loosened for a second, causing you to slide down the length of his malehood until you grabbed on tighter to stop from falling any lower!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you had already fallen quite a ways, and you felt a weightlessness beneath your feet. You saw that you must have your arms wrapped around the fat head of his young cock, and your torso was pressed against the opening in his foreskin, rubbing against his sensitive, covered tip. He must have felt that too, as you felt another pulse from his cock as more blood began to flow to it, and eventually a single drop of clear, slippery, salty fluid poured out of his slit... and right onto your chest and stomach! \"Oh my god, no! No! No! No! Gross!\" you cried out as you nearly let go of his cock in pure disgust, but your will to not plummet to your death won that out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do next? I'd act quickly if I were you!</span></div></div>",

This only made your situation worse as you suddenly felt Mikey's obscene weight coming down on you all at once! You felt yourself being pressed into his half-erect tip as he turned and fell for what seemed like miles to you, until you suddenly felt a pressure give way and found yourself wedged in something hot and musky and wet with... ugh... you didn't want to think about it! You struggled in your fleshy prison, pressing against the sensitive walls with your tiny hands, eliciting another pulse from Mikey; you were turning him on! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you realized this, you stopped struggling, and tried waiting for Mikey to calm down so you could try to escape. It felt like an eternity, trapped in some weird crevice in your little brother's junk while you waited for his boner to go away, but it just wouldn't quit! It's weight held you in place and you still felt that weird slimy stuff all around you again, though it was much hotter this time. You considered your options at this point, and figured the best thing to do would be to...</span></div></div>",
