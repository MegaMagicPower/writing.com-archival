It seemed as though he would never get a hold of the Dark Brotherhood. He had prepared the effigy exactly as his copy of A Kiss Sweet Mother had ordered. He even managed to gather human flesh of an Imperial guard who was foolish enough to try to infiltrate the city gates. The candles lay around the exterior of the circle, the nightshade on the outer edge, just as the book had ordered it. Stabbing away at the rotting flesh before him, Aventus simply kept chanting for the night mother, surely the Dark Brotherhood couldn't ignore him forever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving never known his father, young Aventus lived a relatively simple life in the city of Windhelm with his mother Naalia. Being a Nord, like the majority of locals, Aventus and his mother never struggled too much in their daily lives. The people of Windhelm always took care of their own, and the mighty Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak ensured his people never went hungry, as long as they weren't elves. Though it had its fair share of injustices, many would say Windhelm certainly wasn't the worst place in Skyrim for a child to spend his youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day however, Aventus' life would be forever changed, as his dear mother Naalia would succumb to an unknown illness, with little time for preparation of the young boys well being. Young and orphaned, with no next of kin to take up responsibility for the child, Aventus was sent to Honorhall Orphanage by order of Jarl Ulfric. The young orphans time at Honorhall Orphanage was less than spectacular. Although he got along pretty well with the other children, it was the headmistress that made his life impossible to endure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrelod The Kind was a grinchy, old Nord woman, bitter about spending her entire life taking care of her  \"little guttersnipes\" as she would call them. She was ruthless, and tolerated very little from the poor children who were unfortunate enough to be in her care. Awaiting the children at Honorhall were nightly beatings and beratings, with Grelod often serving extra beatings to those who may have shirked their duties during the day. Perhaps the worst thing about cruel, old Grelod, was her policy barring any child of Honorhall Orphanage from be adopted, ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Aventus didn't take very well to his situation. He went from being an only child and having all the attention he craved from his sweet mother, to being just another riff-raff under jurisdiction of an evil, twisted mad woman. Much to the horror of the other children, Aventus swore revenge by means of the Dark Brotherhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne fateful evening, as Grelod lay in her bed, her copy of The Pig Children in hand, young Aventus managed to escape, with the help of Grelods assistant, Constance Michelle. Though she assisted him with the intention of him signaling the guards to the cruel horrors that take place in the orphanage, Aventus took the opportunity to flee Riften, leaving Honorhall forever a distant memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so tired...\" Aventus called out, still stabbing the flesh before him viciously, imagining it to be the nasty, old woman. \"Please... How long must I do this? I keep praying Night Mother! Why won't you answer me?\" Aventus kept hacking away, just as the ritual demanded. When he had all but given up, he suddenly felt his blood run cold, as an ominous whisper filled his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet child....\" The raspy voice whispered into the young lads ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It brings me great sadness that my own children have forsaken thee... They have given way to greed over values.... Mocking Sithis with their treason...\" The voice had a deep hiss  to it, similar to a nirnroot plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your contract has not been pursued due to the down payment seeming... lacking... For Sithis however, a soul to fill The Void is payment enough...\" the voice continued to hiss into Aventus' ear, the boy remaining eerily still the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As compensation, I would like to grant you the role of listener. With this, Sithis will also grant upon you the power to fulfill your contract on your own.\" This puzzled the young boy, who was not nearly strong enough to wield a two-handed sword, let alone survive the trip to Riften a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how would I do that?!\" Aventus snapped, clearly a little upset that all his efforts to contact the Night Mother had been useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How far would I make it before I am torn apart by a bear, or maybe one of those spriggans? What should I do? I'm just a poor orphan! All I've got is this rusty old dagger! Am I to kill Grelod with a case of rockjoint?\" Aventus screamed in anger, before breaking out in tears, knowing he'd have no choice but to return to Honorhall shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sweet, little child... fear not... your new family will see to it that you be given the proper equipment...\" That is the last thing Aventus heard the voice saying before it suddenly became a tangible object and forced it's way into the young child's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHH!\" Aventus screamed out in pain, as he found himself floating mid-air, a strong current running through him as though he had been the victim of a lightning bolt spell. This torture lasted for about 2 seconds before Aventus it suddenly stopped, dropping poor Aventus violently onto the floor below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining his senses, he looks down at his hands before noticing a strange glow coming from the both of them. Though he never learnt any spells himself, he knew all too well what these glows were! The Night Mother had blessed the child with magic! Before the child had a chance to try the spells out, the Night mother resumed her speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mighty listener... Sithis and I bestow upon thee the power of a deity of size. You are to use it as you see fit... We only ask of you one thing in return... You are to travel to the Falkreath sanctuary and to eliminate all members... This needn't be done right away, as you have revenge of a more... personal... nature to attend to. You musn't wait too however, as they have invoked the wrath of Sithis and he is eager to feast on their souls... we will speak again one the purge is complete... happy hunting...\" With that, the voice disappeared. Strangely enough, this time around the voice seemed to come from within, and no longer as a whisper in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever being one to have fortune on his side, Aventus was in complete disbelief at the situation that just unfolded before his very eyes, not even trying out his new tomes until 30 minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Dark Brotherhood! Can't even kill one old lady! Like I am supposed to believe I've been granted the power to control size! Not even the highest ranking wizards of the Mages College or the Dragonborn hold such powers! Probably gave me some stupid ice spell or something! Might as well use it to put out the candles...\" With that, Aventus fired his spell at a lit candle. As the spell shot from the young boys palm, Aventus knew it wasn't a simple ice spell when it shot out a deep purple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the magical field enveloped the candle, young Aventus watched in awe as the candle multiplied before him, until it stood slightly taller than him. Knowing now that the Night Mother was not bluffing, a malevolent grin formed on the boys face as he knew he could finally get his revenge on all the people who had wronged him. Thinking of who he should pay a visit to first, Aventus decides... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He set out of the Aretino house and into the freezing streets of Windhelm. He rubbed his hands over his bare arms trying to warm him up. He cast a backwards glance at his former home, wiping the tears from his eyes before saying softly: \"Don't worry mom..I'll be okay..from now on!\" He turned around and nearly collided with a large man in iron armor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, e-excuse me...\" Aventus stammered, this man was quite intimidating. \"You the kid who's been performing the Black Sacrament?\" The man asked, Aventus' blood ran cold...how did he know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice of the Night Mother echoed in the boy's ears: \"This man is the Dragonborn....he is trustworthy...and has a part to play in Skyrim's fate...should you spare him...you shall be rewarded by him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAventus Aretino's mouth fell open as he looked at the man with awe, \"U-Um...\" Aventus wasn't sure what to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should stay away from that child, Dragonborn! He is cursed, he is!\" A citizen of Windhelm yelled from across the street, picking up a rock and throwing it at Aventus Aretino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo both the young boy and the villager's surprise, with lightning speed the Dragonborn's sword was out and the rock was deflected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He protected me....the legendary Dragonborn protected me!\"</i> Aventus thought, it seems his luck really WAS turning around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonborn pointed his sword at the villager, \"I think I'll take my chances...unlike you I'm not so cowardly that I would torment a child over such nonsense.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mad! You're all mad!\" The villager ran away in fear, after casting one look over his shoulder he ran around the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, come with me and we'll get you something to eat and some warmer clothes...\" The armored man declared to Aventus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...you are not going to turn me in to the guards?\" Aventus asked suspiciously. \"I'd rather not discuss it here, too many nosy interlopers. Besides...you seem hungry...I can hear your stomach from here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Aventus' stomach growled and he nodded weakly..following the armored man in to an inn which was rich with the smell of fresh food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Aventus was ravenously stuffing his face with meat and potatoes as if he'd not eaten in a week..and from what the Dragonborn had heard of Honorhall that may have been true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what happened in that house? Why did you perform the ritual?\" The Dragonborn asked quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAventus Aretino swallowed a mouthful of potatoes and burped a bit. \"I uh....wanted to kill Grelod the Kind. She's horrible to me and the other orphans, she beats us and makes us feel like we're worthless! Everyone's so miserable there...it isn't fair! She even keeps us from getting adopted!\" Aventus gripped his fork and spoon tightly in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAventus decided to take the Nightmother's word or it..after all she seemed trustworthy to him. \"The Nightmother spoke to me, she made me...a deity of size. I can control the size of anything! I bet I could even be a bigger giant than the ones you see in the wild!\" Aventus was now acting excited, the Dragonborn noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful young lad would look up to the Dragonborn, expecting to see the man's eyes wide with horror or a scowl of dissapproval...instead he saw sympathy and admiration. \"You are quite a brave young lad, most boys your age wouldn't have been able to stomach this sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take you back to Riften....you do the deed. And once things have blown over I'll adopt you and take you back to my home in Whiterun.\" The Dragonborn said kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAventus was over the moon, this had been the best day ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived in Riften under the cover of night, Aventus was snuck back inside Honorhall by Constance Michelle. Aventus said goodbye to the Dragonborn, thanking him for his kindness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConstance Michelle put Aventus to bed, leaving the room after telling the boy goodnight. \"You've had quite the adventure, eh?\" She teased before blowing out the candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while after Constance had left for the night...Grelod the Kind entered Aventus' room, locking it behind her. Aventus was ready however, as she stood over his bed, with a club in hand. \"The ungrateful snot returns! I'm going to give you a beating you'll NEVER forget!\" Grelod snarled and raised the club overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAventus pointed at her...purple energy blasting her...instantly shrinking her down to the size of an ant on the floor.</span></div></div>",

Looking up at the the titanic young boy laying in his bed, Grelod could make out a grin of malevolence on his massive face. She knew he would achieve his retribution today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving Grelod a single moment to come to terms with her situation, Aventus hopped out from beneath the covers, and stomped over to tiny Grelod, who stood trembling helplessly on ground before him. As the revenge-fixated deity approached her frail form, the odor of a young adventurers foot overtook all her senses. The smell emanating from the child's foot was ungodly, to say the least. Grelod would have called it akin to a draugr den, if she would be around long enough to tell her story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look over there, if it isn't a little ant scurrying along!\" Aventus teased, ensuring he took as long as possible to reach Grelod, enjoying the build up of suspense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry ant, you won't find what you're looking for here! Grelod never feeds us, so you won't find any crumbs!\" Aventus continued making his way over to Grelod, making sure to bring his foot down with exaggerated force for every step. Grelod, meanwhile, was frozen on the floor in complete horror. She could only watch as the giant, stinky-footed boy made his way over to her weak form on the rough wooden flooring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only moments to spare before the giant sole looming before her would overtake her and crush her out of existance, Grelod manages to pull her legs from muscular dystrophy and took off running as fast as her old knees could take her. Unfortunately for her, she was an elderly woman who simply didn't have the physical prowess to outrun a boy over 1000 times her size. Still running for her life, Grelod watches as the shadow of the enormous foot casts itself down all around her, reminding her that her fate is inescapable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe odor of eidar cheese becomes painfully apparent, as the soft, fleshy sole of the young deity came down on the tiny woman, merging her into all the grime accumulated from a hard day of life in Skyrim. Just as she thought her torture was over, and her body would give way under the godly foot, she saw a golden aura develop around her, as her wounds closed before her eyes. That guttersnipe was casting healing spells on her! Plopping himself down on the ground, Aventus turns his sole over, looking down on the poor bug-woman squashed beyond comprehension to his disgusting sole. He lets out a hardy laugh, knowing Grelod probably wishes she had given the children in her care more bathing privileges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha! Did you think I'd let you off that easily, you filthy old crone? Nope! Unfortunately for you, I met the Dragonborn who taught me some pretty awesome healing spells! I can keep you around for as long as I want!\" Aventus teased down at the woman, practically indistinguishable from the rest of the dead skin and toe jam that accumulated in his fur boots on the long walk over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeling the ant-sized woman from the sole of his moist sole, he held her by the collar between two fingertips while slowly bringing her to his face, giving her a sense of how small she actually was in comparison. When he finally held her before his face, the young divine boomed down to her, with a huge grin on his face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you see how powerless you truly are, I say its high time we begin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Raising his plump right boyfoot above the still trembling Grelod, he took his time flexing his bulbous toes and wiggling them teasingly...all while he lowered it down upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at yourself! You're so puny compared to my foot. You truly are nothing, you never amounted to much anyhow though!\" Aventus Aretino snapped before his foot touched down upon the elderly crone's body..Aventus Aretino had made sure to align his foot to where the old hag's face would be tucked neatly into his first toe crevice on his right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrelod's face sunk into the soft and grime filled crevice, Aretino's plump toes flanking either sides of her face. She felt a tear roll down her cheek at this humiliation and how helpless she was before one of these filthy urchins. Speaking of filth, Aventus' toes were LOADED with reeking funk and black goo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this is what the grown-ups call IRONY isn't it?\" Aventus laughed, his voice a loud rumble to her ears. \"What I mean by that is...ya never let us take nice hot baths very often. And now look at you, you're getting what you deserve you nasty old hag!\" Aventus licked his lips in a predatory way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis actually sparked an idea in the young orphan's head, glancing over to his boots on the floor, a wicked grin formed on his face as he reached down and grabbed his right boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoisting his foot onto his lap and quickly snatching Gredol up, he shrank her back down to mere insect size...however he was careful not to have her be an ant once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've just found your final resting place....well...once I get tired of you.\" Aventus grinned smugly and began to explain. \"I'm gonna stuff your withered old body into my toe crevice where you'll be nice and snug. And I'm gonna sleep with these boots on, and I'm sure things'll be in an uproar tomorrow morning...so I'll end up getting up and walking around with you in there. You're gonna wish for death when I'm done with you...but I won't let you die yet....I'll keep healing you over and over!\" Aventus roared with wicked laughter, as Gredol whimpered with terror as she was deposited deep into his big toe crevice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night!\" Aventus popped both his boots on, making sure to pull his blanket on up to his chin to assure his feet would be baked by morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAventus Aretino drifted off to sleep, a contented smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the orphans were eating breakfast and chatting to one another. \"Did you hear, Aventus? The old witch is missing!\" Hroar said excitedly to Aventus at the table. Aventus smirked, \"Oh really? That's good news!\" He gave his toes a nice wiggle in his stuffy boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I do hope she's suffering or dead!\" Samuel said dreamily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAventus let out a laugh, \"I wouldn't worry about that! But anyway guys, I met the Dragonborn!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after breakfast and chores were finished...Aventus' feet got sweatier and raunchier and Aventus got more and more of a power high knowing every drop of sweat, every newly formed bit of toejam, was making his enemy's life a total hellscape. He routinely healed her, Gredol had truly crossed the wrong boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConstance approached him shortly after, \"Aventus, your friend requested you meet him in town today.\" </span></div></div>",

With that, Aventus stepped outside into the warm, Riften sun, his tiny captive baking from a night in between his raunchy toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery step the ginormous boy took re-affirmed poor Grelods' fate, as she lay helpless between the mountainous, gunk filled appendages of this deviant rascal. From all angles, the secretions from the toejam that was spewn all around her ensured she was unable to free herself from the musky prison. With only her head still free, Grelod was completely powerless to the young god Aventus. She would be forced to endure the tortures this twisted riff-raff had in store for her until he grew tired and decided to end her under his cheesy, powerful sole. She lay defeated, crying whatever little tears her dehydrated little body could muster while forcibly basking in the most potent odor her old nose has ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Aventus and Michelle arrived at the door of the Bee and Barb, they went their seperate ways as Aventus walked to the second floor to meet up with the Dragonborn in the room he had rented for the day. Eager to share his escapades with his new friend, Aventus took no time blabbing the poor Dragonborns ear to Oblivion about all the plans he had in store for the tiny witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't slipped these boots off all night! I don't even know how many healing spells I've casted on her so far!\" Aventus bragged, wiggling his slimy toes excitedly in his boot, treasuring the feeling of the mean, old hag slowly merging with his vile toe jam, as helpless as he felt when he was under her care. Maybe even more so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I've got an idea!\" The Dragonborn chimed in, feeling particularly vengeful towards the old crone for how badly she had treated these poor, orphaned children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we were to cast a light flame spell on your boots? That would really get your sweat glands flowing!\" The Dragonborn suggested, eager to watch Grelod suffer at this young boys raunchy feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, wouldn't that damage my boots? I haven't got any money to replace them if they catch fire...\" Aventus said solemnly, it really did sound like a great idea, but Aventus was simply too poor to take any chances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense! With Grelod out of the picture, I can officially take you under my care. You needn't worry about such petty trifles anymore! Once I deal with this dragon crisis, we'll move into Proudspire Manor, and you'll have all the pairs of boots you desire! Now place your feet on my lap child, and lets ensure together that Grelod never treats another child the way she treated you!\" With that, the young boy agreed and placed his tired feet on the orchish-clad lap of the Dragonborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrelod lay in her toe jam prison, screaming out pathetic cries that would never be heard by anyone. Just as she thought she would finally die from dehydration, she suddenly felt the familiar embrace of a healing spell, bringing all her vitals back to normal. Humiliated beyond belief, Grelod felt the barrage of tears rolling from her newly hydrated eyes. From outside, Grelod could hear the familiar sound of a fire being lit. Before she had a moment to deduce what was going on, she felt the temperature rapidly rise, her tears evaporating nearly as fast as they were being produced. With the sudden influx of heat developing within the boot of this mischevious young boy, it wasn't long before Grelod was near drowning in the little urchins footsweat. Incapable of any movement, Grelod was forced to watch as a mixture of dead skin and dirt from the toes which dominated her view began to coat her tiny form. She screamed in agony as the rancid toe goo slowly absorbed her entire body, leaving just enough room around her face in order to breathe. With nothing else to do, she lay defeated for the umpteenth time since the boys return to the orphanage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Aventus and the Dragonborn grew bored of their torture, they decided to head off to Honorhall to finalize the adoption, not before hungry, young Aventus stuffed his little face with a sweetroll however. Ready to take on the responsibilities of parenthood, the Dragonborn and Aventus set off, however, what will become of poor Grelod? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aventus and the Dragonborn arrived back at Honorhall, much to the awe of the other children at finding out Aventus wasn't spinning a tale. The Dragonborn was burdened with the ins and outs regarding making the adoption official with Constance Michelle, while Aventus Aretino went to say his goodbyes to his fellow orphans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll miss you!\" Runa Fair-Shield sniffled tearfully as she hugged the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You'll come visit us, right?\" Francois Beaufort asked Aventus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young god nodded, \"Yeah, I promise! I'm sure my new pa won't mind letting me come to visit you all. But don't worry, now that Grelod is gone...you'll all be adopted!\" Aventus assured the orphans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you really think so?\" Samuel inquired warily, earning a nod from the boy deity. \"I know it! By the way, where's Hroar?\" Aventus noticed his best mate wasn't in the group who came to see him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's packing!\" Francois answered cheerily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-? He got adopted too?!\" Aventus was a little sad that he wouldn't get to come visit his best friend, but it was just proof that Grelod's influence was gone, that adoptions were happening so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You don't know?\" Runa asked in a confused tone and was answered by Aventus shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I don't think we should tell you if nobody else has....but ya should go see Hroar, he was just busting to tell you!\" Francois said as the rest of the kids giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAventus nodded and turned to wander into Hroar's room, where he found his best friend frantically packing his clothes and what meager items he had been permitted during Grelod's reign. The young god knew he was going to reveal his secret to Hroar the moment he walked in, how could he not tell his best friend that he was a god and had their cruel tormentor suffering in his toe grime right now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHroar heard the door close and looked up, grinning at his best pal. \"Hey there! Did you hear?! We're being adopted together! The Dragonborn is so great!\" Hroar declared excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAventus was stunned, the Dragonborn must've known how inseparable they were....and arranged to adopt them both. He felt tears of overwhelming happiness start to form in his eyes and wiped them away with his arm...he hadn't experienced such kindness since his dear mother died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back up at Hroar with a smile and sat down on his buddy's bed, \"That's great news! But I have something to show you...\" Aventus smirked darkly and began to pry off his right boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHroar looked confused until the boot came off with a disgusting squelch and his best pal's steamy and rancid foot was revealed. \"Ahhhh....that's good.\" Aventus sighed and wiggled his plump toes, Hroar could see the incredible build up of grime around his toes, his toes had practically turned black and his crevices were overflowing and oozing with jam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuugh! Come on, that's not funny!\" Hroar laughed and pinched his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not finished yet, silly!\" Aventus laughed as he propped his foot onto his left knee, filthy sole facing Hroar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look closely...see her?\" Aventus said with a smug grin. Hroar peered at the gross boy foot, and his eyes widened as before his eyes...Grelod grew a small bit and was shown to be adhered to Aventus' thick sole with her face glued between Aventus' gunky toes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No way....that's....that's....HILARIOUS!\" Hroar fell over laughing with glee. \"Hahahaha! Yep! I actually performed the Black Sacrament and became a Deity of Size. So I guess your new brother is an almighty god now. You're pretty lucky.\" Aventus jokingly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You're so amazing!\" Hroar said in awe, inflating Aventus' already sky high ego. \"But...I think you should end her...and I want to watch. You should tell her off and make her feel as low as she always made us feel...before you drown her as a speck in your toe sludge.\" Hroar said seriously.</span></div></div>",

She was the one who never let us bathe or eat, and it is because of her I contacted the Dark Brotherhood and got these powers!\" Aventus added, eyes still peeled on the insect desperately trying to claw her way free from the rancid build-up between his slimy toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHroar laughed as he witnessed Grelods plight on his new brothers foot. Having been through much of the same experience as Aventus, he knew the miserable old wench was getting exactly as she deserved. Bringing his face much closer to the foul smelling feet than he would have liked, he hawked back all the mucus in his throat, before shooting it all forward, making sure it landed squarely between Aventus' toes, directly on top of the hag who had made his life so miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EWWWWW\" Aventus laughed in disgust, wiggling his toes visciously, making sure to coat Grelod in the thick, vile secretion formed by his brothers foul mouth. He had never expected Hroar, who was normally a pretty nice and fun-loving child, to have been capable of being so sadistic. He was happy that Grelod would see how much better things were around Honorhall without her, before her slow and torturous death at his unkempt feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Grelod was already having a difficult time staying afloat among the pool of toe jam oozing from between her young, former charges horrendous toes. Clawing furious at the rancid smelling sludge that has overtaken her entire body, she finally makes its out from the odourous mountain that would put even a Falmer den to shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, as the light filled her eyes, she was greeted by another one of the dirty, little guttersnipes, Hroar, grinning sadistically down at her mangled form. Knowing begging would be useless, she closed her eyes and accepted whatever cruel fate the boys had in store for her. Unfortunately, they weren't nearly done. With her eyes closed, she couldn't even prepare as the terribly warm ball of saliva and mucus absorbed her tiny form, trapping her further into the pit of grime and funk between the mountainous canyon. Although the mucus managed to clog most of the foot smell, it let it just enough to still make poor Grelods nose hairs burn, while also rendering her completely immobile in a ball of jelly like substance that permeated every grove in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! With all that mucus around her, she looks like a tiny bacteria!\" Hroar chuckled heartily, no longer caring for the cloud of foot stink that invaded his senses at the same time. That is when a lightbulb went off in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what if we make her the size of a bacteria? Then she would really feel as small as she made us feel!\" Hroar suggested, knowing she probably wouldn't last too long at such a minute size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! That's rich! Alright, here goes nothing!\" Aventus says, as the purple energy shoots from is palms, hitting its target down on his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrelod watched as that all too familiar purple glow hit her, before enveloping the mucus all around her. At first, she was in shock, as it seem fate finally favoured her and gave her a chance! The mucus, however, only acted as a basic ward spell, not taking long to succumb to the power of the young boys much more powerful spell. As the spell finally reached her, she again watched helplessly as the mountains of dead skin and grime, accumulated from her cruel ruling as headmistress, slowly expanded around her before as she relentlessly attempted to stay afloat, to no avail. Before long, Grelod was just another speck of grime among a sea of rotting toe jam, smaller than most of the flakes of dead skin among it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now what?\" Aventus said, knowing he may have shrunk Grelod a bit too much. There was no way he could ever find her at this size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, not our problem! We've got to get to our new home!\" Hroar laughed, knowing that Grelod would never trouble them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe residents of Riften never did find out what happened to Grelod, most assuming Aventus was successful in contacting the Dark Brotherhood. With Grelod gone, the remaining children at Honorhall quickly found themselves new homes, with loving families. Constance Michelle even adopted little Runa herself! The two now live peacefully in their home, at what used to be Honorhall orphanage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAventus never thought of Grelod again, after that and he certainly never bothered to check if she was still alive. All that mattered now was his new life as a deity of size. Looking forward, he knows he has many adventures ahead of him with his new family. Hearing the Riften gates close behind them, the newly formed trio decides to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But no matter,  she got what she deserved I trust you boys took care of that?\" Their new father smiled at Aventus knowingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAventus grinned smugly and gave his still rancid toes a nice wiggle in his boots, \"Yes, of course she did! She's nothing but a germ in my toes...adding to my godly filth!\" Aventus declared with his chest puffed out. This drew laughter from Hroar and their new father, who knew all the grisly details. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked for a bit until they came upon a carriage, their father paid the driver to take them to Whiterun, he couldn't expect his newly adopted children to walk all the way to Whiterun from Riften after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeated in the back of the carriage, the two children began to grow hungry, Hroar most of all since he hadn't been treated to hearty meals like Aventus had with the Dragonborn. Reaching into his pack and pulling out some bread and Eider Cheese, the Dragonborn handed them to Hroar and Aventus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you papa!\" The two boys chorused, chuckling as the man blushed. \"I'll...have to become used to that....\" He cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'll like Whiterun, plenty of life and things to do...and many children your own age.\" Their newly appointed father told them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing a bite of bread, Aventus grinned devilishly: \"I still need to pay a visit to Whiterun...I want to crush the city....and the Jarl especially.\" The boy said darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Really? Can I come?\" Hroar eagerly asked. \"Just try not to get yourself hurt, son...and promise me you'll take care of your brother?\" The Dragonborn said seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAventus scoffed arrogantly, \"Nothing can hurt me, but yes I'll be careful father...and I'll make sure Hroar is taken care of.\" Aventus made a baby face at Hroar and ruffled the boy's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heeey!\" Hroar shook the laughing boy off of him. Their father chuckled, \"I suppose the safest place he could be would be with his divine brother.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden ear splitting roar broke this joyful exchange, their father sat up straight and began scanning the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?!\" Hroar yelled, clamping his hands over his ears. Aventus and Dragonborn were able to hear the deep voice speak to them, but to everyone else including their terrified driver it sounded like a horrifying rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Dovahkiin! You would ally yourself with a Divine who is hardly out of his shell?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAventus knew what this strange voice belonged to before he could see the creature itself...something in him just knew..and it helped that he had heard legends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Driver! Drive them to Whiterun! I will pay you extra coin!\" Their father said to the driver. \"Are you mad!? It's a dragon! It will devour us!\" The driver shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not after you or the boys! But you'd better pray they are delivered safely, or a dragon shall be the least of your worries!\" To the two boys' astonishment, their new father leaped out of the carriage and unsheathed his greatsword and shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!\" Hroar called after the man, just as the dragon split the clouds open, flying directly towards his target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Fo, Krah, Diin!</i>\" They heard their father Shout, Frost Breath hitting the dragon as it soared toward him at a steadily slowing pace. It's scales glowed hot and it opened its maw, blasting hot flames down at their papa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAventus watched in awestruck terror as the Dragonborn brought up his shield in time to block the flames. The dragon landed and swiped it's claws at the hero, grazing the shield and leaving deep scratches in it's surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, driver!\" Aventus yelled in the terrified man's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I will! Besides, your father wanted you taken to Whiterun!\" The driver shouted over his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait! Please!\" Hroar pleaded with the man, who sighed and pulled the carriage in around the side of a nearby tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAventus shot off like a lightning bolt out of the carriage, Hroar calling for him to come back...only to realize his best friend was rocketing up to an even bigger size than the dragon itself!</span></div></div>",
