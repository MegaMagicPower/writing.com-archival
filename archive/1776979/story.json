            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's Wednesday, and somehow you've drawn the short straw again, so you're stuck at Club XY, serving drinks to the handful of people coming in to dance.  So far it's been an incredibly slow night, and looking at your watch, you see it's not even midnight.  Hoping to alleviate the impending boredom, you mix yourself a midori sour (staff drinking policies at the Club are rather lax).  Normally you wouldn't drink at work, but today was a terrible day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up this morning with a splitting headache (which was strange, since you NEVER got headaches) you staggered out of bed, eyes still unfocused from sleep.  Moving awkwardly through the tiny studio, you tripped over an unseen obstacle, and despite flailing your arms comically to restore your balance, fell onto the foot of Michael's bed.  The shock woke you up, and you realized that, thankfully, your roomie was still out.  It was awkward enough living in the same bedroom with a straight guy without you throwing yourself on top of him, especially since he had just moved in the week before. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith your head still reeling, you made your way to the bathroom, and took a nice hot shower.  Unfortunately, it did nothing to cure the pounding headache, and with a desperate prayer, you clawed open the medicine cabinet to find... nothing.  Cursing, you went to the kitchen and pulled open the cabinets, hoping that Michael might have grabbed something in the last shopping trip.  Just as you found a bottle of something that looked like it should help, you heard a key in the lock, and realized that you were still completely naked!  Unfortunately, you hesitate a moment too long, and Michael opens the door to a full view of your man-meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, Andrew, that's sick!\" He cried, covering his eyes. \"That is SO not OK.  I thought you were gay, not a voyeur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael, I am so sorry,\" you replied, making a mad dash to the bathroom.  \"I'll just throw on some clothes.  I just... I just forgot to put on a towel. I'm not used to having a roomie yet, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, you don't have to.  I'm not gonna live with some crazy nudist fag.  Besides, I've been seeing you eyeing me when you think I'm not looking.  I'm outta here.  I'll pick my stuff up when you're in class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he slammed the door shut and left you to your headache.  To make matters worse, you were late for your first class, and forgot to bring the essay you had been assigned.  Your Nazi of a teacher even made you -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrew. Hey, Andreeeeew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap out of your reverie and notice that Jamie has turned up. He's been a friend of yours since your first year of college, and you're pretty sure that he has the hots for you, but you haven't had the balls to ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to actually serve the customers if you're hoping to get the big tips, buddy,\" Jamie says. Noticing your glass, he adds, \"You OK there?  I've never seen you drink here, which, come to think of it, is kind of funny, since all the other guys do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a crappy day.  I kinda lost my roomie, and then I got kicked out of my history class, which means I'll have to take it over AGAIN next semester... But I shouldn't be bitching, I'm the bartender - you're supposed to bitch at me, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, I always get that backwards.  Well, if you want my sob story, here goes. There's this g-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's as far as Jamie gets when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

You make your way to the door and carefully poke your head out, and you see that Harry is definitely not alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main bouncer for XY, Harry is a mountain of a man, standing at roughly 6'7\" and at least 280 pounds of muscle and a fair amount of chub.  He's completely bald and has a habit of wearing low cut, tight shirts that show off his pecs and ample belly, as well as a fair amount chest hair.  His enormous lips are habitually curved into a smile, though at the moment they form a grimace as he wrestles back his hostile attacker while blood drips from a deep slash across his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWielding half of a broken bottle is a man in his twenties, obviously piss-drunk, shouting profanities and trying hard to score a hit on Harry.  Standing at (compared to Harry) only 6'2\" and of average physique, the blond-haired youth is fairly outmatched. Currently each of his arms are held in Harry's vice-like hands, but he's trying his best to squirm his way out.  Behind him are a group of preppy looking students, all very drunk, shouting \"Fags should die!\" and \"Get him, Rich!\"  A couple are looking rather nervous about the developments, but don't look like they're going to be doing much to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly decide to:</span></div></div>",

Get out of here - I've called the cops, and they're going to be here in just a few minutes! If you don't feel like getting arrested, I suggest you get the fuck out of here NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, sirens start to blare not far in the distance. Spooked, the group of boys start to move away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Richard, let's get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill caught in Harry's grip, Richard pays them no heed, but struggles to get close enough to cut Harry's face.  The other boys glance back, but as the sirens approach quickly fade into the shadows of an alleyway. Just as the patrol cars pull around the corner, the youth manages to slip from Harry's hands and slice at his eyes. Luckily, Harry lets go of Richard, off-balancing him, so the bottle only grazes the tip of his nose, and then the prep falls to the ground with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, kid. You better stay down there if you know what's good for you,\" says the officer as he steps out of his car. Turning to you and Harry, he says, \"Hey guys, you alright? Shit, he got you good Harry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a scratch, really, Robert. Just throw him in the drunk-tank and tell him off for us, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A scratch? Right. Alright, asswi- er, I mean, punk, time to learn some manners.\" Robert takes Richard away and puts him in the car. \"You sure you're alright there? It looks pretty bad. I'll call an ambulance for you, it's no biggie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No. It's fine, it's not as bad as it looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert shrugs and waves to you. You wave back and watch as he drives off. You turn to Harry:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as bad as it looks, my ass. You're completely white!\" It was true, he was turning very pale and looked a bit faint. You stepped over to him and threw his arm around your back. \"Come on, I'll help you in and get you bandaged up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Jamie steps out of the club. \"Oh... You...\" He stares at you for a moment, then glances at Harry. \"Holy crap! Look at all that blood! I... I gotta go...\" He stumbles away, looking slightly green.  You knew that Jamie had an aversion to blood, but you never realized it was that bad. Pushing that out of your mind, you grunt as you help Harry into the club - he's REALLY heavy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, it's completely dead; it seems that everyone deserted when it looked like there was going to be trouble.  You get Harry over to one of the booths and lie him down, then run over and shut the door and down the music - may as well close for the night at this rate, you figure. Grabbing the first-aid kit, you head back to Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, this really doesn't look good. Why don't you go to the hospital?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No hospitals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you're afraid of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his pallor you can see a tinge of red come to his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, brother. Well, you'll just have to put up with me, then. Thankfully I've done this kind of stuff before - my big brother was always getting into fights and I always had to patch him up. Though honestly, this might even need stitches...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gingerly pull off Harry's shirt, revealing his full hairy stomach and chest. You quickly work to staunch the bleeding, then disinfect and bandage the cut.  You crawl on top of Harry, there not being enough room to work otherwise, careful to not disturb the bandage on his chest, and crouch over his face to look at his nose. You feel Harry's warm breath on your face and inhale the earthy scent. You feel a bulge in your pocket and turn towards it guiltily, but realize it's not a boner, but a bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the pain meds from this morning! Perfect. Here, Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no medicine, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to</span></div></div>",

You both quickly get more excited, and you grind your now rock hard cock into this mountain of man's belly, while at the same time letting your ass stroke and slide along his apparently huge dick, eliciting moans of pleasure and longing from deep within Harry's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you strip yourself of your clothes, and drag off Harry's pants, breaking the kiss only briefly to disentangle yourself from your shirt. Clearly straining through his thong and soaking it in generous amounts of precum, the bouncer's huge, fat member is surrounded by short dark fur, and an incredibly musky scent exudes from the whole area, especially around Harry's jawbreaker-sized balls.

You are quickly coated in saliva, and assaulted by wave after wave of Harry's hot, meaty breath. Incredibly horny, and ignoring the possible implications of your environment, you peel off your underwear and start to jack off like mad, continually being caressed and tasted by the gargantuan tongue, while saliva from the maw's glands drips down onto you in a steady drip of heat and viscous goo. You find yourself lifted up and gently pressed to the roof of the bouncer's mouth, and taking advantage, rub your swollen member over it. It feels fucking amazing, and you instantly shoot your load everywhere, giving yourself and the tongue another coating on top of the saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Harry realizes that his partner has somehow mysteriously disappeared, but still tastes you on his tongue.

Perplexed by this and by your sudden absence, Harry looks around and realizes that he is in Club XY, during open hours, and almost completely naked. Not an unusual state for some of the patrons, but definitely inexcusable for the main bouncer. Quickly donning his clothing, Harry gingerly tested his movement and found that the wounds already felt much better. He gathers up your clothing and tucks them safely behind the bar. Taking one last look around, Harry shrugs and moves back outside to his post, feeling slighted and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as your cum hits Harry's tongue, the giant swallows, carrying gallons of saliva and you down toward his throat. In some of your darker fantasies you had dreamt of being inside another man so completely, but in reality you knew this was impossible, and deadly, regardless. Now, it seems, the impossible had come true, and you pray that you find a way to make it through the ordeal alive. These thoughts flash through you in an instant, and you determine that no matter the outcome, you had damn well better enjoy the experience!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the esophagus and are filled with warmth as the long, strong tube massages you down its length. You can hear squelches and burbles from the stomach you are about to enter, and even feel and hear the steady heartbeat of the man who has devoured you. After what feels like ages, but was only moments, you feel the sphincter of the stomach SCHLORP about your legs. The next beat, you have been sucked down to your armpits, and with a finally squeeze, are deposited into the stomach, slipping down wall of the J-shaped organ onto the soft, spongy \"floor\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's stomach is empty, and surprisingly large, at least from your perspective, as it seems to be about 60 feet in height - there's no way to get back out the way you came in. Already you can feel the tingle on your skin as the stomach's enzymes do their work and attempt to add you as another layer of Harry's chub. The stomach, seeming to sense your presence, begins to churn, keeping you from getting your footing. The warmth and smell of the chamber is nearly unbearable, the heat soaking into your very core, making you drowsy. You</span></div></div>",

You decide that the best course of action is to get through the rest of Harry's digestive system as quickly as possible, no easy task considering from your perspective his intestines are likely to be over a third of a mile long! Unable to get to your feet thanks to the bouncer's stomach eager massage, you are forced to crawl on your hands and knees along the slick, hot surface of Harry's undulating gut. Desperately trying to remember more about the human digestive system, you feel for the tight sphincter that will lead you deeper inside the bouncer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of climbing up a steep incline, slipping down often and getting coated in goo, you manage to reach the entrance to the intestines. At this point you are gasping for breath, the little oxygen that Harry had swallowed being nearly depleted. With a final burst of effort, you push your arms through the unaccommodating hole, and use the leverage to slowly squeeze your body through the tight, slimy pucker. With a squelch, you burst through the other end into an even hotter and smellier chamber... you've entered the big bouncer's bowels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShakily you stand up, only to be tossed down a long shaft as Harry's body responds to your presence and the wave-like motion of peristalsis knocks you off your feet, and deeper inside your unwitting captor.

Panicked, you try to roll around, and notice that you're inside a hot, damp place that reeks of ass.

Judging from the smell, you've managed to survive the trip, and are now in his rectum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unable to move your arms and legs, you crawl your way forward caterpillar-like, forced to press your head deeply into the walls of Harry's bowels, and inadvertently getting some of the slimy rectal juices in your mouth.

However, before you get the chance:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's another one, get him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of the students break off from the group and head towards you. One, standing at 6'4\" and about 200 pounds - a body-builder, this one, has his brown hair in a buzz cut. The other is about your height: 6' and average size; he sports a surfer's wavy hair. The big one moves quickly, despite his drunkeness, and grabs you from behind, locking your arms and legs. The surfer moves in and starts to throw hits clumsily. Unable to defend yourself of move, you have no choice but to just close your eyes as he beats you. He gets a strong blow to your solar plexus and you feel the wind go out of you, and you buckle over.  Still supported by buzz cut, your head merely droops, and the next hit gets you clean in the temple. Your head goes fuzzy from the lack of air and the trauma, and you black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken to the feeling of something cold on your face, and feel the world slowly come back into focus. Looking up, you see Jamie's face over you - you realize your head is in his lap, and he's pressing an ice-pad to your bruised temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, welcome back,\" he says, his voice somewhat wavering. \"You were out for a bit there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seemed like a good time for a nap,\" you reply. \"What happened? Is Harry-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering Harry's state, you jolt up, but your head swims and you fall back into Jamie's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's fine, though he's refusing to go to the hospital. The other guys are gone. I called the cops when you went out, and they showed up right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the few perks of the owner being the sheriff's son, I suppose. So the creeps got away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, but I think Harry told them what they looked like. I didn't even see them - they started to run the minute they heard sirens. Pussies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this uncharacteristic remark from Jamie makes you laugh, but you wince as you do - you're going to be sore all over for a couple days, it seems. Jamie smiles and turns away, looking troubled. You take the chance to look up at him. He actually is a looker, though not the type you'd usually go for. He's got the rather fey facial features stereotypical of a bottom and he's slim, if maybe on the scrawny side. With his brown eyes and matching short hair, he has a fairly approachable look to him, though he often has a tendency to look off into the distance. He turns back to you, and you quickly shift so he won't catch you staring. As you turn, you feel something dig into your side. You reach into your pocket and dig the offending object out - the bottle from this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perfect</i>, you think, <i>just what I needed, some pain meds.</i> You</span></div></div>",

You choose a random direction and stumble across the bed, tripping over some of the larger creases, and nearly losing your footing several times as you walk over the areas where your normal sized body had softened the mattress.

The gods only know how the two of you can get you back to normal, but you would feel better about someone knowing about your predicament, rather than you simply disappearing. And perhaps Michael would be sympathetic and help out, but even if not, he would certainly get you to someone who could keep you safe, like Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Jamie still makes you feel a little guilty, and you start as you realize that you were supposed to be meeting him at work this evening! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt just that moment, you hear a loud BZZZZZZBZZZZZZBZZZZZZ noise.

The giant foot finishes its descent and works its way towards you. You find yourself pinned under the foot, with only your head poking out from between your ex-roommates fuzzy largest and longest toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the shoe becomes much warmer, and you can feel that Michael's foot was already wet, a damp, musky layer of sweat is rubbing onto your body, and as you watch, a large glob of sweat pours slowly down the webbing of the toes and onto your face. Out of necessity and lust, you drink deeply of the sweat, tasting the pure masculinity, breathing in the scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour prison shifts slightly as Michael stands back up, and you are compressed into the shoe by the giant's 300-some pounds of fat and muscle. Fortunately, you are still able to breathe, but there's no way you'll be able to wiggle your way out from under him - unless you take the chance while he's walking, but that could land you underneath the foot entirely, and you would quickly be smothered, or simply crushed, neither of which appeals to you. Your last apparent option is to attempt to get Michael's attention somehow...</span></div></div>",

With a bit more wriggling you manage to get your arms free, but it's a tight fit and you're forced to wrap your arms back underneath each of Michael's toes. Meanwhile all this shifting and the delicious smells and tastes of Michael's foot and Etnies has made you hard as a rock again, and this is only made worse as Michael continues to walk around, his massive weight massaging your balls and cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caress the toes around you with your hands, and use the leverage to lean in closer to the foot.

Releasing the waistbands and letting the underwear squish you deeply into his crotch. The heat radiating from your ex-roommate's (now master's) swollen globes is overpowering, and the musk drives you mad with lust. You attempt to resist giving in to lust again, but quickly realize that there's nothing much else you can do, nor are you eager to displease your new master - he's certainly not the forgiving type!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set to work as well as you can, throwing your whole body into massaging the sweaty flesh engulfing you. You can tell that this is making Michael happy, as his cock begins to work its way down the cloth of your underwear prison, expanding and sliding down to trap you between its bulky mass and the balls you are busily pleasing. You continue working your hands and body against the cum-filled spheres, and slowly twist yourself so you can face the member behind you. After a bit of squirming and struggling, which makes your master's cock go completely rigid, you manage to turn enough to press your face into the swollen dick. You gingerly stick out your tongue, lapping along the broad expanse that is Michael's meat stick, amazed by how thick it is - you are barely able to stretch wide enough to grip the shaft with your arms, let alone wrap around it. Hugging as tightly as you can, you begin to hump against the cock, letting your body move up and down as Michael's foreskin wraps up and down the now dribbling cockhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael lets out a satisfied groan, and with this encouragement you nimbly flip yourself so your head meets your master's. You lap and lick voraciously, drinking in the ample precum that flows freely from Michael's slit, all the while working your body up and down, keeping a steady rhythm. You are thrown off for a moment as the world shifts - Michael seems to have sit down. Clambering back up, you get even closer to your master's dripping hole, and stick your tongue in, lapping in the masculine taste. This causes Michael to buck with pleasure, and you can tell that he's close. Fully aroused yourself, you stick your entire face into the engorged cock slit, humping Michael's cock for all you're worth. This pushes your master over the edge, and you feel the flesh around your face contract as gallons upon gallons of fresh cum rocket their way up from the giant's huge balls and blast into your eagerly awaiting mouth. The taste is indescribably delicious, salty and undeniably male. You buck one final time against the slowly softening member and blast your own load to drip its way down the cock, slowly sliding down and meeting your chest. <i>If this is what slavery to Michael is going to be like</i>, you think while panting, nestled deeply against the giant's balls, <i>then I'm happy being his little bitch.</i></span></div></div>",

Michael eyes you evilly. \"I'm pretty hungry after all this packing, and it's about time for a snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a start, you realize he's talking about you! Not satisfied to simply finish you off, Michael taunts you by bringing his hand up against his gut, smooshing you against it. \"You're going to be part of that soon enough,\" he says with a smirk. His speech vibrates his whole body, and the fat surrounding you jiggles and begins to smother you. Thankfully, the giant moves you away... only to lift off his shirt to expose his voluminous pale flab, and once again brings you against it, this time opening his fist and rubbing you along his vast hairless belly and chest. \"Mmmm, you feel pretty good on the outside of my stomach, I bet you'll feel even better on the inside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, he suddenly closes his fist around you again and lifts you to his round, pale face. You struggle and squirm against the grip, but it's completely futile, and you can only watch as Michael slowly, deliberately brings you to his mouth. As you approach his face, you try to at least get an arm free, in the hopes of grabbing the massive man's goatee, but Michael keeps his grip firm and puts his fist into his mouth, letting you go and snapping his jaws shut just as his hand retreats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land roughly on the giant's sopping wet tongue - apparently the thought of eating you has made this sadistic bastard drool. The giant toys with you, keeping his jaw locked, but moving his tongue around, making it impossible for you to gain your footing, especially with the coating of saliva. More and more of the hot fluid drips onto you and soon you're as soaked as the tongue. Michael lets the drool pool a bit more, then deftly navigates you underneath his tongue, trapping you in the increasingly deep pool of spittle that gathers there. Just as you fear you are about to drown in the giant's secretions, you feel a massive suction pull at you - your ex-roommate is swallowing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Michael's spiteful murmur surrounds and engulfs you as you are massaged down the massive man's esophagus. Your head smacks against something - the sphincter of the stomach - and you are quickly squished through and deposited into the massive chamber. You feel as Michael's hands knead and massage the organ from the outside, squishing you against the walls, and keeping you from any attempt at escape. The world seems to tilt crazily as Michael lays down on your bed, and you can feel a steady shaking and hear a distant thumping - the giant is jacking off after making a meal of you! He continues to knead his stomach with one hand as the other gets steadily faster. After a few more moments you can hear, and feel, Michael moan in pleasure as he cums wildly. This is your last sensation before the lack of oxygen causes you to black out.</span></div></div>",
