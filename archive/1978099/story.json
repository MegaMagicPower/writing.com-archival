As you approach the helicopter you see standing there was a soldier in combat fatigues with an M14 marksmen rifle and a large medical bag, \"you must be my unexpected passenger?\" you ask. \"Thats me. Sergeant Durrant\" he says holding out a hand, \"you plan on shooting anything from my bird with that?\" you ask pointing to the M14.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDurrant laughs, \"no to be honest I like using one of these \" he says pointing to one of the M240Bs mounted on the side of the BlackHawk., \"Well get snapped in we're taking off soon\" you tell him, he nods and climbs in the helicopter while you and the other three crew members run a check over the BlackHawk. After and hour of checking the systems you climb into the cockpit and start up the engines, fifteen minutes later and you were flying over the desert, \"whats that?\" asks the co-pilot pointing out the cockpit window, you follow his finger and see what looks like a person standing off in the distance. \"It looks like a person, but I thought this part of the desert was un-inhabited?\" you say confused, \"it is\" says Durrant on the headset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets go check it out, they may be lost\" you say turning towards the figure in the distance, but as you near the figure you see multiple warning lights blink on the instrument panel. Suddenly the BlackHawk gave a hard shudder and started flying erratically and dropping altitude, despite your best efforts the helicopter was still plummeting towards the ground, \"brace for a hard landing\" you yelled as you neared the sandy ground. The last thing you remember was someone screaming a name before crashing nose first into the ground, knocking you unconscious. When you come to you find yourself still strapped to your seat, you look to your left and see your co-pilot still there, you reach over and check his pulse: still beating, you look over your shoulder and see the two crew chiefs sprawled out on the floor and judging from the fact that they were still breath, also alive, but Durrant was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear faint footsteps outside, like someone walking in the sand, you reach down and unsnap your MP5K from your leg holster, pull on the charging handle and take aim out the door.

As you walk inside your two crew chiefs were looking the helicopter over for any defects, \"good to go?\" you ask, both crew chiefs gave you a thumbs up. You climb inside and begin the start up sequence for the main rotor, five minutes later you were rolling down the tarmac, an hour later you here flying at a steady speed over the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bryan take the stick for a minute\" you say to your co-pilot as you check your location on the NAV. \"Ok in an hour turn left 30 degrees and keep flying straight for another half hour and then we can begin testing to see if those techs fixed that tail rotor\" you say. Just before you begin the stress test on the new rotor a warning light appeared flashing, <i>WARN ROTOR FAIL</i> on the instrument panel, \"alright  we're turning around, Bryan try to find us a clear area if we need to make a hard landing\" you say to your co-pilot. \"OK there's a clearing about a mile from here\" says the co-pilot pointing on the NAV, you steer the BlackHawk toward it and for an hour you fight with the helicopter to keep it on course as it was veering left and right randomly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you had the BlackHawk flying at a height of about eight feet over a large clearing, \"alright on three bail\" you say, \"one...two....three! Go\" you shout. As soon as you shouted three, the two crew chiefs and co-pilot bailed out, but as you go to bail out you become snagged on something preventing you from bailing out. As you try to free yourself you see that the BlackHawk was nearing some trees, forcing you to pull up. You bring the helicopter back around in an attempt to try again, but before you could finish the turn there was an loud bang followed by the helicopter going into an out of control spin, the last thing you remember was the helicopter loosing altitude and then the sound of trees striking the nose before blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come to you find the BlackHawk laying on the forest floor in many pieces, with you still in the cockpit. You attempt to get out of your seat, but a sharp pain in your lower left abdomen area stops you, you look and see that a piece of the main rotor blades had broken off and stabbed you, literally nailing you to your seat. </span></div></div>",

You hear a sound that reminded you of a dog walking across a hardwood floor, the sound of their claws/nails  tapping on the floor. You look around and try to find the source of the noise, but as quick as it came, it was gone, \"odd\" you say to yourself. Suddenly you feel a presence to your left, like someone was standing next to you, slowly you turn and look over our shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at you was a large, gray wolf, slowly you reach toward your sidearm, but as you touch the pistol the wolf let out a low growl, stopping you. Very carefully you move your hand away from the holster, \"don't know which is worse, getting injured in this crash, or that wolf killing me\" you say quietly to yourself. The wolf walks over to you and starts sniffing you, starting at your face and working its way down, stopping at the piece of metal in your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wolf checked you out, you did some checking yourself, after seeing no visible genitalia you determine that the wolf was female. Her fur was a mix of gray with light streaks of white and brown fur in her underbelly, you notice that her right ear was a little torn up with a small scar down her muzzle.

You look out the windshield expecting another wolf to jump on the nose of the helicopter, but none did. Suddenly you feel something brush against your boot, you look and see a small fox climbing through the smashed nose bubble at you feet and climb up on your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the wolf, the fox started to sniff at your face and work its way down, stopping at the metal shard. The fox lightly bit the shard which sent a tingle of pain up your side, \"aahh please don't do that\" you say to the fox. The wolf lets out a small growl to the fox, the fox climbs off you and the two disappear behind you, suddenly you feel the shard start to move, \"hey please don't touch th--\" before you could finish you hear a snap followed by you being freed from the chair. You look over and see the wolf with a piece of the rotor shard in her mouth, you carefully climb out of the cockpit , taking care not to smack the piece of rotor that was still in your side into anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find a tree and lean against it , you look back and see the wolf and fox staring at you from the helicopter side door. You look down at the remains of the shrapnel, it stuck out about one foot in front of you and stuck out about four inches from your backside.

You manage to recover a small bundle of survival gear consisting of your sidearm, boot knife, two MREs, a canteen, and other miscellaneous items, but no useable radio, you gather the gear and begin to leave. You turn and look at the fox and wolf, who were still unmoved, and wave goodbye, \"thanks for not making a meal out of me I guess\" you say to them as you leave. You continue walking for an hour, stopping every so often to check on your wounded side, soon you come to a clearing with a large lake in the middle, you take a moment to clean yourself up and to refill your canteen.

That was the downside to flying an older helicopter like the Huey, no GPS built in, you had to use paper maps to navigate, but it was better than nothing. \"What do you mean its not on the map?\" you ask, \"I mean the jungle was supposed to end 30 miles back\" he says, suddenly you feel a large vibration in the pedals at your feet followed by a small electrical spark on the instrument panel, \"whoa! What was that?\" you say, \"I don't know but its gone\" says the co-pilot. Just then without warning the whole helicopter lurched like a large foot just dropkicked the tail, putting the Huey in an out of control spin. Klaxons and light blew up all over the instrument panels, \"collective's not responding, hydraulics are out!\" you shout over the alarms, the Huey did a belly flop in the one open clearing in the whole jungle, the force of the impact sent a pain through your lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helicopter hit so hard that it bounced back into the air and rolled over to the left, the rotor blade snapped as the came into contact with the hard pack jungle ground. The Huey continued its roll and came to a rest on its roof, leaving you upside down in your chair., You look over at your co-pilot who had already freed himself and was making his way over to you, suddenly the smell of fuel assaults your nose. You free yourself and tumble out of your seat, but you can't open your door, \"get me outta here!\" you yell, the co-pilot starts yanking on your door while you start pushing from the other side. \"Try kicking it\" he says, \"I can't move my legs\" you tell him, he swears before grabbing a piece of rotor and starts using it like a pry bar and manages to pry the door open, grab you by the scruff of your vest and drag you away from the wreck before the fuel catches on fire, causing the helicopter to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"too close\" you say quietly, \"you can say that again\" says the co-pilot, \"let's check out your legs\" he says. He examines your back and legs, \"well I've got good news and bad news\" he says, \"just give it to me\" you say, \"well the  good news is that your inability to use your legs appears temporary, but thats were the bad news come in, I don't know how long temporary is\" he says. \"Great\" you say, \"well I'm going to get started on building a shelter while there is still light out and we just sit tight and wait I guess\" says your co-pilot. For about five hours you are forced to sit against a tree and watch while the co-pilot build a small camp for the two of you to stay in, every so often you would check behind you to make sure no wildlife was stalking up behind you, despite the felling of being watched you found nothing. By the time your new home was built the sun was dipping behind the hills to the west, the co-pilot had a good fire going and a fairly large shelter built from anything he could get his hands on, even some pieces from the wreck. He picks you up and carries you to the fire pit and sets you down against another tree where the two of you have some of your emergence rations, \"you get some sleep, I'll take first watch\" you say to the co-pilot, he gives you a tired smile and nods, an hour later he was asleep in the lean to and you were alert for any animals that might try to attack during the night and to keep an eye out for any rescue planes overhead......</span></div></div>",

The desert stretches out flat before you, and while the landing conditions are hardly ideal, as far as crashes go, you're counting your blessings. You can drop lower much too quickly, and you can hear rocks and plants hit your craft, a sound which would normally be obscured by the propeller, which has stopped. The plane jolts as you bump the ground once, twice, before coasting into a cactus and finally stopping. The particularly large cactus is torn apart by the collision, and the quick stop causes you to bounce painfully. There's a horrible scraping sound just before the plane stops, caused by the cactus and tumbleweeds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb out of the plane and look yourself over, finding no obvious injuries. You then decide to check the plane. One of the blades on the propeller as snapped, and another is bent. The bottom of the plane has been scratched, but the damage seems superficial. You hold a hand near the front of the plane, not quite touching it, but close enough to tell it would be hot to the touch. You decide to wait to check the engine until nightfall, when things have cooled down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is then that the heat makes itself known. You are suddenly acutely aware of the midday sun beaming down on you, reflecting off the sand and becoming blinding.  You reach into the plane and retrieve a backpack with some basic supplies. A couple of water bottles, some trail mix and candy bars, a flashlight, a rope, a multitool, a first aid kit, clothes, and some matches. You resist the urge to drink the water right away, and fashion a hat out of one of your shirts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize quickly that your plane will not provide adequate shade.

Aside from the helicopter's low thrum, it was peaceful above the forest, this was one of the many reasons why you enjoyed flying, it got you away from all your problems back home. A light above the fuel gauge light up, indicating that the tank was almost half way empty, \"I guess all good things must come to an end sometime\" you say to yourself as you turn back to the airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a warning light came on indicating that one of the engines had a fire, you pull on the fire extinguisher lever and shut down the engine. The helicopter could fly on one engine, but not very well, so you had to get back to the airport quick. Suddenly he instrument panel went dark, but all the gauges still worked, unfortunately your navigation and radio stopped working when the panel stopped functioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can this day get any worse?\" you say to yourself, just then you hear a loud grinding noise emanate from the engine followed by smoke lightly start to fill the cockpit. The altimeter, airspeed, and RPM gauges start to count down, you swear as you realize whats happening, you spot a clearing in the trees so you steer the helicopter towards it while you still had control. Just as you come in for a landing the helicopter suddenly tilts on its left side, you bring your arms up and shield your face as the helicopter rolls onto is side and the rotor blade explode when they hit the ground. Finally the helicopter comes to a rest, you grab the survival kit that you kept under the seat and climb out of the wreck. You look into the sky and see that the sun was beginning to set over the mountains</span></div></div>",

Standing in the doorway was a human or rather an animal, actually it was more of a combination of the two; an animal with human qualities. You sit there in shock, starring at the strange figure, everything from the long bushy tail to the furry, pointed ears that sat atop its head, unfortunately it was too dark for you to determine gender and to see finer details like the animal's breed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you remembered how you got here, the snare and the dart. quickly you scramble off the bed and run into the farthest corner and drop into a fetal position. \"Please don't hurt me, I'm lost and I just want to go home, I didn't mean to intrude or anything\" you plead with the creature. The creature tilts its head in confusion, \"maybe it doesn't understand English\" you think to yourself, \"why would I hurt you human?' it says in a female voice, \"ok they understand me\" you think to yourself. Slowly you start to stand up cautiously, \"well umm....\" you start, unsure what to say now that you know this animal/human, isn't...well animal. \"Well what?' she asks, slowly walking over to you, \"well I was caught in a trap and tranquilized before being brought here, I'm sorry if I'm being rude, but I sort of expected to be cut up like a steak\" you say. The female giggles at your response, \"no offense taken, but you must understand, we may be animal in nature, but we are very civilized\" she says, \"I'm sorry, but we haven't been properly introduced, my name is (your name)\" you say, slowly walking out of the corner, \"well (your name) I am Kayla and I am sorry about having to dart you like that\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved into the light you could see she was a dark gray wolf with a streak of white going from her nose and over her head, like racing stripes on a car.

The co-pilot glances over his shoulder at you, \"don't want to get lost down there\" he says, \"why's that?' you ask, \"most of this forest is still unexplored and these trees would make it impossible to locate anyone from the air\" he says. Suddenly a klaxon sounds and you turn your attention to the cockpit, \"whats that?\" you ask, \"probably nothing, but I need you to stick your head out and check the tail for me\" says the pilot. \"How do you want me to do that?\" you ask, \"just strap into the floor there and stick your head out the door\" says the co-pilot, you attach one of the safety straps to your belt and click it into the floor. You lean out the door slowly to look at the tail rotor, \"come on I thought you airborne guys did this all the time?\" yells the co-pilot, \"yeah on airplanes\" you yell back. \"What's the difference?\" he yells, \"well for one this is a helicopter so we're at a lower altitude and I don't have a chute if I fall out, not that it would help.\" you yell back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the tail rotor and see nothing out of the ordinary so you climb back in, \"I didn't see any---\" you never got to finish because the whole helicopter lurched like someone had kicked it from behind, \"what the hell was that?!\" you yell over the klaxon, \"we just lost the tail rotor!\" yells the co-pilot. The helicopter began to spin counter-clockwise at a fast pace, \"hold onto something Staff Sergeant!\" yelled the pilot, you dive to grab one of the seats attached to the floor. Suddenly you feel the safety strap attached to the floor rip causing you to go flying out the open side door, \"Oh Shi--------\" was all you could say as you slid out the helicopter and toward the green forest floor below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou braced yourself as you neared one of the giant pine trees, you crashed into the giant branches that slowed your fall to the ground below. You painfully slam into over ten different branches before finally hitting the ground with enough force to knock the wind out of you. You sit up and hear the sound of the helicopter rapidly losing altitude followed by the ground shaking and the sound of rotor blades snapping like they were plastic, but no explosion. You get to your feet and do a quick self-assessment before taking off in the direction of where you thought the helicopter went down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou locate the crashed helicopter and are slightly relieved that it hadn't caught fire, you carefully make your way to the cockpit to check on the two pilots. What you see makes your heart sink, the pilot had a piece of metal through his chest, probably killing him instantly, you check on the co-pilot and discover that he was also dead due to a broken neck caused from the crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down on a nearby rock as everything that just happened starts to sink in, \"alright, first things first\" you say to yourself. You carefully remove the pilots' bodies from the wreck and start digging two holes to bury them. You remove one of their dog tags and carefully lower them into the two holes that you dug, you fill in the graves and make markers using their dog tags, two sticks and some rope. You turn back toward the wreck to see what you could find that might help you, you find some MREs, a solar charger and some canteens of water so you take those, you still had your rifle and sidearm, both undamaged from your graceful fall from the helicopter, you grab some of the first aid kits and throw them in your bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately your radio broke when you hit the ground and so did the pilots' in the crash, you manage to fit all the gear in your assault bag. You grab your rifle and bag and head out to try to find some shelter as it was beginning to get dark and you don't know what types of wildlife lived in these woods. As you walk you get the strange feeling that someone is watching you, but when you turn around there was no one, as you keep walking it starts to rain, you reach into your bag and pull out your poncho and put it on. you turned on your helmet light because the combination of the darkness and rain made it hard to see, as you walk you see a cave about 20 feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cave was small enough that you have you crouch down a little to get in, you drew your sidearm and looked around the cave for any signs that an animal was living here. After a brief search you find no evidence that anything was living in the cave so you put away your sidearm and set your gear along the wall and drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

The fox follows you out the cave and climbs to the top of the cave entrance, you give the fox a small wave and then turn to leave. You begin walking away from the cave, suddenly you feel something land on your shoulders, you turn your head to see the fox had jumped up on your shoulders, \"what the?\" you say. You've never seen a fox do something like this, you attempt to remove her from your shoulders, but she had wrapped her tail tightly around your arm. Despite your best attempts you couldn't unwrap the tail from your arm so you gave up and let the fox stay, \"alright you've been nice to me, I guess I should do the same, I will how ever be needing my arm ma'am\" you say to the fox and she unwraps her tail from your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue walking with the fox laying across your shoulders for a few hours before you stop to eat some food for lunch. You lower yourself enough for here to jump off so you could set your bag down and pull out an MRE.

The two of you finish your lunch, you clean out the metal cup and put it away along with your MRE trash and switch out your helmet with a boonie hat, \"I don't think anyone is going to be shooting at me\" you think to yourself. As you shoulder your bag the fox hops back on your shoulders again and lays down with her head near your left ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and look at her, \"comfy?\" you ask her, a yawn answers your question, \"look at me, I'm talking to a fox\" you say to yourself. You continue walking with the fox on your shoulders, you look over at her and see she was starting to fall asleep. \"Hey if I can't sleep, why do you get to?\" you ask her, she lifts her head and licks the side of your face, \"alright suck up\" you say, you reach up and lightly scratch one of her ears, making her tail wag.</span></div></div>",

You continue walking for a couple more hours until you see something that sticks out from the trees, you make you way over to the object with your rifle at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get closer you realize it was a crashed military C-130 that looks like it had been here for years, you make your way to an opening in the rear of the plane and climb inside. Inside the rear of the plane were cargo crates still strapped to the floor and some vegetation growing sporadically on the inside of the cargo hold. You make your way to the cockpit in hopes of finding some type of working radio, but you don't get your hopes up because you know the chances of that are very slim to none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the cockpit, there was no signs of the pilots' remains just empty seats and broken instrument panels. you begin digging around searching for anything, you open up a small compartment and find a folded piece of paper, you unfold it and read it. It was the manifest for the cargo, what surprised you was the date on the manifest, June 6, 1968, you walk back into the cargo hold and examine the crates that are still strapped to the floor. You cut one of the straps and open a crate, inside you found rows of M16A1 rifles that looked like they were made yesterday, but these rifle models were way outdated compared to your M16A4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to another stack of crates that had a fire hazard symbol on it and the letters W.P. stamped on the top. You open this crate and saw rows of grenades sitting inside, you carefully take one out and see these weren't the usual baseball style grenades that you know, they were cylindrical with a rounded, cone-like bottom. They had the words WHITE PHOS. painted on the side, you carefully put the grenade back in its case, you have seen what kind of damage white phosphorus can do and you defiantly didn't want to be holding one of those grenades when it goes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think this plane will do for shelter for tonight\" you say to yourself, you drop your bags and grab your folding survival shovel and head out to get some firewood. An hour later you were back at the crashed plane stacking wood to be lit, you pull out some potassium permanganate and a small bottle of glycerin from your survival pouch. You dripped a little glycerin on a branch and then sprinkled a small pinch of potassium permanganate on the glycerin and then stepped back, 30 seconds later the wood began smolder and one minute later you had a small fire going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and see that fox was laying on the rear ramp watching you, you walk over and sit down next to her. You reach over and ruffle the fur on her head, she let out a small growl making you laugh, \"If only you could talk back\" you say to her. You reach into your chest pocket and pull out the manifest, you reach into your bag and pull out a flashlight and start searching the list hoping to find something that might help you survive in this forest. You see something that perks your interest, you put the manifest back in your pocket and head back into the cargo hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shine your light over the different crates until you find what you are looking for, you unstrap the pallet and open a crate, inside were rows on C-rations. You remember your uncle talking about having these when he was in Vietnam, from what you remember they weren't any better than your MREs, but they would do. The sound of a footstep causes you to forget about the C-rations, you look and see the silhouette of someone standing at the rear of the plane, you stand and draw your sidearm, but you drop your flashlight as you stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you say to the figure, \"I'm not going to hurt you\" says the figure in a female voice, \"really?... then why were you trying to sneak in here?\" you ask, \"I wasn't trying to sneak in here, I just didn't want to scare you\" says the figure. \"Well I don't think that worked\" you say, the figure started walking to you, \"stop\" you order, but the figure kept walking to you, you take a small step back, but your foot catches on a strap causing you to trip. You fall and hit your head on one of the other cargo pallets causing you to black out, the last thing you heard was the sound of someone running toward you and the feeling of being lifted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and see you were at back on the cargo ramp at the back of the plane, \"your awake\" you hear the same female voice from earlier say. You turn and see......</span></div></div>",

You feel your face burn as you blush, she giggles \"so is that enough proof?\" she asks. \"Well it proves one of two things, you're either a really good hallucination brought on by my head injury or....you are real\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good enough for me\" she says, \"What is your name\" you ask, she smiles, \"my name is Ember\" she says. \"Do you have a surname?\" you ask, \"yeah, but I don't really use it\" she says, \"well maybe sometime you could tell me\" you say. \"I bet I could guess your surname\" she says, you cross your arms on your chest, \"what are you betting?\" you say, \"well if I win, you do whatever I want for the rest of tonight and into tomorrow\" she says, \"and if I win?\" you ask. \"I have to do whatever you want for tonight and tomorrow\" she says, \"fair enough, go ahead give it you best guess\" you say, she smiles \"is it Grimm?\" she guesses, you stare at her is shock, your arms drop back to your sides and your grin disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't read minds can you?\" you ask, \"well actually I can, but that's not how I guessed your last name\" she says, \"then how?\" you say. She simply points to your chest, you look down and swear, stitched on your vest was your last name, \"I didn't think this one out\" you say. She laughs,\"sorry I tricked you on that one\" she says, you get to your feet and walk over to the fire to throw some wood on it to keep it going. \"So what's your first name\" she asks, \"My name is John\" you tell her, \"I hate to pester, but do you have anything to eat?\" Ember asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's what I was looking for before I hit my head\" you tell her, you walk back into the cargo hold and grab the crate of C-rations that you found. You also find your flashlight and sidearm on the ground where you dropped them, you holster your sidearm and grab the crate of rations and walk back outside. \"I don't know how well you'll like these, but they're all I've got\" you tell her as you set down the crate. She gets up and picks up a ration to examine it, \"so how are you supposed to eat these?\" she says, \"here let me help you\" you say, she hands the ration to you and you open it for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffs it, \"It doesn't smell too bad\" she says, she takes a small bite of the entr\u00e9e, \"I've had worse, but this is ok\" she says. \"Really?\" you say, you open yours and try some of it, it wasn't that great, but it was better than nothing. The two of you sit and talk while you eat your rations, \"so John, if it's not too rude what are you?...I've never seen your species before\" says Ember, \"I was going to say the same to you, but I'm a human\" you say. \"I've heard of your species, but you're the first one I've seen\" she says, \"let me guess....your a Kitsune?\" you ask, she stops and looks at you, \"very good, how did you know that?\" she asks. \"Like you I've heard stories about your race, but humans have never seen one for real\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you finish your meal and stack the empty ration cans near the fire pit, you grab your gear and walk back over to Ember, she was looking up at the stars in the night sky. \"So how do we settle this bet?\" you ask her as you sit down, \"I don't know it was kind of unfair\" she says, you think for a moment and then an idea pops in your head. \"Ok how's this guess my nickname\" you tell her, \"What's the stakes?\" she asks, \"they're the same except instead of a day and a half, its three days and a half, sound good?\" you say, she nods, \"one other thing, no mind reading\" you add. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems fair\" she says, she looks and your with a deep-in-thought expression on her face, for ten minutes straight she is quiet, \"is it Reaper?\" she asks. You stare at her in shock, \"yeah, how did you guess that?\" you ask still surprised, she shakes her head, \"I really just guessed\" she says, \"ok well a bet's a bet, you win this time......again\" you say. \"Come on its getting late, we should go to sleep\" she says, \"yeah your right\" you say, you get up and throw some more wood on the fire to keep it going for the rest of the night and walk back over to Ember. You grab your backpack to use as a pillow and lay down on the ground, Ember snuggles up to you, she drapes her massive tails across you like a blanket and lays her head on your chest, \"goodnight John\" she whispers as she drifts off to sleep, soon you begin to fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

You run your hand down her back causing two of her tails to move, you smile to yourself, \"I was wondering when you would wake up\" she says, \"how long have you been awake\" you ask. \"Not that long\" she says, she lifts her head and looks at you, \"I was about to wake you\" she adds, \"oh? and how would you do that?\" you inquire. \"By doing this\" she says, one of her tails starts to tickle your nose causing you to sneeze, \"yeah that would do it\" you say after she stopped tickling your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on lazy\" she says as she gets off you, she walks over to the smoldering fire pit and starts poking at it, you get to your feet and stretch. You look over at Ember, with the sunlight out you could see her better than last night, her fur ran in random streaks of orange and white, 4 of her tails were orange with white tipped fur and the other 5 were white with orange fur on the tip. She had long black/brown hair on her head, she stood up and turned around to look at you revealing that she wasn't wearing anything. \"You don't wear clothing?\" you ask averting your eyes, \"well normally I do, but it makes this difficult\" she says you look back and see that she was gone, in her place was the fox that always rode on your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that was you\" you say, you could have sworn you saw the fox grin, before your eyes the fox transformed back into Ember. \"Clothing does get in the way sometimes\" she says, \"well I could see how that could be a problem\" you tell her. \"Would you like some clothing for now?\" you ask, she smiles, \"if you could spare it that would be nice\" she says. \"I don't have any to spare, but maybe I could find something on the manifest\" you tell her, she nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the manifest out again and begin looking down the list, you get up and walk into the hold and begin digging through the different pallets and pulling crates out to the ramp. After digging for ten minutes you had 7 different sized crates outside the plane in a line. One by one you open them, \"so what  did you find?\" Ember asks, \"I found boots, socks, t-shirts, pants, belts, jackets, and hats\" you tell her, she walks over and starts digging through the crates and trying on different articles of clothing. \"Well these fit, but they don't really work with my tails\" she says holding a pair of olive drab fatigue pants, \"here give them to me\" you say, she hands the pants to you as you pull out your knife and cut a small hole in the rear where her tails would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try that\" you say handing them back, she puts them on and her tails fit perfectly through the hole, \"better\" she says as she laces up a pair of boots, you get up and head back into the cargo hold to see what you could find. You locate some A.L.I.C.E backpacks so you grab one and start throwing in some C-rations and anything else that you thought might be important, you refrain from any munitions because you couldn't trust their reliability. \"Find something?\" you hear you look up and see Ember standing by some crates, \"just packing a bag to go, I'm just amazed that all this equipment is in such pristine condition\" you tell her. \"Come on lets get something to eat\" she says, you follow her out of the hold where she had two C-rations open, as you walk into the sunlight you see she was wearing a full olive drab uniform with the sleeves rolled up to her elbows and a boonie hat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look uncomfortable with that hat on\" you say, \"its because it presses on my ears\" she says, \"here give it to me\" you say, she hands the hat to you and you modify it like you did her pants, \"there\" you say handing the hat back. She put it on and her ears fit through the holes you cut in the top, \"thanks again\" she says as she hands you an open ration. \"So what now?.....\" you ask, \"what do you mean?\" Ember asks, \"Well I have no place to go, I'm not even supposed to be here\" you tell her, she gives you a confused look. You explain to her how you became lost in the woods, how the helicopter you were riding in crashed, stranding you in the forest, when you finish the two of you sat in silence, after what seems like half an hour Ember breaks the silence, \"you could stay with me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her, \"you trust me that much?\" you say, \"of course, besides if I can't trust you I'll just eat you\" she says, you laugh, but as you see the look on her face your laugh turns into a nervous chuckle. \"Ok...... how far away is your home?\" you ask wanting to change the subject a little, \"half a day's hike, if we leave in the next hour we can make it there before dark\" she says. \"Ok then we better get ready\" you say, ten minutes later you were finishing packing the A.L.I.C.E. bag and leaving the cargo hold, \"need me to carry anything?\" Ember asks, \"just the other bag\" you say pointing to your assault bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab your rifle and follow Ember as she leads the way to her home......</span></div></div>",

She walks over and opens the door for you, inside the door was a hallway with one room on the left and one on the right, as you walk to the end of the hall you found yourself in a living room/kitchen combo with a fireplace. \"Well?\" says Ember, \"its nice, did you build it?\" you ask, \"most of it\" she says, \"how?\" you ask confused, \"thats a story for later, come I'll show you the rest of the house\" she says. You walk over to her, \"bathroom\" she says indicating to one of the doors, \"let me guess...your room\" you say pointing to the other door, \"yep, come on I have spare blankets and pillows in my closet\" she says opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand in the doorway while she walks over to her closet, she stops and looks at you, \"you can come in\" she says, you walk in and sit on the foot of her bed. \"Here you go\" says Ember, she hands you a pillow and a blanket, \"where do I sleep?\" you ask, \"well you can sleep on the couch or....\" says Ember. \"Or?...... or what?\" you say, she flicks her eyes to her bed with a smile, \"oh.....umm I think that..um..I'll...uh..take the....uh..t-the couch\" you sputter as you stand, you manage to walk out of the room without tripping over your feet. You hear Ember laugh as you leave, \"well the offer's still open if you change your mind\" she yells from her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out the the living room and set the pillow and blanket on the couch, you lean your rifle against the arm of the couch and you set the A.L.I.C.E. bag next to it. \"crap\" you whisper to yourself as you realize Ember still had your assault bag with her when she went into her room, you walk back to her room. Her door was still open, you stick your head in, on the floor were the clothing from the airplane, but Ember was no where to bee seen, \"Ember?\" you ask, \"over here\" you hear her say. You look and see her tails sticking out from behind a shoji screen with clothing draped over the top, \"oh sorry\" you say as you turn away, you feel a tap on your shoulder, you turn and look to see Ember standing there in baggy sweatpants and a tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know someone who never seen humans you sure do dress like one\" you tell her, she tilts her head in confusion, \"never mind, you still have my backpack\" you say. \"Oh yeah, here\" she says as she picks it up and hands it to you, \"thanks\" you turn to leave, \" can I ask a favor\" says Ember, \"yeah, remember the bet we made?\" you say. \"Yeah well I still like to ask first\" she says, \"ok what do you need?\" you ask, \"well my feet are killing me from walking in those boots\" she says \"and you would like me to rub them?\" you say, she smiles at you. She lays on her bed, you sit on the foot of the bed and start massaging her feet, \"your good at this\" she says, \"really, because I've never had to do this\" you tell her. An hour later you look over and see she had fallen asleep, she was completely relaxed, all nine tails lay limp across the bed, \"maybe I am good at this\" you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully get off the bed and stand at the foot of the bed,  you smile to yourself and take off your fatigue jacket and lay it across her like a blanket. You don't know why you did this, it just seemed right, you grab your bag and leave, slowly closing the door behind you. You walk back to the couch and lay down, seeing Ember asleep suddenly made you tired, you kick off your boots and grab the pillow she had given you and soon you were drifting off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

You feel a tap on your shoulder making you turn around, standing there was your squad leader, \"you good?\" he asks, \"yeah, whats the plan?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We think that IED was meant for one of the tanks\" he says pointing to the three Abrams tanks in your convoy. Right now the tanks had their hatches open with commanders on their radios and loaders on their M240Bs scanning rooftops, \"we can't move forward until EOD clears the rest of the road for anymore of those IEDs, until then keep your eyes open\" says your squad leader. You look at the civilians that were watching your convoy, over the couple of months that you've been here you've figured out that if somethings about to happen the civilians seem to know when it will happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now their mood was generally calm, but that could change in seconds. An hour later EOD shows up and starts clearing the road for anymore IEDs, the whole time your attention was on the rooftops and the crowds of civilians milling about. Over the course of half an hour you noticed that the civilians were beginning to leave and in a hurry like they had somewhere better to be, you look over at your squad leader hand he looks at you and nods; he knows somethings up. Suddenly all hell breaks loose, bullets began landing all around you, followed by every Humvee returning fire with heavy M2 machine guns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your rifle and fire in the direction of the enemy fire, out of the corner of your eyes you see your squad leader fall, you turn and see him clutching his leg and shoulder. You sprint over to him, you pull out your medical kit and start treating his arm, Henry runs over and starts treating his leg wound. A medic runs over and helps treat the wounds, \"I need someone to run back to the Humvee and grab my bag\" he says, you look at Henry and he gets up and runs into the second Humvee in the convoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see an insurgent with an RPG peeking around the corner aiming at the Humvee Henry just ran into, quickly you get to your feet and begin running to the Humvee yelling for Henry to get out, but the insurgent fires and seconds later the Humvee explodes in a ball of fire. Next thing you knew you were flying backwards in the air and then you slammed into a stone pillar, you rolled on your back and looked up into the sky. Slowly your vision became blurry and began to darken, you hear the sound of boots running toward you and you see the outline of someone leaning over you, \"John stay with me. come on you've got to stay awake\" said the figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John wake up\" you hear the voice saying over and over, slowly the voice changes into a female's voice, \"JOHN!\" the voice says loudly, you open your eyes and find yourself in Embers living room on the couch. Ember was sitting on the couch looking at you with a concerned face, \"what happened?\" you ask, \"you tell me, you were thrashing about repeating the name Henry\" she says still staring at you, \"I woke up to use the bathroom and heard you talking\" she adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it a nightmare?\" she asks, \"it was nothing\" you lie, \"who's Henry?\" she asks, \"I don't want to talk about it right now\" you tell her. \"Ok if you want to talk I'll listen\" she tells you as she gets up and goes over to the fireplace to tend to the fire, you get up and walk into the kitchen section of the room to get a drink, you notice a door that you didn't see before. You start to open it, but Ember runs over and pushes it closed again, \"please don't go in there, that's my one rule\" she says, \"sorry\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on I'll make something to eat\" she says changing the topic, \"ok what do you have in mind?\" you ask, \"something fresh, unlike those rations\" she says walking toward the front door, \"where are you going?\" you ask. \"Hunting\" she says and she strips out of her clothing and turns into a fox and runs out the door leaving you alone. You look back at the door in the kitchen....</span></div></div>",

You walk over and open it, inside was a picture, a book that looked like a diary and a small wind up musical box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the picture, on it were four foxes that looked like Ember, two adults and two children, you put the picture back, the diary was locked with a small lock so you put that back. You turn the crank on the music box, but no music plays, you shine the light in and see that two gear were broken, \"maybe I could fix this for her, I think my watch has gears this size\" you think to yourself. You hear a noise from upstairs, you quickly put the music box in your pocket and run up the stairs closing the door behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get upstairs expecting to see Ember, but no one was there, \"must be my imagination\" you say to yourself. You walk over to the couch and pull over the coffee table, you unhook your watch and using your multi-tool you start taking it apart. You carefully take the music box apart and insert the two gears from your watch, they fix perfectly, you put the box back together and turn the crank again winding up a little and then releasing the handle and it starts to play music for a few seconds before unwinding. \"Well I think my work here is done\" you say to yourself as you put the box in your bag to surprise Ember later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after your clean up your watch parts, there was a knock at the door, you turn and see Ember standing there with her catch in her hands and a smile on her face. You get up and open the door for her, she walks into the kitchen and starts preparing a meal. An hour later you were sitting on the couch enjoying the meal she cooked, \"this is really good\" you say complementing her cooking, \"thank you\" she says, you notice the fur on her face visibly change. The two of you talk for hours after you finish eating, in the back of your mind you wanted to show her you fixed her music box, but you knew she might get made at the fact you broke her rule and went down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm going to bed\" she says as she take care of the dishes, \"ok good night' you tell her, \"hey.. remember if you want to talk...\" she says. \"I know\" you say, she smiles and walks to her room, you kick off your boots and lay on the couch. You reach into your bag and pull out the music box and turn it over in your fingers, you sigh and put it away, you close your eyes and drift off to sleep again.</span></div></div>",

Half an hour later it begins to rain, so you pull your poncho back out and put it on, You continue walking for almost another five hours and each hour the rain seemed to be getting worse so you decide to find some shelter for now, after walking for another hour you locate a cave that provided good enough shelter from the rain so you crawl in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set your gear on the ground and sit down next to it, slowly you drift off to sleep.....</span></div></div>",

Just before you drift off again a loud scream rings out, jumping you awake, \"that defiantly was a scream\" you say as your grab your rifle and run out of the cave into the rain to investigate. You make it about twenty feet from the cave before you hear voices below you on the hill, \"let go of me you pigs\" you hear, \"well look what we have here, someone like you shouldn't be out here at night\", \"yeah you could get hurt or worse you could run into us\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you could tell there were three people below you, two male and one female, slowly you make your way down the hillside to where the voices were coming from. You reach a boulder and hide behind it because just below you was where the voices were coming from, you peek over the boulder and see that you were right, there were two males and a female. The way the sun was you could see the three clearly, the two males were anthros like Ember, but they looked like wolves or coyotes, you froze when you saw that the mystery female was Ember, \"she must have been looking for me\" you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\" she yelled, one of the males had her arms and tails pinned behind her while the other one stood in front of her and ran a finger across her chin, \"you best watch yourself\" he said. You couldn't let them do anything to hurt her, so you bring up your rifle and take aim above his head so that the bullet would harmlessly hit the tree behind him. You wipe the rain off your ACOG before taking aim and pulling the trigger, the branch above the second male's head exploded making him jump, \"what the hell was that?!?\" he yells in surprise, searching the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her go or the next one is going in your ear\" you yell, \"screw you man\" yells the male that had Ember's arms and tails pinned. \"Wrong answer\" you whisper, as you look through your ACOG you see he was trying to hide behind Ember, but not knowing where you were he left himself completely exposed. You fired again and this time you were aimed so that the round hit the tip of his ear, he let out a scream of pain and clutched his right ear or what was left of it. \"screw this lets get out of here\" yells the other male, he grabs his partner and they run off into the forest leaving Ember alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way to Ember, she couldn't see where you were until you were standing in front of her. She ran over and hugged you, her wet fur pressing up against you, \"John I-I don-\" you put up your finger stopping her mid-sentence, \"lets get out of the rain first\" you tell her, she nods and follows you back to the cave, you open your bag and hand her a wool blanket that you recovered from the plane wreck. \"Thanks\" she says wrapping herself in the blanket. \"Why did you come looking for me?\" you ask, she reaches into one of her pockets and pull out the music box you set on her dresser. \"Listen I'm sorry, I overreacted\" she says, \"no I shouldn't have broken your rule\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slides over to you and wraps you up with the blanket and pulls you closer, \"come on lets go back to my place\" she says, \"how? its pouring out and we're at least half a days walk away\" you say. She grins at you, \"I've got a few tricks up my sleeve, grab you stuff\" she says, you pack up your bag and grab your rifle, she walks over to you and wraps her tails around you like a cocoon, \"what ar-\", \"shh, just try not to move\" Ember says cutting you off. A glowing light appeared around the two of you and you feel a sense of vertigo, Ember unwraps her tails and you found yourself in front of her house again, \"sometime you have to explain that one to me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walk in the house, you set your wet gear down by the door while Ember goes into the bathroom and comes out with two towels and hands one to you. You follow her to her room,\"do you mind helping me dry my tails? she asks, \"sure\" you say she sits down on her bed and you sit behind her and start drying her tails with the towel. \"There\" you says as you finish drying the last tail, suddenly she turns around and hugs you tightly, pulling your head into her ample bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what feels like an hour Ember releases you, \"sorry\" she says, \"no its ok, you've had a crazy day\" you tell her. \"Well this day really knocked me out\" you say as you get up to leave, but Ember grabs you with her tails and pulls you back on the bed. She lays on top of you, \"maybe its better if you sleep here tonight\" she says with a grin, you had to admit her fur was warming you up, \"ok maybe just this once\" you say, she lets out a small laugh, \"we'll see\" she says. She presses her muzzle under your chin and starts to drift off, moments later you start to drift off too.</span></div></div>",

As you slowly move the light you realize that the animal was a large mountain lion draped across your lap, you freeze in fear,\"what the hell am I supposed to do now?!?!?\" you think. You look to your right and see your rifle leaning against the cave wall, but it was too far away for you to grab it without disturbing the lion, you also couldn't reach you sidearm without risking waking up the lion. Your only option was your knife on the back of your belt, slowly you move your hand toward your belt and unclip your knife, the sound of unsnapping the clasp on your knife sheath was enough to wake the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion stood up and walks over toward your face, quickly you draw your sidearm and fire a round straight up, the lion runs over to the other end of the cave. \"What was that?!?\" you hear the lion yell, you sit there shocked that you just heard a mountain lion talk, \"you can..talk?\" you ask, \"only if you don't make that loud noise again\" says the lion in a female voice, \"ok only if you don't try to hurt me\" you say. \"I wasn't going to hurt you\" says the lion, you reach over and turn on the flashlight on your rifle illuminating the cave, over in a corner was the mountain lion with her paws covering her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I'm putting my weapon away\" you say showing your sidearm to the lion as you holster it. She lowers her paws from her ears, \"what do you mean you weren't going to hurt me\" you ask, \"just that I wasn't going to hurt you\" she says\" I just....who....why\" was all you could say. \"You're confused and scared aren't you?\" says the lion, you nod, \"well this might help\" she says. In front of you the lion morphs into a human form, but still had the mountain lion features like the tail and fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a name?\" you ask, \"Kathleen\" she says, \"ok Kathleen, my name is John\" you say sticking your hand out, she hesitates, \"what are you doing?\" she asks confused. \"Sorry, you don't shake hands do you?\" you ask, she shakes her head, the two of you continue talking for over a hour, you notice that the whole time Kathleen moved closer to you, seeming no longer afraid of you and you also no longer had a deep fear of her for being a mountain lion. \"Well Kathleen if you don't mind me asking, but how did you find me?\" you ask, you see the fur on her face ripple, \"I..uh..well I smell you\" she said, you knew ever human had their own distinct scent that they gave off, you've seen police use dogs to track people using their scent to find them. \"I was out hunting when I smelled your scent and followed it to this cave and found you asleep\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did you get here?\" she asks, \"well my helicopter had an accident and crashed in this forest\" you tell her, \"was that the loud boom I felt a couple hours ago?\" she asks, \"maybe\" you say. \"Was that also the giant metal...um thing that I found a couple miles that way?\" she says pointing North, \"no I crashed that way\" you say pointing South. \"Oh well I found something a few miles away from here that I've never seen before\" she says, \"there's another wreck?.....maybe I have a chance of getting rescued\" you think to yourself, \"can you take me there?\" you ask, Kathleen nods, \"in the morning though I hate navigating in the dark\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok we should probably get some sleep\" you tell her, you reach over and turn of the flashlight plunging the cave back into darkness, you grab your bag and make a makeshift pillow with it. Just as you lay down you feel a presence behind you, you sit up and turn on the flashlight again and see Kathleen laying down behind you, \"what?\" she says looking at you. \"Nothing its just that I've never fallen asleep this close to a mountain lion before\" you say, \"you know you can sleep closer to one\" she says with a small grin. \"What ar--\" before you could finish she wraps her arms around you and hugs you close to her, \"only if you don't try to eat me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets out a small laugh, \"no promises\" she jokes, you reach up and turn off the flashlight and again plunge the cave back into darkness. The only noises you hear are the sounds of your and Kathleen's breathing as you drift off to sleep.........</span></div></div>",

You pack up your gear and start the long hike up the side of the mountain, after about twenty minutes of walking you start to encounter snow. \"Odd I didn't think I was high enough on the mountain to start to see snow\" you say to yourself, but as you look around you notice it was snowing all over the forest. You continued up the mountain, soon the snow started to become more intense as you continued hiking. At one point you had the feeling of being followed, but when you turned around there was no one around, finally after about a two hour hike you manage to reach a clearing in the mountain that allowed you to see for miles in all directions. You pull out your map and compass and attempt to find your location, but nothing seemed to match up, it was if the forest didn't exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the sound of crunching snow grabbed you attention, you spin around and standing about ten feet away from you was a grey wolf that seemed to be checking you out. Just then you spot another wolf standing on a small ledge watching you, as you watched the two wolves you spot a third, then a fourth, before you knew it you had about eight wolves staring at you. \"oh shit\" you whisper to yourself as you yank on your rifle's charging handle and flick the selector switch to full auto. You were too busy watching the wolves that you failed to watch you footing because as you stepped backwards you took a tumble down the snow covered mountain, on reflex you pulled the trigger and let off three or four round harmlessly into the air. After falling for what felt like forever, you finally come to a rest on your back in some snow, you black out from your graceful fall and when you come to your find yourself.....</span></div></div>",

You turn your attention to the blanket that covered you and you noticed it was the rest of the wolves laying on top of you, keeping you warm with their fur and body heat. The wolf that was laying across your chest stirred in its sleep and woke up, it looked around the cave a little before noticing that you were awake. It started sniffing your face, you remained frozen, waiting for this wolf to take a bite out of your face, but instead it started to lick your cheek and then rub it's cheek against your's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou learned somewhere that it was a wolf's way of trusting you or something like that, which in your case, was a good thing. The wolf repositioned itself so its head was facing you when it laid back down, soon it drifted back off to sleep. \"What now?\" you say to yourself, \"I'm trapped under all these wolves, but they don't seem to want to harm me, wish is odd\" you think to yourself as you look around the cave. Just then, somewhere on the pile of wolves, you felt one wake up and it walked over to the wolf that was currently your \"pillow\" and nudged it awake. The two of them had some sort of conversation, which consisted of short, quiet growls and grunt-like noises, suddenly your \"pillow\" started to stand up slowly and the other wolf was forcing its way under your head, thats when you realized they were switching spots so you helped by tilting your head forward and allowed the other wolf to become your new pillow. The wolf that was your first pillow got up, sniffed your face and did the same lick and rub thing that the wolf on your chest did before walking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of an hour a random wolf would wake up, walk over to you, sniff and lick your face before rubbing up against you and then would either walk away or would lay back down on you.</span></div></div>",

You decide to look around the cave, the cave was about 10-20 feet tall so you could stand without having to crouch down. You notice deeper into the cave that there was some type of writing or drawings on the wall as you got closer you saw it was a picture of a human with writing around it, the writing wasn't in any language that you recognize, it looked like a combination of Russian and Chinese lettering.  Next to the drawing of the human was what looked like a wolf surrounded by more lettering and next to that picture was what looked like a combination of the human and the wolf, \"very odd\" you whisper to yourself. You felt a presence to your left, sitting next to you, silently gazing at you with bright blue eyes, was the wolf that you recognize as the one that was draped across your chest earlier. After a brief check you see that the wolf was female, you lower yourself to her height and hold out your hand to let her sniff to show you weren't a threat, but you knew if they saw you as a threat then you wouldn't be in the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf started rubbing up against you affectionately so you reach up and start lightly scratching the wolf just behind the ears. Just then a noise behind you drew you attention, standing on some type of pedestal were two wolves that were overlooking the rest of the wolves below, \"must be the head of the pack\" you think to yourself. The one that you assumed to be the male let out a noise that was a mix of a howl and a bark, causing the rest of the pack to gather around the pedestal with you in the middle. The two new wolves make their way to the cave floor and when they do the rest of the pack lowers their heads in what you assumed was a sign of respect. You decide the best thing to do is not to upset the pack leaders so you mimic the wolves around you, the alpha male walked over to you and started circling you, examining you from head to toe. You could have sworn you heard the alpha say \"hmm\" as it checked you out, he let out a grunt and the blue eyed female nudged your arm, so you raised it so it was parallel to the ground, she started tugging on the sleeve in an attempt to show your bare arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to help her out and pull the sleeve back the rest of the way, exposing your bare arm, \"what are they doing?\" you think to yourself. Without warning the Alpha bit down on your arm, causing you to shout out in pain. You raise your other fist and prepare to strike the wolf to free your arm, but another wolf caught your sleeve, preventing you from hitting the alpha. After a painful five minutes, the wolf released your bleeding arm, which you grab with your other free hand, \"what did I do to get bit?\" you whisper to yourself through clenched teeth......</span></div></div>",

You nod and slowly move toward the cockpit, just as you make it half way, the helicopter completely rolls to its left causing you to slide and crash into the closed, left side door.

In front of you was a large pond or river with clear water flowing through it, in the center of this pond was a few large boulders and on one of these boulders was a human-like animal with blue and white fur with its back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you move to get a better look at this strange creature, as you neared you could see that the creature had fox-like features, pointed ears and a bushy tail from where you were you could tell the creature was clearly female.

You noticed the water around her start to act strangely, like someone had switched off the gravity and it started to float in the air in different sized globs. As she continued to rise into the air you noticed some type of energy radiating around her, as you sit there watching you want to try talking to her, but you don't know if you should interrupt whatever she was doing.</span></div></div>",

She spins around and looks at you with glowing, green eyes that radiated the same energy that her body was radiating. She looked you over, but as her eyes see your rifle they change color to a glowing amber color, making you take a step back. <i>\"Maybe this wasn't a good idea\"</i> you say to yourself, the figure continues looking you over, she seemed fixated on the weapons on your persons, your bayonet, sidearm, and grenades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes change colors again, but this time to a glowing red color making you feel a shiver of fear creep down your spine. \"Uh oh\" you say, you turn to run, but you find that you can't as you are lifted into the air and rotated so that you are facing the fox figure. She says something in that strange language, but this time instead of singing, she says it in a neutral voice, completely devoid of emotion. \"Listen I don't know what you're saying, I was wondering if you could help me get out of here\" you say with your hands raised. She says something again and this time is sounded like she was asking a question, you adjust the rifle sling that was across your chest, but she must have thought you were doing to harm her, because next thing you knew she was shouting at you in that strange language. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the energy in her eyes radiate more making it look like her eyes were on fire, \"no no no wait hang o----\" before you could say anything else you find yourself being launched backwards through the air. You go crashing into at least five trees before coming to a painful stop on a patch of dirt, you roll over and spit out a mouthful of blood, surprisingly no teeth. You inhale and you can tell you have at least three broken ribs and judging from the pain in your hands you have two broken fingers, and one finger jammed, your left shoulder was dislocated, and there was a sharp pain in your right leg. You look up and see the fox figure float back down onto the boulder, you attempt to stand to get away from her, but you fall back down when you try to put weight on your right leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab your leg and thats when you could tell it was broken too, you look at the fox again and you see she was walking across the water like she was walking across solid ground. As soon as she made it to land she ran over to you, with your right hand you draw your sidearm and aim at her, because your pointer finger was broken you would have to use your middle finger to pull the trigger. \"Please no more\" you beg, but as she got close you saw her eyes no longer had the glowing energy in them and her face showed emotion, something that it didn't have 30 seconds ago. \"I'm so sorry are you ok?\" she says in perfect English, you must have hit your head when you got thrown because before you could say anything, everything was getting dark and you began to pass out.</span></div></div>",

Mira broke free from the tails and ran over so she was standing between you and the multi-tailed fox, \"Ember, its ok he's not going to hurt me, he interrupted me during one of my meditations\" she says, you notice the fox named Ember's face wince.

She opens the chest and inside was all your belongings and weapons, you walk over and get dressed. \"It looks like I will be staying here until I decide what to do with this stranger\" says Ember pointing at you, \"hey I'm not a threat\" you say raising your hands. \"That is yet to be determined in my book\" says Ember, she walks over to a blank spot in the room and waves a hand, like the chest rising from the floor, a door suddenly appears on the wall, she opens it and walks inside.

After you finish eating she grabs you and lays down on what looks like a couch near the fire pit and sets you on her stomach, lightly petting your head again. Even though it was a strange feeling being petted, you were starting to like it, you lay down on her furry stomach and stare up at the ceiling.

She hugs you with her arms the way a child would hug a stuffed animal, you couldn't do anything, but pray that Mira doesn't hug you any tighter and cause you to suffocate. About an hour later you can hear her snoring lightly and her grip on you loosened quite a bit allowing you to escape her grasp if you wanted to, suddenly you feel two finger grab you and pick you up, you look over and see it was Ember. \"What do you want no---\" before you could finish she silenced you by putting a finger over your mouth and carried you to her room without saying anything to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits on her bed and set you down in front of her, \"what are you doing?\" you ask in a concerned voice. \"I want to apologize for my attitude toward you earlier, I was doing some thinking and if Mira seems to trust you, then I should too\" she says. \"Oh--um apology accepted\" you say a little confused, \"and I was hoping that maybe we could start over on a different foot\" she adds, you nod, \"sure I think thats a good idea\" you say. Ember gives you a small smile, \"by the way I never got your name\" she says, \"its Michael or Mike for short if you like\" you tell her, holding out your hand, which she shakes using her finger. Suddenly the door opens and Mira walks in \"hey Ember have you seen----oh there you are\" she says noticing you on the bed, \"wait why are you in here?\" she asks confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just talking\" says Ember, \"wait I thought you said you didn't trust him?\" she asks, \"well I'm kind of doing a fresh start with him\" Ember says. \"Oh well that good\" says Mira, \"that reminds me I wanted to ask you something\" you say to Ember, she tilts her head, \"I saw your tails combine together into one, can she do that too?\" you ask pointing to Mira. \"You mean this?\" Mira asks, just like Ember her one tail suddenly divides into seven tails, \"you see we use our tails for many things, like lifting, an extra set of hands, even eating\" says Mira. \"Wait eating? How do you do that?\" you ask deeply confused, one of Ember and Mira's tails move toward you and stop near your face, suddenly the tips open up into a mouth-like opening making you fall back in surprise. Slowly they snake their way toward you and hover near your face again, the only thought running through your head at the time was, \"oh god they're going to eat me\", but instead of eating you they kiss you on the cheeks, leaving you confused. It was like being kissed by a normal person, but also being brushed on the face with the softest fur you could think of at the same time, both Ember and Mira sat there giggling at your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a knock on the front door causing both girls to stop laughing, \"who's that?\" you ask. \"There's only two other people that know where I am besides Ember\" says Mira, \"who?\" you ask again. \"Mira's parents\" says Ember, \"oh......um what happens to me now\" you ask, both Ember and Mira look at each other.......</span></div></div>",

You saw no one, but as you scanned to the left again you could make out what looked like a figure standing behind some trees, as you point your rifle at the figure you hear a puff of air followed by something sharp hitting you in the side of the neck. You reach up and pull some type of blow dart out of your neck, you feel your arms become heavy and your visions starts to blur, \"whaa---\" you start to say, but your speech becomes slurred, soon you lose all sense of balance and fall down face first, but lucky for you, you're out before you hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come to you find yourself in some type of holding cell, you look around slowly and find that your vest, rifle, and backpack were gone, but for some reason your captors forgot to take your sidearm still strapped to your leg. You attempt to grab it, but you find that you are having trouble moving you right arm, you try using your left arm, but you are also having trouble moving that arm too. You try your other limbs and find that you are having trouble getting them to respond too, so far the only thing you can move is your head. Suddenly the door to the cell opens and a figure walks in and pulls some type of black cloth bag over your head to prevent you from seeing where you were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your arms bing grabbed and you being dragged out of your cell, after being carried for a couple minutes you are set down, but the mask is left on your face. \"Where did you find this strange creature?\" you hear a female voice say, \"we found him near the riverfront m'lady, we found these on him as well\" says another female voice. You hear a thump that you assume as the female dropping your confiscated gear in front of you, \"let me see his face\" commands the first female.

She was human like, but she was covered from head to toe in red/brown fur, sticking out of the red hair on her head were two pointed ears. Her hands were human like, but they were covered in black fur, her feet though were paw-like and also covered in black fur, swishing behind her was a red/brown fur covered tail with white fur on its tip. Her face was a canine-like muzzle, she had dark brown eyes that seemed to be studying you, just like you were doing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is he restrained?\" asked the fox, \"he's not restrained m'lady, we're holding him up because his limbs are still paralyzed from the toxins\" says one of the females holding onto your arms. The fox gets off the throne and walks over to you for a closer examination, \"careful m'lady\" says another female, \"I thought you said he was still paralyzed?\" asks the fox, \"he is, but I don't know when it will wear off\" says the unknown female. \"Hmm where are the things you found on him?\" asks the fox, \"here\" says a third female, you watch as a human like wolf walks forward carrying your rifle, vest, and bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox picks up your M16 rifle and examines it first, \"interesting I've never seen a weapon like this before\" she says turning the rifle over in her hands. Slowly you feel the ability to move your limbs start to return, you realize that the two females were only holding you up and not holding onto you tightly, you contemplate breaking free and drawing your sidearm, but before you could the fox hands back the rifle and approaches you. \"So tell me strange being, what are you?\" she asks, \"I'm human\" you manage to say without slurring your words too mush. You get a hard hit on the back of the head, \"you will address the Empress as m'lady or Empress Sasha\" orders one of the female holding you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox raises a hand, \"its ok he meant no disrespect, he does not yet know our ways and customs\" says the fox. You turn around and see that the female that struck you was a human-like cat, the look on her face said that she didn't trust you, \"can you stand?\" asked the fox, \"I can try um m'lady\" you say this time without your voice slurring. She nods and orders the two female to help you to your feet, you sway from side to side before finally regaining you balance, \"now tell me what is your name?\" asks the fox, \"my name is Henry Empress um... m'lady\" you say saving yourself from getting hit again. The fox gives you a small smile, \"Sasha, its Empress Sasha\" she says, \"if you don't mind me asking Empress Sasha, but what do you plan on doing with me?\" you ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" says Sasha deep in thought.........</span></div></div>",

You walk over to the bed and touch the soft sheets with your hand, \"where will I sleep?\" you ask as you turn around, \"with me of course\" says Sasha.

As you open them again you see you were in a large room that had large wooden support beams with colorful banners adorned on them. Leading toward the center of the room was a bright red rug with gold trim, at the end of the room on a slightly raised platform was a throne, but what was sitting on the throne was surprised you the most. Sitting in the throne was an female anthro feline of sorts, you couldn't tell exactly what type of feline it was because it had features that belonged to a lion, leopard, and a tiger. The feline looked you over with glowing yellow eyes while you did the same, she wore a clothing that made it obvious she was in charge, but in charge of what was still a mystery to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what felt like hours the feline looked you over and sat on the throne in silence, little by little you feel the ability to move your limbs return. As you regain movement in your hands and arms, you realize that you weren't bound, but merely being held up by two sets of hands and they weren't holding very tightly onto you. Suddenly the feline gets off her throne and walks over to you and makes a gesture and the two sets of hand pull you to your feet. She stops in front of you and examines your gear on the floor next to you, she reaches down and picks up your rifle. After turning it over in her hands she sets it back down and looks at you, \"well two things are obvious: you're human and you're some type of soldier, but whose army you belong to, I don't know\" she finally says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find any more like him?\" she says to a female anthro german shepard, \"no your majesty\" says the guard. \"Hmm take him back to the cells while I decide what to do with him\" says the feline, you didn't want to go back to the cell they had kept you in so you start fighting to get free. \"Quit your struggles\" ordered an anthro Wolf, during the struggle you fell over due to still being slightly paralyzed, \"get to your feet\" the german shepard ordered. \"Screw you\" you yelled, the guard grabbed you by the shirt and lifted you up, \"why you little....\" she said as she raised a clawed fist and prepared to strike you. In one quick motion you reached down, drew your sidearm and jammed it under her chin causing her to freeze. At that moment the whole room went quiet, no one moved, the sound of clapping broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over and see the figure you know as 'her Majesty' standing there clapping, \"my initial assumptions about you were wrong\" she says with a smile. \"Samantha let the human go\" she says to the dog, who lets go of your shirt, \"Sara come here and find our guest a room for now\" says the figure. A female anthro fox comes out from behind the throne and walks toward you, \"follow me please\" she says in a soft voice. Slowly you holster you handgun while maintaining eye contact with the german shepard as you follow the fox out of the room into a long corridor. \"Who was that?\" you ask when the two of you are alone, \"she is The Empress, she is the ruler of our people\" answers the fox, \"ok, but what is her name?\" you ask, \"here is your room, someone will come for you later\" says the fox, she opens the door and leaves without answering your question. You enter the room and look around, in the center was a small bed that could hold two people, next to it was some type of wooden dresser and on the left wall was a large banner with some type of insignia on it, suddenly someone knocks on the door.........</span></div></div>",

You look down and tighten your seat belt and check your gear, suddenly you feel the helicopter shudder and then as quick as it came it stopped. \"What was that?\" asks the door gunner, \"don't know, but it and that rotor warning are gone\" says the pilot, \"I didn't find anything wrong\" says the crew chief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's goo-\" suddenly a klaxon sounds cutting you off, \"we just lost vertical thrust!\" yells the pilot, \"what does that mean?!\" you yell back, \"it means buckle up and hold on\" he yells.

You throw your gear out the opening in the helicopter and climb out after it, next to the helicopter you find two graves marked with makeshift tombstones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully climb off the helicopter taking care not to further injure your leg and collect your gear, you find some broken pieces of metal and make a splint out of them for your leg. You look at the graves and see they were for the two pilots, \"but where are the crew chief and door gunner?\" you whisper, you look around and see no prints in the sand anywhere. You grab your rifle and check it, it still worked despite the crash, you sit \"ok what do I do now?\" you whisper, you close your eyes and try to remember if you saw any villages nearby when you flew in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" you say as you open your eyes, you remember, you did see a small village about a mile and a half away from here. You get your bearing and make your way in the direction of where you remember the village was, \"maybe thats where the door gunner and crew chief went\" you say to yourself.

You relax a little, \"shes right\" you say to yourself, you take your hand of the knife hilt and she resumes walking over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf walks over and sits next to you, \"may I examine your leg?\" she asks, you hesitate, but nod, she carefully removes the splint. She runs her paws up your leg taking care not to cause you any pain, \"well I don't think anything is broken just sore\" she says. \"Well I have something for that\" you say as your reach into your bag and pull out your first aid kit, you pull out an ice pack, activate it, and put it on your leg where you feel the most pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about earlier\" you say to the wolf, she gives you a small smile, \"I'm glad you stopped and heard me out first\" she says. \"My name's John\" you say holding out your hand \"Sasha\" she says, shaking your hand, \"so why didn't you hurt me before?\" you ask. \"Because not all wolves are the big, bad stereotypes that everyone thinks we are\" says Sasha, \"some of us have feelings of compassion, love, and other emotions, we're not just wild killing animals\" she adds, staring at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt sorry for Sasha, having her whole species labeled as killers, you slowly reach over and set your hand on her shoulder and brushed her fur a little. Her fur was really soft to the touch, you could also feel her body heat radiating from beneath, she snapped out of her trance and looked over at you, giving you a half smile. \"Where are my manners, are you hungry?\" she asks, you nod, she gets up and walks over to the fireplace, she returns with two bowls of some type of soup, \"its not very filling, but there is plenty of it\" she says as she hands you a bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do I sleep for the night?\" you ask as you finish your soup, \"you can sleep on that bed if you want\" she says pointing to the bedding that you were sitting on. \"What about you?\" you ask, she shrugs, \"I'll figure something out\" she says, \"I can make room and you can sleep here\" you say. \"You trust me that much?\" she says, \"I should have trusted you earlier, you had the chance to hurt me and you didn't, you've taken me in, giving me a place to sleep and food to eat, I think I trust you\" you tell her. She leans over and gives you a small hug, you reach into your backpack and pull out your desert scarf to keep you warm during the night, you remove your vest, sidearm and helmet and set them at the foot of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrap the scarf around your neck and lay on the bedding, despite the fact that you had the scarf on and there was a fire in the house you were still freezing. \"Are you cold?\" Sasha asks, \"just a little\" you lie through chattering teeth, suddenly you feel hands grabbing you and pulling you into a warm embrace, you look over and see Sasha had grabbed you and pulled you close to her. Your head was now resting in her cleavage and her fur was warming you up, you look up at her \"comfy?\" she asks with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little\" you answer, she squeezes you lightly before laying her head down, \"goodnight John\" she says with her eyes closed, \"goodnight Sasha\" you say as you close your eyes.

Kino walks over to the fireplace and returns with two bowls of soup, she hands one to you, \"Kino, do you know where everyone is?\" you ask, she shakes her head, \"nope, woke up one day and everyone was gone\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well have you seen two other men come through here before me?\" you ask, again she shakes her head, \"no you're the first person I've seen in a long time\" she says. The two of you continue eating and talking, as soon as you finish your bowl of soup and Kino take care of it you become tired from todays events so you lay back down on the bedding and drift off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake the next morning, as you sit up and stretch you look over and see Kino asleep on the pillow next to you, you reach down and check your leg, it was still sore, but not as bad as yesterday, \"what are you doing?\" you hear kino ask. You turn around and see she was awake, \"nothing, just checking my leg\" you tell her, \"well don't mess with it you might make it worse\" she says. \"I know, you know its flattering that you decided to sleep in the bed with me\" you say, Kino lets out a laugh, \"well technically since its my bed you slept with me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, \"yeah I guess thats true\", \"come on I'll make breakfast\" says Kino as she gets up, but as you attempt to stand Kino stops you, \"nope, with that injured leg you stay there\" she says, \"well what am I supposed to do?\" you ask. \"Just sit there and look pretty\" she says as she walks over to the fire pit, minutes later she comes back with breakfast in hand, you took a bite, whatever it was it tasted good. \"This is really good\" you say pointing to your breakfast, she blushes, \"thank you, I'm glad you like it\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you see something that catches your eye, there was a foxes' tail behind Kino, \"what?\" she asks, she turns around and sees the tail. She lets out a heavy sigh, \"you would have found out eventually\" she says, \"found out what?\" you ask, before your eyes Kino changes and gains some fox-like features, more tails appear, she gains a muzzle, fur, paws, and pointy ears. She gets up and quickly leaves the room so you get up and follow her, she was in the front room standing by the fire pit, \"go ahead and run like the others\" she says still looking at the fire place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hopple up behind her, \"I'm not running anywhere\" you say, she turns and looks at you, \"you mean your not afraid?\" she asks, \"why should I?\" you ask. \"Well because I'm different\" she says, \"to be honest I think your beautiful\" you tell her. She smiles at you, \"really?\", you nod, she walks over and hugs you and starts sobbing lightly, \"are you ok?\" you ask, \"its just....thats the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me\" she says. You wrap your arms around her and return the hug, you feel her tails lightly cocoon around you, the two of you stay this way for what feels like twenty minutes before breaking the embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I can heal that leg if you want\" says Kino pointing to the makeshift splint on your leg..........</span></div></div>",

Kino walks over to her bed and pulls out a box, \"come sit down\" she says pointing to the bedding, you limp over and sit on the bed, she pulls out some type of armband and whispers something to it making some type of writing glow on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you,\"take off your jacket\" she says, you unzip your vest and uniform jacket, she takes the armband and ties it on your left arm, \"thats it?\" you ask, \"yep in an hour your leg should be fully healed\" she says. \"So earlier you said run like the others, who are the others?\" you ask, \"well in case you haven't noticed the rest of the village is empty\" she says. \"Let me guess, they found out that you weren't normal and it scared them away?\" you ask, she nods, you wrap your arm around her shoulder and pull her closer in a sort of half-hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minute later you start feeling a tingling sensation in your leg, more like bugs crawling under your pant leg, \"well thats intresting\" you say, \"what?\" Kino asks, you tell her what your feeling. \"Yeah thats just your leg healing\" she says..........</span></div></div>",

You hear the crying become whimpering as you walk inside, you sling your rifle and draw your sidearm due to the close space inside the house. You pull out a flashlight to help you see, because as you walked deeper into the house it became increasingly difficult to see in the dark. As you near what looks like a closet you hear the whimpering start to become louder, \"hello?\" you ask calmly, suddenly the whimpering in the closet stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you open the door and shine the light inside, what you saw almost made you drop the light, inside was a small child, but this child was a wolf complete with the gray fur, pointed ears, and a tail. At first you were tempted to just run away, but you decided not to, because human or not, it was still a child. You put away your sidearm and hold your hand out, palm up, to show you weren't a threat to it, \"its ok, I'm not going to hurt you\" you say in a calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf child looks over and sniffs the air around your hand and after determining that you weren't a threat slowly took your hand and comes out of hiding. You lead the child out into what looks like a living room/sleeping room combination and sit on the ground, \"can you talk?\" you ask him, but the wolf doesn't respond, just stares at you. \"Ok...um are you hungry?\" you ask, the child nods nervously, \"ok.. we're getting somewhere\" you say, you reach into your bag and pull out an MRE ration and open it. You get up and walk into what you assumed was the kitchen and find a small metal bowl, you wash it out with some water and put the entr\u00e9e in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return and pull out your miniature stove and use it to heat the food, after heating it up you hand it to young wolf. He sniffs it and tries some of it, suddenly he takes the bowl and starts to eat the food rapidly, \"easy don't eat too fast you'll give yourself a stomachache\" you say to him. While he eats you pull out your map to try to determine your location and where to go next, the wolf finishes eating and slowly sits next to you and looks at the map with you.  You find the village on the map and draw a small circle around it, while you think of what to do next, the wolf reached over, took the grease pen and drew a circle around the bottom of the nearby mountain, \"whats there?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes the pen again and draws a small house near the circle, \"thats your home?\" you ask, he nods, you notice tears forming in his eyes. You reach over and put a hand on his small shoulder, \"I'll get you there\" you tell him, he looks at you and then suddenly jumps up and hugs you around the neck. \"Easy, try to get some rest, we'll leave tomorrow morning, ok?\" you say to him, he lets go of you and nods, you reach into your bag and pull out a desert scarf and hand it to him, he sniffs it before taking, \"thats the best I can do for a blanket little guy\" you tell him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes it and wraps it around himself, it was really large on his little frame and it worked perfectly as a blanket. He lays down next to you and drifts off to sleep, you know you're going to be freezing tonight for doing this, but you take off you jacket, fold it up and lay it under his head as a pillow. You drape your second scarf over your chest and lay down, using your backpack as a pillow and soon you drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

He hands the scarf back to you, \"you can keep it\" you say, he gives you a small smile and then drapes it around his neck like you, You retrieve your jacket and put it back on. \"Lets get you home\" you say the two of you gather up any water and food and walk out the door, you use your map and compass to navigate to the mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for over three hours in te desert sun you finally reach the mountain, you take the little wolf off your shoulder, \"ok where now?\" you ask him.

You pull out your flashlight and walk in with your rifle slung and sidearm holstered, \"hello? is anyone here?\" you yell into the cave, no answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back outside, \"I don't think anyone is here little guy\" you say to the wolf, as you stand and turn around you get tackled by something big and heavy. You find yourself on the sandy ground looking up at a tall, male, gray wolf with his teeth barred and growling at you, \"trying to kidnap a child are you?...well I know what to do to people like you\" says the male as he raises a clawed hand. \"You've got it all wrong\" you say, \"do I?\" says the wolf, he prepares to swipe at you with his paw, suddenly the little wolf ran over and wrapped his arms around your neck as if to protect you. \"What is wrong with you child, defending this coward\" says the tall wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you give me a minute to explain, I'm not here to kidnap him, I'm here to bring him back home\" you tell the wolf. \"Show me the child's face, then I'll know if you are lying or not\" he says, slowly you remove the hat from the little wolf and show his face to the adult wolf. You see on his face that he recognizes the child and his claws retract, \"stay here\" he says, he walks into the cave leaving you laying on the sandy ground, minutes later he returns with a female wolf behind him. The little wolf lets go of you and runs over to the female wolf who hugs the little wolf tightly, \"it seems you were telling the truth\" says the male wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female wolf walks over to you, \"thank you for bringing him back home to me\" she says with tears of joy streaming down her face, \"You're injured?\" she asks noticing your makeshift splint on your leg, \"I don't think its serious, I'll be ok\" you tell her as you get to your feet, \"nonsense you will stay with us until that leg is healed\" she says. You follow her back to the cave and inside you see at least eight other wolves standing there, each one had the same look on their face that said what they thought about you.......</span></div></div>",

She leads you deeper into the cave, to your amazement the cave started to look a little modern, it had stairs cavred out of the rock, different passages and even doors for every room,  \"this is amazing\" you say, \"whats that?\" asks Crystal. \"How everything is carved out of the cave, those stairs, these rooms, it looks hand carved\" you tell her, \"its possible, our people have lived here for many generations, these passages spand deep into the mountain for miles\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter following up three sets of stairs and down two passages you arrive at her room, she opens the door, inside was a medium sized bedding of sorts. Next to it was a large mirror with brushes near it, just to the left of the mirror was a small window that looked out the side of the mounntain, \"you can set your things here\" says Crystal, pointing to one side of the room. You look back towards the door and see some artwork hanging on the wall, \"did you draw these?\" you ask examining them, \"yeah, they're nothing special, just doodles\" she says. \"They're amazing\" you say, you could draw pretty well, but in your opinion these were better than anything you could draw, \"you think so?\" says Crystal, \"yeah, here look at mine\" you say as you reach into your bag and pull out a notepad that you sometimes doodle in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are really good \"she says looking through the notepad, while she looks through the drawing you sit on the ground and remove your bag. You start going through your stuff to see what was damaged in the crash, surprisingly your tablet still worked because of its protective case. Crystal sees the tablet and picks it up \"whats this?\" she says looking the tablet over, \"its a tablet(IPad/Android)\" you tell her, \"what does it do?\" she asks. \"Well it can do many things like play music\" you say, you open a music player and play a song, Crystal looks around the room trying to find the source of the music, \"its that coming from that?\" she asks pointing to the tablet. \"Yep\" you hand the tablet to Crystal for her to play with, you continue checking all your stuff, after an hour Crystal hands the tablet back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its very interesting, if only you could use it to draw\" she says, \"you can\" you tell her, you open an art app and pull out a stylus and hand the tablet back to her. She sits next to you as you show her how to use the stylus and how to use the app, change pen sizes, colors, and how to use the different art tools. After a five minute tutorial, Crystal was drawing on the tablet with you looking over her shoulder, after a while you start to feel tired from your three hour walk to the mountain and you start to nod off with your head laying on her shoulder.................</span></div></div>",

You see Rex get somewhere between embarrassed and nervous, \"we--um---we smell each other\" he says rubbing the back of his head. \"Oh....well why didn't anyone try to smell me?\" you ask, Rex lets out a small, nervous laugh, \"because when you first walked into the cave you had a strong smell and everyone could smell it, no offense\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear footsteps behind you and as you turn around you see Crystal walking toward you, \"I thought I smelled you out here\" she says.

Crystal walks over and sits on the rock next to you, \"I was wondering earlier, why did you offer to have me stay with you?\" you ask, you see her fur flutter, \"um--well I---uh---you see----*sigh* I found you interesting and I was the only one here that didn't have a male mate--err---companion\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look back out the door, you noticed a reinforced wall running along the city dividing it from the rest of the world, suddenly you hear an alarm coming from the cockpit. \"Whats going on?\" you ask, \"I don't know, I have no control\" says the pilot, the helicopter started moving erratically, spinning randomly, and dropping in altitude before crashing on top of the reinforced wall dividing the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall split the helicopter in two, the cockpit containing the two pilots and two crew chiefs in one half and you in the other. Your half still had the spinning rotors on it and as it hit the ground both the tail and main rotor blades snapped, sending shards of rotor blades in every direction. Finally the main body came to a grinding halt and you stumble out the wrecked front and look around. As you look around you realize your half of the helicopter crashed inside the supposed quarantine zone, \"John?!\" you hear the pilot yell from the other side of the wall, \"I'm here\" you yell back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok?\" he yells, \"I'm good\" you answer, \"I don't think we can get you out\" he says, \"what do you mean, is your radio broken?\" you ask, \"no radio's fine, its that you're in a quarantine zone and no one goes in or out\" he says. You swear, \"so what now?\" you yell, \"hang on\" he says, a couple seconds later you hear him return, \"ok I'm throwing something over the wall that might help\" he says, you look up and see a small satchel fly over the wall. You catch it and open it, inside was a gas mask, two MRE's, a canteen, four emergency flares, and at least five pistol magazines for your Beretta handgun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" you ask, \"thats the best I can do to help\" he says, \"whats the mask for?\" you ask, \"we were told that if we came into contact with anything in there, that we should put that on\" he says. You became unnerved at this new info, \"great so now I trapped in here alone with god-knows-what\" you say to yourself. \"My suggestion, stay close to the wall and find some shelter\" says the pilot, \"Alright I'm going to try to find shelter for the night\" you say, you head back tot he crash site to retrieve your gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk around searching the buildings for a place to stay that will keep you concealed from anything that was living in the quarantine zone. After hours of searching you locate a single story building that offers a good combination of concealment and shelter just as the sun began to disappear behind the horizon. You open the satchel and take out an MRE to eat, but before you could open it you hear a noise outside, you remember what the pilot told you so put on the gas mask, grab your rifle and find a place to hide under some rubble,</span></div></div>",

You hear a loud crash come from one of the other rooms above you, the sound of footsteps seem to be heading towards what look like stairs. <i>\"Oh crap\"</i> you think to yourself as the footsteps draw near, you look around and find a small storage closet, quickly you run in and quietly close the door behind you. You lift you night vision goggles and put the gas mask back on, unfortunately you can't use the goggles and the mask at the same time so you can only sit in the dark closet and pray that whatever was out there doesn't find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the footsteps walk by the door and fade away, you stay hidden in case it returned, sure enough not two minutes went by before the footsteps come back and stop out side the door. You reach for your bayonet on your vest to defend yourself in the small room, but the footsteps leave without touching the door. Quietly you remove your mask and don the goggles again, you open the door slowly, on the ground around the door were more of those footprints, but thankfully they seem to be leading towards the front door. <i>\"Whatever that thing was its gone\"</i> you say to yourself, after a brief search you locate a basement and from the lack of footprints in the dirt, this was the best place to stay for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way downstairs and find a secluded area of the basement to sleep for the night that won't leave you laying out in the open in case that thing returns.

The cheetah still had its arms around your chest as it raised its head and looked at you, \"tag you're it\" it said in a female voice with a smile, \"what?\" you say shocked that it just spoke perfect english. \"I said tag you're it\" she repeated, \"wait, you're not going to hurt me?\" you say confused, \"why would I hurt you?\" she asks tilting her head to the left slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well because you're...umm\" you say struggling for the polite word to describe her, \"an animal?, a monster?\" she says finishing your sentence as she climbed off you, \"I was going to say different\" you tell her as you sit up. She shrugs, \"same thing\" she says, \"why did you chase me?' you ask, she grabs her left arm and rubs it nervously, \" I...uh..well you're the first person I've seen in a long time and I liked having someone else as company and...well..yeah\" she says nervously. \"I'm guessing you want me to stay?\" you ask, \"well..I mean if---you know--if you want to\" she says nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there and think for a minute, the whole time you were thinking you could see the cheetah fidgeting nervously as she waited for your response. You look at her and nod, \"I'll stay\" you tell her, in the blink of an eye, she grabbed you and hugged you close to her, you could hear her purring loudly as she squeezed you tightly, You feel her soft furry chest press up against your face the whole time she was hugging you, it was a little odd considering you don't even know her name yet, but somewhere in the back of your mind you liked it. \"Umm ma'am can you let me go?\" you ask, \"oh sorry\" she says as she lets go of you, \"its just I'm a little excited you decided to stay\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its ok, um if you don't mind me asking since I'm going to be staying, but what's your name?\" you ask. She smiles at you, \"my name's Matahari, but you can call me Matty for short if you like\" she says, \"my name's Paul\" you say holding out your hand. Matahri shake you hand and helps you to your feet, \"why did you say \"tag you're it\" when you tackled me?\" you ask, you see the fur on Matahari's face flutter, \"umm I really don't know, it was just the first thing that popped in my head at the time\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Matahari back to the workshop that you ran from earlier, but this time she takes you upstairs instead of the basement. The upstairs was completely different from the first floor in many ways, the second floor was like an apartment, it had one large room and a small hallway off to the side. Inside the large room was a kitchen/living room/ bedroom combo, the couch in the middle of the room had a bed unfolded from it and off to the left was a small kitchen. \"You can set your things over here\" says Matahari pointing to an empty corner of the kitchen, \"so what do you want to do first\" you ask Matahari, she looks at you.......</span></div></div>",

Something in her voice made you relax and she again started to remove the mask, she took the mask and set it on the ground next to you. Even without the mask obscuring your vision, you still couldn't tell what the figure was, she wrapped her arms around you and pulled you close to her in a sort of hug with her tail wrapping around you.

Her fur is grey tipped with black, and the clothes she wears are tattered and torn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering last night, you decide that she has not shown herself to be a threat so far. She speaks first. \"My name is Ima.

You're clearly not from the area.\" You describe the events of the crash, and Ima listens with concern evident on her face. When you finish the story, she looks crestfallen. \"I'm sorry... Here I'd hoped...\" She trails off, and though you don't want to pry, you can't help but ask. \"Hoped what?\" After a pause, she goes on. \"Well, it's silly, now that I think about it. But I'd hoped the quarantine was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was meaning to ask,\" You start, \"Why is this place quarantined?\" The expression that crosses Ima's face tells you that she's trying to figure out how to phrase it. \"Our city was hit by a bomb. They thought it was carrying a disease, so they closed everything off- it was just supposed to be until they could make sure nobody was sick. But then we lost all contact with the world outside.

The two of you sit in silence for a while, before Ima says, \"Say, why don't I show you around town?\" Agreeing that it sounds like a good idea, you follow her out the door.

You completely lower your rifle, \"come follow me\" she says waving toward the door, you hesitate, \"where?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just trust me\" she says as she turns and leaves, you let out a small sigh before following her outside, \"I have to ask, why did you smash through the window?\" you ask. \"I thought that someone had captured you and were holding you prisoner\" she says, \"so she's concerned about me.

After about an hour of talking the male let out a small sigh and nodded, Miko walked back to you, \"who was that?\" you ask, \"my father\" she says. \"Here let me introduce you to everyone else\" she says, you follow her over as she introduces you to her mother and two sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your the oldest?\" you ask after you introduce yourself to the last family member, \"no I'm the middle one\" she says. \"really, the three of you look the same age\" you say.

She points to what looks like a scar that runs across her right eye, but as you look closer you realize that it was a length of white fur and not a scar. \"My older sister has a patch of white fur on her forehead and my younger sister has a patch on her muzzle\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, my father says that if you are to stay here, you have to help us gather food and supplies just like the rest of us\" she says.......</span></div></div>",

As you walk in the front door Miko's mother walks over and looks at what you found, \" oh what a nice find\" she says taking the blankets. Miko's mother looks at you, \"why don't you go lay down, you look tired\" she says, you laugh \"I feel tired\" you tell her, she looks over at Miko, \"Miko will you find a place for our guest to rest\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiko nods, \"I was planning on resting a little also\" she says, Miko's mother looks at her and then at you and seems to be putting two and two together because she gives the two of you a big smile. Your too tired to make any sense of what was going on so you just walk away to find a place to sleep, Miko walks up behind you and steers you toward a small, empty room in the back of the house. \"Let me guess, your room?\" you say as you walk in, \"yep\" she says, you shrug and find a spot on the floor to sleep. \"Why are you laying over there, there's a mattress over here\" says Miko, you look up and see on the other side of the room was Miko sitting on a small bare mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm just so tired I could sleep anywhere\" you tell her, she lets out a small laugh, \"here maybe I can help\" she says. Suddenly you feel her tails snaking their way around your body and lifting you up and pulling you toward the mattress, she sets you on the mattress. She lays herself on top of you giving you a good view of her chest, but your eyes were locked with hers, she leans forward and gives you a long lasting kiss, to you it was a bit odd because of the fur on her muzzle tickling your nose. She wraps her arms around your head and rests her head under your chin, you run your fingers through the fur on her sides making her twitch, \"stop it that tickles\" she says into your ear. \"Thank you for letting me stay here\" you say, Miko smiles and gives you a soft squeeze with her tails, \"its the least I could do\" she says, you close your eyes and soon drift off to sleep...........</span></div></div>",

Even with your face covered, the cold stings at your eyes, and you quickly lean back in. Turning to the pilot, you speak with disdain. \"Is it really that important that we come all the way out here?\" Without turning back to look at you, he responds, \"Look, I don't care much for it either, but there's nothing we can do.\" <i>He's right of course</i>, you think to yourself. It was the kind of assignment that wasn't worth arguing about. That didn't mean you had to enjoy it. \"Honestly, I'm not sure why-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're interrupted as the helicopter jolts. There's a loud clang, like it's been stuck by something, and a horrible grinding noise followed by the acrid smell of smoke. Before you can ask what's going on, the pilot speaks with a commanding tone. \"We're losing altitude fast!\" You see him frantically working the controls, but the sight is quickly obscured by thick black smoke. You grab an oxygen mask off the wall, holding on to a grip on the wall with all your strength. The craft swings to the side, and you are nearly thrown to the ground. The pilot shouts something, but you can no longer hear. You barely register that you can see the ground, even from where you're standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you can't immediately tell where you are. The you are still wearing the mask, though it has been cracked, and it's been severed from the craft. There is a pressure against your lower back- while you are lying underneath something, you don't seem to be pinned. The air still smells of smoke, and you can't seem to register sound normally. You pull yourself free from the wreckage, across the ice which seems to have melted, leaving it damp. Once you've cleared the helicopter, you remove whats left of the oxygen mask and roll onto your back to survey what's left of the helicopter.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you notice is that the tail cone has separated completely. The helicopter his heavily dented and bent out of shape- you see that it's buckled in on itself. The top sticking down must have been the pressure you felt. The cockpit is surrounded by shattered glass, and you cannot see the pilot. Looking up at the main rotor, you can see something tangled around it, but it's impossible to make out just what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and check yourself for injuries, and don't find anything too serious. You're sore, and you've got plenty of cuts and bruises, but you know enough basic first aid to manage. With that in mind, you walk gingerly back to the helicopter to see what you can salvage. You find your gear mostly intact, as well as the helicopter's first aid kit. Using the wreckage as shelter, you clean and bandage your cuts, and quickly change into cleaner and drier clothes. You'd still look a mess to anyone who saw you, but at least you won't catch hypothermia or anything. You lean heavily against the helicopter, trying to make a plan. Then...</span></div></div>",
