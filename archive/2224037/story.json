            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was with great glee, that I thrust my blade into the chest of my younger brother. I felt triumph as I watched the light fade from his eyes as he slipped into a crimson dream. How I hated you, Jared, everything about you; chosen to be the great champion by that bitch of a sorceress, while she warned the elders of 'the cancerous evil that would one day grow in my heart'. I had lost everything, and more; cast from the village, my home, the woman that was to be my wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I realized life was unfair, as I slept in the dirt, like a dog. Those with power shaped the world and I never wanted it, but you did, did't you? I had toiled in the village for many years; only to be cast aside because I was born a devil, so I swore an oath; the only one that matters. Take what I want and do what I please, I will be the master of my own destiny no matter who's blood must be spilled, even if it be yours 'brother'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were my thoughts as I watched the last bit of life fade from my brother, lighting struck overhead driving the beast within me. I tore my sword from his chest, the blade was a crude thing black as night jagged serrations caked with raw flesh. I don't remember how it found its way into my possession, but since then It has rarely stood still in my grasp. Too many have died by my hand, some of them I regret killing, most I do not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brought my blade across the sword of light, shattering it destroy its power. Now that there were no more threats before me; I could rest, take my place upon the throne within the fortress where none born under the sun dare venture.      </span></div></div>",
