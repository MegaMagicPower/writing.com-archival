He doesn't really fit in to a school cliques and is kind of a loner but the friends he does have are good and loyal to him. A rumor around school is he is the most unlucky person there. It is not because he is clumsy but because he enters the wrong room at the wrong time all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne time he entered a room as some bullies were stealing a kids wallet, not only did they steal his wallet to they beat him up for looking at their faces.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Something that I never thought I would ever bring myself to doing I have succeeded at doing; that being creating a personal journal, I have nothing against journals I just never really had anything I cared to remember in that much detail. I mean my life wasn't interesting....that is before some special events that triggered my being here starting this journal for anyone who cared could read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with all that I have experienced recently I decided to keep a record so I would be able to remember as much as I can of all the events I have encountered. And I can hopefully to convince the non believers who choose to read this of what I have experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost likely if you are reading this it means something along the fatal lines has probably happened to me or I am seriously injured and can't recount the tale of events that I have experienced personally....but as un-believeable as it may get I swear all the events are true....at least from one side of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I best get started then. And I think the best spot would be with an introduction of who I was before I get too far ahead of myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy full name is Charles William Black, though most people just call me Charlie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a senior in high school. Though I never really felt like I belonged there I didn't have many friends. But the ones I did have were the best friends anyone could ever ask for. They were loyal, dependable and supportive of everything I tried to do. I know it may sound cliche but that is just how they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am what you would call unlucky. Most people that know me know to stay a \u201csafe\u201d distance away from me at times. The rumors in the school call me \u201cthe most unlucky student in the school\u201d. If something can go wrong in my presence it normally does. People would call this clumsy but that is not it my problem is with being in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of my more notable examples of this would be during about my freshmen year of high school I was having a grand old day minding my own business with few and far between problems through out the day, then I went to the bathroom and pow I ran right in to a horde of six bullies that were in the process of taking a kids money. So conveniently for them I walked in because the other guy didn't have much money on him so long story short they took all my money I was saving for a new video game and started wailing on me for seeing their face's. That was one of the more extreme cases I have had but they are all pretty bad just as a general note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome other trivial things that may help you to know who I am are. I have two parents my mom is a small woman is size only being just under 5'4\u201d. She had long auburn hair and a voice as smooth as velvet, she loved working out giving her a slim but toned body she defiantly knew how she wanted to look and shot for it 110%. also her cooking is amazing and she knows it, trying at least one new recipe every week, it is something that I always look forward too. That being said she was one of the top legal attorneys in the city, when she was in the court room it was as if her client had let her off a dog leash to rip her opponents case to shreds.... at least that is what her friends at work tell me when I see them every so often. but she hid that side of her well normally she was a kind gentle woman helping anyone she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext is my dad he is about 6'2\u201d an average build. But unlike my mom her was just a small time accountant, one noteworthy thing is he is on my school's school board. He got on when he had a teacher that picked on some of the students in class just to make them feel like fools. He got on and made her life a living hell. She didn't quit but she did stop picking on the students. He found he enjoyed the school board and has been happily on it for the past 6 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is my family I do love them very much. Though I can't remember if I said goodbye to them or not the last time I saw them.....pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Until next time-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie Black</span></div></div>",

While out one night something happens that changes your entire perception on myths forever. who will you meet? will they change you? this is a chronicle of everything that happened during and after that fateful night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthis is a story that so long as the chapter is relevant to the story it is fair game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwrite however you want, but try to make it make sense and have good spelling and grammar.<br>\r\n(i would rather have good spelling over grammar, it is just one of those things that annoys me when things are misspelled)<br>\r\n<br>\r\na fun idea for this might be to go with a journal/diary entry format. but if you don't want to do it that way it is fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules:<br>\r\nno out of place add ins. If he/she is just walking down the street and gets shot by a random shrink ray then that is a no no. but if you build up for it then that is ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will start off with a low content rating to restrict super gore, or in-depth sex scenes. If you want to add something that is more on the violent side or sex then message me and I will think about changing it. Just send me what you wanna add and I will decide on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep the story going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther then that go at it and write something<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Characters: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe main character: boy or girl around the age of a high school or college student. And has the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny Simmons: great friend hot and knows it, she is on the more popular side and is a little ditsy but she is nice to you so you are friendly terms with her. Not into the supernatural thing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss Kelly: your best friend. You have known him since you were toddlers and  you can tell him anything. He is superstitious but not really into the supernatural<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue Fox: a quiet friend. She doesn\u2019t talk much but you like hanging out with her anyways. She is completely into the supernatural anything that comes out about supernatural matters she is into it. Almost an encyclopedia about any supernatural creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdd a new character as you see fit ( I did not include any supernatural creatures but they are out there)<br>\r\n<br>\r\non a side note. For good additions I will give out GP. So feel free to add something.</td>",
