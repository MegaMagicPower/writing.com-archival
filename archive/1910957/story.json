As she jogs down the alleyway, a strange door catches her eye. It's made entirely of metal, and looks out of place with the rest of the things in the alley. What's more, it seems to lead into a building that was the site of an explosion a few years back. Overcome with curiosity, Linda tries it. To her surprise, it opens, though it's a bit rusty and sticks a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the whole building seems to be long abandoned, which makes sense all things considered. Judging by all the lab equipment lying around, Linda guesses that this was some sort of research facility. She eagerly begins combing through the junk, hoping to find something useful in her own tinkering, but all the good stuff appears to have been broken or picked clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, she's just about to leave when she hears a small voice. \"Hello? Is anybody there?\" She perks up when she hears it, and searches for the source. \"I-if there's anybody there, would you mind lending me some help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her search for the voice, Linda stumbles upon a strange jar sitting on a shelf, covered in dust, and with a lid bristling with complicated looking equipment. The fluid inside glows somewhat, and she can faintly make out something floating inside. Wiping away the dust, she takes a look and nearly drops the jar in shock. Inside, is a brain. There's no stem, and it appears to be free floating. \"I- I'd really like some help if you don't mind...\" Well, at least she's found the source of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?</span></div></div>",

Are you alive in that jar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the brain pipes up again, it's voice is very excited. \"Oh thank you! Someone has finally found me! I was starting to think I'd be alone here forever! To answer your questions, YES! and, I think so... for a certain value of alive anyway. I'm not really sure how, except that it has to do with this stuff I'm floating in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda giggles as she examines the jar. \"So, what's your name? Or should I just call you brainy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh, sorry! It's been a while since I've talked to anyone. My name is Jamie! I'm a- well, I <i>used</i> to be a weasel. Now I guess I'm just a weasel's brain in a jar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hi there Jamie! My name is Linda. I'm an otter,\" She informs him as she examines his jar. \"You know, I hope you don't mind me saying this, but you look kind of cute considering you're a brain in a jar. But you're really dusty though. How long have you been here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie stammers at the unexpected, though not unwelcome, compliment. \"I-I don't know, a while ago I guess? They kinda just left me here to sit and stew after plopping me into this jar...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that wasn't very nice of them, whoever <i>they</i> are.\" Linda decides to break the news of the lab's seeming abandonment to him. \"I... I don't know how to tell you this, but I think this place was abandoned a while ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abandoned? I... I must have been down here for longer than I thought... It's kind of hard for me to keep track of time since I can't really see... I've been so lonely though...\"</span></div></div>",

What's going on? A-are you taking me somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda smiles and nods, despite the fact that he can't see. \"Yup. I think you've spent enough time alone in this dusty old lab. I'm taking you home with me so that you can finally have some company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really? Thank you! Thank you so much! This- This is the best day of my life!\" He continues to chatter on about how grateful he is, as Linda carries him to her Apartment. When they get there, Linda sets him down in her room on the computer desk, next to the monitor. The room is fairly small, and filled to the ceiling with all sort of scientific looking machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" She starts, \"Here we are. It's not exactly big, but you don't take up a whole lot of room, so that's alright.\" She turns her computer on. As it whirs to life, she turns to address Jamie. \"Since you're just a brain, if you need me to do anything for you, all you have to do is ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie bubbles in his jar. \"Thank you,\" He says softly. \"This is really nice of you. You know, you sound really pretty. I bet you look pretty too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda blushes at the compliment. Fortunately for her, he can't see this. \"Why thank you Jamie~ And like I said earlier, you're pretty cute yourself.\" She pats his jar, and then...</span></div></div>",

Why don't we see about fixing that! Um, do you mind if I take you out of your jar? I want to get a look at your optic nerves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie pulses nervously. \"I- I don't know. I think I kind of need to stay in this jar. It could be dangerous to remove me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, maybe I could just kind of... flip you over? There doesn't seem to be any wires or anything connecting to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the people who did this said something about using a non intrusive wireless interface to connect me to my speakers and microphones. So that's why I don't have any wires. But how exactly would flipping me upside down help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right. Sorry. Maybe I could just look at your speaker and microphone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay, I guess... Just, be careful alright? Being blind is bad enough, I don't want to be deaf and mute too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise, I'll just look,\" Linda says softly. With that, she unscrew Jamie's lid and begins to examine it. While she's doing so, Jamie is unable to hear or talk, and is completely cut off from the world. Linda takes the cover off of the lid, and checks for anything that might be used to attach a camera.</span></div></div>",

Reluctantly concluding that she didn't have anything compatible with his jar in its current configuration, she starts putting the lid back together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finishes and places it back on his jar, Jamie gives a sigh of relief. \"Ah, that's much better. So... Were you able to find anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Jamie. I wasn't. There was one spot that might have been for a camera, but I don't have anything that could fit. Not without seriously rewiring your lid.\" She sighs in disappointment, and sits down and starts typing at her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's okay. I've been like this for a long time.

Well, instead of telling you, why don't I just show you?\" With that, she presses one final key, and a computerized voice chirps to life over her computer's speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Beginning brain extraction routines. Please stand by.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie pulses in confusion. \"Brain extraction routines? Linda, what are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles as she clears some space off of what looks like an impromptu operating table and lays down. \"Well, I've been wanting to try this for a while now. I've checked the math a thousand times, and I've set up all the machines I need to let my computer take care of it. Finding you just gave me the courage I needed to go through with it. Don't worry, I'll be back in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie continues to protest as previously unseen saw blades whir to life and begin the process of extracting her. However, his voice cannot be made out over the sounds of the operation. Eventually, the din caused by the machinery dies down as the process comes to completion. \"Linda?\" Jamie murmurs softly. \"Are you still there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a moment of silence, and then he suddenly hears her voice again, this time with an electronic twinge similar to his own. \"Y-yeah, I'm fine. That was just more intense than I was expecting.\" Her brain has been placed into its own jar, this one with a camera in addition to the speakers and microphone. There are a number of other devices attached to it, and unlike Jamie, her brain is wired into them, rather than floating freely within the tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we do now? Don't we need your body to take care of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hold on just a second. Removing me from my body was just the first phase of the operation. Giving me control of it was the second phase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright, if you say so...\" He trails off as the machines start up again.

Wait, you didn't take yourself out of your tank did you? because that's not what I meant either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I did..\" she blushes. \"Well, my body did, I'm putting myself back now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thank you. Please promise you won't do something like that again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I won't\" She blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie sighs in relief over his speakers. \"Thank you... I don't... I don't think I could handle being alone again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picks up his jar and sits down after safely returning her brain to it's own jar. \"Don't worry, you'll never have to be alone again now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise\" she smiles, \"But I have to say it felt pretty cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to take your word for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?~\" she offers. \"I mean.. i connected my brain, I could do the same for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, th-that's okay. I think I'd prefer to just stay in here.\" In actuality, he had developed a phobia of people touching his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" she smiles, and pads out of the room to grab something. When she returned, she had a blanket, and used it to wrap Jamie's jar up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda? What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know how well you can regulate temperature like that, so I wrapped a blanket around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Hmm... That's a good point. The temperature on that shelf I used to be on never really changed. But... what are you going to do to make sure I stay about the same temperature?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.. it shouldn't be too bad for you in here but.. if I have to I'll loan you my body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, that's alright. I'm fine in this jar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda smiles. \"I know you are. Come one, let's go.\" She stands up and heads out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie bubbles in his tank. \"So, um, where are we going Linda?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The jar fell straight down, landing on its base with a loud clang and a few sparks.  While the glass was thankfully still intact, the base had been badly dented in the fall, especially the speaker, which had its cover ping off and its cone bent.  \"Wh<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">a</font>-<b>dhsd</b><i>zzzzrt</i> -at?  He<i><b>rr</b></i><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">rrr-</font>\" came the heavily distorted voice, static and feedback further drowning it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\"  Linda blurted, grabbing the jar and cradling it to her chest.  While she didn't know who this was, why they were in a jar, or what she could do about it, she had enough sense to realize that, if she were left in a jar and abandoned in a blown out research facility, she wouldn't want people dropping her and breaking her tank.  \"Are you hurt?  Can you still hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>AAH</b></font> hear!  Ca<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">nzzrpt</font> not he<b><i>chCHKnn</i></b> me?\"  Came the jar's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda breathed a small sigh of relief, pretty sure that the brain had heard her and tried to answer.  Standing up slowly, Linda almost made a repeat performance and dropped the brain again as the mechanical ruckus intensified, though this time she was able to keep hold of the jarred brain.  Linda froze again, this time debating whether or not she should investigate the noise or get the hell out of hear before whatever secret government murder robot down there stomped in here and smashed her flat, and once again the situation changed while she was still deciding what to do.  The smashing and grinding ceased suddenly, replaced by a dull and somewhat comforting rumble like the engine of a small family car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh brain?  DO you know what that noise is?\"  Linda asked, searching the jar for a nameplate after addressing it... him?  What little of the voice she could still make out sounded male, though maybe it was the only voice the speakers were programmed to speak in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Linda was searching the jar for some indication of the occupant's name, the occupant very helpfully answered \"Yea<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><i>BBBttbbtt</i></font>sha assemb<b>RRRTT!</b> onta<i>click!</i>\"  From that garbled mess, Linda concluded that the brain seemed to know what that was, suggesting that it, or he, rather, also knew some things about this facility. Linda was pretty sure she heard the word 'assembler' in there somewhere, but that was about all she got.  Investigating the jar didn't give her much information either, only a few cryptic words written in faded ballpoint pen on a small small sticker on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PROJECT:  6</b><br>\r\n<b>MODEL: 3.2</b><br>\r\n<b>SUBJECT: J/Wea/M</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile 'subject' was probably who's brain this was, 'J/Wea/M' was probably not the name its... HIS mother gave him, and Linda didn't feel comfortable even pronouncing that as a word, much less addressing the brain by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter realizing that nothing had happened in a few seconds, and remembering what had happened every other time she took too long trying to figure out what she should do next, Linda made a snap decision.  She was ninety-nine percent sure that the brain had said 'assembler', and since it was an assembler in the room right next to where the brain had been stored, and had activated only after Linda picked up the brain jar, Linda thought it was possible that the machine was an assembler for brains in jars.  Maybe she would find some spare parts that would help her repair this jar, or maybe the assembler had some sort of automated repair feature.  If nothing else, 'assembler' didn't sound that dangerous, so Linda didn't see what harm could be done investigating it.  Carrying the jar over to the large metal door and setting it down gently beside it as she swung the surprisingly light door open, Linda was greeted by the 'assembler'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'assembler' was less a single machine and more a very small automated assembly line, a series of conveyor belts, robotic arms, laser scanners, and digital displays packed tightly into a room not much larger than the living room in Linda's apartment.  She could hardly squeeze into the room, which seemed to have been designed so that only 3 full-bodied people could fit in it at a time.  There was a small computer on a small desk with a small and ratty old stool set in front of it, the monitor bearing a sticker conveniently labeling it 'controls'.  Across from that was a reinforced chair bolted to the floor, a chair fitted with metal wrist, ankle, waist, neck, and head restraints and was seated beneath a large series of surgically equipped arms.  Finally, there was just an empty space near the door, and next to the end of the assembly line.  Linda didn't know if the space was just for anyone who wanted to sit in and watch, or maybe they were there to grab the brains as they came off the line, or if they just had some extra space left over after designing the room, but Linda could easily guess what the other two people would be doing in their spaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Linda...</span></div></div>",

She has a job, friends, and an annoying boss. However, she's very bright, and has an interest in all manner of strange things, as well as a large dose of curiosity. This leads her to explore what looks like an abandoned laboratory while taking a shortcut home from work. There she meets Jamie, and our story begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies- Weasel (formerly)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge- Uknown<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio- Jamie used to be a typical weasel boy. Until one day, his brain was extracted from his body and ensconced in a jar. The jar is equipped with speakers and a microphone, so he can hear and talk, but lacks a camera, meaning he can't see. He has no idea how long he's been this way, but it was presumably a long time. He's gotten lonely over the years, and is overjoyed when Linda finds him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies- Fox<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge- 25<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio- An acquaintance of Linda's and her next door neighbor, Erik loves one thing above all others: money. To this end, over the years, he has acquired a number of items and sold them to Linda in order to support her 'interests'. He deals with all sorts of things, and has many customers with similarly strange tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Use good grammar. I don't want to constantly edit chapters because they're riddled with spelling mistakes.<br>\r\n2) Try to make each chapter at least a paragraph. I know sometimes this isn't possible, so when you can't make at least a paragraph, try to make the options fun and unique.<br>\r\n3) Try to avoid endless lists of choices. We don't want anyone getting bogged down trying to get to the actual story.</td>",
