He learned that he was in the city of Bayville  N.Y. not to far from New York city. \" Well this place has a lot super powered people to it doesn't really matter,\" commented Ethan. As he was organizing his inventory he noticed a couple of guys sticking a flier on his shops window. Curious he stopped what he is doing an went to see what the were putting up on his store with out permission.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                As he opened up the door he noticed that these two looked like they were ready to pick a fight. He noticed that had light blue arm bands with letters F.O.H. on them. \" Pardon me young man would you please tell me what it is that you think you doing putting up fliers on my store front with out my consent,\" inquired Ethan?  \"We just doing are civil duty warning the mutie freaks that they are not welcome or wanted in our shops or towns.\" he replied.  \"You have a right to your opinion but I must ask you to take down the flier since you didn't ask for permission to put it up in the first place,\" said Ethan.    <br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n              \" Why are you mutie lover or something,\" the kid asked? \"No, but as I just got done explaining you put something up on my storefront with out my say so. If you don't remove it will have to call security to have you escorted from the mall and banned for vandalism and harassment. I don't want any trouble so why don't you and your friend here come back latter look through the shop for a costume for Halloween. Bring friends I'll give a discount to show no ill will towards you,\" said Ethan.   \"Alright we'll leave the store alone after all we're just looking out for the real humans and not those things.\" he replied.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                       Ethan listened to some more of the rant before he stopped them. \"Sorry, young man I would like to discuss some more but I have to be getting back to work. Before you leave can you give your names so can be sure to give you the discount for you and your party, replied Ethan. The young man answered,\"The name's James and my friend over there is Steven and we'll have are girlfriends with us when we come by latter,\" replied James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     \"See you then young man.  Would you do me a favor please pass the word around about my humble little shop. I could use all the advertising I can get,\" said Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \" No problem sir and thanks again ,\" replied James. With that they left. Ethan went back to the store thinking <i>I may be a servent of chaos but i am not a bigot I know to many powerful people. I really don't hate anyone. Dislike most them because I know them personally. I think the boy and his friends need to see life on the other side of the fence. Then maybe they will learn something. </i> With that in mind he went find the right costumes for James and his little group of biggots.  </span></div></div>",

Each wanting to see what the Britt would do. The groups who both happen to  be mutants and anything that was said or done about the subject was of interest to them. <br>\r\n      <br>\r\n            First of the groups  was one adult woman and 3 other teenage girls. The other group was made up of 4 teenage boys and girl. Ethan  noticed them when he was having that talk with those two young men minutes ago. From the interest they were showing he figured that they were mutants. So he went an put up the open sign in the front window of the store.  Tapping on the glass to get the two groups attention. When the one group of women noticed he motioned them to come to his shop.  The adult woman  a very beautiful black woman with  white hair was the first to come in the others hung back a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               Ethan figured that the woman was being cautious with her being the only one to come in here first.  \u201cGreetings  madam welcome to my costume shop.  From the way you and  the others were watching I can assume that you are mutants,\u201d said Ethan. Before the woman could respond  Ethan continued , \u201c It doesn\u2019t matter to me that you are a mutant or not, miss.\u201d  \u201c Ororo Munroe,\u201d replied the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \u201cThat\u2019s a  beautiful  name maim. If you are wondering about those two from earlier you don\u2019t have to have to worry about them at least in here. I nether  agree or support their beliefs. I am just trying to make living and everyone is welcome here. So if you and the others out there want to can come in look around  all the costumes are on discount or reasonable priced since it is Halloween tomorrow,\u201d said Ethan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    Storm found the man pleasant and felt compelled to at least to look around. Rembering the girls she excused herself to go get the others. \u201c Jean, Kitty,  Rogue it\u2019s all right  while we\u2019re here lets look around maybe we\u2019ll find some costumes for  tomorrow nights costume ball at the Professors estate,\u201d said Storm.  As soon as she said that the three teenage girls that were waiting entered into the store to look around.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For instants does the ball have a theme or just a loose guideline for the costumes,\u201d replied Ethan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u201cNo it\u2019s guests choice other than that nothing explicates to revealing,\u201d answered storm. \u201cThat\u2019s good to know it will help to find the right costume for all of you fine ladies. Don\u2019t worry about finding a costume I will help you to find one that is right for you. I once heard a customer say that Halloween is come as you aren\u2019t.
