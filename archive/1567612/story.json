A town so small it was just barely bigger than a village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden in the state of *bleep* and nestled in a ring of mountains and surrounded by a thick forest. Only one road goes into town and leaving means going back the way you came since the road stop's dead centre of  town in a cul de sac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamed after it's founder Edmund Alphonse Harrington the town was built in the early thirties and boasts a wide variety of things normally left out of such a qient community. A cinema as big as a multiplex, a zoo filled with exotic animal's, a massive school building as well as a five star restaurant, town hall, TV studio and a heck of a lot more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe housing was their of course, like a tiny version of the new York suburbia with only a handful of houses all of which were of the right side of town while the stores, the zoo and other buildings were on the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund had this vision that his tiny town of only a handful of people was just the foundation of a massive city easily rivalling the main metropolis of the country. He spared no expense in the town's construction, nor did he spare any on publicity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 5 years of constant construction, of hiring countless builder's, clerks and a wide variety of people to work and live in his town on march 19 1937 the town was officially complete. He then contacted every news station in the state, TV, paper's, radio. He had them all there at the town's ribbon cutting signifying it was now open to be shown in all it's glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a grand celebration, people celebrated from dusk til dawn that day, dancing, drinking and just about everything else you could think of that people considered 'partying' in 1937.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarrington was ecstatic, the reporter's loved what they were seeing and guaranteed that they'd make this the tourist hotspot he desired. Soon his dream would be realised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sun rose on March 20's......the town was deserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if everyone had just stopped what they had been doing and just got up and left in the middle of the night. Food lay half eaten on the table's that had lined the town's street's for this day, cigarette's barely a quarter smoked still smouldered on the ground, radio's still playing static as someone tried to change the station but stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Every one was just....gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====71 years later=======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA SUV sat beside the pump of a fill up station, the owner of the car grumbling as the number's continued to climb and climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I agree to this?\" The tall and reasonably muscled young man said grimly, he had blonde hair done in gelled spikes, wearing a giant's' jersey and black slacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause *munch* you promised Lindsay, Allen.\" Smirked the passenger in the back seat watching him while flinging popcorn down her throat. She wore a lose black t-shirt with 'Jack Skellington' on it stretched over her substantial chest, she also had blonde hair but done in a bob cut and held in place with a pink hair band. She wore several small necklace's of varying neon and an arm warmer on her right wrist, she finished of her look with a pair of black cut off's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Su.\" Allen grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey she's got a point...\" Exclaimed the one in the front passenger seat, he was  wearing a green and blue Hawaiian shirt over his slight frame, he had black done in a loose ponytail down to mid back, sickly green knee length shorts and badly beaten old sneaker's. He had one arm leaning out of the car and addressed his friend via the right mirror. \"....Your driving from one end of the country to the other cause the girl your drooling for wanted to 'see America' on the way to Miami.\" He laughed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah yeah.\" He sighed as the number's 'still' continued to rise, 'freaking gas'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what?\" Susan said perkily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know there's one more of you in there with a snide comment. Just say it and get it over with Barry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one he was addressing looked over his magazine for a moment before pulling it back up. \"Nah I'm good.\". Barry wore a button up shirt and jean's. He had his hair done in a short cut that was only a few inch's shy of being a crew cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen grunted at the comment while still watching the number's go up. Relief flooding him when they stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n$150.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I take dad's gas guzzler?\" He moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause it was the only on that'd fit all of us.\" Barry said curtly while he still read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen ignored him, he walked over to the attendant to pay the bill. He reached into his wallet to get the money.........if he had a wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped as he saw the expectant look on the attendant's face, his oil stained hand held out in a 'gimme' gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...well you see.\" He stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Allen I've got the money.\" His face lit up at the sound of his saviour's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards them from the store across the street was Lindsay. She had long flowing fiery red hair that reached her well rounded behind which was clad in a white material skirt, wearing a dark pink blouse that his  her reasonable 'asset's'. In both arm's she had a plastic shopping bag that looked fit to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith considerable skill she pulled a wallet out of her skirt pocket and produced a hundred bill, two twenties and a ten. Handing them to the attendant who snatched them greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about taking your wallet. I didn't have much left after I bought those t-shirt at the world biggest rubber band ball.\u201d Lindsay said perkily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d Allen said without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Cou-whipped-gh*\u201d Coughed Kenny, his front passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say Allen was far more interested in the girl in front of him than his friends comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then I guess that means we can take off.\u201d Said Allen as he turned to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Lindsay hummed. \u201cI just wish there was a little more time to see any sight's.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't get your hope's up.\u201d Said Barry, putting away his magazine. \u201cNot much to see in *bleep*.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou folks lookin' for a sight.\u201d Came an elderly voice. They all turned there head's to see an elderly man in a mechanic's uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGranpa not now.\u201d Said the attendant next to them. \u201cThis is my granpa, he used to run the station a for he got to old. Still likes to dress up and play mechanic though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush up boy!\u201d He growled at the young man before turning back to the other's. \u201cIf you want sight's, there's a town bout 2 miles long the road, just turn right when you get to the sign that says 'ED'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that story again.\u201d The grandson sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEd.\u201d Susan said with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup. 'ED' a genuine ghost town.\u201d The old man said smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry looked out with sceptic written all over his face. \u201cGhost town. Yeah right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's true. The ghost's of a thousand restless souls inhabit that town. Unchanged for over 70 years by the ravages of time.\u201d He exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen turns back to the younger man for a better explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c'ED' was supposed to be a town that'd put this area on the map. Had everything a big city normally has even with a town of only a few hundred.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds nice.\u201d Barry commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. When it was done the builder, ya know the guy the town was named after. Invited all these media people to the town, there was a big party all day an' night. But when the sun came up the next day.....everyone was gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup. Like they'd vanished into thin air. Now the entire town's supposed to be haunted. If you believe that sort of thing.\u201d The attendant said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen dared a look at Lindsey's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer look said it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat direction is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======20 minutes later=======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen was hunched over the wheel as he drove down a barren and cracked backwoods road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTown coming up.\u201d Said Kenny, his arm still out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked up to see the tiny town over the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow it really is tiny.\u201d Said Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes they past a large iron archway welcoming them to 'ED'. What the found strange was a large party banner under it displaying the towns grand opening. The banner still as sight and bright as the day it had been hung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drove to the centre of town and parked in the cul-de-sac. Other cars in various positions scattered the street, from parked to an old ford with the door's open and playing country western.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is....weird.\u201d Said Barry, looking down over the table that was still brimming with partially eaten food. \u201cYou think their was a party here a while ago?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that guy did say that the town was 'frozen in time'. Maybe this stuffs been lying here for 70 YEAR'S.\u201d Susan joked while she looked at the town with side way glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery funny. It's probably all just for show\u201d Allen said. \u201cOkay here's the plan. Wee only here for an hour then we leave kay. Now then we stick together and....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm going to the theatre.\u201d Said Kenny. Taking off towards the move house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw a sign saying 'zoo' on the way in. I think I'll see what they kept here.\u201d Exclaimed Barry going  in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat restaurant has my name written all over it.\u201d Said Susan before skipping off to the resterant with the 5 stars above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen looked at were his friends and sister had been a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll go with you.\u201d Said Lindsay with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen smiled. \u201cAnywhere in particular?\u201d He said while offering an arm which she happily accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo not yet. I wanna have a look around first.\u201d She said before the two walked off in a random direction.</span></div></div>",

The ticket counter was a tiny room with the two sets of double doors behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenny walked up to it, moving past the ticket counter he noticed that all the posters for the movies looked to be in top shape, not even a little yellowed from the decades unkept. He shrugged thinking nothing more of it and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rich red carpet covered the entire floor and was devoid of any stains or gum. Their were four other doors (6 if you include bathrooms) each leading to a differant theater, and in dead center f the room like an island. The snack bar. warm popcorn jumping in the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped over the counter. Looking at the old popcorn machine, still popping away kernals after more than 70 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached in slowly and latched onto a piece that jumped into his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't feel stale.\" After a second he popped it into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm this tastes great.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone else is here.\" Kenny said in conclusion, no other explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell except one, but he didn't want to consider it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging he scooped up a bag of popcorn and pulled a glass bottle of coke out of the chiller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over the movie titles over each screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These movies don't exactly scream 1920's.\" He muttered to himself. They looked more like titles for cheesy 1950 and upwards b movie titles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he selected his film and went into the theater with the title above it saying...</span></div></div>",

First row always made you bend your neck right back and made it hard to watch the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like magic that as soon as he parked himself down a light shoot for the projection room and making the movie appear, dramatic music starting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn screen was a typical old horror movie title, the words 'Night of the zombie bimbos' flashed across the screen dripping with what looked like slime while the movie started in the background, focusing in on the island of Hawaii like from a satellite view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture began to focus in more and more until we see a beach on the island paradise, the beach was quite active. Guy's and girls in their teens enjoying themselves on the backdrop of a setting sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Kenny noticed was how they were dressed. The girls would looked like they'd be more naked wearing normal cloths and the guy's didn't look much better since they're suits were the old prisoner stripped unitards. These were definitely 20 style cloths, back when showing anything above the ankle could get you arrested for indecent exposure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera panned over the entire scene slowly, allowing Kenny to see all what a 20's teen considered fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My grandpa has more fun than this.' He thought dryly 'And he used to be Amish!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera then focus's in on one particular teenage boy at the end of the beach, staring at all the happy couples enjoying themselves. With a heavy sigh he leaves them to their devices and ambles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's not the most attractive guy you'd ever met, but hardly a bad catch for any girl. Not handsome but hardly ugly. Average in height and carrying a little paunch despite his diet and exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he wanders down the beach he hears an unusual sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Mmmmm*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like a woman, doing something that was most likely inappropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed towards the sound further down the beach. Finding the woman half out of the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadame.\u201d He said hurrying over and picking her up. \u201cMadame speak to..........\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was rendered speechless at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast the mass of blonde curls was a woman far more stunning than any he'd ever seen. Deep blue eyes, candy apple cheeks and thick rosy lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Mmmm*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't sound very good......it sounded great, but the point was it wasn't a sound a well person made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must have hurt your head or something.\u201d The boy (lets call him Fredrick) said. \u201cLet's stand up and get you somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation she shot up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Whap*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFredrick was knocked back onto his rear when something huge and soft uppercut his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was speechless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked past the fact that she was curvier than a country road, looked past the twin bosoms like prize winning fruit, he even looked past the look of raw lust in the woman's eyes as she approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Kenny out in the theatre ignored these things, he along with the actor in the film were to busy wondering how she managed to find a microkini in the twenties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so stunned by her revealing state of dress that he didn't notice her approach him until she was in his lap, pressing herself against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to move away but she held him tight with strength her 4 inch shorter frame betrayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaam please let go I..\u201d He was silenced as the bimbo pressed her lips to his, effectively silencing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFredrick melted into the kiss, falling back and letting the woman atop him put her full weight against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he couldn't escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he didn't notice before then it was to late to do so now as something unknown moved from her lips to his, colouring them a darker shade of red as they grew puffier to match hers. The chemicals spread throughout his body numbing him to everything that was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis genitals inverted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body matched her in curves, his suit growing looser yet tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair cascaded down to his/her inflated behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer suit grew tight and outlined her new assets perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face rearranged to met the same type of build as the woman atop her, with a slightly smaller nose and rosier cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay this is definitely not a twenties film.' thought Kenny, who was clearly weirded out by the un nessicarily graphic change he'd just wittiest rather than a simple fade out/ fade in bit like they used in so many twilight zone episodes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde got off her new sister and seemed to look upon her handiwork, or would have if see had any mind to use to appreciate her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman who was Fredrick also stood up, her cloths quickly morphing into a v cut one piece. Her mind already numbed from the change it was all to quick as practically all knowledge drained out of her head like a leaky pipe, her eyes growing blanker and blanker until all that was left was a moaning husk of a human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Mmmm*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two held onto each other for a moment, seeming to enjoy the closeness before they shambled along the beach, their empty eyes looking upon the target and their lips puckered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weird thing was, the way the camera took a front view rather than a back one. Made it look to Kenny that the girls weren't heading towards the other beach goer's. The way they seemed to stare right at him....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...They looked like they were coming at him</span></div></div>",

Panting heavily from the exertion but ok. She went over to a phone and called the police and ambulance to come and rescue her from the cabin in the middle of the woods.

There wasn't a one among them who could be smaller than a Double D, Their wide hips and badonkadonk ass's swaying in a very deliberate manner as they move down through the seats to get to him. Oh jeez the wavy blonde just ran her tongue over her lips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments they were all around him, giggling and pushing up against him with their lush bodies, Running there hands over his bulging belly and caressing his second and third chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou weren't thinking about leaving after only one movie were you Kenny?\u201d The red head with the G-cups whispered into his ear as she rubbed his shoulders, sending his pupils into the back of his skull. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a customer as handsome as you in forever. And we intend to 'milk' it for all its worth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven haired seductress pressing herself into his right side nodded before picking off a few stray kernels from his man boobs \u201cDropped some. Open up big guy.\u201d She jokingly ordered before slowly pushing them under his nose, The second the smell hit he opened his mouth and she pushed them in, pushing them in just far enough that he ended up kissing her fingertips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere, like, so glad you enjoy the food.\u201d The ditzy brunette with the bowling balls stuffed under her shirt chirped. \u201cWe've got a 'ton' of that stuff just sitting around that needs to get eaten. So we , Like, hope you've got room for more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm Full.\u201d Kenny managed to moan out. The blonde and the raven haired women gently rubbing his over inflated belly softly and gingerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde fixed him a wry grin and lifted his shake cup out of his hands. Leaning over his eyes rolled back to the front of his skull just in time to see an acre of cleavage fill his view. His eyes bulged as the straw brushed his mouth. He opened up and started drinking as reflexively as with the popcorn. His belly started to visibly expand before the girls hungry eyes. A line of drool escaped the red heads mouth as she saw him put on inch after inch to his glorious gut with every sip, The seat squeezing him tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three hugged him that much closer to feel the swelling against there persons. He'd put on another 20 pounds before the straw was drawn away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn't look like your full.\u201d The blonde said cheekily. Shaking the.....shake, making a heavy sloshing sound. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t sound like you've even touched this thing. So......\u201d She pulled herself closer \u201cHow about staying for another movie or 2? We have plenty more snacks I'm sure a big boy like you can manage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenny. Basically now little more than a sea of adipose tissue, sugar and hormones could do little to form a proper response in the wake of a pair of melons dangling inch\u2019s from his face. All he really could do was make a short strangled noise. Which of course the girls took as a yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d She stood up. \u201cLinda...\u201d She said looking at the Red head behind him \u201cYou go put in another movie. Becka...\u201d It was the Brunette she turned to this time \u201cGo fix Kenny here a snack tray. You know the one I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean the one with the....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. Anna. Go with her..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you Maria? What will you be doing?\u201d Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smirked and plopped herself down in Anna's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeeping our guest company of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna glared but followed after her Brunette co worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenny gulped as Anna fixed him with what could only be described as 'Bedroom eyes' \u201cAlone at last.\u201d She said before putting her hands over her head and stretching. Making sure his eyes were fixed on her swelling bosom, Right before a button on her top shot off like a bullet and hit the screen, allowing him to see even more of her smooth cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms came down and one went round behind his back, While the other went into his popcorn bucket, Like Maria before her she lifted some popcorn to his mouth and he scarfed it without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love a man who enjoys his food.\u201d She whispered just as the room went dark. She guided his own swollen fingers back into the bucket were it resumed its piece by piece feeding, While she decided to be even more daring and placed her free hand against the parts of his swelling sides that were starting to flow over the arm rests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Given the towns size he thought it would be more like a petting zoo, a dozen different animals at most and even then it would probably be things like racoon's and beavers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actual case was that Ed's zoo looked more like a big city type on that schools could take entire student bodies to all day without one class running into the other. Just standing here alone and looking out over the expanse he could see maybe 10 different sectors to this place with more beyond his line of site. With habitats that could easily hold whole groups of wild an exotic animals comfertably without ever having to worry about improper conditions or 'activists'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before he continued onward he took a glance back at the entrance. The streets and houses still visible over the 10 space parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels like a god damn Tardis or something.\" He muttered before heading into the zoo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped slightly when he heard the unmistakable sound of a lions roar in the distance. As if all at once the zoo came to life, the chattering of monkeys, the squak of birds and the rattle of cages sprung up all around him, like someone flipping on a switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok someones fucking with me. Either this is a trick or......no no someones definitely fucking with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs wandered down the lane he came across a kiosk, full to the bring of old paper maps that looked like they'd just been printed, a map of the park itself painted onto the metal surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok so were do I wanna go in 'Edsneyland'?\" He snarked upon seeing the map, which really did look more like a bigger version of the map he'd last seen on his familys last trip to Florida. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn it were a number of different sections of the zoo, each holding a different species quite comfortably.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wheelchair squeaked and groaned as it ever so slowly inched along, metal scraping against metal as the wheels made each revolution, the chair heavily burdened by it's new occupant. Susan's face flushed a bright shade of crimson, her heart was racing and pumping so hard she could feel each beat in her ears. All while she drew the sharpest breaths she possibly could, in a feeble attempt to supply her beyond morbidly obese body with enough oxygen just for her to remain conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Huff... huff... wheeze... unngh...h-hun...</i>\" Susan trailed off. The sheer act of trying to communicate with her words had been smothered by her obesity. Her jaw felt so heavy, her lips felt so swollen and foreign to her. She felt her heart begin to race harder from her useless attempt at speaking, her face burned hotter, red blotches appeared an even darker shade spreading now onto her chest. Despite the immense weight of over 800lbs bearing down on Susan, her insides felt empty in her drugged and dazed state. If there was even a small chance whatever was moving her wheelchair would listen to her, she was determined to lead it where she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>Huff... wheeze...</i></b> <i>h-hun... gry</i>.\" She forced out from her obscenely fat face. \"<i>F-feed...</i> <b><i>huff... huff... unngh... huff... wheeze...</i></b> <i>ne... eed...</i> <b><i>huff... huff...wheeze...</i></b> <i>f-foood</i>.\" She barely managed to struggle out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's wheelchair slowly came to a stop, spun itself gently around, and began squealing loudly once more. The sharp noises carried across the whole town on the still air as the overburdened wheelchair began back up the street towards the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's mind was beginning to clear up as her slow and ponderous journey progressed. She became aware of her added flesh with each notch in the pavement, as gravity would bump and jostle her many dangling sacks of blubber that poured over all boundaries of her chair... or was it a couch? Just how fat was she? She wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing was ragged, she had to maintain heaving breaths to stay alert, her resting heart rate felt like it was way beyond danger territory. Each heavy beat of her overburdened heart thudded hard in her ears, the world sounded strange. The simplest of movements were far beyond her now, her muscles would burn like fire before they would move her mass mere inches. And even more shocking to Susan, was the fact that she was on the absolute cusp of having the greatest orgasm of her life because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stained glass double doors of the restaurant gleamed as they opened automatically, allowing their obese former patron back on the red carpet leading into the lobby. Susan's wheelchair slowed as it approached the waiter dressed in white. He turned when he heard the forceful wheezing sounds that alerted him to the presence of the near formless woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness!\" He said aghast, as he looked upon Susan's red bloated face. \"Bring some amenities in here for our guest immediately!\" The waiter shouted aloud. Soon more waiters seemed to float about silently, Susan could hear the sound of a machine priming itself behind her, as a cannula slid gently into her nose and began blasting cool refreshing oxygen for her helpless mound of a body to sustain itself on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that's better now isn't it?\" He smiled. \"We always take care of our customers, as I'm sure you well know. Now what might you be doing back in this fine establishment so soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>Huff... wheeze...</i></b> <i>h-hungry...</i> <b><i>huff... unngh... huff...</i></b> <i>n-need...</i> <b><i>unngh... wheeze...</i></b> <i>f-fed</i>.\" Susan managed to gasp and sputter out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After your last visit here madam, I must say I'm not entirely too surprised. That glint in your eyes as you ate...\" The waiter paused as he leaned further into Susan's face, her eyes sunken from the size of her cheeks and her lips bulging out with fat into an odd pucker. \"I'd say you were born for this. Just sign here please. You're aware of our only offering I'm sure...\" He trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan struggled with her thoughts as the waiter placed a pen between her bloated fingers, there was no way she was enjoying this right? She heard a part of herself shouting in protest, but that rational part of her was silenced once the waiter finished jostling her softly sagging fat hand holding the pen against the register. Immediately once the register was signed the smell of food became readily apparent to Susan. Despite the feast she endured earlier she felt empty, she was hungry... no, she was starving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter led Susan into the dining room back to the same center table as before. Things were different now, there were no chairs. Just a single, heavy, ornately etched solid marble bench set low to the ground. The bench surrounded by a slew of medical equipment, tubing, and IV bags swinging leisurely overhead upon rolling stands. Susan's heart raced at the sight of these new additions. She wasn't doing this was she? She couldn't be enjoying truly letting herself for the first time in her life, could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore waiters surrounded Susan and grabbed her arms, others grabbed various bulges of sagging fat in an attempt to move her to onto the bench. The uneven fat folds of her legs were effortlessly supported as Susan rose. Her belly was lifted from both sides, the enormous cellulite-rippled sack of fat parallel to the ground. The darkened fat folds on her calves were lifted from the ground around her feet so Susan could heave with the help of the waiters to reach her destination. She took heaving gasps of oxygen and grunted loudly with each step, but eventually made it with the help from the eerie waitstaff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's body settled into a vast sloping mound on the wide bench, she continued to think as she caught her breath. This couldn't be, right? There's no reason she should be enjoying this, but as her eyes continued to stare down the various pieces of heavy-duty machinery and medical equipment, the only thing she could think about was that quickly mounting pleasure quaking between her blubbery thighs. She began to drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you're curious as to what those are,\" Says the waiter dismissively, as he shakes his head. \"but you won't have to worry or think about any of that. In order for our customers to get the most out of their money, we use these to ensure their feasting continues for as long as possible. They'll make sure you don't give out on us too soon, so your unending feast can continue as long as possible. But enough of me talking, you have to start eating before this lovely spread goes cold. But don't worry, there will always be more... there's always more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the head waiter faded away once again with the registry, dozens of hands from congregating waiters began to grab forks and spoons loading them up with everything in sight and forcing them past Susan's near useless lips. Her cheeks bulged and her throat surged as she gulped feverishly to maintain their breakneck feeding pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other choice left to her, Susan continued to eat and suck down oxygen, as she experienced the best orgasm she ever had.</span></div></div>",
