Beast Boy, poor Beast Boy remained at a healthy five foot four inches, but that didn't stop what happened every morning...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">Morning High<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMornings that included: his primal instincts coming into play, sexual visions of enveloping Raven's thins lips with his hardened member and semen, or shredding Robin's mask and skin with lust and passion filled claws, were becoming increasingly normal. His dreams led him into deep slumbers and often the alarm could not bring him out of euphoria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning was no different... Heavenly scents of tofu waffles, bacon, and eggs bathed and washed over him. Streaming into his nostrils hoping to press him out of his sex filled dreams, but to no avail the scents of food was nothing compared to the heat of sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy's penis arose triumphantly from its sheath thrusting slowly into the air searching for frictions. Beast Boy dug his elongating nails into the mattress and his hunger filled pants, gasps, and moans ricocheted off the walls and clutter of his room.</span><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">Starfire trotted heavily through the corridors of the Teen Titan's Headquarters to Beast Boy's room.

Beast Boy clothes seemed tighter Raven assessed. His white shirt outline his developing muscles and his checkered green pajamas were tight and weren't truly able to restrict his erected pen-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven ripped her eyes off of Beast Boy's body blushing, \"He's fin-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Uh...

Hard-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurt, hard sounds alike when you're Starfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire mistook Beast Boy's pleas for Raven for hurt. \"There is a disturbance in his pants!\" Starfire cried, \"This is causing the pain\" Starfire gripped Beast Boy penis quite hardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starfire stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy awoke and began to scream struggling to remove Starfire's hand from his throbbing member, \"Ahh! Let go! Let go! Ah! Let Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire held on tighter, \"There is a monster in your pants! You must be still\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven tried to pry Raven's fingers off of Beast Boy's long and thick 'monster,' but this was a difficult task because she didn't want to touch Beast Boy's penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven decided to grab...</span></span></div></div>",

All three had various reactions.  Beast Boy backed away with his hands up, Robin looked away blushing, and Cyborg began to laugh awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err I don't know ask Cy,\" he said with various hand waves. Cyborg's mouth opened, but upon Beast Boy's statement, he gave a simple retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck no, Robin can explain the little things about sex,\" he said. \"But to be simple, it's how human reproduce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, and you use that large creature which spews acidic white stuff to do this?\" Starfire pressed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Beast Boy said, \" I guess you can say it like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there was nothing wrong with you then?!\"  Starfire inquired in a high pitched squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not down there,\" Beast Boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most joyous!

'Violating the personal space'\" Star happily stated and glided across the room to tightly hug Beast Boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't do that again,\" Beast Boy said trying to pry from Starfire's grasp.

It was ripped in many places do to Beast Boy's claws.</span> <span class=\"crose\">\"But I recall enjoying it and so did you.\" Raven wrapped her thins arms around Beast Boy's shoulders.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"That didn't mean it was right,\" Beast Boy said jumping out of bed.  Raven also got out of the bed near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think, you're taller than Starfire now,\" Raven observed his body pleased and aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Beast Boy said looking down at Raven, \"What's happening to me?\"  With that, he bolted to the Infirmary.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"crose\">\"I don't know, but it looks fine to me,\"</span></i> Raven thought. She leaned against the metal door frame watching Beast Boy run naked in the corridors.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">After a quick shower, Raven got dressed, and went looking for Beast Boy.  She found him in the Infirmary, wrapped in one of his bed sheets because that was all that fit. Cyborg was doing some tests.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Haya Raven,\" Cyborg said, then nearly began to chuckle, \"Come to see what's happening to Beast Boy?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"crose\">'I've seen more than this,'</span></i> Raven thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Dude, can you hurry it up?\" Beast Boy asked, \"I really want to know what's happening to me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"So tell me what <i>exactly</i>  happened last night, no stuttering or mumbling or trailing off! I can't figure it out unless you fill in the blanks\" Cyborg replied annoyed</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"I, uh, well what had happened was~\" Beast Boy started.  He was so worried about saying he lost his virginity last night to Raven in a passionate sexual act, for he knew roommate incest was looked down upon.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"...We</span> <span class=\"crose\">slept together,\"Raven said in her monotone, like that act was no different from checking a book out of the library.</span> <span class=\"cblue\">What ever Cyborg was expecting, it wasn't that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two, together, What?\" Cyborg inquired, but then began to laugh, \"Aww sucks man I knew it would happen one day!\"  His laughter was halted from Raven and Beast Boy's glare.Cyborg quickly composed himself and then looked at his results once more. Raven and Cyborg weren't too worried, but the new Beast Boy was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said this build up started after Star was jacking you off?\" Cyborg said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh she didn't jack~ She just...\" Beast Boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then this all makes sense now,\" Cyborg said, \"I think I know what's wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Beast Boy pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your animal side is finally maturing,\" Cyborg said, \"Males of most species become larger and more powerful when they hit puberty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I had that like five years ago,\" Beast Boy eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noo salad top your human part did,\" Cyborg said, \"Now it's your other side.  You seem to grow with any action that influences your sex drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Beast Boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Well, that makes sense,\" Raven said, \"You grew a little after what Starfire did.  You grew some more after asking me on a date, and you grew a lot after we had sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay I guess it makes sense\" Scratched his head, \"So how do we stop this?\" Beast Boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't,\" Cyborg answered concisely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?!\" Beast Boy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is too much room for error,\" Cyborg said, \"If I try tampering with it, I could cause it to never stop.  But it should stop on its own...\" Cyborg added a bit unsure, \"Eventually... You can morph into any animal.  Each one gets different things during puberty.  You should do a bit of research\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"<i>Great</i>,\" Beast Boy said.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\"><i>'Very great,'</i> Raven thought.</span> <span class=\"cplum\">Raven shook her head.

Beast Boy was nearly at eye level with Cyborg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyborg scowled at Beast Boy height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Probably need to get used to that comment by now,'</i> Cyborg thought. Beast Boy then left the room, before anything else happened.  He walked quickly and found the Titan's Library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this is one of the first times I've been in here,\" Beast Boy muttered as he walked over to the computer database.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please enter search material.\" The computer instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start with the close ones,\" Beast Boy said as he typed \"Age of maturity for mammals and physical reproductions from it.\"  He then clicked enter. Within a minute, a vast amount of information came up on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Raven,\" Beast Boy said, without looking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know?\" Raven asked entering the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heard you and smelled you,\" Beast Boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I smell nice?\" Raven asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like lavender and mint,\" Beast Boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'That's what I used in the shower,'</i> she thoughts.  \"You find anything interesting yet?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not yet,\" Beast Boy said. He gave a big sigh and said, \"I'm sorry for last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if you remember, but you did resist, until I forced you into the room with my powers,\" Raven said, \"So I'm more to blame than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven, I would never intentionally do something like that to you,\" Beast Boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you,\" Raven said, scanning another screen filled with more animal information.  \"That seems to fit you right now,\" Raven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which animal?\" Beast Boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Equus Caballus,\" Raven said, \"Horse.\"  She added at Beast Boy's confusion.  Beast Boy quickly crossed his legs.  \"I think you're becoming like that analogy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains the tight feeling,\" Beast Boy muttered.  He saw Raven take another deep breath.  He heard her heart quicken and her scent was quickly overwhelming him.  \"Raven,\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Raven asked, looking at the strained expression on his face.  \"Am I getting to you?\" she asked, in both a worried and excited tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Beast Boy said, feeling his flat sheet becoming a roomy tent.</span></div></div>",

Ye-y-yes,\" he cleared his throat stopping the progress of his growth, \"You should. You're not helping me.\" He clenched unto the sheets nearly as a security blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven slipped her hands around Beast Boy's shoulder, \"I want to help you Beast Boy.

Perhaps because wolves were carnivorous, or they were a dominant species, or known to be aggressive, or it said right there on Lion Crusher's Domain: Animal Information Pages page: \"once a wolf puppy reaches puberty, it starts to 'challenge authority' to find its place in the pack. Wolves are rough with one another\"... He didn't really know why, but it just frightened him a little, so he exited the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and folded his hands across his belly...

He collected the sheets and tightened it around his waist, fortunately the sheet was thick because when he stood he could feel his flaccid member and testicles dancing at his inner thighs. He adjusted a bit for some comfort and ventured off to find some clothes. His first thought was Cyborg. Being that Cyborg was the oldest Beast Boy envisioned him as an Elder, a person with a unfathomable amount of wisdom. Not only did Beast Boy envision Cyborg as a leader, but he could sense his loyalty; it streamed out of Cyborg in waves. Cyborg did reek of body odor, sweat, oil, metal, fire, rubber, and a small pinches of Jinx and Bumble Bee, but the wave of loyalty surpassed even the metal man's foulest days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy raised his nose in the ear and picked up Cyborg's 'heavenly' scent. He followed the trail until he reached the Infirmary. Cyborg was still tampering with the blood he had to force Beast Boy to give (Beast Boy was never a huge fan of needles.) Beast Boy was about to open his mouth, but something came over him... An urge, no... A hunger, not quite... Something a bit more predatory... Something that involved territory, yes he felt territorial. Beast Boy watched the metal man devote his time and effort to viewing at his blood, but this didn't fascinate him. Cyborg was in his space... Beast Boy gritted his teeth as his eyes became slits of red and green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknown to Cyborg Beast Boy was watching... He was so focused on the microscope that time and space slip away from him. <i>'What if it's more than just his animal side getting some down play in puberty?'</i> He repeatedly interrogated himself, <i>'What if there is something more?'</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy quietly walked behind the mechanical man and stalked him, stalked is such a hard word how about intensely observed. Beast Boy intensely observed Cyborg his nails elongated by the millimeter with ever passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyborg removed the slide from the stand and analyzed with his red eye the blood... <i>'There are no signs of radiation... Maybe Beast Boy found a way to incorporate the Beast into his physiology?' But that wouldn't even make any sense...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy was inching closer, but the sound of shattering glass caused the growing green male to stop dead in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Cyborg cursed, and upon turning around to gather a bin, bleach, and ammonia he saw Beast Boy standing behind him looking pretty dazed. \"Ah!\" He jumped back, \"What the hell were you doing-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly Beast Boy didn't remember when he had gotten so close. He looked around the lab, and then at the door, and the spot he was in a numerous amount of times... At least he remembered he needed some clothes, \"Sorry... I-just came here to get some clothes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vein appeared at Cyborg's temples, \"Well you don't have to sneak up on me like that! You trying to give me a heart attack salad top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No he-he sorry I didn't realize you were so old! Tin Can need some oil?\" Beast Boy sincerely smiled both canines peaking out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noogie between the two males wasn't quite the same but Cyborg, who only towered over Beast Boy by like 4 to 6 inches, still grasped the younger male's head; a lock of embrace and the hand was to drill the love in. Beast Boy didn't smell the fear that was once emitting from Cyborg... The wave of loyalty was back and he was glad for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwwwwwwwww! Come on!\" Beast rasped in whines, \"No fair! No fair!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You grew a little BB, did you and Raven get it ooon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy stopped, \"...no...\" Beast Boy stated defeatedly and defensively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sure</i> you didn't. Well, I have clothes but they're from when... I was human... Hope you don't mind wearing a dead man's clothing\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hint of sorrow left Beast Boy's mouth gapped open forming a long no </span></div></div>",

Beast Boy looked down at the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wore those!\" Beast Boy cried at the out of style clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Cyborg said, \"When I wasn't in a sport's uniform, these were the cool clothes.  You want them or not?\"  Beast Boy heard Cy's tone dripping with sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't have much choice until this stops and I get a new uniform,\" Beast Boy said.  He picked up some pants and a shirt.  \"<i>These don't look</i> too bad,\" Beast Boy thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo BB, you don't want any undies?\" Cyborg asked.  Beast Boy glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just say the line 'Beast Boy wears my underwear.' and rethink that question,\" Beast Boy said.  The smile on Cyborg's face was quickly  covered by a hand in a vomit reflex position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, that is not right,\" Cyborg said, \"And I'll wait outside to see how you look.\"  With that Cyborg left the room for Beast Boy to try and get some clothed on.  Beast Boy's hearing could now pick up Cyborg pulling out his camera to capture Beast Boy on film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jerk,\" Beast Boy muttered as he pulled the black denim pants on.  \"These are a bit baggier on the legs, but the crotch is real tight,\" Beast Boy commented as he rolled the pant legs up so they fit, \"So either Cy liked tight pants or mine is bigger than his was.\"  Next he pulled on the white under shirt, also a loose fit, and put one of Cyborg's leather jackets over it.\"I can deal with this,\" Beast Boy said as he looked in a mirror.  Beast Boy liked how he looked.  Had he tried this stuff before his change, he would of looked like a fool.  Now, he looked almost cool.  \"I am cool, if you dig green,\" Beast Boy muttered.  He then put his gaze down to his now clawed toes.  \"No way I'm wearing shoes with them,\" he said as he pulled out a pair of old open-toe sandals.  They would be the only thing that clashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo BB, you decent yet!\" Cyborg yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't have to yell so loudly,\" Beast Boy muttered, \"I can hear him fine now.\"  With that, he opened the door.  Cyborg immediately started taking pictures, which Beast Boy posed to.  After a few minutes, the two guys stopped their act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>So I'm still me deep down,</i>\" Beast Boy thought with a smile.  He then looked at Cyborg.  \"I need some more help,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With what?\" Cyborg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want some tests run on my senses, so I know what they can do now,\" Beast Boy said with some authority.  Cyborg caught it in his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, but you should be nice if you want anymore clothes,\" Cyborg said coldly.  This brought Beast Boy to his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I don't know why I sound like that sometimes,\" Beast Boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably because I'm a guy and part of you thinks I'm a threat or challenger for the alpha male position,\" Cyborg said as they were walking back to the Infirmary to do the tests.</span></div></div>",

It was leaking off the walls, the ceilings, the floors, everywhere in the Titan's Headquarters. His scent, his air of dominance, his condescending ways of phrasing things leaking everywhere saying: \"I am Robin and I own everything.\" God it was an awful smell; having someone in your territory thinking they ran the show. Beast Boy stopped abruptly, for that smell that smelled really smelly was getting to him. He inhaled deeply; his nose twitched and flared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ermmmm Beast Boy. Earth to Beast Boy... Come on green bean I don't smell that bad\" Cyborg raised an arm and inhaled his own scent and then waved off his own must.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cyborg heard the sluggish steps in the corridor he pieced two and two together, either Beast Boy was going to have another... erection, or fists were about to fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salad head let's go do your tests\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin appeared from around the bend looking a bit miserable. Robin had to do a double take on Beast Boy's new... clothes, \"Euhh,\" Robin scratched his thick jet black hair, \"What's up with the new digs?\" His question sounded so unsure. He knew Beast Boy increased in height and was just about his height, but how do you bring that up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyborg stated, \"Those are my old clothes...

My scent?

Beast Boy is saying that there is more to my scent. Do you care to elaborate Beast Boy\" Robin held his ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy took another whiff, \"Dominance... There's only one room for an Alpha male.\" Beast Boy eyes reddened and Cyborg and Robin were not oblivious to that matter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was calm, \"You are my mentor. I am your teacher, your leader, but more importantly I am your friend... And we run this as a team\" There it was that hidden smell. It was so faint, but it took Beast Boy out of his trance of 'I am Alpha male bow down to me.' What was that faint smell? Was it like? An attraction? What was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy took a step closer, \"I am <i>your</i> leader, you are to submit to me... I can also be your friend if you like.\" Beast Boy smiled his canines were long and sharp<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not an option Beast Boy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...too bad I really liked,\" Beast Boy quickly grasped Robin in a headlock and gave him a noogie, \"your hair.\" He laughed</span></div></div>",

Well, not yet anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try,\" Beast Boy said.  Raven moved a little away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this better?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" Beast boy said, with a relieved sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Raven said, \"Now we'll both act like mature adults and keep in control of our bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easier said than done,\" Beast Boy said moving further away from Raven.  When he was comfortable again, he started researching some more animals.  Raven also went to work.  Since the computers were networked together, she would send him non-verbal messages on something interesting she'd find occasionally.  This suited Beast Boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this makes sense,\" Raven said, looking at the days date, \"It's a full moon and I should be going through my period soon.  Both his urges are at their peak and my body wants to mate.  Better tell Beast Boy.\"  And with a click, the information was sent to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should of just told him,\" came a voice in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said that?\" Raven asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was the weakest one of us,\" the voice said, \"I was weak and unmoving until you saw Beast Boy's muscles.  Those nice hard ones.\"  The voice gave a high girly laugh.  \"Now, every thought you have of him and you in a bed or on a table is giving me strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Raven asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lust,\" the Lust part of Raven said.  A mental image of this part of Raven's mind flashed before her eyes.  There she stood, wearing a black leather dominatrix outfit.  \"And soon you won't be able to resist.  And if you do, that will make you angry and release <i>her</i>.\"  Raven knew she was referring to her anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI won't let you take over,\" Raven said aloud, \"You won't get your hands on Beast Boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Lust asked, \"You want him for yourself, right?  That empowers me.  You can't win against me Raven, not now that Beast Boy's become an object of desire.  Go on, take him.\"  With that, Lust forced Raven to remember the passion and ecstasy she felt the previous night.  Raven was clutching her head.  Her nipples were hard, her vagina moist.  She wanted Beast Boy, but knew she couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the room, Beast Boy heard Raven's heart race and smelled her scent get even stronger.  Unbeknown to him, Lust was forcing her to release these pheromones.  He too clutched his head and crossed his legs hard.  But his urges and size slowly grew and grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, both snapped at the same time and ran to each other.  Raven tore away Beast Boy's only clothing and Beast Boy disposed of Raven's outfit and their naked bodies merged, feeling and kissing each other in a primal sex act.  A few times, Beast Boy playfuly bites and licks Raven's neck.  Raven could only moan in ecstasy from this.  She rubbed her hands over his expanding frame.    His hair was now passed his shoulders.  By this time, they were on the floor, Beast Boy entering her with ease.  The books within 20 feet were quickly flying around and pages were ripping out of them and tearing themselves apart.  Only when both passed out, did everything stop.  Everything but Beast Boy's growth until it finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, both started to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven,\" Beast Boy muttered, his eyes slowly opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Raven answered.  She saw she was in the middle of his massive chest now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did it, didn't we?\" Beast Boy asked, with a tone of joy and sorrow.  He didn't even look at her.  He just stared at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did,\" Raven answered, in a similar tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Beast Boy asked.</span></div></div>",

One piece was made into a loincloth around him.  He gave the other piece to Raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Raven said, wrapping it around herself, but still didn't look around, \"Well, it seems I had one more I didn't realize I had.  And she is what helped in both our acts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which emotion is it?\" Beast Boy asked, keeping his back to Raven.  Like her, he didn't want a repeat of what just happened.  He had felt Raven's feet by his clawed feet when she was on him and her head just at his chest.  He had to of been as tall as Cyborg now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lust,\" Raven said with disgust, \"She likes you, a lot.  She's the one who makes me want to hold you and touch you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Janet,\" Beast Boy said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Raven asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you were reading when Cyborg and I were watching it and dancing along to it,\" Beast Boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which stupid movie was that?\" Raven asked, happy that Beast Boy wasn't angry with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</u>,\" Beast Boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't she the lead female?\" Raven asked, recalling some parts of the movie.  She didn't get why those two liked that movie and only barely paid attention to it.  She had gotten some money from the other Titans for her videos of Beast Boy and Cyborg doing <i>The Time Warp</i> when they were stoned.  Neither knew about that business deal, yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and in once part, she does it with Rocky, the muscular hunk, in a passionate, lustful act,\" Beast Boy said, \"So your Lust self is like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A slut,\" Raven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much,\" Beast Boy said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But knowing that analogy doesn't help us,\" Raven said, sad again, grabbing her knees close, \"She'll want you again eventually.  She'll try and control parts of me to attract you.  I don't want her to take over and cause you more growth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Beast Boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're my friend.  And after all we've been through, I don't want her to do this.  But I can't stop her.  It's too basic an emotion to fully block,\" Raven said.  She started to shed silent tears.  Beast Boy's enhanced hearing heard every tear hit her knees.  He wanted to help his friend, but if he went near her, he'd only entice that Lust.  He wanted to help her with every fiber of his being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But why do I?</i>\" Beast Boy thought, \"<i>Because she's my friend. No, it's more than that.  Raven's helped me through some thought times since the team was formed.  And I helped her.  We were there for each other.  I want to protect her, but why?  Because she's a potential mate?  No, I would never reduce Raven to that.  She's more important than that to me.  She my everything.  I</i>\"  \"Love her,\" came out his mouth.  \"I love Raven,\" he said again.  He couldn't believe he had realized it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'll have to leave the tower,</i>\" Raven thought, \"<i>It's the only way to keep Beast Boy safe.  I'm going to miss this family, but it's a sacrifice I have to make.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, there is a way you can stop her,\" Beast Boy said with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Raven choked out through some tears.  Beast Boy had never been the brightest bulb, but when he did shine, it was usually very bright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is more basic than Lust?\" Beast Boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.  Well, maybe fear,\" Raven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong,\" Beast Boy said, \"It's the complete opposite of Lust.  Come on, you can think of it.\"  His tone chided her like when he would play a silly guessing game with her and she had no interest in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Raven asked.  Beast Boy's questions and tone had stopped her crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love,\" Beast Boy said.  He heard Raven take in a deep breath.  \"Love,\" he continued, \"is the most basic emotion.  It is the feeling to give someone else a higher place than yourself in your life.  It is the basis of friendships.  I care about you and the other Titans and would die protecting you because you are my friends and family.  You hold that place because I love you all.  And I love you most, Raven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love me?\" Raven asked, \"Love me love me?\"  Her heart quickened, but this was not lust's doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Beast Boy said, \"And even if you only see me as a friend, you love me on some level.  And it is that type of love that can hold back your lust.  Your friend love of me and your want not to do this again until we both choose it is strong enough to fight that vile Lust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knew you could be so wise?\" Raven muttered.  Beast Boy chuckled at Raven's comment, hearing it like she spoke in a normal voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Raven, do you love me as a friend?\" Beast Boy asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Screamed Lust in her ear, \"You only desire his body, his muscles, his fricken horse size cock!  Nothing else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You're wrong</i>,\" Raven thought back, \"<i>He is one of my closest friends.  That's why I feel so disgusted by your actions.  I'm disgusted because I do see him as a friend.  I love him in that respect and possibly deeper.  Now keep out of this relationship!</i>\"  Lust gave a quiet defeated laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll see you in a month, when your emotions run high and so does he,\" Lust said before shutting up.  Raven smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Beast Boy, I love you as a friend,\" Raven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I think we can look at each other,\" Beast Boy said.</span></div></div>",

She hid behind another just before Robin and Starfire entered. \"I want to know alittle more about the sex.\" Said Starfire to Robin. \"Well... um...\" Robin started to blush. \"Here. Use the computer.\" He ran to the computers and searched sex in the data bank. Starfire sat down and started reading about it. \"Wow, it sounds most fantastic!\" Starfire said. Beast boy and Robin gave each other a shy smile, and turned back to watch the pair. \"I would love to try the sex.\" Starfire said. Robin was speechless. His buddy down stairs was aroused by the thought of him and Starfire. He has been wanting to hook-up with starfire for a while now, and didn't know what to say. \"Ok..\" he managed just to get the words out of his dry throat. \"Come to my room in ten minutes then.\" He said as he walked out of the room.

If anyone would teacher her about the sex, Robin would know. She walked through the halls, cheerfully towards Robin's room. She was turning the corner when she ran into Cy. \"Hey Star, happy today?\" He asked noticing her smile and how she was almost skipping when she turned the corner. \"Oh yes friend, today is most joyous!\" Cy was used to Star being happy over nothing, but still felt the need to ask. \"What's happening today that's got you so happy?\" Star didn't know that what she was about the say was going to open up a door of jokes toward Robin, so all she said was, \"Robin is going to teach me about the sex.\" Cy smiled, but held down the laugh he had inside. \"Ok, I'll take you to his room.\" They walked down the hallway to Robin's room. Cy opened the door, and saw Robin sitting on his bed. Star stepped in. \"Hey Robin, can I talk to you for a second?\" Cy waved Robin in to the hall. \"What is it?\" Robin asked. \"Here, you're gonna need this.\" Cy pulled out a condom from one of his hands and gave it to Robin. Robin blushed at the sight of it but said thanks and walked inside, locking the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was shocked to see Star nude on his bed. \"So how do we start the sex?\" She asked sitting up. Robin was harder than stone at the moment. He stripped nude and walked over to Star. \"Well- um- we start by kissing.\" He said while starting to kiss Star. \"Then I'll take it from there.\" He said. They made out for five minutes before he but on the the condom, and penetrated Starfire. She let out a little moan of pleasure, but touched the middle part of her chest and was muted herself. Robin loved this moment, he loved Starfire, and was having sex with her. Robin kissed Star's neck, sending waves of pleasure through her, all she did was lay back and try not to scream. They went on for hours. Robin and Star were happy wrapped around each other. Robin had to stop when he hit his orgasm and cummed into the condom. He took it off and threw it into the trash. He laid next to Starfire on his bed. \"Wow.\" she said. \"That was fantastic!\" Robin was happy she liked it seeing it was his first time. \"Can we do it again?\" She asked. Robin was surprised. \"Well... we could.\" He managed to say. Star smiled and started to kiss Robin again... </span></div></div>",

That shut Cy right up. Raven felt the hurt Cy slightly felt. \"Ok, calm down you two.\" she said. \"So Cyborg, what are you watching?\" Raven asked. turning towards the screen. \"Nothing much, news mostly but nothing is happening, at least in our sector.\" He said. \"Hey Cy, want a burger?\" Beast boy said as he took three off the pan, he wasn't expecting Robin or Starfire for awhile. \"Yeah, I'll take one.\" He answered. \"How about you Raven? \"Yeah, I'll help you.\" She got up and walked to Beast boy. She gave him a kiss, and grabbed Cy's and her plates and put the burgers on them. Beast boy grabbed his and joined them, sitting next to Raven. \"Hey, just to mention, don't go near Robin's room for awhile.\" Cy said. taking a bite from his burger. \"We know.\" Raven, and Beast boy said in unison. Cy was kinda surprised, but didn't say anything. He sat there quiet until he saw Raven finish and slide closer to Beast boy. Beast boy put his arm around her, and she seemed to lean on him. Cy was about to laugh. \"I'm going to leave you two alone, I have to upgrade the T car.\" And with that he left the two on the couch. \"I love you Raven.\" beast boy said after a couple minutes.

On one hand, we might be saving Robin, on the other, we'd be walking in on them.\" Cy said in answer. \"What do you mean we'd be saving Robin.\" Raven asked. \"Well, you saw how Star almost made Beast boy a girl.\" He said refering to a couple days ago.

Cy had a idea, \"I know what to do come with me.\" They followed Cy through Titan Tower, and out the door. When they got out the door, Raven and Beast Boy noticed Cy arming the security system. \"What are you doing?\" Beast Boy asked. \"Nothing, Raven, Take that bolder and throw it at the tower.\" Raven did what she was told and used her body and threw it at the building. The alarm started to sound. Cy picked up the boulder and threw it off the island. Within a few minutes, Robin and Starfire came running out to assest the damage. \"What happened?\" Robin asked looking at the hole in the wall. \"Nothing, we were training and Cy accidently threw a boulder at me and I dodged it but the Tower didn't\" Raven quickly came up. \"Ok, as long as my friends are safe.\" Star said returning into the tower. \"You're welcome.\" Cy said turning to Robin.

He could hear two sounds that were nearing; heavy breaths and breaths more cyclical, not that all breathing is not cyclical, but these breaths were: held... then curt breath... held... then curt breaths   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gathered a metal picture of his two teammates, Cyborg and Robin, before they rounded the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin silently gasped  when his eyes beheld Beast Boy his pattern was messed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy waved embarrassed at Robin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin eyed Beast Boy absorbing in his features then he came close getting a good view of his height (Beast Boy was taller than him by two inches,) hair, eyes, teeth, claws, body, loincloth. Robin's heart quickened and Beast Boy detected it, but Robin regained his composure all too quickly to note the scent he was giving off, \"When did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Didn't Cyborg tell you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big smile appeared on Cyborg's face, \"No it kinda slip my mind\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin and Beast Boy said in unison:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell could this slip your mind?\" Beast Boy stated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could this possibly slip your ming?\" Robin stated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I concerned about some other things... I have to talk to you Beast Boy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alone?\" Robin question in envy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Was he jealous just now? No, no it's Robin he wouldn't be interested in me'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it doesn't have to be alone... I guess\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What happened I mean? You're worried\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it that noticeable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Beast Boy muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you left I received a disturbing call on the screen I was playing videos and he popped up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was it?\" Robin stated defensively, but it was hidden by his calm demeanor <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't give me his name he just said that he wanted to see you... That you have something of his and he wants it back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell did he get this line? It's a private line... Could you trace the call?\" Robin question a bit agitated <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but he gave me an address...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A guy?\"  </span></div></div>",

Starfire could sense her distress, but... What would she say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy was just trying to calm his nerves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Cyborg just knew there was something up. Something in Beast Boy's eyes told a story of his shadows...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they were united on one thing besides there silence one thought tied them together... Who was this guy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive seemed like it was dragging on for hours because the drive did drag on for hours. Damn it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were on the edge of Jump City near the bordering town. They arrived, they arrived in this desolated area. There surrounding were an aqueduct, a river, water tower, trees, and more trees; a conventional horror area. But this mystery guy wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven and Starfire landed and the guys got out and off their vehicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where is your mystery date?\" Cyborg tease<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy couldn't pick up his scent... There was too much water... And he couldn't hear him because there was too much running water and it was running due to yesterdays down pour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

Beast Boy was getting irritated because Cyborg's old digs were itchy and heavy, so he removed the jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven and Robin noticed his formed muscles. Beast Boy had the body of a swimmer...<br>\r\nRaven and Robin then glanced at each other and then turned away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there for thirty minutes was annoying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has forgotten now\" Starfire stated bored<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...

He studied this man as if he was studying a tofu label.<br>\r\nThis man was tall and he had a sea of red and black dread locks braided down into a knot that touched the middle of his long torso. His left eye was covered by a crimson eye patch, but the scar appeared well beyond the patch. The scar extended inches above his left eyebrow, and down his mahogany colored cheeks.  The man's face was well defined, and was outlined by a rugged goatee. Beast Boy studied his features as if he was trying to tie him into his past... <i>'Is he apart of my past?'</i><br>\r\nNarc only smiled waiting for Beast Boy to say something, but Robin spoke picking up on Beast Boy's silence,\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have ten second to answer\" Cyborg warned pointing his weapon at his chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarc grimaced, but answered bitterly, \"I am but a friend visiting a friend, but while me and Garfield  play,\" he snapped his fingers, \"catch up you guys can mingle with my friends\"  Ten people enveloped in green came out and stood by Narc's side. Narc leaned on one of his cronies, \"they don't compare to you Garfield,\" he licked his cronies ear, \"but they keep me entertained\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I... What do you want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you back. You should have never left, but, but I understand he was so very very nasty to you, but I promise pinky swear promise I'll be nothing but sweet to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? ...I...\" Beast Boy buried his face in his hands. He looked at the front of his hands and saw the scars...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were treated terribly... You suffered... Because he made you ki-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Beast Boy's vision was getting blurry. He dropped down on his knees feeling like the neglected abused child he once was, \"Leave me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire flew to Beast Boy's side, \"Beast-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch him!\" And with that Narc' cronies attacked all of the members of the Teen Titans save Beast Boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarc slowly walked up to Beast Boy humming. When he approached Beast Boy he caressed his cheek, \"shhh I'm here now\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

O\u2019 no it\u2019s Beast Boy now, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\u201d Beast Boy could sense a wicked smile perched on the man\u2019s face. Beast Boy coughed in air while using his hands to raise his body. Before Beast Boy could stand the male grasped his thick green hair and touched his lips. Angry, Beast Boy\u2019s clawed at the Narc's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarc was fuming, \"No! No! Bad Garfield!\" He delivered a knee to Beast Boy's face. The blow nearly shattered Beast Boy\u2019s teeth, but it caused tears to involuntarily enter Beast Boy\u2019s eyes. The metallic taste of blood caused Beast Boy to tremble; blood began to seep out of the sides of his mouth. The quavering green Titan spewed crimson at his assailant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a suitable move for filth.\u201d The man stated in disgust while removing the crimson liquid from his face with his sleeve, \"No I'm sorry no no I'm sorry... That's my father talking no... It's okay everything is okay all right... You'll be fine we'll be fine... blood doesn\u2019t satisfy you anymore Garfield right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy was cringing, grasping onto his stomach and moaning in pain. His mind was uncontrollably traveling to the past, his past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm~ you turned over a new leaf.\u201d Narc stated slowly while walking over to the cowering changeling, \u201cInteresting I was always fascinated with you... Wow how long do you think the fa\u00e7ade last? Garfield.\u201d He leaned in close to whisper in his pointed ears. Narc grasped Beast Boy\u2019s ripped rimmed shirt, so he and Beast Boy could see eye to eye. Narc's long slender hands wrapped around Beast Boy\u2019s throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Please\u2026\u201d Beast Boy choked on the lack of air<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male shushed the quivering Titan in his clutches, \u201c Don't cry Garfield, the fa\u00e7ade ends here\u201d his grip tightened. The male\u2019s sensual voice faded. A darkness swept over Beast Boy\u2019s body as a heat filled with wrath streamed through his veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy wasn't sure when it happened... But he did know it happened... It was so painful. It felt like his body was being torn in two, no worse he felt like his muscles were set on fire. Everything was burning his skin, muscles, bones... He wanted to break shatter into fragments. He just wanted to die and then he felt his death or at least everyone, every scent, every sound, every thing just seemed to vanish... He was gone he ceased to exist and it felt good in the darkness away from his past, that man, his team... Away from all of their scents, their anger, their hate, their hurt... Their love. He was gone and it felt so right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy\u2019s slashes were graceful, agile, and vigorous; he removed himself from the man\u2019s clutches by clawing at the man\u2019s face. The man stumbled releasing his grip, laughing he charged at Beast Boy, but the changeling swiftly dodged the brutal plunge. Beast Boy grabbed Narc's dreaded hair causing the him to stagger backwards as Beast Boy pulled. Beast Boy\u2019s clawing hand carved into the man\u2019s neck. Narc slid onto the floor, he touched the blood dripping from the gashes, and placed his crimson covered finger tips in his sight and smiled dementedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy pounced, but was stopped by a boot entering his mid section. The fierce assault did not stop Beast Boy, in a matter of second the changeling presented the eccentric Narc with an elbow to his face. Narc had no time to wipe the blood that was dripping down onto his lips or cradle his broken nose, Beast Boy pounced again this time landing on the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Narc covered his face as the animal before him continuously carved at his dark skin. The changeling saw that his swipes were failing, so he grabbed the man by the side of his face, sinking his elongating nails into the man\u2019s skin and slammed the man\u2019s head against the cement floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Beast Boy awoke he found himself towering over the man his final thought was to kill. He fell backwards terrified. He searched for a sign that did not hold him responsible for the man\u2019s status. The scent and taste of blood left him wincing in self indignation; he was frightened to see a steady minute stream of blood flowing on the pavement. While holding his breath, he crawled to see if the man was alive. He placed a pointed ear to the man\u2019s chest and checked for a pulse. He heard shallow breaths rumbling in his lungs and felt a lingering pulse. A tear fell, the man was unconscious, and in relief he slid on the floor stopping at the man\u2019s feet. He buried his face in his hands; when he sensed the warm liquid he averted his attention to his hands, peering at the crimson liquid in bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe released tense breaths, panting. His thoughts ricocheted off the walls of his mind all leading to inadequate responses, dead ends. He looked around and all of the members of the Titans were gazing at him stunned. He wasn't sure when it happened... He wasn't sure when he changed but he knew he had changed...</span></div></div>",

I'm not exactly sure what moves I did to impress you do you mind doing it for me, so I can be amazed too?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeastBoy started with the elongate, \"Yeah\" It sounded like an inquisitive really then it but ended when Narc emerged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I taught him\" Narc was too quick for Beast Boy to move and again his thin hands wrapped around Beast Boy's throat slamming him against a near by tree, \"You will change, murder, and feed my child\" Narc chanted until Beast Boy's eyes grew wide, \"Now do you remember?\" He smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy somehow maneuvered out of Narc's hold and sunk his nails into Narc's throat. \"Who are you!\" Beast Boy screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th...at's... ri..gh...t...

Robin  paced his self thoughtfully, for he didn't know what mindset Beast Boy was in, but he couldn't stop his trembling hands. Hands that mimicked his fear for Beast Boy, no this Beast before him. Robin placed a weary false smile on his face already his fear was dominating his mind; Beast Boy he reminded himself was human and above all his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Don't come near me...\" Beast Boy voice was small, but the statement was powerful<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's foot and thoughts hesitated, but his movement ceased. Robin nearly forgotten how sensitive Beast Boy's nose became he understood that Beast Boy could sense his fear. Robin squatted down and wiped the sweat dripping into his mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you?\" Robin's voice was sterner than he implied <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy didn't answer, he held his head low to avoid eye contact, and his eyes drifted to the metal floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smally chuckled and pressed on, \"Silence isn't going to help you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy minutely shifted when Robin advanced in his steps<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's patience was draining and his fear had turned into anger, \"Attempted murder. Do you understand? You can be trailed and imprisoned for attempted murder, despite Narc being a criminal. You nearly killed him. What the hell is wrong with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need this right now\" Beast Boy tried to change, but was hindered by electricity.  Beast Boy let out a cry and threw his head back squeezing his eyes tight until tears seeped out of them like muffled grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's programmed  to electrocute when your DNA begins to alternate hence the needles, so you're not going anywhere for a while until you tell me who that man was and what's going on with you.

But there was another scent to this sanitized area, a scent he knew deeply.  His vision  became less blurry as he saw Raven watching over him, with a mixed face.  Had it not been for the pain medication he was on, both would of stimulated him right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven, what happened?\" Beast Boy asked.  He tried sitting up, but couldn't as Raven pressed her hand against  his bare chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me,\" Raven said, \"Which side of you fought Nar'c last night:  Beast Boy or the Beast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we know which one to play with,\" Lust chided in Raven's ear.  Despite her best efforts, Raven had been unsuccessful in taming this new emotion.  It didn't cause as much trouble as some of the others would, but it did get annoying hearing her say various male titan's names followed by \"Bow chika bow wow.\"  Beast Boy's was among the most frequent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I transform at all into the Beast?\" Beast Boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not from what anyone saw, and he is pretty hard to miss,\" Raven said.  She blushed realizing her Lust just made her add that last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it wasn't him,\" Beast Boy said closing his eyes.  He had hoped so much it was the Beast.  The Beast he could deal with,  It had a simple mind:  Protect those I care about.  Defend from all attackers.  But this darkness, this hatred he felt inside him for that man. . . that man.  \"Where is he?\"  Beast Boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Who?\" Raven asked, \"Narc?\"  Beast Boy's eyes flashed of hatred as he nodded an affirmative to Raven.  \"He's locked up at the Maximum security prison.  He's in the ICU after what you did to him,\" Raven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Beast Boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beast Boy, what happened between you two?  You're my friend, you can tell me,\" Raven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially after we have sex again.  I mean, look at what he's become Rae.  A few more times and he'll be able to whoop on that baby bird easily.  You know you want to hold him, touch him.  Make him feel all better.  Oh yes, and then there's how he touched us:  so gentle, yet firm.  Rubbing against those muscles, feeling that pierce deep inside us, releasing that magma of pleasure we had never felt before!\" cried Lust's voice.  It went higher and higher with each word.  It sounded like she was going to release just from talking about it.  \"You know you want it Raven!\"  Raven took a gulp and she started sweating.  Luckily Beast Boy was to deep in either trying to remember who Narc was or trying to forget.  But then something happened that Beast Boy's new senses picked up on.  So did Raven.  The part of her costume in front of her vigina was getting wet.</span></div></div>",

Rob-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Narc claim you Garfield?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're full of surprises today\" Garfield's eyelids fell over his pupils lazily almost sleepily <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Narc hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I don't know Narc!\" Garfield hissed although Robin couldn't see his eyes they did turn red underneath the lids<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled placing his mask over his eyes, \"You're right you did.\" Garfield opened his eyes to study Robin, but was greeted with a smile and hidden eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarfield wanted to see Robin's eyes and with a silly strength and his tongue sticking out he reached for Robin's mask. Robin dropped forward and kissed Garfield and Garfield toyed with his mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they parted Garfield began, \"Ri-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh\" Robin hushed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarfield felt a sudden pinch and in a matter of seconds off to la-la land he went...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Beast Boy, but there is more to this story than you are giving us...\"</span></div></div>",

Granted there were guards outside and automatic guns pointed at him now, but he still smiled.  Soon his body would heal and he would go get that green boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not a boy anymore,\" Narc thought, liking his lips.  He heard the door open and looked at who entered.  \"Ah Robin, are you here to bring me flowers from my Garfield?\" Narc asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Robin said.  What ever happened in his room, no matter how much he lost in composer when BB was near, he had regained it a few minutes after leaving that room.  If his mentor taught him one important thing, it was how to suppress those types of emotions when on the job.  He was thankful he was excellent at it.  \"But I'm here because of him.  I want to know what's your history with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my history with Garfield?  Is that all?\" Narc asked, in the same soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't deny we don't have one,\" Narc said with a chuckle, \"I mean, how he reacted towards me so beastly towards me when we last met, shows there's something to it.  But you already knew that, didn't you?\"  Robin remained silent, glaring at this scumbag.  \"I'll take that as a yes,\" Narc said, \"You're not that dumb, are you?  But as for what happened between us, well let me say not even Garfield's adoptive father could rip that from my mind.  And there's no method of torture that you can do to make me say.  But I do wonder, Boy Wonder, why did you come all the way here, when Garfield is right under your roof, with all the answers deep inside his mind.\"  Robin's face remained without emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want your side of the story,\" Robin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My side?\" Narc asked, looking up at the ceiling lights, appearing as though he was thinking, \"My side is on top.  More control.  But with his new body, I might have to try somewhere else.  If I had known that would happen to him, I might of kept a tighter chain on him.  But that's in the past, and a therapist once told me it's unhealthy to hold on to old grudges.  He told that to me again after his testimony once put me in prison and right before I <i>played</i> with him.  He screamed quite a bit.  I don't know if it was pleasure or pain, but it certainly was fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sick,\" Robin said.  He stood up and started to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"9-8-5-4-1-3-7-5-4-6-8-7-4,\" Narc said.  This stopped Robin's tracks. \"That's the override to the Tower's main door, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know that?\" Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been watching my Garfield for a while now, and all his friends,\" Narc said, smiling, \"That Raven and Starfire seem like they'd like some <i>playtime</i> as well.\"  Robin took all his self control from hurting Narc anymore.  He left the room and returned to the Tower.</span></div></div>",

There was no one around, and no sound, but that of a nearby stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Garfield said looking around.  It was then he noticed something off.  \"Hey, I'm skinny again!  I'm in normal clothes! And I'm not green!  What is this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A place to sort out the current issues we've been having,\" came a deep, soothing voice from behind.  Garfield jumped back in shock when he saw himself, but this version of him was green and in his Titan's uniform.  Beside him was the Beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are?\" Garfield asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are part of your mind,\" said Beast Boy, his voice was only slightly deeper than Garfield's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are the sides of you you draw on when you are a hero,\" Beast added, \"What you see yourself as is who are when not playing a hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I figured that part out, kind of like with Raven,\" Garfield said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Raven,</i>\" came a voice from behind Garfield.  It was oily, but sounded like Garfield's.  Garfield turned and saw a blob before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Garfield asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the problem,\" Beast Boy said, \"It's the culmination of your sexual desires and primal urges, from all the animals you can turn into.  It's what has been making you bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Garfield said.  The blob quickly shifted into some animals, before returning to the blob like state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Garfield's time had come.  It's time to grow up.  Grow big, strong.  Become the leader.  All follow Garfield.  Spawn children with those compatible.  Kill weak children.  Survive.  Must survive.</i>\" came the oily voice from the Blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, not cool,\" Garfield said, \"How exactly do we stop this part of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have that power,\" Beast Boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only you do,\" Beast said, \"You must either tame this part of you or you will become its slave.  Always attracting your friends to wanting sex with you, both male and female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Garfield said with a shaky voice, \"How hard can it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very hard,\" Beast Boy said, \"Harder than trying to beat a Trigon powered Slade and Trigon himself alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\" Garfield asked, as the blob moved closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this part of you can affect your subconscious mind.  Make your body emit pheromones to arouse both you and your friends.  Make you angry at them for no reason.  It will control you without a moment's hesitation,\" Beast said, \"That is why you must tame it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I'll try,\" Garfield said.  \"Hey blob-thingy!  I want you to stop controlling me like you do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Don't you like what I've done?</i>\" cane the voice again.  The Blob now transformed into what Beast Boy looks like now, nude.  \"<i>The girls do.</i>\"  It now made images of Raven and Star hanging on his massive arms.  \"<i>As does Robin.</i>\"  Robin appeared in front of Blob's groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice, but what those three feel for me isn't real.  It's manipulated inside them by what you make me put out.  I want you to stop everything!\" Garfield yelled at it.  Beast Boy and Beast shared a quiet smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No.  Never stop growing.  Not yet.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?  Like when ever I have sex with someone, I'll get bigger?\" Garfield asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Not until we are strongest,</i>\" Blob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just passed Cyborg in height,\" Garfield said, \"So there isn't much more to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Not the alpha until defeat old clan.  Not alpha until all submit to you.  Never stop until alpha.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you mean all the Titans must bow to me, and I defeat the Doom Patrol?!\" Garfield asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to happen.  I won't do that.  And you will stop altering me now!  I'm in control of this body, not you!  You will do as I say!  You will stop what are you doing right now!\"  The voice only laughed as Garfield felt a hard shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarfield woke up and saw he was in Robin's room, and there was a figure over his body.

Beast boy found the blanket that he threw off Robin's bed, and wrapped himself in it. \"I'm asking because I sensed that you were terrified, scared, yet brave.\" She flipped a page. Beast boy wasn't sure if he should tell Raven about what happened. He remembered that Raven has had multiple internal conflicts. She would be the best person to talk to, but he had to remember to try and not have sex with her, or turn her on in anyway. \"Raven, remember when you had to fight your dad?\" He heard Raven take in a breath of shock that this topic was being brought up again. \"Yes... why?\" \"Well, remember that you had conflicts with yourself, about telling us that you were the portal for him to rise, or that he was coming at all?\" \"Yes, where are you going with this?\" She said flipping a another page. \"Well, I'm having conflicts of my own.\" She put down the book now, and was all ears, yes she liked the muscles of Beast boy, but didn't feel as horny as before. \"Thanks Cy\" Beast boy explained his dream to her. She didn't understand some parts, and he explained some of them. She sat back in amazement, she thought she had problems. \"Ok, stay away from the others will be the best thing for you to do.\" She said. \"Do you want me to inform them?\" she asked. \"Only tell them about what's happening, not the whole dream.\" Raven understood, and left to tell the others on Beast boy's problem. All Beast boy did was lay on the bed, fighting every sexual thought from his head. He only wished today would end, or that none of this happened at all. He wanted everything to go back to normal. He wished he didn't sleep with his team mates, or had been \"Beast boy\" but Garfield Logan. He almost just wanted his life to end here, and now...</span></div></div>",

Right before he exited, He turned to  Robin and Starfire. \"Sorry.\" Then he walked out of the room. Robin and Starfire didn't look at Beast boy at all. If the chemicals he's setting off doesn't arouse them, the sight of him will. Cy followed Beast boy out, but Robin and Starfire stayed behind for a few minutes after. \"sorry <br>\r\nStar.\" Said Robin looking at his bed. \"It's ok friend, there was nothing we could do. Remember, it was the chemical he was giving off.\" Robin still felt bad. \"I should of had more control\" He said out loud to himself. \"Friend, I think I know what would make you better. He took of the head piece of her suit, and the head piece of Robin's suit and gave him a kiss. She was right, it did make Robin happy. It made Robin remember that she was the one he liked, the one he loved. He gave a kiss back, and grabbed is head piece. \"We should catch up.\" He said putting the piece on his head. Starfire agreed, and they walked out of the room, hand in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven was waiting for Beast boy to arrive. She had took the two beds that are usually in the room and made it into one bed to fit the now huge Beast boy. Beast boy lied down on the bed as Cy attached a band around Beast boy's head. Beast Boy started to relax on the bed. \"OK, this is your brain.\" Cy said showing it to BB. \"This area is where hormones are controlled from.\" He pointed to a bright red area on the screen. \"As you can see, it's the most active part in your head.\" BB nodded. \"What we can do, is send electro pulses into your brain in this specific area and try to deactivate it.\" \"No, i still need hormones.\" BB was right, Cy didn't think about that. Raven stepped forward. \"Remember when you were trapped in my head by this mirror?\" She asked. \"Yes, I do.\" He answered. \"Well, we can enter your mind too, all of us, and fight the blob from your dream.\" Beast boy realized that was what Beast boy, and The Beast from his dream, that he could only tame it. He could only tame it because he would have friends to help. \"Yes, that's what we have to do, Raven, but how are you going to sync your mirror with my head?\" He asked. And Raven took the mirror and stabbed Beast boy in the hand with the handle. The end was so pointed that it left only a pin prick on Beast boys hand. \"Ow! That hurt Raven, you could of warned me.\" He yelled grabbing his hand. \"Calm down, you wouldn't let me do it if you knew. Also, there's a problem.\" She said turning to the others. \"Beast boy may not be able to join us in his head.\" \"Well, you got into your own by the mirr-\" Cy started. \"No. I got in through meditation, something I don't know if Beast boy can try to do.\" A couple of light bulbs exploded over head. \"I can try, if you can show me.\" Beast boy said. \"Just get this fucking Blob out of my head.\" Robin had heard the plan and decided to speak up. \"Ok, Raven stays out here trying to get Beast boy to meditate. Starfire, Cy, and I will go in through the mirror.\" They all agreed.</span></div></div>",

I was asking because, before this, you always enchanted me. Your looks, smell, actions, all enticed me.\" Raven didn't know what to say. Beast boy got an expression on his face that she hadn't seen in a while. He was shy about telling her this, actually shy. Raven knew this was actually him speaking. She felt something inside her give a little jump. \"I'll think about it Beast boy, but we have to get through this first.\" He nodded, but looked a little down. \"Ok, breath in and when you exhale say 'azarath metrion zinthos' and try to relax. Beast boy did what she said and closed his eyes. When he opened them he was in the meadow again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin, Starfire, and Cy where a couple of yards away from Beast boy and Raven joined them from a portal that appeared. Beast boy walked over to them. They were surprised by the sight of him. \"What?\" He asked. \"Look at yourself.\" Raven said. He did, he was different, he was human again. \"Who's that behind you Garfield?\" Robin asked. Garfield turned around to see Beast boy and the Beast again. \"Are you here to tame it?\" They asked. Garfield nodded. \"Ok, because here he comes. Out of the forest that surrounded the meadow, came the Blob. Garfield felt terrorized at the sight of the Blob, but stayed strong. He took the hands of the Beast and Beast boy and they formed into the normal Beast boy. Robin saw the Blob, actually everyone did. \"Titans attack!\" Robin yelled. All of them attacked. Robin sent his bombs into the blob. and it grew as they exploded. Beast boy turned into a rhino and charged just to find it was charging at him too. They were fighting forever to no avail. Finally Raven pointed it out. \"This isn't working!\" she said as she sent a tree into the blob. Beast boy knew she was right. Wait...they're in his brain. He realized what he had to do. \"Everyone, step back!\" Clouds began to form in the sunny sky above. \"Raven focus your power on the clouds, Starfire, shoot your starbeam into the clouds!\" The clouds became black then went orange when Starfire shot into them. \"Cy, shoot your laser beam into the clouds too, and Robin, get your bombs ready.\" The clouds went red with Cy's shots. then the clouds started to separate. \"Robin, throw your bombs at the Blob, now!\" Robin did what he was told. Then a red Beam shot from the sky at the blob and Beast boy finished it off by charging at it. The blob was done, the combined power of the attacks had killed it off. It melted screaming at Beast boy. \"We won!\" Beast boy started jumping up and down at the sight. \"Come on let's leave.\" Raven said reopening the portal. Beast boy closed his eyes tight, and opened to be laying on the bed. everyone was there, but still in their suits. Cy was running another test to check if it was need to keep the suits on. It was clear. \"Ok, he's clear, you can take off the suits. Robin, Starfire, and Raven got out of the bio suits. that was until Beast boy started to yell. He was shrinking. By the time he stopped. He was Robin's height but still had muscles. \"I want this just to end!\" He yelled. \"It has,\" He didn't hear Raven come up to him. She was rubbing his head. \"And I like it.\" Raven was happy to see Beast boy normal, but a little bigger than before. \"We're going to leave.\" Robin said smiling. Everyone left Raven and Beast boy alone. \"I love you Raven\" He said. \"I love you too.\" They held each others hands and were happy.

He was so sad, and depressed, he couldn't do anything now. He saw the images of the blob from his dream with the other parts of his mind before his eyes. The blob was there in the middle, but bigger than before. The beast, and Beast boy looked weak, and old with age. He started to rub his eyes in disbelief, but he still saw them. He saw the beast and beast boy turn toward Beast boy on the bed away from the blob. They were wrinkled with age and barely able to move. They spoke slowly and barely loud enough to hear. \"He's killing us.\" said The Beast. \"Soon we'll be gone, and he will take over.\" Old Beast boy said. \"Never! I'll never give into you!\" east boy yelled at the Blob. \"But you already have, sleeping with Raven was the beginning, now you're too far to turn back, you're mine!\" The blob began to laugh. Beast boy was trapped. He looked around, and saw Robin's daggers. He walked over them and grabbed one. He turned to the Blob. \"If I'm not in control of myself then no one is!\" He dug the dagger into his flesh and pulled it down his arm. The pain was unbearable, but Beast boy didn't make a sound. He then dug it into his leg and cut a line down it. Then finally, he took it and shoved it into his heart. He leaned against a nearby table. He saw all three figures in front of him melt into nothing. The door opened and Raven came running in, and screamed at the sight of Beast boy. the last image Beast boy saw was Robin, Starfire, and Cy staring at him as Raven tried to heal his wounds, but they were too bad, and Beast boy saw a light. Beast boy saw his parents, and went towards them. He took one more look at himself and he wasn't green, he was human again. He turned around for one second towards his old teammates. Raven was yelling, and crying. He never have seen her cry before. Everyone else fell to their knees and started to cry, but tried to comfort Raven too. \"Bye friends, I'll miss you always.\" He then turned, and walked to his parents, and into the light.

He placed his hand on Beast Boy\u2019s shoulder, \u201cI know it may be hard to see but Robin cares he was just afraid-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy faintly smiled through a river of tears and absently stared into Cyborg\u2019s eyes. \u2018Enjoyment overlaps sorrow\u2019 Beast Boy contemplated<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyborg halted, understanding Beast Boy\u2019s fa\u00e7ade. Cyborg nodded, a silent agreement to Beast Boy\u2019s hidden plea for isolation. Beast Boy began to move. He desired to remove this pressure. He desired words that would soothe him. Cyborg\u2019s hand slid from Beast Boy\u2019s shoulder as Beast Boy trotted to his room. Cyborg noticed Beast Boy\u2019s bleeding free hands. Before Beast Boy entered the roof he was about to rap on Raven\u2019s door, but she was probably angry about exploding on her face, for she didn't even talk to him before battle nor after battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway even if he knocked she wouldn't respond and the door wouldn't open.</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He began to dream, then his dreams turned into an old memory, and his old memory shifted into a nightmare.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The facility ruptured the adolescent\u2019s purity because the area subjugated his liberty allowing regret to seep into his innocent mentality. Gentle forest green eyes began to fill with tears. The child attempted to recollect a human\u2019s tranquility; a petite and fragile emerald green hand ran across the frigid base longing for gentleness. The adolescent pressed his sharp ear against the base; rest would remove the burgeoning starvation. Tears flowed onto the adolescent\u2019s emaciated face; as the adolescent closed his exhausted eyes. An orange light spilled into the darkness revealing the child and the feces that surrounded his withering form. A silhouette of a figure, a male, appeared between the orange and the darkness. A demented and menacing smile crept on the male\u2019s face. The male lowered his posture to grasp the child\u2019s thick green hair. The male raised the child\u2019s head so that the child was peering into the male\u2019s ocean colored eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will change, murder, and feed my child\u201d The male\u2019s scent of liquor and sex bathed over the child creating a nauseating and suffocating cloud. He lowered the child\u2019s head and exited, allowing the darkness to conceal the adolescent\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe child\u2019s eyes opened slowly. Trotting and shivering could be heard by his sensitive ears. The child\u2019s stance adjusted to the presence; his body was consumed by hunger and dominance, he embraced the animal\u2019s fear. The child could feel a change sweep over his body; he became a predator lurking after his prey. His hands elongated into claws which caused acute pain to nestle in his hands. The sharp pain pressed the boy out of his trance. The child forced his body into a corner desperately trying to force his instincts, hunger, and dominance to calm. The animal, a female horse, squealed as its entrails and urine flowed down its hind legs. The child released a pain filled cry, a cry that was an amalgamation of human and animal. The child collapsed to his knees as the change swept over his fragile form. The child menacingly and powerfully strutted to the mare. A primal panting escaped the child\u2019s throat and entered and exited the atmosphere. His canine teeth elongated into daggers and his once innocent eyes narrowed into malice. The mare stood in defense; her robust legs rose and slammed against the cement floor. The mare strategically charged at the burgeoning child. The child grasped the mare by its head. His claws carved into the animal\u2019s eyes. Blood coated his hands. The child removed his elongated nails from the mare\u2019s eyes, and began to lick. The mare collapsed onto the floor in pain. The child enveloped the mare\u2019s throat with his teeth. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare\u2019s squeals ricocheted of the facilities walls and Beast Boy\u2019s slumbering mind. Beast Boy shuttered exiting his slumber trembling from the memory. The taste of animal blood resurrected in his system this caused Beast Boy to cringe in disgust. He rolled over to his side as he clenched onto his stomach and gurgled a 'bleh' type noise . Beast Boy\u2019s communicator began to sound. His superior\u2019s, Robin, voice emerged. Robin informed Beast Boy of the Titan\u2019s location, status, and requirement for Beast Boy appearance. Beast Boy did not have time to process and cast the dream from his mind and system. He expeditiously exited the roof of the tower and entered his room, which remained to be a disaster from the Beast\u2019s assault. This was the reason why he secretly, sometimes, slept on the roof. He grasped his uniform and began to place it on. Being that he was in a rush he fell over the items that were on the floor. His uniform rode into his private areas and rose inches above his ankles and his shoes were uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit\u201d he muttered, \u201cCyborg should help me wash my clothes\u201d he stated dismissing his clothes continuous sudden uncomfortable fit. While he removed the uniform from his body he searched for a larger pair of clothing. He placed his large training sweats and a tight top that outlined his developing muscles. He exited his room swiftly and journeyed to the battle unprepared mentally.</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve worn that outfit for two battles now salad face\u201d<br>\r\nBeast Boy peered at Raven\u2019s torso <i>\u2018she won\u2019t even look at me.

His voice squeaked, he tried to clear his throat but he released a voice that was raspy and a slightly deep. \u201cThey\u2019re uncomfortable even down to my shoes.\u201d Beast Boy raised his sweats and exposed his bare feet. He wiggled his toes to prove a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly Robin walked to his motorcycle, \u201cO\u2019 we\u2019re wasting time we have a crime to solve\u201d Robin managed to mouth, despite his exterior, Robin\u2019s interior was consumed by the true reason behind his clothes sudden fit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO\u2019\u2026 O\u2019?

This battle should be easy\u201d Cyborg stated while entering his updated car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Beast Boy pondered about shifting into a Peregrine Falcon, but to Beast Boy Raven appeared to be vexed, \u2018She must think I\u2019m a\u2014no she doesn\u2019t know\u2019 Beast Boy mind began to panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I ride with you Cy?\u201d Beast Boy nearly pleaded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter you don\u2019t want to soar with the wind?\u201d Robin questioned before placing his red helmet on and revving his motorcycle <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 I do, but\u2026\u201d Beast stated while gazing at Raven who was distancing herself from the Titans who remained on land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I would offer you a ride, but I don\u2019t think you can handle it\u201d Robin held a mischievous smile, although he was concerned about Beast Boy\u2019s \u2018condition\u2019 he didn\u2019t want to treat him as an enemy, outcast, not again. \u2018I have to learn how to treat Beast Boy it\u2019s the least I can do\u2019 he thought before peeling off to the crime scene. \u201cTitans Go!\u201d<br>\r\nCyborg peered at Robin and then finally Beast Boy and smiled. Beast Boy was sincerely smiling he appeared to be happy. Beast Boy hopped in the T-Car and gave Cyborg a pair of thankful eyes. This will be an easy battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunts Point Avenue\u2019s alleys were all painted black; there were a few people that lingered on the filthy midnight street of Jump City. Although the crowd was small, it was the darkness that blinded the Titans from the criminals\u2019 location. The criminals\u2019 tracks lead them to a street with three deep alleys and three tall abandoned apartment buildings. Beast Boy\u2019s senses were acute, for his eyes sight pierced the darkness, and this frightened him into silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong B you afraid of the dark?\u201d Cyborg teased<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy stated in a raspy huff his canine tooth peaking, \u201cNo.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn actuality he was afraid, not of the darkness, but his senses\u2019 extending his normal limitations. His sense of scent was peculiarly heightened. He could sense the faint odor of the criminals\u2019 perspirations and a familiar scent of liquor and cigars caused him to shutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if these criminals are not in the alleys?\u201d Starfire questioned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re in the alleys\u2026\u201d Beast Boy silently murmured in a trance, so no one heard his statement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we continue to search\u201d Raven stated in a even quiet tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Til we kick these criminals\u2019 butts\u201d Cyborg completed triumphantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! We will be kicking the butt. We are the Tit\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo they\u2019re in one of the alleys I can\u2014\u201d Beast Boy broke off into silence afraid his powers were getting out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a feelin\u2019 too that they\u2019re in these alleys, but\u2014Well, we have three alleys\u201d Robin sighed, \u201cI think it\u2019s best if we split up\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Titans nodded in agreement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRaven, Cyborg, take the alley closest to the left.\u201d Robin commanded as he pointed to the alleys, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStarfire, the middle, me and Beast Boy will take this alley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy shifted into a Sumatran Tiger to appease his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger lead the leader into the darkness. Robin\u2019s hand rested on Beast Boy\u2019s arched back. Robin did not want to light a torch. He did not want the criminals being capable of seeing the light and therefore fleeing, it was best if he allowed Beast Boy to guide him, so their location could be concealed.  After wandering deep into the alley\u2019s shadow the two male members came across a gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighed in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should inform the others that this alley is a dead end\u201d Robin explained to Beast Boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy peered up at his leader. <i>\u2018But their odors are so heavy in this spot\u2019 he thought.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin placed the communicator to his mouth, \u201cRaven, Star, Cy, this alley is dead\u201d<br>\r\nBeast Boy shifted into his human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps, they\u2019re in the abandoned buildings?\u201d Raven evenly spoke into her communicator<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, same here Rob, our alley is dead.\u201dCyborg gritted his teeth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes the alley is not alive. And I have found no signs of the criminals\u201d Starfire stated innocently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s check the\u2014\u201d In mid sentence Robin was startled by the street lights sudden burst in energy. An orange glow illuminated the shadows. Moments passed and there were no signs of movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRob is everything all right?\u201d Cyborg question in concerns<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Cy.\u201d Robin sighed after a few moments, \u201cJust a fluctuation in electricity. These criminals must be in the abandoned buildings. Titans go\u201d With the universal sign for action Robin ended the transmission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeast Boy,\u201d Robin called removing Beast Boy out of his stupor, \u201cwe got to go check these ol\u2019 building\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin and Beast Boy began to depart from the alley, but they were stopped by a sonorous, sensual voice, \u201cAa~ leaving so soon Titans?\u201d A silhouette of a tall male appeared out of the orange glow, \u201cWe\u2019ve been expecting you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy\u2019s and Robin\u2019s bodies tensed into a defensive posture, \u201cO\u2019 yeah well my fists are expecting to meet your face!\u201d Beast Boy chided <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Robin questioned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall male stepped further into the light exposing his identity, and two hulking, masked cronies. The tall male had a sea of black dread locks braided down into a knot that touched the middle of his long torso. His left eye was covered by a crimson eye patch, but the scar appeared well beyond the patch. The scar extended inches above his left eyebrow, and down his mahogany colored cheeks.  The male\u2019s face was well defined, and was outlined by a rugged goatee. Beast Boy studied his features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am but a friend visiting a friend.\u201d The male\u2019s eye shifted to Beast Boy, \u201cMy have you grown.\u201d The tall male did an analysis of his own.</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The air in Beast Boy\u2019s lungs exited all too rapidly, paralyzing Beast Boy to his knees. The tall male seized advantage of Beast Boy\u2019s defenseless guard. Grasping Beast Boy\u2019s by the rim of his tee-shirt and lunging him away from Robin.     <br>\r\nBeast Boy\u2019s body rolled on the cold ground, the tall male only walked to his victim, \u201cIt\u2019s been a while Garfield. O\u2019 no it\u2019s Beast Boy now, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\u201d Beast Boy could sense a wicked smile perched on the man\u2019s face. Beast Boy coughed in air while using his hands to raise his body. Before Beast Boy could stand the male grasped his thick green hair and delivered a knee to his chin. Beast Boy\u2019s faces heated up from the strike. The blow nearly shattered Beast Boy\u2019s teeth, but it caused tears to involuntarily enter Beast Boy\u2019s eyes. The metallic taste of blood caused Beast Boy to tremble; blood began to seep out of the sides of his mouth. The quavering green Titan spewed crimson at his assailant. <br>\r\n\u201cSuch a suitable move for filth.\u201d The man stated in disgust while removing the crimson liquid from his face with his sleeve, he then delivered a handsome strike to Beast Boy\u2019s stomach. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Garfield blood doesn\u2019t satisfy you anymore?\u201d<br>\r\nThe blow caused Beast Boy to collide into two tin dumpsters; Beast Boy was cringing, grasping onto his stomach and moaning in pain. His mind was uncontrollably traveling to the past, his past.<br>\r\n\u201cMm~ you turned over a new leaf.\u201d the male stated slowly while walking over to the cowering changeling, \u201cInteresting, how long will the fa\u00e7ade last? Garfield.\u201d He leaned in close to whisper in his pointed ears. The male grasped Beast Boy\u2019s ripped rimmed shirt, so he and Beast Boy could see eye to eye. The man slammed Beast Boy against the cooper colored wall, his long slender hands were wrapped around Beast Boy\u2019s throat. <br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Please\u2026\u201d Beast Boy choked on the lack of air<br>\r\nThe male shushed the quivering Titan in his clutches, \u201cGarfield, the fa\u00e7ade ends here\u201d his grip tightened. The male\u2019s sensual voice faded. A darkness swept over Beast Boy\u2019s body as a heat filled with wrath streamed through his veins.<br>\r\nBeast Boy\u2019s slashes were graceful, agile, and vigorous; he removed himself from the man\u2019s clutches by clawing at the man\u2019s face. The man stumbled releasing his grip, laughing he charged at Beast Boy, but the changeling swiftly dodged the brutal plunge. Beast Boy grabbed the male\u2019s dreaded hair causing the man to stagger backwards as Beast Boy pulled. Beast Boy\u2019s clawing hand carved into the man\u2019s neck. The man slid onto the floor, he touched the blood dripping from the gashes, and placed his crimson covered finger tips in his sight and smiled dementedly.<br>\r\nBeast Boy pounced, but was stopped by a boot entering his mid section. The fierce assault did not stop Beast Boy, in a matter of second the changeling presented the eccentric man with an elbow to his face. The man had no time to wipe the blood that was dripping down onto his lips or cradle his broken nose, Beast Boy pounced again this time landing on the man. The man covered his face as the animal before him continuously carved at his dark skin. The changeling saw that his swipes were failing, so he grabbed the man by the side of his face, sinking his elongating nails into the man\u2019s skin and slammed the man\u2019s head against the cement floor. <br>\r\nWhen Beast Boy awoke he found himself towering over the man his final thought was to kill. He fell backwards terrified. He searched for a sign that did not hold him responsible for the man\u2019s status. The scent and taste of blood left him wincing in self indignation; he was frightened to see a steady minute stream of blood flowing on the pavement. While holding his breath, he crawled to see if the man was alive. He placed a pointed ear to the man\u2019s chest and checked for a pulse. He heard shallow breaths rumbling in his lungs and felt a lingering pulse. A tear fell, the man was unconscious, and in relief he slid on the floor stopping at the man\u2019s feet. He buried his face in his hands; when he sensed the warm liquid he averted his attention to his hands, peering at the crimson liquid in bewilderment.<br>\r\nHe released tense breaths, panting. His thoughts ricocheted off the walls of his mind all leading to inadequate responses, dead ends.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He crawled over to the man and checked his pulse and his breathing, finally after checking the stranger\u2019s stats he released the breath he didn\u2019t even know he was holding.

You gave him a good <i>tusseling</i>\u201d Robin smiled and chuckled smally <br>\r\n\u201cNever was good with words.\u201d Beast Boy peered at his hands<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I\u2019ve noticed\u201d He hand Beast Boy a gauze so he could rid his hands of the stranger\u2019s blood; Robin disregarded his own pain. \u201cBeast Boy, do you know this man?\u201d Robin eyed him evenly<br>\r\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t know who he is\u201d Beast Boy remarked without hesitation as he played with the gauze, \u201cGuess some people hate me an\u2019 here I thought I was the ultimate dudester\u201d<br>\r\nRobin didn\u2019t know how to reply to Beast Boy\u2019s unhappy-go-bad lucky attitude because it didn\u2019t suit his character. In Robin\u2019s mind Beast Boy was a silly-constantly joyful-idiotic-pest that kept the team in high spirits if that\u2019s even imaginable. So what could he possibly say to cheer up Beast Boy when he was the one use to being perked up.<br>\r\n\u2018Shit\u2019 Robin\u2019s mind tumbled in aggravation. He crawled to Beast Boy\u2019s side, \u201cListen\u2014\u201d Robin trailed off when he heard the whimpers cascading in Beast Boy\u2019s throat; the whimpers were dangerously altering into sobs, and finally Robin watched clear drops fall onto the cement. Beast Boy couldn\u2019t fathom why he was weeping, he just felt so suddenly pressured with emotions\u2026. He felt something within him was breaking and the sensation was mind numbing and painful. <br>\r\n\u201cB\u2026Beast Boy?\u201d Robin wrapped his arm around Beast Boy\u2019s shoulder and cradled his alley in hopes to cure him.  \u2018Cure him?\u2019 Robin thought as his free arm cradled Beast Boy\u2019s shoulder; he didn\u2019t know how to cure Beast Boy he was emotionally, mentally, and physically unstable.<br>\r\n\u201cRobin I don\u2019t know-\u201d Beast Boy began. His warm breath was filled with tears and it bathed Robin exposed neck, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u201d Beast Boy head began to move rapidly as he quivered in Robin\u2019s embrace.<br>\r\n\u201cShhh\u201d Robin gently whispered, \u201cit\u2019s all right\u201d He tried to ease Beast Boy mind as well as his own. Robin hands caressed Beast Boy back soothingly, \u201cIt\u2019s all right to cry\u2026 You don\u2019t have to hide your face\u2026\u201d <br>\r\nBeast Boy pulled away slowly and stood up quickly, \"Robin I- Nothing let's cuff this bastard\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Beast boy had gotten to Robin by now. \"Well do you?\" He said as he pulled of his tight shirt, showing of his new muscles. Robin didn't know what to do. Do Beast boy, or run. He couldn't decide. His penis was like a rock at the sight of his friend. He wanted pleasure so badly, but what would happen? Beast boy noticed the bulge in Robin's pants, and knew the answer. Beast boy pulled off his pants for his penis to  have some breathing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin couldn't stop now, he wanted Beast boy, badly. Beast boy walked over to his bed and lied down. \"So are you going to have me or not?\" Robin had enough, he locked the door, and stripped nude. His penis hung in the breeze, and was a little shorter than Beast boy in front of him. Beast Boy reached under his bed, and pulled out a bottle of lotion. Robin was primed and ready. He went over to Beast boy, and started to rub his erection, Beast boy felt amazing pleasure and let out a growl. Robin then started to kiss Beast boy and got on the bed with him. After a while, Beast boy had found himself lower than he was before, near Robins member. He started to pump it, until Robin set little moans of pleasure. \"Ride me Beast boy, ride me.\" Robin said before Beast boy rubbed the lotion on Robin's throbbing member, and inserted it into his anus. \"Oh the pleasure\" Both of them thought as Beast boy slid up and down Robin's penis. The two went on till Robin sent out a load of cum. Then it was Beast boy's turn. They went on for hours, until the both had too much excitement. \"That was amazing.\" Robin said finally getting of Beast boy's growing dick. Beast boy was growing again, and everything was. They laid down next to each other till they both fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

After all, in the past months she had been sensing a sort of duality in Robin, and now, there he was, caught in the act of his own desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch passion was displayed in that static moment that Raven herself was concerned that she would be overwhelmed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should leave,\" she thought, but she did not<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't be here,\" yet she remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no doubt that they were both asleep. Their faint emotions showed only fleeting dreams. She did not know why she stayed; only that she did and that she could not move away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir embrace, covered only loosely by the sheets, radiated with passion in its strongest form, but Raven could feel no love in their minds, only lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stillness of the moment encompassed her as though the scene before her had been stopped by some unique combination of the cold morning air and the silence pressing in from all sides, held at bay by the shallow rise and fall of the lovers' chests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not the time for emotional thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came here to apologize, but this is nether the time or place for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, as quietly as possible, she backed out of the doorway and briskly returned to her quarters.

The rest of the Ravens still had some say in matters here. Which was why the pale grey limbs latched themselves onto Starfire's firm grip, desperately trying to keep Beast Boy a boy. With Tamaranean super strength to contend with, anything was possible- even castration. Raven had no intention to find out whether or not she could heal that type of wound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Star, for the love of Azar, let go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But friend Raven-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts!\" demanded the dark sorceress as she braced feet against the alien redhead, practically dangling off of her. \"Let go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy was faring no better here. For one thing, it was his manhood on the line. For another, he had two attractive ladies touching said member that identified him as male which led to a throbbing in his little friend which led to more pain in a neverending, vicious cycle as more blood was pumped into that part of his flesh. The only reason he wasn't screaming his head off was the fact that he had to concentrate on not orgasming- now that'd be a way to thank a friend, cum all over her for saving his little bud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas, he was a guy, and guys never claimed to be made of stern stuff. Besides which, Robin decided to make an appearance at his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's going on in here? I was trying to get some work done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all he heard before he came with a grunt that just screamed 'oh, I give up!', splashing a generous amount of semen on Raven and Starfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange skinned girl blinked at the panting and spasming boy on the bed. He'd somehow found the strength to drag a pillow over and promptly stuck his head under it, too tired to ask Star to let go of his deflating 'monster' as he curled up into a ball, halfway to tears as he groaned. What did he do to deserve this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven was blushing to the roots of her hair as multiple explosions and bangs went off inexplicably around her. Finally remembering herself, she took a deep breath before nervously wetting her lips. Bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rather amazing, the firing range of a human male's ejaculation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment she had no idea what exactly it was she tasted. All she knew was that it was pleased her and she wanted more. Her tongue neared her lips once more before her mind finally caught on to what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen boy ejaculated hard. New, unidentifiable source of moisture on her face and lips. She had just licked her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified, the sorceress turned to make her way to her room, mumbling something about meditation as she disappeared down the hall past a stunned boy wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of this awkward little unit was torn between leaving to take care of his own problem or going to his slight green friend and dispensing aid. It was a rather hard decision to make and he nearly whimpered at the sight of his green friend curled up like a newborn kitten. His eyes raked over his comrades body in a way that was highly inappropriate for a superior and his subordinate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar left very confused. No one would answer her questions.

She groaned and leaned against the cool metal door of her room and let her fingers roam to her lips. Her tongue slipped out and licked up the rest of the pleasing liquid off of her plump lips, and she groaned again as she slid to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I enjoy this so much?!\" she grumbled as she heard a light bulb out in the hallway explode. Rolling her eyes, she crawled over to the center of her room and crossed her legs. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath in. \"Azarath Metrion Zinthos...Azarath Metrion Zinthos...\" Raven chanted over and over again, finally feeling relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as she was starting to forget what had happened with Beast boy, a scene took place in her head. She was in said changeling's room, and she was wearing...well, not much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top she had on a large blue long sleeved shirt that came down to just below her thighs, and it had a paw print right in the center of it. On bottom all she wore was her lacy black thong, luckily mostly covered up by the shirt. She sat on Beast boy's bed, her legs bent at the knees and straddled out in front of her. She looked like she was posing for a playboy magazine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven could feel everything in this vision; her vision-self felt anxious, yet...seductive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door to the room opened slightly, revealing a very happy and very hard Beast boy. He smiled down at her, that one small fang poking out from his lips. Raven smiled and opened her legs wider, giving him a full view of everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licked his lips predator-like and pounced, knocking her on her back. She heard him let out an animalistic growl, turning her on like a light switch. She felt his hands gently tear off the fabric that binded her naked breasts from his hungry eyes, and felt those same emerald orbs gaze at her chest with awe. Smiling, she arched her back so their chests were touching and heard another growl escape his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Raven gasped and shot up, hitting her head on her dresser in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she had opened her eyes, she could still feel parts of the vision. His teeth were biting her neck...his hands massaging her breasts...his shaft rubbing up against her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, God...\" Raven moaned as she rubbed her head, a bump forming where she had hit it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes again, she looked around to see everything in her room rearranged. The candles that she had lit were burnt down to little stubs of wax, her mirror in her bathroom had a gigantic crack down the middle, and her bad was on the completely different side of the room! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\" she muttered and heard something else shatter behind her. Wincing only slightly, she began to clean the mess she had made. \"So much for meditating...\" she grumbled.

Beast boy was returning to his room by now. She shook her head. Beast boy turned around and their eyes met. Beast boy fell to the ground and started to yell. Raven ran to the aid of her fallen comrade. \"I can't breath!\" He yelled as he started to dig his claws into his out fit, ripping it off of his body. Raven stood there watching as he grew bigger. She stared at his muscles, and was breathless. He finally stopped, and stared up at Raven. \"Look at those muscles, you want to feel them.\" The voice rag again, and it was true. Raven wanted to feel Beast Boy, everywhere. \"What are you staring at?\" He said as he stood up. Beast boy looked amazing, his muscles were big, his hair was down to his neck, his green skin radiated, and Raven couldn't resist. \"Beast... boy... your tall.\" It was true. He toward over her by at least 3 inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast boy looked down at Raven, her face was speechless. That's when he caught a smell, a smell coming from Raven.
