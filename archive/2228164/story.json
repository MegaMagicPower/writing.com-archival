It's around 9:30 AM, and most of the residents are just getting up to begin their morning routines. Tim, an average young man in his mid twenties steps out onto the front porch of his home dressed in a blue robe with a cup of coffee in one hand, fetching the morning paper and the mail as he does every day. As he bends over to pick up the newspaper at the edge of the property, he hears a high pitched whistle coming from his left. He looks over to see the head of his neighbor, Katie the Kitsune, peeking over her side of the white wooden fence, a half mischievous half flirtatious smirk on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's only at this point Tim realizes she had whistled because she got a view of his backside when he bent over. He quickly stands back up, a slight blush in his face. Katie just giggles. \"Don't be so embarrassed, Tim. I think your butt is very cute.\" Tim sighed. Katie would often flirt with him like this, and he would always acknowledge her remarks but never returned her interest. It was nothing personal, he just wasn't interested in dating outside his own species. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks, I guess.\" He replied. Katie giggled again, batting her eyes and blowing him a kiss before going back inside. Though Tim wasn't romantically interested in Katie, he couldn't help but watch as she made her way back to her house, her hips and nine luxurious tails swaying side to side as she did so. Even he had to admit she was quite attractive. He still wasn't sure why she hit on him , though. He was nothing special and he knew it, and with a body like her's she could have any guy she wanted. I should really ask her why she's so interested in me sometime, he thought as he made his way back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim shares his home with two housemates, with whom he splits the rent. There was Tony, a large and muscular werewolf who worked at the local gym as a fitness instructor. Tim and Tony didn't exactly call each other friends, but they got along well enough. Then there was Tina, a ghost who technically was a tenant in the house before the other two, having died shortly after moving in about a year before Tony and Tim. She wouldn't say how she died, but whatever happened she didn't seem to let it bring her down. Tina was quite cheerful and optimistic, almost nothing seemed to dampen her mood. Her housemates aren't exactly sure what she does for a job, but as long as she helps pay her share of the rent, they don't really care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tim sat on the living room sofa to read the newspaper, joined shortly after by Tony. \"Anything interesting in there?\" Tony asked, only half interested as he switched on the TV. \"Same old stuff.\" Replied Tim. Tina suddenly rises up from beneath the sofa on the other side of Tim, having just been down in the basement of the house a second before. \"So guys, anything happening today?\" She asked, to which Tim and Tony both shrugged and grunted in response. Tina huffed and crossed her arms as she gave a little pout \"You guys are always either working or just sitting around. Come on, it's  the weekend! Let's go out and do something for once!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Please note, this first chapter was just to set up the main cast and get the first episode rolling. The first episode of the first season will begin right where this leaves off. Each season will have a total of 12 to 15 episodes. Depending on how well this does, I may add additional seasons. For now, let's focus on the first. Please do not worry about any future seasons for the time being, and if you have an idea for an episode, put it in the current season list. Thank you.)</span></div></div>",

He helps people, to become stronger, healthier, better. As much as he enjoys helping people they can be so difficult sometimes, which leads to him get extremely angry. Tony exhaled when he entered his car. He placed his key into the ignition and drove off.   Tony was so glad that he bought this sports car, he smiled as he felt the wind in his fur. He sometimes just drives to feel the wind in his fur. He doesn\u2019t know why he enjoys it so much, he just enjoys  the feeling of euphoria going through his fur.  Tony brought his attention to the road, knowing that this isn\u2019t time or place to be day dreaming. He almost caught up in the Canine phenome. The canine phenome was a study several years about how canine lycanthropes  and how their statically more likely to be caught in a crash. It was first thought that the statistics were just coincidently, but after this study it was found out it had to with an old instinct passed down through generations.  Because of this It became extremely hard for lycanthropes to get drivers licenses. It was extremely troublesome.  <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tony pushed those thoughts away, and continued to drive. He drove through gazing around the small town, and the rows of new building that were build by mythical Incorporated.  He was looking forward to trying the new restaurants, especially McDaris, not to be confused with McDevils the\u2026. club.  Tony drove passed the restaurants, and drove into his neighbor. Waving hello to some of neighbors before driving into the garage. He got out of his car, and headed into the house. He then sat down on the couch, and starting to scroll through his feed. He suddenly stopped scrolling, as he stopped on a photo of Hannah, a hot Lycan that he used to date. She was hot in her wolf form , as well as in her human form.  He sighed, he sure does miss her, and seeing her with a new boyfriend several weeks after they broke up made him start fuming. He took deep breath in and calmed himself.  He was glad he took those anger management classes, it really helped.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI guess she already moved on, so it\u2019s time for me to as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He pulled up a dating app called Cinder, that he downloaded one night when mopping around after their break up.  He opened up the app and quickly created a quick profile, and created it. He was surprised when it matched him someone almost instantly.  His match with an attractive dark skinned human named Raina(Ximena) she was wearing a cute hoody  covering her head , she had a nice smile. He clicked on her profile and started reading her self-summary. Tony discovered that she was lived near him, so using his \u201cmanly\u201d charms he convinced her for him to take her out for a date tomorrow. Tony satisfied put away his phone and headed to bed.  Tony said goodnight to his housemates, and walked over to the bathroom to brush his teeth. As he looked into the mirror, he forgot he forgot he stayed lycanthrope form that he has been in for 3 three weeks straight.  \u201cThat\u2019s not good\u201d he thought as he transformed back into human form, he saw all of brown fur retreat back into his skin, and his fangs retreating back into his teeth.  His yellow eyes diming back to his regular greens. As he got acquainted with his human form, he has to stop doing that. It is dangerous for Lychantropes to stay in their wolf forms. It can awake the inner animal within then making them rapid. It sadly happened to his uncle.  <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRest in Piece uncle Benny\u201d he said underneath his breath.<br>\r\n \u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He knows that he shouldn\u2019t relax in his wolf form, but it just seemed more natural. He took a quick shower that he hadn\u2019t had in days, and instead of wiping it off with a towel , he instinctively  shook it off.  He sighed as he went clean up the mess, he then brushed his teeth and went to sleep.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He woke up in a good mood the next day and decided to hang out with some friends today before  he was going to go on the date. He walked out into their backyard, a took in the morning air. He walked back in just in time for the toast to pop out of the toaster. He quickly put it on his plate with his eggs, ham, and bacon. He quickly devoured his food. He heard a yawn as Tim walked into the room, <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGood morning.\u201d Tony said as Tim sleepily walked over the coffee make and made a coffee.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGood morning Tony.

I haven\u2019t seen you like this for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, I actually forgot I have been in my Lycan form for a while.\u201d Tony chuckled<br>\r\n\u00a0 <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can forget that but to be fair I am not a Werewolf.\u201d Tim chuckled back<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you guys chuckling about?\u201d Tina said as she floated up from the basement.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Tina.\u201d Tim and Tony said in unison which both of them repeated \u201cjinx!\u201d, and \u201cjinx again!\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tina rolled her eyes, but quickly changed her tune when Tony said that he is going out.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTony, please take me with you, I am so bored!\u201d <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tony declined her plead several more times before leaving and heading to ___.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nWhere will Tony go to meet his friends?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The entire restaurant had a romantic atmosphere, candelabra hanging from the ceiling with a romantic music playing around him. Their was a artificially made foundation leading to a coy pond.  As he is being seated he looked at the table with two forks,  two spoons and fancily folded napkin.

Tony stood their eyes widen still processing the godly kiss he was given. He stood for a while, then snapped out of it and drove home with a chipper mood. He then went home, and collapsed in bed. He woke up in the morning still with chipper mood from last night. He just laid in bed for a little before getting up to the smell of bacon and eggs. He got up and went to the kitchen to see Tim cooking his famous Sunday breakfast. Tim is really good at cooking; he is a god at cooking. Tony sat down as Tim placed some food on his plate. Tony consumed the meal, while Tim placed some food on his plate. Tony rubbed his belly full from the godly meal he just ate. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you, for the great meal, Tim.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, prob.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo, your in a chipper mood today Tony.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, I guess I am.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c I haven\u2019t seen you this happy , since you got the highest score on wolfman(this worlds equivalent of Pacman)\u201d Tim responded<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201dYou got so angry when, I passed your score.\u201d Tony laughed<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOf course, I did!

Tony drove to meet Remington. Tony was excited to see Remington\u2019s Sushi place. Tony drove up to a building with architecture similar to what you would except in Japan. Tony saw Remington closing up shop, and walking up to his car. As he entered the car it immediate starting running and driving away. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo, Remington. How was the reopening of your sushi place?\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was pretty stressful, but we are used to stress, aren\u2019t we?<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, we are.\u201d Tony said with a nostalgic lens It was a lot simpler back then.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCan\u2019t say I miss it though. \u201c<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, me neither, but sometimes I miss just be able to brawl it all out in my wolf form.\u201d Tony clutched his fist.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Remington stared at him, looking as he wants to say something, but he also missed the freedom that it brought. Tony and Remington lived in a ghost pretty much and had to fight to survive since a young age. Even thought it wasn\u2019t a very nice place to live it was all they have known. It was definitely different from how they live know, they their street was teared down and the cops started crack down on violence in the era, they became more peaceful, but also more restricted. They arrived at____. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Where do they arrive at?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Okay, so here's the rundown. As with most of my stories, this takes place in a world where humans and mythical creatures coexist. The three main characters, a human, a werewolf and a ghost are all housemates living in a suburban neighborhood somewhere in the US. The series follows their daily misadventures as they try to go about their lives, making ends meet and getting into various hijinks along the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here's how this works. Select a \"Season\" and then an \"Episode\"', then follow that episode's primary plot as described. At certain points you'll be given the chance to decide what happens next. Understand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, some groundrules...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No killing the main characters<br>\r\n2. No short chapters, unless you're just giving more choices for episodes<br>\r\n3. If you're going to end an episode, let it reach a minimum of 7 to 10 chapters in length first<br>\r\n4. Feel free to come up with your own ideas for future episodes. All are welcome! Just please make sure your idea hasn't already been listed<br>\r\n5. I may edit or add rules as I feel is necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf your additions are really good, I may give up to 10,000 GP per add, depending on their quality. That's all for now, enjoy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, if anyone can think of a better title for this story, please let me know! I'll be sure to credit you for it. <br>\r\n</td>",
