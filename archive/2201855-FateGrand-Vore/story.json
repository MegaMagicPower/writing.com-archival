In this singularity the femal servants are at the bottom of the food chain and everything wants to eat them. Will they make it back to their master or will they become food?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1.) Scathach is the only female servant capable of being immune to digestion.<br>\r\n2.) Only one female servant per story line.<br>\r\n3.) The story only ends when he female servant we're following is eaten and digested.<br>\r\n4.) Female servants must eventually be eaten.<br>\r\n5.) Soft and cock vore only.<br>\r\n6.) Swimsuit servants will always wind up on a tropical island.<br>\r\n7.) Have Fun.</td>",
