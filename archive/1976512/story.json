            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to check out the area where the noise was coming from alone. Your friends are way to drunk to get up anyway so there is no reason to even try to get them with you. So you grap your flashlight and start walking through the night. You just traveled about some hundred meters through the forest as you arrive at a zone which looks like that a plane crashed. You stand next to a tree as you take a overview of the chaos. Something is wrong, there is no fire or something which would usually burn when a plane crashes, to bad that your flashlight isnt strong enough to give you a good view about the area. In the dark distance you can see two shadows nearby whats to seems to be the wreck, they are just standing there and it seems like that they are talking to each other. You are a little bite nervous but if those people need help, you should offer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you allright?\" you nearly yell towards them. They dont make any moves so you walk towards them. \"Do you need any help?\" you keep asking as you get closer and closer. You point your flashlight to theyr feet, not wanting to blind them. One of the two persons actually get something out of its pockets, you cant tell what it is your flashlight seems to run out of battery aswell. When you are finally about 3 meters in front of them, you notice that theyr faces are not human, all you see are hairs, but you cannot tell exactly what it is. In a fraction of a second you feel some electric shock running through your body and you collaps, everything fades black, the one shadow has shoot you with the thing of its pocket, that is the last thing you can remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up, in a very well light up room which looks very modern, everything in this room is made out of some white metal and the green lights turns everything into a relaxing atmosphere. But actually you dont feel relaxing at all, you try to get up but you cant move at all, you notice that you are tied up on your arms and legs. the cuffs are not to tight but not comfortable as well. Suddenly a door infront of you is opening and a weird looking person enters the room. It's a animal like human....a anthro?! You are confused, is this real or are you still drunk or having a bad dream?! She looks like an owl... yes a female owl, you are sure about this. She is wearing some white coat and pants and she has some dark brown feathers, she actually look like a doctor. She gets closer to you and you are shocked, not able to say anything. She types something on her arm and a hologramm appears, it shows a human body, your body, as the bracer starts to scan your body. Some digital letters appears in a unknown language. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vitality values clear, DNA structure complete, pulse... slighlty above normal.\" says the owl lady with a adult voice which sounds like a regular human female. You gulp and gather some braveness to speak. \"You can understand me?\" you ask, still in fear. The owl lady just nods \"yes human, we do.\" she says that so easily just like that such meetings are usuall. After this quick chat, she turns arround and moves towards the door again. You are still pinned to the bed but you better ask quickly more questions before she just leaves: \"What are you going to do to me?\". Not really surprised by that question the owl lady awnsers while stepping out with: \"The Captain decides what to do with you. Meanwhile...\" she pushs a button on her bracer and the bonds open up. \"...you should calm down a little bit. You better dont try any stupid things.\" With those words she leaves the room and the door closes as a green light on it turns red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk arround a little bit and notice that you dont have any shoes on, actually you only have some white jogging pants on. You check the walls and notice immediatly that this isnt a material that you have ever seen before. It's like soft metal... just weird you think to yourself. Just like the lights, they are bright but not blinding you at all. Minutes past by as suddenly...</span></div></div>",

You have sitten on your bed but you stand right up as three other anthros enters the room. Two of them wearing similar suits which seems to be very tight, they have some dark grey color and are patterned with honeyomb. It looks really futurestic, especially because a male husky and a female gecko are wearing them. Obviously those two seems to be the guards cause the device they are carrying are held like projectile weapons. The third one seems to be the captain, her formal clothes are held in dark brown. She is a fox lady which shows her authority just with the pose of her body. You dont know what to say, you are nervous again but this dosnt matter because the fox lady begins to speak first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Captain Eliana Serah and i want to welcome you onboard of the BS - Explorer\". She paused, giving you the oppertunity to awnser. You need some seconds to realize that but you began to relax yourself and awnser her as brave as you can: \"Thank you Captain, i'm Nick Saunders... from earth.\" You feel yourself stupid, of course you are from earth, they kidnapped you from there! The fox lady reveals a little smile by that as she awnsers: \"We know that, Nick Saunders, we actually brought you here. I hope you feel allright?\" You ask yourself this question in your mind, and you also have a awnser, even if she isnt going to like it: \"Allright?... How shell feel when i get snatched by some animals?! Shell i fell allright?!\" that was a surprising move, even for yourself. Actually your are not in the position offend her or any of them. But she seems to play cool and she says calmly: \"Well Mr. Saunders, we understand your misery, but we had no other choice to take you with us and make you a part of our community according to \u00a768 in the Human Contact protection Act.\" Now you are even more confused, it seems like the universe has made his own laws for the treatment of humans?! the world is turning upside down for you and in disbelife you ask: \"What.... what is that mean?\" The fox girl smiles again and she awnsers quickly: \"It means that when a Human has contact with one of our species, he or she will be fully integrated into our social life and world to avoid the discovery of interstellar life by humans... or you would call us Aliens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit back down on your bed, you are overhelmed by all these news. Captain Eliana Serah waits a minute before she begans to speak again: \"I understand if you need some time to catch on all those new experiences. But when you need anything those two guards will support you, they will show you everything you need. And if you need any more informations you can come over to my quarters.\" With that she leaves, the guards following her until your frontdoor. The Quesiton is, what are you going to do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nick felt his blood begin to boil when he saw Elora take off her shirt and sat on the newly created bed in his room. She was such a sexy creature, having a body that a human woman couldn't hope to hold a candle to. There wasn't a single flaw with her figure. Her legs were long and slender, matched with a thin waist and flat, toned stomach. Since she was a panda, she had black and white fur covering the whole of her body, with most of it being the color of the former. The only parts that were white were the front of her torso that also stretched around her slender waist to cover most of her back as well, her pretty face and her small puffy tail that hung just above her luscious, tight ass. She had her long legs crossed while she gave him a lustful gaze with her piercing green eyes, her plump lips curled up into a sexy smirk. She made sure to thrust her chest out to further entice him with what was definitely the most prominent of her features, which were her huge, round boobs that were capped with these small, cute and rubbery black nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost men would probably be wondering if they could give such a gorgeous women the performance she deserves. Nick... well, he never had such thoughts since he knew how good he was at pleasing his lovers. And even though she was a completely different species from him, that didn't deter him in any way. He took a few steps towards the busty panda so that he stood right in front of her, letting her eyes roam up his body to meet his lustful gaze that conveyed just how confident he was right now. He could tell that he was having an effect on Elora already because of the way her breathing had quickened and how her nipples were twitching from how hard they were. Perhaps it was because of the predatory demeanor he was trying to give off. Apparently, it was working like a charm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking thirsty all of a sudden, Elora,\" Nick spoke to her huskily. \"I know something that you can drink to help you out...\" He tugged on the hem of his white sweat pants a couple of time to further hint what he was talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElora shuddered and averted her eyes from his to see the large bulge in his pants, causing her to lick her sumptuous lips in both lust and anxiousness. She gently brushed his hand away with one of her black furred paws and hooked her fingers on his pants and the boxers beneath them before she looked up at him. \"I love it when a man is so thoughtful,\" With a quick pull, his pants and boxers slid down and pooled around his ankles. At the same time this happened, his cock came flying out at Elora's face, bumping up against her chin which made her gasp and lean her head back to see just what sort of monster he possessed. It slapped against his stomach before it stood proud and erect in front of her face, pointing right between her eyes, allowing her to see it in all of its thick, veiny glory. Easily, it was about ten inches long and had a girth that matched it perfectly. It bobbed enticingly with the beat of his heart with prominent veins running along the shaft that made her want to trace her fingers along them. It had a large, mushroom-shaped tip that looked like it would do quite well in filling her up in all of the places she wanted. \"Oh! And so giving as well! I can't wait to get that drink from you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take as much as you want,\" The human said to her with a wide grin. \"I've got plenty in the tank for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled sensually up at him while wrapping the fingers of her left paw around the shaft of his mighty length. \"Don't mind if I do then...\" The curvy panda stroked his cock up and down a couple of times, enjoying how hard it felt in her paw and how it throbbed every now and then. It just felt so strong and thick... she was getting wet from just the scent it was giving off. Not being able to hold herself back, Elora dipped her head downward and let her tongue slide out of her mouth. She used her paw to make his cock point upward, allowing her to run her tongue from the bottom all the way across to the tip of the fleshy pillar. Nick groaned in delight at this, knowing that this was going to be good. The busty panda did the same to the left and right sides of his cock as she couldn't get enough of the taste of her first human cock. Wanting more, she leaned her face back and pointed the tip of his cock at her mouth. \"Ah~\" She moaned when she opened her mouth wide and began to take his cock inside of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick placed a hand on the top of her head as he watched his cock make a disappearing act inside of her wet orifice. The heat of her breath and the wetness of her tongue that dragged along the bottom of his shaft made him groan rather loudly, his mind wondering just how far she was going to be able to go. \"Fuck!\" He cursed when he saw her go past the seven inch mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElora stopped at this point, her eyes lidded from the taste of his cock in her mouth and the his musky, male scent invading the nostrils of her cute black nose. \"Mmm...\" She moaned while closing her eyes and wrapping her plump lips onto his dick to form a tight seal around it. She dragged her lips slowly backward until only his tip remained in her mouth before she plunged forward, this time taking the entirety of his cock into her mouth and burying it within her tight throat. Her ears heard Nick groaning in pleasure, which delighted her and so she continued in order to keep him feeling like that. Elora closed her eyes to concentrate on sucking the absolutely delicious cock in her mouth. Her cheeks hollowed every time she drew her face back, hugging the sides of his cock nicely and adding a suction he'd never felt before from a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sexy panda let his cock slip out from her mouth with a loud pop, nuzzling it once she did. \"My god... this cock is amazing.\" She whispered against it. \"So hard and thick...\" She left a trail of kisses from the side of his length until she was at the tip, where she took it into her mouth again and then let it pop out from her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really know how to suck a dick, don't you?\" Nick questioned the sexy anthro working on his cock, groaning when he felt her kisses on his shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded while she was busy lavishing the fleshy pillar with her tongue. \"I could play with it for hours and never get enough!\" Elora exclaimed to him, her tone full of lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his cock throb against her tongue when she was licking it from the bottom to the top for what seemed like the millionth time but still felt just as great every time she did it. She moaned when he did this, sending a pleasurable vibration throughout his cock that caused him to groan as well. His eyes lowered and he saw her large breasts jiggling with every motion she made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElora soon noticed this, a sensual smirk curling up on her lips as she looked up at this stud of a human. \"I see that you're paying a lot of attention to my boobs,\" She noted and cupped the massive jugs with her paws, bouncing them a couple of time with them. \"Do you like them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There isn't a thing about you that I don't like, Elora,\" Nick confessed, bringing a hand down and traced his fingertips along the slope of her left breast, seeing her furry flesh rebound against his fingers and taking in just how soft they were. \"You have such huge tits and everything else about your body is nothing to sneeze at either. I'm sure that the other men on Earth wouldn't have a problem letting a sexy girl like you suck their cocks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad for them...\" She giggled. \"Since you're the only human whose cock I'm going to be sucking and letting you do whatever you wanted to me. I mean that too...\" Her voice lowered to a more sultry tone before she licked her lips. \"Whenever you feel like it, you can call me and I'll be here to do all I can to satisfy this cock of yours. Whether it's from sucking you off...\" She lifted her giant, pliable breasts up with her paws, the bottom line of her cleavage hovering over the tip of his cock. \"To using these huge... soft... tits...\" She lowered herself  and let his whole length plunge into the valley of softness that she created for him. \"And I know you'll love how tight my pussy is. Or do you just want to make this a one time thing?\" Elora looked up at him when she asked the question, wondering if it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a living room, with a couch and glass coffee table, a small dining area with a large table, a bathroom with a large tub, and a bedroom with a large bed.

So i had to invite you into my private rooms.\" she smiles. First you are kinda shocked, but the warm and soft palm of her hand on your private parts feel so good that you just lean back a little bit. She starts to massage your crotch with her whole hand and soon you begin to get a hard on. <br>\r\nThen she puts one of her legs over your body onto the other side of you so that hear nice formed rear is resting on your chest. Slowly she lowers her butt and soon her whole weight is resting on your chest, pinning you down and giving you a view on her swinging tail which reveals her butt once in a while. \"Eliana...\" you stummer but you get immediatly silenced by the fox lady. \"Hush! You are my guest, so you better take what i offer you.\" she giggles and starts to massage her hand on your crotch now even harder. <br>\r\nYou do what she demands and lay still on the bed. But you cant help yourself, you have to grab her butt with both hands! As you do so, the fox lady shrugs for a second in surprise but enjoys your move right away. She takes a look at you and slides her rear towards your head. With one of her hands she slides up her skirt and presents you her cheecks with a delightful smile on her face. \"Do you like what you see?\" she asks amused and you just nod. Your fox mistress seems to wear a black thong that is hiding deep between her legs and rear. She begins to wiggle her butt onto chest back and forward. It's like a dance that she performs, just with her rear, right in front of you. <br>\r\nHer hand loses the grip of your crotch as she notice that your dick is allready hard. \"Oh... what do we got here?\" she giggles as she...</span></div></div>",

Actually you just feeling a little bit cold by just wearing those pants. So you walked towards the door and opens it. The two guards where waiting for you there. The Gecko girl turns towards you: \"How can we help you?\" You didnt noticed her before, but now that you talk to her personally you notice her well formed body. She isnt that muscular like the Husky right next to her, but very well looking. After you scanned her body - which she deffinitly noticed- you awnser: \"I... I need some clothes... please.\" The Gecko girl nods and scans the human body infront of her as well as she says: \"I see... well, follow me.\" She starts moving and you follow her right away, the male Husky is right behind you. It seems like that they really want to get sure that you dont do come up with bad ideas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the girls through a long hallway, everything and everywhere is this soft white metal and the green light. Everything looks like it was made from some futeristic designer. But as you walk behind her you have a even better view on her butt. She has some well formed rear, small and compact... for a gecko you think. The ship seems to be gigantic as you keep walking with them through it. You start to think of the words of the Captain... BS - Explorer... \"What does the BS in BS - Explorer mean?\" you ask them. The male Husky which is two heads bigger then you awnsers: \"BS means Battleship, it is the third biggest Ship in a fleet. But the Explorer was redesigned for Covert-Ops.\" Very great cover when you crash into a planet you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the gecko girl comes to a stop as she is standing infront of a gigantic door three times bigger than the door of your room, on it stands *Armory*. She uses her braces to unlock the door on a nearby terminal, loud mechanical sounds appears and the door opens quickly. They enter and you are immediatly stunned by the size of that warehouse. The Armory has the size of two football fields and the hight of at least 15 meter. A bunch of Drones are flying arround and sorting crates from one side to another. Right infront of the entry sits a female squirrel on a gigantic desk, it seems that she commands the drones on her hologramm table pad arround. She wears just a white tanktop and a really really short jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira, we need some clothes for the human.\" says the gecko girl without wasting any time. The Squirrel stops to command the drones right away and her eyes rests on you. She leans back and brings up her paws right onto the desk, she makes it herself very comfortable: \"So this is the human everyone is talking about.\" says the Squirell girl as she begins to take a long look on your body and by that she is smiling all the time. The gecko girl gets impatient: \"Mira... Clothes!\" she demands as the young Squirell girl finally stands up: \"Allright allright, YOU, come with me.\" she says agressive to you as she stands up and marchs directly towards a seperate room. You need a second to follow her command but follow her hastily. The two guards seems to stay put and begin to have a brake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you arrive the other room the Squirell girl is allready checking some clothes on a small terminal for you. The door behind you closes and she types something in which probably could fit to you. A cabinet is automaticly sorting the choosen clothes and delivers them onto a table nearby. While she is keep searching out some outfits for you, you start to check her body, she has some very long legs and compared to that a small body but all in all she is kinda cute and also maybe just a centimeter bigger then you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally there are two outfits you can choose from. \"Cmon, try them.\" she says. You are not sure about this, you cant see any changing room so you better ask: \"Where can i change my clothes?\" the squirell starts giggling and she shakes her head. \"Are you serious?\" she asks \"...just turn off your pants and turn on the other one like everyone does it.\" Still not sure about to expose yourself in front of her, you turn arround and switch your pants as quick as you can, but in the time where you turned off your pants she sneaks behind you and embrace you with both arms. You can feel her breasts pressing against your back. Her fur is very soft and warm. You escape her hug and turn arround, you both are looking into each others eyes...</span></div></div>",

She press her mouth against yours and starts to play with her tongue. First it feels really weird and new but you lat her pass as also your tongue finds its way towards her mouth. After this hurried kissing action she decided to move on, she picks you up under your armpits and literally throws you onto the nearby table. She is amazingly strong for such a small and also slim girl. So you lay now on your back on the table as she jumps right onto you, pinning you down with her body by sitting on your chest and her knees are pressing down your arms. She swings her butt gently over your chest as she slowly begins to unzip her tight short jeans and as she do so she says: \"I hope that you are good human and you do what a girl is wishing for.\" Finally she pulls her jeans half way down and you can see her white colored panties and on her panties is something printed, a hazlenut right where her vagina is. The hazlenut looks a little bit deformed because her cameltoe seems to be allready eating this nut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up, taking off her jeans completly and throw them away. Her tail is wiggling in anticipation so she comes back down on her knees again, but this time her sex is very close to your face. You are surrounded by her legs and by that also by her warm and soft fur. \"Are you hungry for a little hazlenut?\" she asks as she grinds her indexfinger over her pantys playfully, you just nod. \"Yeah? Then lick it.\" she demands and burrys her sex with her pantys on right onto your lips. You begin to lick and you notice that the smell of her vagina is stronger then you thought. The young squirrel giggles and begins to enjoy the show as she grabs for her breasts to massage them by herself. Then she begins to ride with her lower body all over your face and whenever her sex makes contact with your nose she adds a little bit more pressure. Its getting hard for you to breath underneath her but you do your best to pleasure her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of this joyride she gets switchs to the next step. She paused for a second and with one strong pull she rips off her pantys. Of course you allready have a hard-on, so she turns arround and continues the sensation how she wants it by inserting you dick into her sex. She moves up and down, back and forward, always showing you her butt, her fluffy tail is raised up high because of the sexual sensation. \"Hm.... yes! .... Yes!\" she says restrained, not wanting to let the others hear whats going on in here. You both come together right at the perfect time so she gets suddenly slower. She turns arround with a satisfied smile on her face: \"Good job Human\" she giggles and gets closer to your face just to lick all over it. You dont do anything and let the procedure go on. When she is done, she gets up and turns on her tight black jeans again. \"My Name is Nick by the way.\" you tell her as you get into a sitting position. She giggles again and says: \"So... Nick... you better turn on your outfit, before some other sexyhungry ladys are coming into here...\" she slides into her pants and looks towards you \"...and we do not want that, do we?\" she says with a little smirk on her face. \"Uhm... no...?\" you replied and immediatly start to take on your new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds you are ready and willing to go as Mira comes closer to you once again. \"You better dont forget me and i hope you will visit me here from time to time.\" she says gently as she nearly rubs you her used pantys from before under your nose, the odor of her sex immediatly hits your nostrils. \"I wish i could stay here with you.\" you say and your heart beats faster. She just start laughing and says: \"Belive me, you wouldnt survive it, now go!\" she says friendly but still demanding and gives you a pat on your butt. So you do as she says and you get back to the guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards are still on the point where you have left them, they just talk and laugh about something as they see you coming. They turn back to theyr typical military stand, the husky asks: \"Finally done?\". You are not sure if they notice what happens, but the best way is to play along and awnser calmly: \"Yes, it seems to fit very well.\" you awnser, you are wearing now a light brown suite which feels very different then the clothes you are usually wearing. The gecko girl seems to start to speak as suddenly the loudspeakers of the armory roars: \"Nick Saunders with Guardians, please come to the ...................................... \"</span></div></div>",

Following orders as they should the two guards lead you throughout the ship. While you three walk you look around the ship silently, there are dozens of different rooms with different things going on in them. There was one lab room, you peered through the window quickly to see a skinny male crocodile pour some kind of concoction into different beakers. You later notice a kind of lounge room with arcade games that assumed similar forms and looks as one\u2019s on earth. You then noticed a few medical rooms where you saw an elderly female raven coughing and a muscular looking male fox giving blood. This entire ship looked like some fully sustainably space community. Then you noticed a few rooms with weapons. As you got a few quick glimpses through the windows to the rooms you saw firing ranges where many different anthros of all shapes and sizes were firing an array of artillery from projectile weapons like on earth to laser guns to cannons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking in awe you slammed into something large and metallic, you notice the guards giggling behind you, you had just slammed into the door of the captain\u2019s headquarters. You heard a giggling from behind the door, \u201cMust be the human, come, come in.\u201d The female gecko puts her paw on some kind of holographic scanner opening the door for you, you turn to her, \u201cThanks.\u201d You smiles at you, \u201cAny time, lover boy.\u201d Your heart sank as you walked into the captain\u2019s headquarters, they knew. The room looked like a large conference room with large holographic screens projecting what is undoubtedly television from their planet. Most of what was being show on the screens was casual news, you were kind of happy seeing so much familiarity across this ship, so many things that humans do that these creatures do to. Maybe being taken from your world wasn\u2019t what you had planned for today, but at least these creatures act fairly human, have similar interests and technologies like humans and\u2026 um\u2026 mate like humans, there are even other humans on their planet that they have snatched up from earth, living completely peaceful lives amongst these aliens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox lady turned in her large metallic chair to face you all, she had a warm smile on her face, \u201cAh, Nick, take a seat.\u201d You end up taking a seat at the end up the table, the captain giggles, \u201cOh you\u2019re a silly human aren\u2019t you. When I said take a seat I meant a little bit closer to me, I\u2019d like to talk to you.\u201d You get up and take a seat right next to her. She smiles warmly at you, \u201cSo how have the last few hours been, adjusting well so far.\u201d You rub the back of your head, \u201cAs well as one can adjust to being kidnapped by aliens.\u201d Eliana giggles, \u201cSo how tight was Mira?\u201d You gulp, \u201cW-what?\u201d The vixen smirked, \u201cOh don\u2019t play dumb with me Nick, they told me everything. I find it a bit funny, she always pulls this shit with human males, sometimes even females, she just has this sexual thing for humans. Can\u2019t tell you why, she just has a\u2026 thing for humans.\u201d You stutter, \u201cSo I\u2019m not her first\u2026?\u201d The vixen giggles, \u201cNo, she\u2019s been with many others over her time working here. Just don\u2019t let her intimidate you ok.\u201d You nod, Eliana claps her hands, \u201cGood, now onto what I was REALLY meeting you for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen pulls out a large folder, seemingly filled with dozens of papers, \u201cI would like you to look through this folder and pick out a family that you would like to adopt you. See, we come to your planet to observe it, when one of our first ships crashed there we found some eerie similarities between human technology and our early tech. Now more than ever we see a parallel line between the technology of our worlds, the only difference is your line is a lot less developed then ours. We crashed in what you humans call the Bermuda Triangle, we had to sink one of the islands in the area we landed in, in hopes that the locals didn\u2019t spread the word to other humans that we existed. Of course back then we didn\u2019t know that humanity didn\u2019t pose much of a threat to us and assumed your kind was just as advanced as ours. We\u2019ve been trying to break the galactic code for a while now, the one that keeps us from being know to your species and forcing us to kidnap anyone who finds out about us, but many other alien kinds still believe that the human race is too underdeveloped and barbaric for such technologies and advancements that we have, at least on a planetary level. We\u2019ve found however that humans in our society get along fairly well with us anthros, even better than they did with their fellow humans. We\u2019re trying to use this as our main case in introducing humanity to the rest of the universe but some of the high councils won\u2019t budge to this reasoning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just blink, having your mind blown once again from this new information given to you, Eliana chuckled, \u201cSorry about that little tangent, anyways I hope you do know most humans on our planet are married, do have a stable job and are peaceful members of the community with little to no police arrests what so ever. Now, onto the folder, since most new comers to our planet don\u2019t have much of a resume or way of providing for themselves we let newly arriving humans get adopted; so to speak, by a volunteering anthro family. You will stay with that family for a good two to three years until you can get a well paying job and provide for yourself. You can pick from anyone from this folder along with anyone on this ship who knows their family wouldn\u2019t mind an alien in the house. I\u2019d like you to look this over for the next few days and give me a decision no later than by the time we dock, go it?\u201d You nod and smile at her, \u201cGot it.\u201d Eliana dismisses you as you leave her headquarters. You turn to the gecko girl, \u201cSo, what am I supposed to do now?\u201d The gecko girl shrugs, \u201cWhatever you want, you don\u2019t really have any place to be, we just need to be with you at all times.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You peered at the target and saw you hit it dead center.  You smiled before moving onto the next target.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter firing on several targets, you decided to take a break.  You peered at the other targets you'd hit and found every one of them was right in the center.

Kangina then turned to the gecko girl that had been watching you.  \"I'll take care of him from here.\" she said and the gecko girl left.

Like you have expected the elevator goes down but you can only notice that by a signal thats shows the actual floor where the elevator is. The elevator itself dosnt make any vibrations or sounds at all. You can see a bunch of different floors on a nearby map. \"1. Commanding Floor... 2. Living Floor... 3. Mechanic Floor... 4. Cargo\" you mumble to yourself as you study the map. The Gecko girls notice that and says: \"The living floor is my favorite, this is where we go after a hard day of work.

The heat on this floor is way higher then on the Commanding Floor. You also hear a constantly roaring sound from somewhere, it deffinitly have to be a machine or even the engine of the ship. You and the guards are stepping out of the elevator, the Shepherd is typing something on his bracers then he turns towards you. \"Finally you are here, you must be the human everyone is talking about, im Jeff.\" he lifts his arm to shake your hand and you reply as shaking it. \"Nice to meet you, im Nick.\" you say as the male shepherd nods. \"Well Nick, we dont have any time to waist. I guess you dont even know why you are here.\" asks Jeff and he allready knows the awnser, you just shake your head. \"Ok then, we want to give you the opportunity to proof yourself as usefull. So we want to send you with one of our mechanics to see which kind of skills you have.\" again he starts typing on his bracers. \"You can change your clothes over there, in the changing room.

You past by a few male furrys, as you finally arrive at a female cat, she is sitting infront of the entrance of a air shaft, checking her bracer. \"Are you Sira?\" you ask gently and she looks up to you. She nods and stands up, imeediatly you notice that she must be a head bigger then you, she is slim and looks somehow young. \"The Human... Nick, right?\" she asks and you nod. \"Very well, nice to meet you, i really could use a hand.

Its going up and down, left and right and you have no idea where you are, this is actually some crazy mace you think and you have your trouble to catch up with the agile catgirl. Suddenly the shaft goes slightly upwards, like a slide and ahead of you is a hatch to go through. Sira is moving through it without and problem, you follow her and as you try to get through the hatch by climbing, you slip and slide backwards, your left arm slides underneath you and you are trapped by the hatch in your back. \"Ahhhh! Damn!....\" you curse, trying to escape of your missary. \"Whats wrong?\" asks the tall cat girl as she turns arround, seeying you in your uncomfortable position.

You try to complain but her soft paws on your face just let you muffle. \"What did you just sayd? You love my paws?\" says the catgirl and enjoys the show \"Well i like my paws too.

So dont be shy, just a few minutes of licking isnt that much.\" This is really humilating, you just refuse to lick her dirty, smelly soles, but it seems like there is no other choice.

It isnt that hard at all, isnt it?\" she chuckles and wiggles her toes just to humiliate you even more. After a minute of licking her salty and smelly toes, she goes one step further. \"Dont forget to lick between my toes. A Cat lady like me has to be clean everywhere.\" she demands, first you think you are going to refuse, but you dont have another choice anyway. So you brace yourself and lick the catgirls dirtyest part of her paws. Its disgusting and the sweat isnt making it better. So after a few minutes humiliation she seems to be satisfied. She lowers one paw onto the side and checks the other one. \"Hm... seems to be clean for now.

The cougar smiled.  \"I suppose an explanation is overdue anyway.\" she said \"We come from a planet called Furonita, located many light-years from Earth.  Our kind have a tradition of coming to Earth every 100 years and bring a human back to our home planet to live among us.\".  You sat and let the information sink in.  \"I'm sure you must be a little confused, but I assure you things will be fine.\" Ansolia said.  She then took your hand and led you out of the room with the husky guards following.  \"I feel it'll be necessary to give you a tour of the ship.\" Ansolia said as you walked down a narrow corridor.

Everyone of them was wearing different type of clothes, most of them are easily to recognize as mechanics which keep the ship in a good state. You also notice the guards and a few doctors or scientists. However, after a few minutes of walking down the hallway she reaches a door with the Number #307. \"There we are, your personal quarters.\" says Ansolia as she opens the door on a nearby terminal with her bracers. The door slides open and you two enters the room and by that the door closes immediatly. It looks like the room you have been before, but with way more furnitures then just a camp bed.  There is a small table with chairs for two people, a larger coffee table with couch infront of a blank wall and on that coffee table are one of those bracers that everyone uses to open doors and stuff. Your bed is embedded into the wall. It's actually a pretty big room for one person and you are feeling glad to call this your own for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cougar girl walks towards the coffee table and you follow her. \"This is your personal Identification-Access-Tool, short IdAT\" she picks it up and hands it over to you. It feels incredibly light for some metal bracers and you turn them on immediatly, first you think they are to big for you, but seconds aftter you have turned them on, the device begins to react and switchs to a comfortable size. There are no buttons at all on thsi thing, it's a blank bracer which looks like some regular piece of metal as suddenly some fine lines are beginning to glow on it. It shows some kind of loading screen but just a fter a few seconds it shows your name on it: *Welcome - Nick Saunders*, first you are kinda surprised. \"How do i use it?\" you ask before you even touched the interface of the device. \"Actually its pretty simple, you can try by yourself, there is nothing that can go wrong.\" says Ansolia as she is watching you handle your new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to press on what you think supposed to be a screen and really, the blank wall in front of you builds up a hologramm which is now a oversized television. You see a colorfull nature you havnt seen before, those hologramms also refelects everything in such brilliant quality that this must be at least 4K and even in 3D, they are not like in those sci-fi movies. You are so stunned by the images that you didnt noticed that the cougar woman has allready sit down on the small table nearby: \"Are you done?\" she asks amused as you finally wake up from your daydream and turn off the hologramm. \"Uhm... yeah... i'm sorry\" you replie and walks toawrds her to sit down on the other side of the small table. She press on a button on her own IdAT and a steaming hot drink comes out of the table which seems to be tea. After checking your interface you try it by yourself and the table serves you a drink as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two start to have a little small talk, do you begin to flirt?</span></div></div>",

Your planets specific history only allowed one race to rule it, our planets history allowed multiple creatures to rise and evolve into their upright, two legged forms.\u201d You nod, \u201cThat\u2019s really interesting.\u201d Ansolia chuckles, \u201cYou\u2019re pretty cute when you\u2019re trying to make small talk.\u201d You chuckle, \u201cMe, cute? No, I don\u2019t think so. I mean it, not even in a joking way.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female cougar looks at you and puts a paw over one of your hands, she smiles at you, \u201cNow why would you think that?\u201d You shrug, \u201cI just wasn\u2019t ever much of a ladies man, I mean I had a girlfriend in high school but it only lasted a year. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m a complete strike out when it comes to women, I\u2019m just not an expert at it either, he-he.\u201d Ansolia smiles, \u201cWell then, maybe I could be your girlfriend.\u201d You say quickly, \u201cBut we\u2019re not even the same species.\u201d The cougar tilts her head, \u201cSo what? You look really cute and nice, and I\u2019ve always wanted a sweat little man to bring home with me and DOMINATE.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sends a shiver or two up your spine, \u201cIsn\u2019t it the man\u2019s job to be the aggressive one?\u201d Ansolia bursts out laughing, giving you a good view of her sharp carnivorous teeth, \u201cOh please, I\u2019m trained in twelve different fighting styles, all with an assortment of lethal moves and attacks and I can lift a five hundred pound oxen with my bare hands, if anyone needs protecting in this metaphorical relationship it\u2019s you.\u201d You shake your head, \u201cBut why me? What makes me so special, in the eyes of any other anthro girl I\u2019m probably just some underdeveloped ape from another planet.\u201d Ansolia grins, \u201cNot true. Most humans who end up on our planet end up marrying outside of their species. It\u2019s all about being attracted to something exotic. Humans are usually against marrying or mating an anthro because their used to having only one type of species on the sexual market so to speak. On our planet it\u2019s much more open so say a dog marrying and screwing the shit out of\u2026 let\u2019s say a horse is no biggie for us. It\u2019s commonplace. Soon however you humans warm up to the idea. Even the less attractive humans can easily have a harem of anthros of their preferred sex bowing to their feet. Why? Because exoticness is very, VERY attractive. Totally across the board. We\u2019ve even done research to prove that it does attract mates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit back in your chair, \u201cUm\u2026 wow. So I could in theory, be a ladies man on your planet, in theory.\u201d Ansolia chuckles, \u201cIn theory, more like in real life. Which is why I wanted to possibly, hang out with you before anyone else does\u2026 I thought maybe, who knows, maybe you\u2019d be into\u2026 BIG CATS, and maybe you\u2019d want a big tough pretty kitty like me as your mate. I mean we don\u2019t have to do stuff like that now, we could always just chill as you humans say it, and be friends for now. We could play games, or eat dinner together or bone or\u2026 oh I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t mean to say that.\u201d You could tell the cougar was blushing underneath her thick, warm and inviting fur coat, you wave your hand, \u201cIt\u2019s fine Ansolia, but I would like to take it a bit slow if that\u2019s ok with you, lets just be friends.\u201d Ansolia practically jumps onto the table, \u201cWith benefits?\u201d You chuckles, \u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019ve kind of just met you.\u201d Ansolia sits back down in her seat, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right cute stuff,\u201d she then winks at you.</span></div></div>",

You pull out of her love tunnel and remove your face from her crotch, making her let out a disappointed groan. \"Awww, why'd you stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you stopped before I could release earlier.\" You retort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, I suppose we've both had enough foreplay, time for the main event.\" She slides back down so she's straddling your dick. \"But first...\" she reaches behind herself and unhooks her bra, letting it fall onto you as her breasts bounce free. You drop your jaw in stunned silence at how... perfect they looked. She took advantage of your confusion to grab your hands and bring them up to her breasts. Your hands cup them and squeeze out of instinct, making her moan again. \"Ready?\" You nod in response. She impales herself on your dick, letting out a shriek as she did so. She rides you like there is no tomorrow, and all you can do is lay back and grope the two perfect breasts she let you play with. The two of you were still pent up from your earlier denials, so it didn't take too long for you both to feel ready to pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ansolia...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... me too.\" She says between gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside... Don't worry.. I'm safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cumming.\" You both release in pleasure as your fluids mixed inside of her. She pulls herself off your softening rod, resulting in your a *pop, followed by your mixed fluids spilling out on top of you. She flops down next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That.. was.. amazing.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.. same here.\" You reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was Rome?\" She jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll like it here.\" She wraps her arms around you and gives you a quick lick on the cheek before both of you fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You awaken to the Furonitian sun shining in your eyes (even on the other side of the universe, the sun still finds a way to be a dick to sleeping people.) As you shift in bed, you find that you're alone. Ansolia must have already gotten up and moving. You get up to get dressed and find her, but you get reminded of last night's events as you see the shreds of your only set of Earth clothes on the floor. With no other option, you leave the room in nothing but your underwear, that's when you smelled something delicious coming from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to investigate and see Ansolia wearing an apron and standing over a stove, cooking. She had her back turned to you, meaning she probably hasn't notice you yet. It also meant you got a good look at her back. You didn't see any bra strap, meaning that the apron <i>is</i> her top for now. What drew your eyes however, is that you can see that she traded her black panties from last night for a bright red thong that showed her soft looking ass cheeks. This gave you a devilish idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreeping up behind her as quietly as you could, you get up to where you're almost breathing down her neck. You raise your right hand and give her ass cheek a firm *smack, causing her to yelp in surprise. You walk up beside her, using your hand to massage the part you smacked, to both your delights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning sleepyhead.\" You give each other a quick peck. \"Sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a rock. Only problem was I woke up without my 'Pretty Kitty' to cuddle with.\" This causes her to blush as she remembers her dirty talk back on the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess we'll just have to make up for that. I'm making breakfast for us. Take a seat,  it's almost done.\" You sit down at the table and look back at her. She goes back to cooking, letting you look at her ass some more. You notice that her tail is now swishing back and forth as her ass swayed with it. Maybe this planet wouldn't be so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finished.\" She turns back to you with a plate of pancakes, bacon, eggs, and sausage. \"I only got one plate though, so we'll have to <i>share</i>.\" Putting a seductive roll on that last word. She walks over to you with a sway of her hips, setting down the plate and utensils in front of you and taking a seat on your lap, making sure to grind her near bare ass into your crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the protein?\" You ask before you dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are from animals similar in taste to your barnyard animals, but are not the same for.. obvious reasons.\" You guess that made sense. She cut a piece of the pancake and stabbed it with the fork, lifting it up to you. \"Open wiiide.\" You do so and she slides the food into your mouth. It tasted great, she could really cook. You could get used to this life. You get a piece of the eggs while she takes one of the sausages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure you were watching, she gives it a long lick all the way to the tip, leading to her starting to suck it, making audible slurping sounds as she gives her food a blowjob, never breaking eye contact with you the whole time. She finally takes the whole piece into her mouth. She takes back the fork and continues feeding both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, all that was left was a single strip of bacon. She takes the piece and puts half into her mouth and turns to you with lidded eyes. You can take the hint as you lean in and take the other half, letting your lips meet in the mid like one of those cheesy romance movies back home. She takes a bite of her half and your each take your respective pieces into your mouths, leaving your lips free to lock together for one last makeout of the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull apart, gasping for breath, she speaks first. \"So... how'd I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I make up for not cuddling in bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, we have something we need to discuss.\" You look at her, confused. \"As you know, I'm assigned to that ship we brought you here on. But that means that you'll be here all alone while I'm deployed. I'm sure you don't want to live in my house all pent up without me here to satisfy you, so I have two options for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I can petition the captain to get you a position on the ship with me. I'm sure we can find something you can do to pull your weight. Then we'll be together all the time.\" While that sounded promising, you had to admit you preferred having solid planet underneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Option two is I call up some friends of mine that are quite... fond of humans. They can keep you company while I'm away, and when I'm home, I wouldn't mind sharing. You'd have your own harem right here in this house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's your call?\"</span></div></div>",

After a night like that I'd be crazy to not want seconds. I'll call the girls, can you wash the dishes for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" You kiss one last time before she gets up and you give her one last smack on the ass, making her yelp again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'll get you for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promises, promises.\" She leaves the room and you take the dishes over to what you guess is the sink. You set the dishes in, but you can't seem to find the handle for the water. You couldn't even see a sensor like those fancy bathroom sinks on Earth. Then your eyes landed on a lone button on the edge of the sink. You press it to see what happens, then watch as a green slime flows out of the tap. It covers the plate before quickly fizzling out of existence, leaving a spotless plate behind. \"Huh, neat.\" Is all you can say as Ansolia reenters the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I called the girls, they would love to meet you and are on their way here. They should be here in about 10 minutes.

You finally get interrupted by a chime ringing throughout the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's them.

You feel a warm, wet object dragging itself up your face. You open your eyes to see what looked to be a poodle girl laying on you, tongue out and panting like a dog back home. Her skintight suit gave away her DD breasts and slender body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo, you must be the human Ansolia told us about. She was right, you are a cutie.\" She gives your face a few more licks before whispering in your ear. \"<i>Now let's see if your performance in bed lives up to her description.</i>\" You start to blush at her words. \"Come on in girls, come meet our new playmate.\" She gets off you and walks into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to get up, only to be pushed back down by a massive white foot. You look up to see it belonged to a bunny girl. Her fur was snow white and looked soft as cotton. She was wearing one of those leotards that were associated with her kind back on Earth. While her chest was not as endowed as her friend, only amounting to about a C cup, she made up for it with hips that looked wide enough to almost swallow your head between them. \"Mmmmm, you are a tasty looking treat. I hope you know how to treat a lady. In case you don't,  you should know that a lady likes to be...\" she lifts her foot over your face, \"pampered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can join her friend, she halts and looks back out the door before reaching outside. \"Come in here, don't be shy.\" She comes back in, pulling a squirrel girl in with her. She shared the bunny girl's C cup breasts, but rather than having wide hips, her ass looked like two volleyballs that bounced as she entered the door. Her tail was bushy enough to almost hide a small person in it. She noticed you staring at her and covered her face with her tail with the exception of her eyes. \"H-h-hi there.\" She squeaks out. \"Nice t-t-to m-meet you. Please be gentle with me.\" The bunny girl pulls her in to join the poodle in the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou once again try to stand up, only this time you are stopped by your body locking up at the next sight you see. A panda girl stands in the doorway. She was a titan of a woman. Standing at at least 10 feet tall, she dwarfed you easily. She had some weight to her, but not enough to be a put off. Remembering the 5 levels of fatness back home, you would class her as level 4, fluffy.  Her breasts were enormous. Comparing them to your head would be like comparing an apple to watermelons. \"Awww, you're so cute.\" She scoops you up in her massive arms and gives you a hug. \"Come on, let's go sit with the others.\" She carried you into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five of you got situated on Ansolia's couch. You were sitting in the panda's lap while the poodle layed across yours. The bunny girl clung to your left arm and the squirrel sat to you right, still covering her face with her tail. It was only then that Ansolia came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you girls again. Now then, this is Nick. He's the human I told you about.\" The four of them giggled at this. \"I called you four to keep him company while I'm away, and to serve as his little harem.\" Another round of giggles. \"I suppose introductions are in order.\" The poodle started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Sherri. Could you scratch behind my ears please?\" You do so as her eyes shut and smile widens in pleasure. Your head gets pulled to the side as the bunny girl gives you a kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im Monette. It's a pleasure. That one there is Aurora.\" She says, pointing to the squirrel girl. \"She's a bit shy at first around new people, but she'll open up soon.\" Before you can try and get her to talk, you feel yourself get slightly lifted off the ground as the panda girl brings you to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Pandora. I hope you don't mind but, I'm a bit of a cuddler.\" She tightens her grip around you as Ansolia speaks up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, because of certain... events, I have to go and buy Nick his own suit. You five stay here and get to know each other while I'm out. Have fuuun.\" She blows you a kiss and walks outside. Sherri sits up and looks you in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Nick, you got four beautiful girls at your beck and call, what do you wanna do first?\"</span></div></div>",

Sherri got off your lap and Pandora picked you back up and began carrying you to the bedroom. Sherri took the time to already start removing her suit on the way there. Monette got ahead of Pandora, walking with extra sway in her hips once she got your attention. Aurora lagged behind, still feeling nervous about this arrangement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the five of you got to the bedroom, Pandora set you down before walking over to the bed to undress. Removing her suit revealed that she had decided to come here with nothing underneath. She sat down on the bed, causing it to creek under her weight. She reached out her arms for you, wanting you to let her hold you again. You walk forward and let her grab you and lean back onto the bed. This felt incredible, with her massive size compared to you and how soft her fur was, she was almost a bed in and of herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Monette and Sherri strutted up to you. Sherri had finished taking off her suit, showing that she had come without a bra, but was still wearing a pair of light blue polka-dot panties. Monette had still not removed her leotard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who's first?\" Sherri asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind going last, as long as I have this cutie laying on top of me.\" Pandora says from under you.

My task is to analyze the behaviors of humans and if they seem to cooperate i give them a kickstart into theyr new life with our species.\" she says very calm and awaits your next question. \"So... how is my kickstart going to be look like?\" you ask further. The Cougar woman smiles and says: \"Its good that you ask. First of all you got this quarter as your personal space further more i have to tell you that you will stay on this ship for a while. We have to make sure that you are really able to life with us in friendly coexistence before you take one step on our planet...\" you nod as she continue \"...also, i was able to organize a flight into space with one of our pilots so you will see how working in space will be.\" Hearing that is making you grin, you are allready imagine to fly a spaceship by yourself like in many video games or like in all those movies. \"Really?! Im very glad to get the chance to fly side by side in space.\" you say amazed by the news. The Cougar girl giggles \"oh... *giggle* im sorry, you are just going to be something like a Co-Pilot first.\" You blush a little bit, it was obvious that they wont give you a ship right away. \"Oh... well, i guess thats also cool. Im still excited! \" you say a little bit ashamed. Ansolia stands up and moves towards the door. \"Well, lets go.\" she says and you do as she demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two walk down the hall towards the elevator. Here and there you see some other Anthros again, most of them seems very friendly, just a few are to busy to take a look. As you and Ansolia are entering the elevator, the cougar girl is pressing something on her IdAT to get the elevator moving, you notice that your IdAT is also reacting, it looks like that it shows your actual position on a map. After a few seconds the doors of the elevator are opening and you are following again the movement of the cougar girl. You find yourself in a gigantic spaceship hangar. There must be at least 30 ships, most of them the size of a fighting jet some of them are even 4 times bigger. Alot of stuff is going on, Mechanicans reapring are working on some of those ships, another ship is actually flying out and another one is emptying its cargo. You are just amazed and cant belive your eyes, especially as you turn your head towards the shield which is seperating this with air filled room from the empty space. Its hard to follow Ansolia and watching all this kinda stuff. But finally she comes to a stop infront of two Anthro girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls salute and Ansolia is doing so as well, you on your side totally forget to salute as well but nobody seems to bother.<br>\r\nAnsolia begins to speak: \"Pilots, im glad that you have been able to spare some of your freetime for us. This is the Human - Nick Saunders - he is allready excited for the flight into space today.\" as she pauses, you begin to make a few steps forward and reach out your hand. \"Nice to meet you.\" you say as your hands are shaking the strong hand of a Shepherd girl. \"I'm glad to meet you Nick, im Shila.\" response the very tall shepherd woman, she is wearing a very tight suite which seems to be the official pilot suite, everything is in a very dark grey and just a small silver embleme on her chest is shining on it. <br>\r\nYout turn towards the next Pilot which immediatly introduce herself. \"I'm Sarora, welcome.\" when you thought that Shila the Shepherd would be big, you would be wrong. Sarora is a Dragoness which is actually twice as big as Ansolia. Sarora is wearing the same suite as Shila but with the little difference that she has a golden embleme and no boots on. Sarora has also a shiny silver skin and two black horns on the back of her head. <br>\r\nAfter the introducing, Ansolia begins to continure \"Pilots, i would be glad if you could tell Nick Saunders more about your dutys in this fleet.\"<br>\r\nBoth of them nods as Shila steps forwards and begins to speak.<br>\r\n\"I'm a level 2 Pilot. My qualifications are specialized to fly mining and salvaging ships. By that im also trained into scanning of asteroids for capable resources.\" says the Shepherd woman and steps back again.Righter after that, Sarora is taking a small step forward:<br>\r\n\"I'm a level 3 Pilot. My qualifications are specialized into fighters. As a Dragoness, im constantly in training for the higher fighting ships until i reach my full size.\" explains the enourmes dragoness and steps back again. You are amazed that this girl can even grow bigger as she allready is.<br>\r\nAnsolia nods \"Good, so i guess we dont have any time to waste. Did you two agreed with each other which one of you will take Nick Saunders to his first flight?\"<br>\r\nThe two girls are looking at each other, one of them nods and begins to speak, its...</span></div></div>",

And give me a report of how Nick Saunders has done in this flight. It's very important to know how we supoosed to treat him Sarora.\" Sarora gots a small smile pon her face and nods. \"Dont worry, i will give you a full report of the flight right after.\" she says as everyone salutes and goes theyr way. You follow Sarora right away, it's kinda hard to catch up with her, her steps are so big, that your small steps has turned into a faster walking. You notice that her foot is as big as your upper body, which kinda afraids you. You gather some brave to speak to her \"So... you sayd you will be trained into higher fighter classes as you grow in size.\" The dragoness lady is taking a look at you, knowing what you want to know: \"Thats true, aslong as i grow i will go through the tiers of fighters, which at the end is more like a suite, especially made just for me.\" she says as you two are getting closer what seems to be her fighter.\" The imagination of her being a battleship amazes you. \"So you are going to be a ship by yourself?! How much does a Dragoness like you will grow?!\" you ask her and with a smile she says \"Well they will build a suite which works like a fighter and i will be about 50 or even 60 meters big.\" You cant belive what you hear and just gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you reach the ship, which isnt that big in size compared to how big she will be one day. \"So here we are, my second ship and im nearly to big for it allready. Lets hop in.\" she giggles as she moves the ladder up into the cockpit. You follow her right away which gives you a weird perspective of the sole of her gigantic feet but also of her swinging rear. You reach the top of the ladder and notice, that this fighter has only space for one person. Sarora has made herself allready comfortable in her seat, but comfortable seems to be the wrong word because you notice how small she have to make herself to get into her own cockpit. The cockpit itself seems very clea, there are no buttons and monitors, there are just a pare of gloves which Sarora is taking on. \"Where do i supposed to sit?\" you ask confused. The dragoness smiles \"I guess there is only enough space for you in my footwell.\". You look down onto her feet, her toes are wiggling and it seems like that she had planned this out like this. You sigh but you dont think that Sarora will torture you or something so you get into the cockpit, pressing yourself into the extremly tight footwell. \"Are you ready for take off?\" she ask as she picks on some glasses to navigate. You nod and right away the ship starts to rumble. Sarora concentrate to navigate the ship out of the hangar and seconds later you can see above you the stars and the empty space, you also notice for a second a nearby planet but it dosnt seems to be the earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of navigating the ship, Sarora asks you \"Everything allright down there?\" as she playfully wiggles her toes which tickles you a little bit. \"Yes, everything is allright.\" The Dragoness nods \"Good, i will turn into Autopilot for a while...\" she says and turns off the gloves \"...and you as my copilot can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u>Choice 1 GOOD Sarora</u><br>\r\n-\"...ask me everything you want.\" *flirt*-<br>\r\n<b>OR</b><br>\r\n-\"...choose the destination.\"-<br>\r\n<u><br>\r\nChoice 2 BAD Sarora</u><br>\r\n-\"...massage my feet until we are done here.\"-<br>\r\n<b>OR</b><br>\r\n-\"...pleasure me with your tongue!\"- <br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

They actually put a collar on you like you would be a dog?! You could enrage but you are smart enough to stay calm and see what happens next. Suddenly, the lizard guard speaks to you. \"Get on the ground!\" she demands and you look confused at her. \"Wha-\" you wanted to ask her why he should get on the ground now as the behave necklace suddenly reacts and gives you a painfull electro shock. You fall down on the ground immediatly and groan in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mr. Saunders, as you can see you better follow the orders of my Guards. Otherwise it can be a very painfull life for you.\" says the male wolf as he turns arround to leave and the guards following him. \"Oh, besides... All Crewmembers are permitted to give you orders. You are allowed to explore the ship now, have fun.\" he says with a big evil grin on his face as you are still on your knees and regain your strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain and his guards leaves the room and you are alone now.

She has a excited look at you and seems friendly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight next to her stands a Panther lady which dosnt seems so amused.

I'm glad that you have freely choose to be the volunteer for Dracha's experiments. I'm Captain Jazal.\" You nod towards the wolf and awnser with \"My pleasure\". Then the lizard takes a step forward \"My name is Silana, im the mechanic on this ship, nice to meet you.\" she says as she bows. Right after her, the Panther lady is introducing herself \"I'm Cass, Officer of Arms.\" she says simply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are really impressed by this new experience as a question is rushing through your mind. \"You sayd 'Welcome on board' ?\" you ask towards Captain Jazal. He nods \"Yes, we have been able to repair most of the damage from the impact and our generators are producing enough energy again to power our nanite-camouflage-shield... Which means our stranded ship is invisible for now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracha cough for a moment. \"...Ok, now that everyone has introduced to each other, i would be glad to go on with my experiments right away.\" says the avian women.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a short walk through the ship, you arrived at a new section. You looked up and saw that the big hallway you were walking through had multiple levels, all containing a number of doors. Several spiral staircases could get you upstairs. The architecture reminded you of a prison, but here there weren't no guards or people banging on prison doors. It looked more relaxed and calm, with all the white and gray walls surrounding you. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"These are the sleeping quarters\", Anita continued, as she guided you by the arm. \"Do you want to see one from the inside?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess that's fine\", you answered, not sure if this was a good idea or not, knowing that she'd probably only have access to her own room. She walked to one of the staircases and gestures you to follow her. You did, and as you walked up, the echo of your footsteps filled the air. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why is nobody around here?\" you wonder, while the sound bounced back into your ears. \"There must be hundreds of people on this ship, guessing by the number of doors\". <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I suppose everyone is working very hard to maintain and control the ship. You need quite a crew to make sure things go not boom in here\", she responded with a smile. \"But I agree, normally you'd see some other anthro's around.\" <br>\r\nOnce you set foot on the 3rd floor, you saw a female fox walking towards you too. Coincidentally, Anita had to go the opposite way to get to her room, so you two would meet her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"See? We're not entirely alone.\", Anita said. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Anita! I see you're showing the new human around.\", spoke the fox, as she became in hearing range. Her body was covered with brown fur, some small white spots breaking the pattern, wearing only jeans and a shirt. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Rose, yea I figured he would want to see a sleeping quarter, so I'm bringing him to mine.\", answered Anita, by that confirming your thoughts. Rose showed a mischievous look at Anita and shaked hands with you. \"Nice to meet you, I'm Rose, good friend of the wolf over there\", she said, quickly putting her more serious face on again. \"I'm late for a meeting so no time to talk right now, but I'm sure we'll meet again.\" and walked on. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come\", said Anita, \"my quarters are right here, do you want to come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look of Rose and the enthusiasm of Anita bothered you a bit. Was this a good idea? Who knows what she is up to in there. Your thought for a moment before answering:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a small couch, a dining area with a table and chairs, a small bathroom with a large tub, and a bedroom with a large bed.  You gazed at everything in the room.  \"I guess you like it, huh?\" Anita asked, grinning.  You nodded as you stood next to Anita for several seconds.  Then Anita led you into, </span></div></div>",

He turned around in his seat and smiled when he saw you.  \"I see you've finally awoken.\" the fox said as he stood up and approached you.  \"I am John.  I'm the captain of this vessel.\".

The propellor was attached to a giant blue spaceship with graffiti painted over it in such a matter that would remind you of that movie, Akira. That thing in the sky must've been home to aliens.

You'd think that such a brightly colored rocket ship that big would attract a lot more attention. You you up and then the spaceship starts to turn around and face your direction as you gulp and nervously step back. You then let out a sigh. \"Geez Ryan,\" you say to yourself. \"What are you worried about? Those aliens obviously haven't...\" Before you could finish your sentence, a blue light shines on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh,\" you say. \"Looks like I spoke too soon.\" You begin to run as the spaceship follows after you.

For minutes you see nothing but light and then... you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you let out a grunt and look down and gasp as you see you have been dressed in a strange Sentai style uniform that was yellow with a symbol on it resembling a giant paw with the rings of saturn over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see you're atop a strange table and get up and spot something that catches your attention immediately. It was a literal frog man, dark green in color with a purple version of the uniform on you. He had to be half your height and was looking at you with a grin. \"An alien!\" you yell. \"Relax kid,\" says the frog man in a slight Boston accent. \"We ain't here to conquer your planet.

And congratulations, you've been drafted.\" You look at your uniform and see a holster with some kind of weapon. \"Are you the captain?\" you ask the frog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog man just lets out a laugh. \"No, just the talent scout and believe me, you won't feel out of place.

It appeared that there was a sound over the speakers. \"Croaker,\" said a female voice over the speaker. \"Bring the new recruit in to meet with the rest of the crew.\" You gave a look of surprise before turning to the frog man. \"New recruit?\" you asked. \"New recruit?! What is that all about.\" Croaker, who you assume is the frog man gave a smile. \"You'll see, kid. You're aboard the Javelin. See, we've been going around recruiting beings from different planets to combat the Sevarian.\"\" \"What's a Sevarian?\" you asked Croaker. Croaker let out a ribbit before answering you. \"They're the nastiest aliens you'll ever meet. No conscience, no regard for life, no restraint. The universe would be better off if they never existed because all they do is pillage, destroy and conduct cruel experiments, in that order. They're not a kind of anything if you know what you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were suddenly very afraid as you follow Croaker. \"So, Croaker is it, how many people are there in the crew.\" Croaker lets out a ribbit again. \"Including you and me, fifteen. Below General Nala, there are three divisions of this crew. First is the Nerve unit that consists of the crew's best fighters. Then there's the Brain unit, with yours truly. We specially in the jobs requiring intelligence such as finding young talent. Last is the Heart Unit. People in that unit have jobs requiring special powers. There are 5 of us in the Nerve Unit so far, 4 in the Heart Unit and 4 in the Brain Unit. Though I highly doubt you'll be assigned to the brain unit. Right this way kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what to expect. \"Uh Croaker,\" you said. \"Are there any other frogs in the crew.\" \"Nope. I'm the only one. I was put in the Brain Unit because I'm not a battler.\" You and Croaker walked into the main room to find the conference of the ship and the entire rest of the crew was there. There were fours seats in the main room, three of which were labeled with the images of a heart, a brain and a nerve. In the Nerve seat was a white furred wolf man built like a WWE wrestler with a Hulk Hogan-esque mustache and a red uniform with a grim expression on his face. He was surrounded by an alligator snapping turtle man dressed like a ninja complete with a naginata blade, a brownish skinned hippopotamus woman with white hair in a purple unitard with a red jacket, a teenage shark man resembling a hammerhead sharp with spiked shoes and a baboon man in a karate outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turn to the Brain seat as Croaker ran up to his leader. From the looks of it the leader of the Brain division was what appeared to be a bat man in blue Tron-Style cyberpunk armor and goggles. He appeared to be polishing a sniper rifle. Besides Croaker, his team consisted of a crocodile man in steampunk armor that obscured his entire body and a chubby bespectacled pink and purple furred cow woman dressed like a doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Heart Seat was occupied by a cobra woman who had strange symbols marked on her body and appeared to be wearing sunglasses. She wore a green uniform. Her unit consisted of a rockhopper penguin whose uniform seemed to include a cloak, an eagle man whose uniform resembled an unbuckled straight-jacket and a wild boar woman who appeared to be wearing a Mad Max inspired outfit with spike decorations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of the crew was a lioness in a golden yellow colored uniform who also appeared to be wearing an eyepatch. As she took a closer look at you the three commanders were forming their own opinions. \"Is this a joke?\" asked the wolf man before glaring at the bat man. \"Vladios, your frog really screwed up this time. I don't even know what the hell kind of creature that is. It doesn't look like it would last five seconds against a Sevarian.\" \"How blind you are Clancifer,\" said the bat man, Vladios. \"After all, it was Croaker who found several of your warriors.\" The hippo woman and shark boy behind Clancifer smiled at that before Clancifer growled. The cobra woman inched up to you and let out a hiss. \"There's an unusual aura emanating from this one. Perhaps we've found the turning point in the war.\" \"You're reading between the lines Braco,\" said Clancifer. \"General Nala, you can't seriously be considering allowing this... whatever it is in the crew. It's from Earth. Everyone knows that planet could self-destruct any day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala, the lioness leader looked down at you and you gave a nervous look, but she nodded her head and let out a growl. \"In this universe, anyone who isn't a Sevarian is an ally. As of this moment he's one of us and begins basic training immediately.\" You had no idea what you were getting into. Which unit were you going to be assigned to?</span></div></div>",

Vladios, the bat leader of the Brain Unit certainly didn't expect you to be assigned to him. However, the wolf man, Clancifer let out a mocking laugh at Vladios. \"Hear that, Vladios? He's your problem.\" Vladios simply ignored the wolf and gestured for you and Croaker to follow him. You do so and see a glint in Vladios's goggles. You turned to Croaker to ask him more questions. \"Exactly what have I gotten myself into? The Brain Unit? How the hell do I qualify. I'm hardly the smartest human on Earth.\" Croaker let out a ribbit. \"This is war, Ryan,\" he said. \"Beggars can't be choosers.\" \"But <i>you</i> choose me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVladios looked back and scanned you with a strange device built into his goggles. It made a strange noise before Vladios checked the readings. \"It says here your species is known as a human, homo sapien.\" Vladios clicked on something on his goggles and it appeared to show him lines of information about the human race. From the look on his face, Vladios didn't like what he saw. \"At this rate, the Earth doesn't need the Sevarians to destroy it. Croaker, are you sure we need someone like this in the army?\" Croaker gave a smirk. \"At least this shows they know how to destroy people, Bossman.\" Vladios let out a sigh. \"Come, we don't have time to argue. Tock, Arizona, come, the human will just have to come along on our mission.\" The crocodile man and the cow woman nodded their heads and followed Vladios as you and Croaker followed behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point the cow woman turned her head to look back at you. \"I know of a similar species where I come from. We have an animal that looks just like his kind, but smaller. Their flesh is quite delicious.\" Now that frightened you. \"Don't let Arizona scare you,\" said Croaker. \"Her kind are the apex predators on her planet. We recruited her after we learned she wiped out a synthetic virus created by the Sevarians. In this world, flying without a doctor is like running forward into enemy cannon fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take Croaker's word for it before the five of you reach an area of the ship where there appear to be smaller spacecrafts. You followed Vladios into a steampunk style craft similar in appearance to a fish's skull. You look at Tock the crocodile man and assume that he was the one who built this craft given both it and his armor had steampunk undertones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What better way to test our new recruit than a trial by fire?\" asked Vladios. \"We've received a distress call from Mercury. Dress light but not too light. It's the closet planet to the sun.\" With that Vladios's crew took off with you along for the ride.</span></div></div>",

That lioness woman just assigned you to the Nerve Unit run by Clancifer, that angry wolf man. Needless to say, Clancifer wasn't happy about it and protested. \"You can't be serious, General! That scrawny... thing, in my unit? He wouldn't last a tenth of a second against a Sevarian!\" \"Well,\" said Nala. \"Then it is your job to prepare him for work in the field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf man grumbled to himself as he gestured for you to follow him and his team. Croaker looked somewhat in concern for you as you nervously followed. \"Listen here, human,\" said the wolf-man. \"Ryan.\" You protested. \"Whatever,\" said Clancifer. \"Just to let you know, Sevarians are the most murderous species this side of the Milky Way. If they aren't killed on sight, you will be. There's a reason this branch of the army is called the Nerve Unit. There is no room for cowards around here. Are you a coward?! Ryan!?\" You step back as one of Clancifer's soldiers, the blackbelt baboon, spoke out. \"Leave him alone, Clancifer. Threatening one to be brave does not make him any less fearful.\" The snapping turtle ninja simply sharpened his sword before the hippo woman walked up to you to get a good look. \"I'll agree with you that he's exactly what we expect in a soldier, but Rome wasn't built in a day, Chief,\" she said. \"It wasn't destroyed in a day either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite his crew's protests, Clancifer still wasn't keen on you being in the Nerve Unit, until he got a sinister smile on his face. \"Boys,\" he said. \"And Delilah. I think that if the kid's gonna be in the Nerve Unit, it's up to us to harden him into the crew. After all, the Sevarians won't take any prisoners. Congratulations, Ryan. You're heading for the arena.\" Croaker overheard this and was now very afraid. \"Arena?\" you ask. \"What arena?\" The hammer headed shark boy let out a snicker. \"You'll see.\" You nervously follow the rest of the Nerve crew under the deck before Croaker walks up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan,\" the frog man said. \"You don't have any idea what you're getting into. Clancifer is going to send all members of the Nerve Unit after you. That wolf is practically the drill sergeant from hell.\" \"Go on,\" you say nervously. \"His training regime is absolutely brutal,\" said Croaker. \"Only the strongest warriors last as members of his crew.\" First Croaker points to the snapping turtle ninja. \"Picasso was actually a mercenary hired to assassinate Clancifer by the one Sevarian that survived a fight with the old wolf. Clancifer caught him in the act and the two were beating on each other for days. They were so evenly matched, Clancifer drafted him.\" You could se Picasso glare from the reflection in his dagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Croaker points to the baboon man. \"Wukong is a level eighty blackbelt in Cosmic Karate. He was initially hired by the army to train a new generation of martial artists before he got transferred to us.\" Then Croaker pointed to the hippopotamus woman. \"Delilah over there is the queen of the warrior women of planet Hippolyta. And let me tell you, you don't want to pick a fight with the hippo women of Hippolyta.\" Finally you look at the teenage shark by Clancifer. \"What about the shark boy?\" you ask. \"Sledge?\" asked Croaker. \"He's been with the Nerve Unit since before he was a year old. \"You inducted a <i>baby</i>?!\" you yelled in shock. \"This is war,\" said Croaker. \"The Sevarians won't spare children. At least we can give them a way to defend themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Clancifer leads you and the rest of the Nerve Unit to an arena and tosses you in the center as you yell. \"Welcome to Boot Camp, Earthling,\" says the wolf man. \"You want to stay alive, we'll show you first hand a fraction of what the Sevarians will do to you.\" Croaker simply moved to the side to watch the fight with a somber look on his face. \"I really hope Clancifer knows what he's doing. For your sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is your first opponent?</span></div></div>",

He screamed in pain as you did this and he falls to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" How the hell did you do that?\" He asks, still in major pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm an 8th degree black belt in GOJU-RYU Karate, and what I just did is fairly simple.\" You say with a big smirk on your face. Then suddenly a knife goes flying by your head. You turn around to see Picasso standing their. He looks like he wants to rip your eyes out. Then he jumps out of sight and you are thrown off completely, how could a snapping turtle jump so high and so fast. Then you hear him land behind you, and you take action. You foot sweep him and then strike his chest, which causes him to gasp for air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If these guys are your best warriors then there is something wrong.\" You say mockingly. Then you get hit from behind. Wukong! He is fast just as a Monkey should be you think to yourself. Then he says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your an 8th degree black belt too? Very interesting... Maybe we misjudged you.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know the saying, don't judge a book by its cover.\" You say like a smart ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the Monkey man runs at you and starts to throw moves at you that you had never seen before, yet some how your able to defend against all of his attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Its a good thing I took Karate' you thought to yourself. As you keep fighting you notice that every time Wukong threw a right punch he would throw 3 lefts after. You used this to your advantage. Right after he threw his right punch you came in and hammered his ribs with all you had and it brote him to his knee's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well three down, one to go.' You said to yourself. Then Delilah walks out. She looked very calm. She started to run at you and you had figured out what to do. As she ran at you, you slid under her and jumped on her back and put her in a choke hold. She grabbed your arms and just threw you off of her, she wasn't even trying., at least it seemed that way. You had to come up with something quick.

Her most notable feature was a bright pink and blue colored rear given that she was a mandrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut next came a puma man who was wearing a bandolier and a purple outfit that resembled an army uniform. He had shifty eyes and a cocky grin on his face. To the side of this cat man was a unicorn woman who looked dressed like an amazon in a chain mail bikini with an eyepatch. While the puma was armed with a gun, the unicorn had an impressive looking sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen out came the largest of the aliens, a woman resembling a large woolly mammoth who appeared to have some strange symbols tattooed all over her body.

As you crouch in the bushes, you see that there had to be a crew of at least eight aliens, but the weirdest thing was that they were all different species, but were all wearing the same red and gold colored spacesuits. There was a blue mako shark-man who was helping a large bison man dig the ship out of the mountain. In the back, a hammerhead shark girl was working on the engine as a crocodile girl was handing her tools. A white tigress and wolf man were scouting the area with some strange device when the leaders came up from behind. There was a male eagle anthro following a lioness who was wearing a different version of the crew's spacesuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything appears to be okay Captain Kath,\" says the tigress. \"No hostile lifeforms in the general area.\" \"Be on your toes anyway sailor,\" says the lioness with a slight purr. \"The Nemesis would've hit this planet had we not stopped it.\" Nemesis? What was the lioness talking about. The hammer shark girl snaps her jaws as her crocodile friend rubs her head. \"But we got caught in the remains of that dreaded comet. It's lucky no one was killed.\" The eagle man lets out a slight shriek. \"Captain. I've already sent the remaining nine members of the crew to scout the area.\" \"Excellent Lieutenant,\" says the lioness. \"Can't be too careful. This planet might be inhabited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take out your phone to snap a few pictures. Real live anthro aliens had landed on Earth. But they don't appear to be hostile.</span></div></div>",

You could only imagine what it must be like landing on a strange alien world that is probably uncharted by their kind. You try to move back a little bit to slowly move away but you cause a slight rustle in the bushes. The two anthros look in your direct alert, they pull out two gun shaped devices, most likely a form of projectile weapon. The lioness trembled a bit, \u201cH-how\u2026 or what is there.\u201d You decide to come out, if you scare them anymore they might just shoot you and they seem more afraid of you than you are of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up from the bushes with your hands raised above your head, \u201cOk, ok you got me.\u201d The two anthros gasp, you and the two anthros just stare at each other awkwardly for about a minute.

It\u2019s impossible. Human are there more of your kind?\u201d You chuckle, \u201cUh\u2026 yeah, tons, actually a few billion.\u201d The wolf gasps, \u201cAmazing. Say, I know you probably don\u2019t get asked this everyday but would you mind coming back to our spaceship with us. You have no clue how much of an astronomical discovery this is for us. Your species was the mother species of our kind, anthros, and well\u2026 maybe the captain can explain it all a little better than me but, are you up for it?\u201d You respond, \u201cSure.\u201d The two anthros lead you back towards the spaceship.

How did they survive?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know, they\u2019re resourceful. I mean they were resourceful enough to make us to carry on their legacy in case their entire species, ya know\u2026 died out.\u201d You were really confused by all of this but he felt happy that they called your kind resourceful, considering how un-technologically advanced humans were to these aliens. The eagle approached you, \u201cHuman, may I speak with you?\u201d You smile at him, \u201cOf course.\u201d The eagle stood in front of you, he sized you up a lot being he was built like a body builder and was a good foot or two taller than you. Come to think of it they all were a bit taller than you, you\u2019d probably only be up to the lioness\u2019 and wolfs chests at your height. The eagle grinned, \u201cConsidering your shocked look, I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t get interstellar travelers on your planet everday.\u201d You shake your head no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eagle chuckles, \u201cWell I would like to invite you to come back to our home planet with us. We would love to study your body, like your DNA, blood, organ functions and so forth. You may very well be a direct descendant of our ancestors, like everyone else on this planet. But we\u2019d like to keep things a little hush, hush right now. We know very little about your culture and we would rather not cause a ruckus by having you tell more humans about us or have someone else discover us. I know this is a bit sudden but I need your decision now.\u201d You ponder it over a bit, you\u2019ll probably never get an offer like this for the rest of your lifetime. And you could go down in history as the person that discovered aliens and also befriended them on behalf of all man kind. At the same time if you step in their spaceship with them there is probably no turning back and if they decide to dissect you or something you probably won\u2019t have much of a say in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ponder this over you notice the eagle is gesturing something towards the lioness, you don\u2019t pay much mind to it before you feel something hard and metallic strike your head. You fall to the ground and slowly start to lose consciousness. The last thing you feel before blacking out is a pair of furry paws grabbing you and hoisting you over someone\u2019s shoulder. Sometime later you spring up, you realize you\u2019re on a bed, thankfully not some kind of medical table. The sheets are warm and soft but you look at the room around you and realize it\u2019s not your bedroom but some foreign one with pictures of anthropomorphic creatures on the walls. One of the pictures on the wall being a picture of the lioness from before with two other lions that looked much older than her, you must be in her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump out of the bed and run for the door, trying to open it you see that it\u2019s locked. You slam your fists on the door only to realize it is made of steel. You bang and scream until the door opens. You see in front of you this lioness, she asks with a worried expression, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong human\u2026\u201d Too late, before she can even finish you slam your fist into her stomach, knocking her back a bit. She then growls at you, \u201cAre you fucking kidding me, ok, if you\u2019re looking for a fight you\u2019ll get one.\u201d She rushes up to you, you try to deliver a punch but she catches it in her paw and squeezes your fist effortlessly, you start to scream as it feels like every bone in your hand is turning to dust, \u201cOk, ok I give.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets your hand go as you collapse to the floor, \u201cNow what has gotten into you?\u201d You scream, \u201cWhat do you mean, you guys abducted me.\u201d She cocked and eyebrow and grinned, \u201cTechnically yes, but listen it\u2019s for a good cause, we\u2019re bringing you back to our planet to study you and sample your genome. See to make a long story short, humans went extinct on our planet thousands of years ago. They were more technologically advanced then the humans on your planet. They were soon threatened by a powerful alien virus they had never encountered before because they were fairly reserved to themselves and barely ever dealt with off world species, leading to a vulnerability to alien viruses and sicknesses. Humanity was soon brought to it\u2019s knees but they infused human DNA with DNA from animals on their planet and that created our kind. Humans called us Anthros, made sense since we were pretty much the humanized versions of the animals on their planet. Now this is great for us because we may be able to either work alongside with the humans on your planet or reverse what the humans had done to create us and in effect recreate humanity on our planet using you and your genome. To be honest once we found you, you didn\u2019t really have much of a choice we would\u2019ve taken you on board anyways, either with or without force.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your head, \u201cThis is a lot to take in.\u201d The lioness nods, \u201cI understand, it must be quite the shell shock to be talking with a humanoid animal.\u201d You nod and chuckle, \u201cYou could say that again.\u201d This makes the lioness chuckle, \u201cMy name\u2019s Rein by the way.\u201d She extends a paw to you, \u201cDo humans still shake hands?\u201d You take her paw and shake it, \u201cYeah we do, and the name\u2019s Andrew.\u201d Rein chuckles and licks your cheek, \u201cNice to meet you, you hungry at all?\u201d You answer, \u201cActually yeah I am.\u201d She gets up and gestures for you to follow her, \u201cCome on it\u2019s almost dinner time.\u201d You get up and follow her, \u201cAwesome what are we having?\u201d Rein chuckles, \u201cOh you\u2019ll see.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You two soon enter a large room with a table in the middle and various sinks and counters all up against the walls of the room. Sitting at the centered table were the others anthros you notices before. There was the wolf, the eagle, the hammer head shark girl, the croc girl, the tigress, the bison man and the shark man all sitting at the table. The male wolf scratches the back of his head nervously, \u201cUh sorry about the bump back there, no hard feelings buddy.\u201d He sticks out his paw and you shake it, \u201cHey, I understand, as long as you guys don\u2019t dissect me.\u201d Your little joke made everyone at the table laugh except the eagle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stares at you sternly, he clears his throat getting your attention, \u201cWell human I\u2019d just like to thank you for your um\u2026 cooperation and letting us take you back to our world, it is a great help to our kind.\u201d You shrug, \u201cNo problem but what\u2019s to eat I\u2019m starving.\u201d The tigress looks up at you and grins, \u201cOh it\u2019s my favorite, homemade Yuranian weasel spleen.\u201d You look down at her plate and see some bloody mass of meat on it that looks more like it wriggled it\u2019s gelatinous self out of some cat food can. The tigress bites into it and rips chunks off the hunk of meat as she splatters blood on her muzzle. The tigress turns to you with a grin, \u201cSit down and eat we prepared a meal and a seat at the table just for you.\u201d You chuckle, \u201cWell aren\u2019t I special.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down and look at the \u2018food\u2019 that\u2019s in front of you, you take a sniff of it while all the other anthros are preoccupied with eating. You take a small bite of it, it actually tastes pretty good. These aliens must be onto something, back on earth nothing that disgusting looking would ever taste appealing. You continue to gobble up the food with the rest of your crew until you are completely full, and that doesn\u2019t happen until after you ask for seconds. You thought that was one of the best foods you\u2019ve ever eaten, until two hours later you were in one of the bathroom stalls throwing up your guts, apparently their food didn\u2019t agree with you. You then hear a voice from in the doorway of the bathroom, it was the hammerhead shark girl, \u201cYou know stuff like this is fairly common with off worlders, when they eat something from a foreign planet they tend to get sick on the first try. Don\u2019t worry buddy, you\u2019ll start keeping it down soon enough, until then we\u2019ve decided to feed you through and IV.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ended up telling her that you were fine with the idea. She left you alone in the bathroom to continue your throwing up. You returned to Rein\u2019s room, she wasn\u2019t there at the time so you decided to take out a photo from your wallet of your family. You smile warmly at the picture, this may be the most amazing thing that has ever happened in your life but you still miss your family and your home world. Then a voice from right beside you makes you jump out of your skin, \u201cThose your parents?\u201d You look over to see Rein looming over you, looking at your photo, you put it away, \u201cYeah.\u201d Rein grins, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll see them and your planet again I promise. We\u2019re not letting any freaky scientist keep you as an experiment you can count on that and if they\u2026 do we\u2019ll fight for you, we are some of the most powerful fighters in our military after all.\u201d You smile at her as she puts a reassuring paw on your shoulder. A few minutes later you decide to head to the showers, you were a little uncomfortable because it seemed that the showers were built like a sports locker room shower, as in there were no separate stalls or anything from blocking your nudeness from anyone else who\u2019d possibly decide to walk in and decide to shower. What made things worse, they were gender neutral. You then hear someone open the door, your worst possible fear realized, \u201cOh hey human, mind if I join you?\u201d You don\u2019t even think about turning around, you just continue to wash yourself, \u201cUh no, sure come on in.\u201d You practically grip your teeth upon saying that, you may be a guest on their ship but you don\u2019t want some alien guy or gal looking at your junk.

Just as you get closer though the door of the ship opens. Before you can see what comes out you turn and run away. You don't know whats in there but you don't want to take any chances. You look back for a second to see whats there but in that second you run into a furry wall. You are knocked to the ground by the impact. Looking up you see that you ran into a grizzly bear! You try to scramble away but you feel yourself being lifted up by your shirt. \"Calm down little guy!\" the bear says. Wait, the bear talked. You look over the creature holding you again and see that its humanoid in appearance. From the figure you can tell its a female. She's got a thick figure with large breasts and short brown hair. She appears to be wearing some kind of jumpsuit, and by the looks of it, she's much larger than you. She's probably about eight feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of someone approaching makes you look back in the direction of the ship. To your surprise its another bear woman. This one is a polar bear. She's got a similarly thick body to the grizzly bear woman and has even bigger breasts. She's also larger, at maybe ten feet, with long blond hair. \"What have you got there?\" the polar bear asks. She walks closer and then smiles. \"A human, and a cutie at that!\" she says while bending down to get a better look at you. \"Yeah, I guess he freaked out when he saw the ship. I caught him before he could get away.\" the grizzly bear says. The polar bear holds your face in her large paw and then looks at the other woman. \"What should we do, let him go?\" she asks. \"No way! We came here to explore, and I think this little guy is a perfect souvinir!\" You don't really know whats going on, but that statement makes you panic. You begin to struggle violently in her grip. \"Now you scared him!\" the polar bear says. \"Hey, settle down.\" the grizzly bear tells you. You continue to flail about until you feel feel a blow to your neck and are rendered unconscious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come to you are lying in a bed. You rub your head and before you can get up the door opens. The polar bear woman walks in and sees that you're awake. You instinctively tense up but she puts her hands up. \"Look I'm not here to hurt you, okay? I'm sorry my friend had to knock you out and she's sorry.\" she says, and then turns to the open door. \"Isn't that right Ruth?\" Through the door comes the grizzly woman, who rubs the back of her head. \"Yeah I'm sorry. You were kinda freaking out on me and I acted without thinking.\" she says. The polar bear turns back to you. \"There, you see? Now my name is Ophelia, and she's Ruth. Now whats your name?\" she says. You just stare for a moment and then answer. \"Um, my name is Blake.\" you tell them. Just then another bear walks in, this one a black bear. She's a little smaller than Ruth, at about seven and a half feet, with slightly smaller breasts. \"So is he up yet?\" she asks. Then she looks at you and rushes over. You flinch away from her but she grabs you and starts feeling you all over. \"Ooh, he's small isn't he?\" she comments as she moves your arm around. Olivia pulls her off of you and sighs. \"Yes, he's small, and FRAGILE.\" she tells the black bear. \"Sorry about that. This is Lexi, and she's kind of excitable.\" she tells you. Ruth steps forward and clears her throat. \"Well I guess I'll explain everything. We were on your planet exploring. We were just examining the area and weren't trying to interact with the natives, but then you ran into me.\" she says. \"Then she knocked you out and we sort of thought that since you were already caught, then you would make a good specimen.\" Olivia adds. \"Don't worry, we'll take good care of you!\" Lexi says with a smile. It seems now you're the property of these three bear women, but how are you treated? </span></div></div>",

You sit there confused while the three bears try to comfort you. \"So what will it be like?\" you ask. \"Well..like this actually.\" Ruth says. You look confused so she elaborates. \"This ship is our home. We live here and travel the stars.\" You lay back down and try to gather your thoughts. Looks like they intend on keeping you, but traveling the stars  doesn't sound too bad. Maybe this won't be too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lie there suddenly a large pair of paws begins feeling your arm. Lexi is once again fawning over you and is touching you all over. \"You're so small!\" sh says while she examines you. Her paws move toward your lower regions and you try to keep her away. \"Hey!\" you exclaim. Olivia comes over and pulls Lexi off of you. \"Sorry about her.\" she says. \"You're cute, so she can't really help herself. She then bends down to be at a more even height with you. \"Just remember, if there's anything you need don't hesitate to ask.\" she tells you. \"Uh, thanks.\" you say, finding it hard not to stare at her huge breasts. She notices your gaze and chuckles.\"I think you'll be fine.\" she says and pinches your cheek a little. Then she stands up and heads toward the door. \"Well I'll let you get some more rest.\" she says as she exits the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth walks over and puts a paw on your arm. \"I'm really sorry about knocking you out. It was just sort of an instinct.\" she tells you. \"I guess its okay.\" you say. \"At least you're not trying to eat me.\" You look down and see Lexi at the foot of the bed staring at you. \"Well most of us won't try to eat you.\" Ruth says. \"But he's cute enough to just gobble up!\" Lexi says as she walks to you. She leans down and licks your cheek, causing you to blush. \"Okay, I think thats enough.\" Ruth says and pulls her away. \"Darn...\" Lexi says. As she grabs Lexi you find yourself looking at her body. Her breasts and hips look great, but then again all three of them are pretty attractive. Ruth sees you staring and blushes a little. \"Well, I'll leave you alone for now. We'll see you later.\" she says and drags Lexi out of the room. \"Aaaww man.\" Lexi says while pouting. You lay back down and try to get some more rest.\t</span></div></div>",

You're on a space ship and have to live with three bear women. Its a little hard to accept but there doesn't seem to be anything you can do about it. With a sigh you get out of bed and walk to the door. Might as well explore the place since its your new home. The door opens when you near it and you step into the hall. It looks pretty normal as you walk along. After rounding a few corners you see something that amazes you. The next hallway has a window on one side. You look out at the vastness of space and gasp. You have to admit its a little awesome and terrifying at the same time. You continue down the hall and keep going, not really looking for anything. There sure are a lot of halls and rooms. This ship is huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a whim you decide to enter one of the rooms and see whats inside. You step inside when the door opens and find a room that looks like a gym. You hear someone somewhere in here and look closer to see Ruth further inside. She's lifting weights, and big ones at that. Looks like she changed her outfit to a pair of shorts and a tank top. You walk toward her slowly, not sure if you should say hi or anything. She eventually senses your presence and looks over. You stop when her eyes meet yours and just stand there. \"Oh, hey Blake. Decided to explore a little huh?\" she says. You nod and approach slowly. \"Yeah, I'm sorry if I interrupted you.\" you tell her. \"Of course you didn't. I'm just working out a little.\" she says as she continues to lift weights. She then sets them down and stands up. You look at the weights and think about how heavy they must be. Then you wonder how strong Ruth is. Your gaze shifts upward as Ruth walks over to you. \"So do you like the ship?\" she asks. \"Yeah, its pretty big.\" you say before her large form. She leans closer and tilts her head. \"Are you still nervous? Come on I said I was sorry for knocking you out!\" she says. \"I'm not nervous, just a little overwhelmed.\" you tell her. \"Yeah, I guess it is a lot to take in.\" she notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth is you are nervous, but not for the reason she's thinking. You've never been this close to a girl like her before and its kind of intimidating. She's large with a great figure, not to mention the whole being a grizzly bear thing. Her outfit is a little tight, and when you stare you see that her fur is a little damp in places. She sees you staring and then steps back. \"Oh, I must be a sweaty mess!\" she says and sniffs herself. \"No, I was just noticing how attractive you are.\" you blurt out, then shut up. You never were very cool around girls. She blinks at the compliment and then turns a little red. \"Oh, well thanks.\" she says. After a minute of standing there looking at each other she backs up. \"Well I should hit the showers and clean up.\" she says. As she does so she looks you over and gives the faintest of smiles. Then...</span></div></div>",

You head to the door its coming from and open it. Inside you see Lexi on a bed reading a book. She looks up when she hears you. \"Hey there cutie!\" she says and puts her book down. She then lays on her stomach with her arms folded. \"You must be feeling pretty bold to come right into a girl's bedroom!\" You look at the door from the hall and see a sigh that say LEXI. \"Oh! I'm sorry!\" you say and start to leave. Before you can get too far though Lexi grabs you and pulls you inside, shutting the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there in Lexi's room nervously while she walks back over to the bed. \"You don't have to look so nervous.\" she says as she sits down. You can't really help it. This is the first time you've been alone with a girl in her bedroom, let alone a big bear girl. Lexi pats the spot next to her. \"Have a seat.\" she says. You hesitantly walk over and sit down next to her. She might be the smallest of the three girls but she's still much bigger than you. When you sit right next to her like this you can look up and see just how tall she is. \"So how are you doing?\" she asks. \"Fine I guess.\" you answer. \"I still wish you guys would take me home but this place is pretty neat.\" Lexi smiles and puts a paw on your leg. \"Sorry about all this but you'll learn to live with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she makes smalltalk you notice that she's started to rub your leg. It doesn't bother you so much as it makes you nervous. \"You okay?\" she asks and takes her hand off of your leg. She places it on your back and begins rubbing there now. You have to admit it feels really good.\"You know you really are cute.\" she tells you. \"When Ruth caught you I was so excited!\" She leans in a little closer and her boobs are right on your head. You can feel her heartbeat and its starting to really make you embarrassed. What next?</span></div></div>",

First you try pulling away gently, but that doesn't go as planned. When Lexi feels you moving she grabs you with both hands and sets you on her lap. Now her boobs are resting perfectly on you and she's holding you like some sort of teddy bear. \"Something wrong?\" she asks as she holds you in place. \"No, its nothing.\" you say nervously. \"Are you not comfy enough? Let me help!\" she suggests and then falls onto her back, still clutching you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There now, isn't lying back nice?\" Lexi says. \"My fur is nice and soft right?\" It does feel good, like a little bed. \"Yeah,\" you admit. \"Its like a bed.\" You begin to relax and Lexi knows. When she feels your body loosen she grins and begins rubbing your chest. \"So the ship is pretty cool right?\" she asks. \"Yes actually.\" you say. \"I didn't expect there to be so many rooms. I even saw Ruth in a gym.\" Lexi continues to make conversation and starts to move her paw lower. When she reaches your crotch she brushes against it and you stop talking. \"Sorry, my bad.\" she says with a giggle. You feel like you should try to get up but at the same time you feel like staying. As if she sensed your thoughts Lexi flips you over without warning so you're facing her. Your face is buried in her breasts and she's looking at you with a smirk. \"How's this? Even comfier  right?\" You nod slowly with red cheeks, not knowing what else to do. As if that was all she needed Lexi pulls you up to her face and in for a kiss. Her big tongue overpowers yours as it probes around inside your mouth. Not being able to resist you just go along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lexi and you make out you feel her paws over your back.

Ophelia rolls her eyes and pulls you from Lexi's grasp with one hand. \"Just get up. We're making a stop.\" she says as she holds you in the air by your shirt. \"A stop?\" you ask. \"Yeah, we need to pick up some supplies.\" she tells you. Ophelia then walks out of the room still holding you, with Lexi right behind her. \"You sure have bad timing though.\" Lexi says in a frustrated tone. \"I'm sure he'll be having his fun soon enough.\" Ophelia states with the faintest of smirks. What does she mean by that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you reach the bridge Ophelia puts you down and sits in her seat. Just as she does Ruth walks in. \"We there yet?\" she asks. \"Almost.\" Ophelia says as she takes the wheel. Lexi walks over and wraps her arms around your shoulders. Ruth sees this and sighs. \"Jeez Lexi, you don't have to look so desperate.\" she says. Lexi sticks her tongue out at the grizzly. \"I'll have you know he came to MY room.\" she gloats. Ruth is taken aback and turns a little red. \"What?\" she asks. \"It was an accident.\" you tell her, which calms her down. \"At least I wasn't all sweaty from working out.\" Lexi adds. Ruth turns away and folds her arms while Ophelia is amused. Whats up with these girls? Why do they seem to like you so much? As you wonder this Ophelia begins pushing buttons. \"Okay guys we're landing.\" she says. When the ship stops she gets up and heads for the door. Ruth begins to guide you out as well but Lexi grabs your hand and pulls you along. Ruth scowls and follows you all outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you exit the ship you are amazed by what you see. There are other spaceships all around you like a parking lot. It seems to be indoors as well. You look around and see other aliens walking around. They all appear to be animal based like the girls, but not just bears. You see cats, dogs, lizards, and all sorts of others.Lexi continues to pull you along and Ruth grabs your other hand forcefully. Ophelia smirks as she leads the way while you are escorted by the the two bears. When you exit the parking lot you find that you're inside what seems to be a massive shopping mall. \"This space station is a huge collection of stores and businesses.\" explains Ophelia. \"You can find anything you need here.\" Next...</span></div></div>",

Soon Ophelia comes across a small shop that looks a little run down. When you enter you see that its filled with what looks like spare parts. \"Okay first we need to get some tools and spare parts for the ship.\" she says as she searches through the inventory. Then a rather large badger woman walks out from the back of the shop and spots you all. \"Hey girls! Here for more parts?\" she calls out. Ophelia looks up and smiles. \"Hey Anne. Yeah, we're making a pit stop.\" she tells the woman. Anne walks out and stops at you. \"I see you have a new member.\" she says as she bends down to get a better look at you. Her huge breasts are in your face, causing you to blush. \"Hey Anne, mind getting those balloons out of his face?\" Lexi says annoyed. \"Sorry if if I'm a little too much for him.\" Anne says with a jovial laugh. She is indeed even bigger than Ophelia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia seems to be doing well and is finally ready to make her purchase. As she walks to the counter Anne follows. \"Still, why did you guys pick this one up?\" she asks. \"He was an unexpected specimen we collected.\" Ruth says. \"She knocked him out.\" Ophelia explains. Lexi laughs while she and Ruth show you around and Anne leans in close to Ophelia. \"You could have just left him there. No one would have believed him if he said anything.\" she says. Ophelia looks away and turns a little red. Anne picks up on this and laughs. \"Oh my god, you like him!\" she says. Then she looks at the rest of you. \"That little guy managed to charm all three of you?\" Ophelia pays for her stuff and silences Anne. \"The point is he's with us now. I'm sure life with us will be way better than Earth.\" she tells her. Anne shrugs. \"Well I'm happy you guys found someone you like.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you exit the shop and say good bye to Anne. The girls are carrying all the parts while you follow closely behind them. You drop everything off at the ship and head back to the shops. \"Okay lets get back to business.\" Ophelia says. \"Lets get something to eat first.\" Lexi suggests. \"I could eat.\" Ruth agrees.

Lexi guides you to a shop that you see serves what looks like pizza. \"Is that pizza?\" you ask. Lexi laughs and pats you on the back. \"What, you think Earth is the only place that has pizza? There are hundreds of races way more advanced, so I think we can handle lunch.\" she tells you. It smells great, even better than what you're used to. Maybe the ingredients come from some space animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a girl comes to the counter to take your order. She's a hawk girl with brown feathers. Her wings also serve as her hands and their tips are red. She looks about seven feet tall and has nice boobs and generous hips. \"Hey guys!\" she says to the bears. \"Long time no see!\" The girls give her a smile as Lexi orders. The hawk sees you and leans across the counter. \"Who's this?\" she asks with her head cocked. Lexi puts an arm around you. \"This is Blake. He's our latest recruit.\" she says. You roll your eyes when she says \"recruit\". You smile meekly at the hawk and she grins. \"Oh he's a cutie!\" she says and pinches your cheek. \"I'm Andrea.\" she tells you. \"Andrea's actually part of our crew, but she's working here for a while.\" Ophelia explains. Ruth chuckles. \"She got into a fight and it ended up going over the counter. They busted up three ovens and she's paying it back.' she explains. Andrea frowns. \"I didn't start it!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you all have your food you head to a table and start to eat. A second after you start Andrea sits down with you. \"I'm on break, so lets eat together.\" she says. You take a bite of your pizza and find its delicious. You don't know what kind of ingredients they use but its way better than Earth pizza. \"The creatures we use for food are different from Earth animals, but its close enough.\" Ophelia tells you. As you eat you learn more about this subject. They don't eat Earth animals because they're too similar to their own kind, but they do use the same fruits and vegetable. They also have their own fruits and veggies that you don't know of. \"You'll try them eventually.\" Ruth says as she puts a paw on your hand. You start to feel more relaxed as you eat with these four alien women. When the meal is over...</span></div></div>",

It feels like its been forever!\" she exclaims. \"And here I got used to living without you.\" Ruth jokes.Ophelia just smiles. You on the other hand are a little confused. Now another one is going to be living with you? Andrea gets up and walks to you. \"Looking forward to living with you.\" she says with a smile. She then holds out her wing for a handshake and you oblige. Her feathers feel pretty nice and you accidentally hold on for too long. \"You can let go now, or do you like me that much?\" she says with a grin. You retract your hand quickly. \"Sorry!\" you say. Andrea smiles while Lexi and Ruth are frowning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think its time we got going.\" Ruth says annoyed. She grabs your hand and pulls you along. The others follow with matching smirks. You all resume your shopping trip and pick up the remaining supplies you need. Its mainly food and other things, so you actually feel like you're on a normal shopping trip. Along the way you get a little more comfortable with Andrea, who seems like a really nice girl. You've only just met the others as well so its all good. When you're all done you had back to the ship, with Andrea pulling you along this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everyone is on board you find that Andrea is still holding your hand.

The hawk girl is enjoying playing with you. Before she can tease you anymore however Ophelia grabs you. \"Come on, you guys have been pulling him all over today.\" she says as she puts you down. She sounds a little annoyed. \"Jealous?\" Andrea asks. Ophelia just rolls her eyes and walks away, but she did blush a little. The others head to their rooms, but Lexi stops you. \"Care to finish what we started?\" she offers seductively. \"Um, I'll just head to my room and rest a little.\" you reply shyly. She hugs you to herself at this. \"You're so cute!\" she squeals. Then she and Ruth head to their rooms and you yours. You notice that Andrea's room is near yours before you head inside.

She walks forward, ushering you back into your room, shutting the door behind her. \"What are you doing?\" you ask as she pushes your toward the bed. \"Just getting to know you better.\" she says and pushes you down. She starts to climb on top of you but then backs off. \"Just kidding!\" she says.

What happened?\" she asks.

Lexi picks you up and holds you in front of her so you're facing each other. \"Predator and Prey.\" she answers. When you give her a confused look she explains. \"You'll get a set amount of time to hide in the ship, then the four of us will hunt you down.\" You look at the four of them and see the eager looks on their faces. Well they are all technically predatory animals. \"Okay, lets do it.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls push you out of the room and tell you to hide. You wander around the ship trying to get as far away as you can. As you travel the halls you realize just how big this place is. It seems bigger on the inside than the outside. While you look for a good spot you here the padding of paws on the ground. They're already catching up! You quickly duck into the nearest room and see that its a laundry room. The door opens and you dive into a pile of clothes. \"Where are you?\" you hear Ruth ask as she walks in. You can hear her sniffing around and she gets pretty close before turning around and leaving. You wonder how you escaped but the smell the clothes you're hiding in. They haven't been cleaned yet, so the smell of the other girls must have thrown her off. Then you realize you're in soiled clothes and jump out blushing intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exit the room and walk along until you hear talons clacking. Knowing it must be Andrea you duck into the nearest room once again. Turns out its a library. You are momentarily taken out of the game to admire just how many things the ship has. You walk further into the room and are soon brought back to reality. You suddenly feel a huge presence behind you and turn to see Ophelia looming over you with a grin. Her sharp teeth are showing as she pounces. You try to get away but she's too fast. The next thing you know she has you pinned to the ground under her massive form. \"Looks like I win.\" she says with a smile. You can feel her fur through her clothes and her boobs are pushing up against you. \"Whats this?\" she asks when she notices your reddening face. She sits up and pulls you up to her face. \"Are you blushing?\" she asks playfully. Without warning she then kisses you. Her larger tongue is invading your mouth and your own tongue is being played with. When she breaks the kiss she looks pretty happy. What does she do next?</span></div></div>",

She walks over to a sofa and sits down with you in her lap. This situation makes you realize how cozy this room actually is. There's lots of comfy places to sit and lots of books to read. You look up at Ophelia and see that she's watching you as well. \"Feel nice doesn't it?\" she asks warmly. \"Yeah, this room is great.\" you tell her and settle down into her fur. Your head grazes the underside of her boobs and it feels like they're resting on top of you. The two of you get lost in the moment until the others come looking for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear voices getting closer until the door opens and the others enter. When they see the two of you on the sofa Lexi points a finger. \"See? I knew she was keeping him for herself!\" she accuses. Ophelia chuckles. \"And whats wrong with that? As the predator who caught him, I should be able to do what i want with my prey.\" she says. Andrea steps forward and looks over you. \"Well at least she's being honest. I thought she'd never drop the whole matriarch thing.\" she notes. Ophelia hugs you tighter. \"I'm not dropping any act, I'm just finally showing him how I feel.\" she says, and rubs your head. \"I'll take good care of him.\" The two of you exchange smiles, causing the Ruth and Lexi to try and separate you. Once they pry you away from Ophelia you go back to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the party goes well. In your conversations you get to hear about some of their experiences traveling. As time goes on you notice that the four of them are getting a little tipsy. You take a sip of Lexi's drink and find that it tastes alcoholic. Guess they wanted something more than soda. Soon they start to really show it and begin clinging to you. Lexi hugs you and starts licking your face. Then Ruth tears her away and hugs you herself. Andrea begins rubbing your leg and her hand starts moving toward your privates. Everything is thrown into chaos however when you feel that huge presence from above again and Ophelia snatches you up for a long kiss.

When you're done the door opens and Lexi walks in. \"Sorry! Were you in the middle of-\" she stops when she sees you're already clothed. \"Ahem. Sorry.\" You smile weakly and walk with her out of the room. She holds onto your arm as she walks and leads you to what looks like a dining area. Ruth and Ophelia are already there and Andrea isn't far behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys.\" the bird woman says with a yawn. She ruffles your hair and sits down at the table. You sit down between Ruth and Lexi. In font of you is a bowl of cereal, and you begin eating. Around you the others are having their own breakfast. Andrea is also having cereal, but the bears are devouring plates of sausage and bacon. Makes sense, they are carnivores. \"So...\" you begin. \"Where did my clothes come from?\" you ask. \"We bought them yesterday.\" Ophelia tells you. You don't remember that. One of them must have snuck off and done it. \"We wanted to surprise you!\" Lexi says and hugs you. \"I put them in your room while you were asleep.\" Ophelia says. \"I also watched you for a little while.

Where?\" you ask. \"Where ever we want!\" Lexi says. Ruth sighs and explains. \"Ophelia's family is crazy rich and she has enough money to live off of forever, so she literally just explores all over the place.\" Ophelia wraps an arm around you. \"Sometimes we head to a new planet, or visit an old one.\" she says. \"Or we just glide through space for a few days to unwind.\" She rubs your butt when she says this. Lexi turns red and huffs. \"Whatever, where are we headed?\" You're actually curious too. Would it be their planet, one full of bear people? Or it might be the planet of some other space anthros.</span></div></div>",

Everyone gets up and heads for the exit. As you walk Ruth puts a large paw on your shoulder. \"Stay close to us, okay?\" she tells you. You smile at her protectiveness and nod. Andrea gives you a hug from behind. \"Yeah, we wouldn't want to lose you!\" she says. As you exit the ship you see that the landscape is a bit desert like. Not so much that its an actual desert though. You've landed in a town that looks perfectly normal, there just doesn't seem to be much green around.  Once you're off the ship though you see various gardens around the town. The planet must be desert like but the residents still grow plants for their own needs. Speaking of the residents you see that they're all reptile people. You see many different kinds of lizard people going about their lives. \"Okay, lets find a restaurant and grab some food.\" Andrea says. Your group begins looking for some place to eat while exploring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour walk eventually takes you to a part of town that contains all the shops. Already you see many places to eat. As you look around you don't notice that you've fallen behind and run into something soft. You are knocked back and look up to see a large lizard woman with bluish black scales looking down on you. You can't really tell what kind of lizard she is but her long tail is waving about and she has small frills pointed downward coming from her neck. She also has dark blue hair reaching down to her back. She's looks like she's Ruth's height, with a voluptuous figure and huge breasts. \"Well hello! New around here?\" she asks with a smile. You stare up at her at a loss for words. \"Do you need a guide?\" she asks as she bends down to get a better look at you. Just then a white paw grabs you by the back of your shirt and lifts you up. \"There you are!\" the owner, Ophelia says. \"I told you to stay close!\" Ruth says annoyed, but relieved. Ophelia turns to the lizard woman. \"Sorry, he's new to traveling.\" she tells her. \"Don't worry about it, he's a little cutie.\" the woman responds. Then she looks at you. \"And the name is Sally.\" she says to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour group goes on their way but Sally casts one more look at you before she goes. Later on... </span></div></div>",

Sally would have helped me find you guys.\" you argue. \"I'm still glad we found you quickly.\" Ophelia says. Ruth snickers. \"Yeah, from the way you grabbed him I'd say you were afraid that lizard would steal him away!\" she says. Everyone has a laugh but Ophelia reddens a little.

It looks like some sort of knick knack shop. When you enter you see all sorts of little statues and decorations. There are also various accessories and clothing. This place has a good variety. The girls go about looking at the selection, as do you. Before you start though a woman comes from the back of the shop. The first thing you notice about her is that she's the same type of lizard as Sally, except she's older and has short hair. \"Hello!\" she says to you all. \"Hi.\" you say a little awkwardly. \"She stares at you for a second and smiles. \"Well its not everyday we get offworlders in here, but I don't think anyone of your species has been here!\" she tells you. Andrea comes up behind you and puts you in a mock headlock. \"This little cutie is a human we picked up!\" she says. The woman smiles again. \"Well just let me know if I can help you.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little more searching Ophelia comes over to the shop keep with an empty portrait with what looks like a button on top. \"Excuse me, what is this?\" she asks. \"Oh thats one of our more hi tech items.\" she says. \"My daughter can explain it better than me.\" Then she looks toward the back. \"Sally!\" she calls. Then a familiar face emerges and smiles happily upon seeing you. \"Hey there!\" she says and runs over to sweep you up for a hug. In a flash the others are staring at her. \"Sorry.\" she says and puts you down. \"You've met?\" her mother asks. \"Yeah, we ran into each other earlier.\" Sally tells her. \"Well explain this picture frame to them.\" Sally takes it from Ophelia and points to the button. \"Basically this thing is like a camera. When you press the button it snaps a photo of whoever its facing. The cool part is that the flash also reads your brainwaves, so instead of taking a photo of what you're doing, the picture will reflect how you feel. So be careful what you're thinking.\" Lexi walks over. \"That sounds neat! Lets buy it!\" she says. Ophelia nods and pays for the frame while Ruth chats with Sally. \"So you know about all that hi tech stuff?\" she asks. \"No, I just like to learn about stuff I find interesting.\" she answers. She glances at you when she says this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you run the shop together?\" Andrea asks. Sally's mom looks at her daughter. \"Not just us. I have two more daughters but they're out running errands. They plan on running the shop but I know Sally wants to get out there on her own one day.\" she says. \"It will be sad to see her go but I'll support her any day.\" The other girls have walked over to inspect the picture frame as well.

Besides there's also Ophelia and Ruth watching over you. They're determined to make sure you don't get lost again. When it gets late in the day your group heads back to the ship. \"That was fun.\" Ruth says as she boards. \"Yeah, even if our little buddy almost got stolen away.\" Andrea adds. \"Try not to tease him too much.\" Ophelia says with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the ship you all head to the living room and Lexi pulls out the portrait. \"Okay everyone, lets try this thing out!\" she says. Everyone gathers into a group while Andrea fiddles with it. \"Hey there's a timer function.\" she says as she studies the back. When she has it all figured out she sets the timer and everyone smiles for the photo. After a quick flash everyone gathers around to see what kind of picture will form. Since it will project everyone's feelings, you're all pretty curious. When the photo forms it shows the girls huddled around you. Lexi is holding onto one arm while Ruth holds the other. Andrea has her arm around Ruth while Ophelia is standing behind you with her paws on your shoulders. Her huge breasts are looming over you. \"Wow! Look at that!\" Lexi says. \"You sure seem to be clinging to Blake.\" Andrea tells Ruth with a chuckle. \"Whatever!\" the grizzly responds. \"I don't know, this picture shows our true feelings.\" the hawk says. While they have their back and forth Ophelia grabs you for a hug. \"I guess we all just want to be closer to you.\" she says while you are smothered in white fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on everyone turns in for bed and you're headed for your room. You're walking down the hall when you hear someone behind you. You turn quickly, assuming its Andrea trying to mess with you. Instead your face is greeted by the underside of two boobs. When you look up you see someone you didn't expect. Its Sally! The lizard woman puts a finger to her lips, and before you can say anything she grabs you and covers your mouth.

Looks like she doesn't plan on trying anything. You think about waiting for her to fall asleep and then getting one of the others but you soon find out thats not going to happen. When she dozes off her grip is as tight as ever. Its not too tight, but you can't get up. With a sigh you try to get some sleep too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up you find that Sally's grip has loosened and manage to slip away. As you stand up she wakes as well and follows suit. \"I guess I should go and face every one.\" she says. You hope the others don't get too upset. You head out with Sally following and when the door opens you are face to face with Lexi. \"Oh! Blake! I was just...\" she starts and then trails off when she sees the lizard behind you. \"What the hell is SHE doing here?!\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you and Sally are sitting on the sofa while the others stand before you. Lexi looks mad, as does Ruth. Ophelia is watching Sally and Andrea is smiling in amusement. \"So what are you doing on my ship?\" Ophelia asks. \"Well I kind of wanted to be with Blake, so...\" Sally answers. \"So you snuck into our home?\" Ruth finishes for her. \"What gets me is that the two of you spent the night together.\" Lexi says. \"Nothing happened. We just slept.\" you tell them. After some deliberation its decided that Sally can stay. \"Its not like we don't have room.\" Ophelia says. And she seems like she'll look out for Blake.\" When they found out nothing happened between the two of you they seemed to lighten up to her. If anything this seems like some adventuring party picking up a new member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally gets up and grabs the portrait they bought and snaps a photo of herself. \"What are you doing?\" Ruth asks defensively, not wanting their photo to be erased. \"Just watch.\" Sally says with a smile. Instead of replacing it, the photo changes to include her. She appears with her arm wrapped around Lexi, gazing at you lovingly. Guess you have one more roommate. </span></div></div>",

The other girls are watching with interest and a little jealousy at the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi then lets go of your hand and stands up, seemingly satisfied. Andrea and Sally feel out the curves in their hips while Ruth gives her thighs a squeeze. Ophelia cups her boobs and smiles in satisfaction.

Sally comes from behind and pats you on the head. \"There are so many planets out there. Some are home to a single kind of people, like mine, and some have a bunch of species living together.\" she explains. \"This is just one of those, and just one of many forest planets in general.\" Ophelia looks at you. \"In fact, there's another forest planet nearby, called Rafor Tropis.\" she says. \"Whats that like?\" you inquire. \"Its like Tempar, but way hotter.' Ophelia says. After a bit more discussion you begin to land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the six of you exit the ship you are amazed at the environment. Its like the exact opposite of Reptos. There are so many trees and plants that they basically cover the whole sky, letting barely any sunlight through. The air feels kind of moist as well. \"What do you think?\" Lexi asks as she holds your arm. \"Its awesome!\" you say. \"Its so colorful!\" There are so many different colored plants around and you stare at them in awe. Soon you exit this parking area and get your first look at this planet's civilization. You notice that it seems kind of primitive. There are a few houses, but mostly you see various huts on the ground and built in the trees. They're very large huts, as big as houses themselves, but still huts. \"These kinds of planets have some level of technology and space travel, but embrace a simple life style by choice.\" Ophelia tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people walking around give off that vibe. They're clothes seem to be made of animal pelts and plants. There are lots of different kinds of aliens. You see various lizards, some frog people, and even some bears like Ruth and Lexi. There also a lot of birds around too. A spotted owl woman walks past you in a shirt made of leaves, with big boobs showing. You stare for a second and are met with the stares of your female companions. \"I was just...checking out the fashion here.\" you say quickly. They all roll their eyes and Ruth places her paws on your shoulders from behind. \"Just keep walking.\" she says and gently guides you forward. There are so many other kinds of species that you are blown away. You see squirrels, leopards, wolves, and more! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're so interested I'll explain.\" Sally says. \"A lot of plants on planets like these are soft to the touch but still tough enough to be used for clothes.\" As you all stroll along...</span></div></div>",

You are carried to a nearby building. Once you get inside you see that its a diner. \"Caught by the rain?\" a deer woman behind the counter asks. \"Yeah, we're new around here.\" Andrea says as she tries to shake her feathers dry.

When she sees the girls playing around with you she smirks. \"Sorry to interrupt you guys, but I brought you something.\" she says and hands Ruth what appears to be a hair dryer. \"That will dry you pretty quickly, and it should help with your clothes too.\" she says. As she turns to leave she looks back with a grin. \"Don't take too long now.\" she says. Sally uses the dryer first, and it gets her clothes relatively dry pretty quickly.

Ellie lets you go and offers a hand to Ophelia. \"Look, maybe I started off wrong. How about I show you around?\" she says. Ophelia glares at her and... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My semi naked body was a lather of sweat as if I've been having a nightmare, but I cannot remember any bad dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a vague recollection of something running behind me, something large, shadowy and ferocious. I still felt the uneasiness that follows a feverish sleep, when you don't know what it was you feared, and whether it was in the dream, or whether it's real. Perhaps it's behind me now, but I feel with my right arm, and there's just the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the wall of my cabin. I lay there, resisting full awakening, and stare above me. There was a constellation of some strange configuration, with odd sized stars I'd never seen before. On one side of the swirls of heavenly bodies was a large void of blackness, the cold, empty. one-eye socket staring down; a dangerous and all consuming black hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a jolt of returning memory, I jerked wildly and sat up. I peered at the rectangular perimeter of the pattern of stars, my overheated body chilling instantly. The view above me was impossible. I must be still dreaming. It couldn't be a nightmare because there was nothing threatening about the sky above me, dark and night though it was. <br>\r\nNo, there was nothing that should frighten me, or bring me feelings of misery, except for one thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy cabin no longer had a roof. Or ceiling. I was looking up into the void of space. Then, just when I was ready to jump out of bed, go racing out the door to find an explanation - surely discovering that this was just a nasty dream - the whole ceiling was growing lighter, and instead of outer space, galaxies and stars, there was a huge glowing shape that grew in size until it filled the whole sky above the cabin. The cabin walls were shaking, dust was flying and I knew then without any doubt that this was no dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next brought my heart-hammering body upright and the hair on my neck stood up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe they'd probe me or <i>worse</i>, they might even decide to <i>eat</i> me.

Your brain freezes, gears twisting as you try to comprehend the information. \"C...come again?\" \"A wandering black hole is on a direct path with your home planet, travelling <i>close</i> to the speed of light. If our math is correct, Earth has about 1 minute and 17 seconds remaining. Give or take a few seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was certainly news to you. You were surprised that there wasn't an uproar over this on earth, but realized that tracking a black hole moving at nearly the speed of the speed of light is probably not an easy task, and by the time they were able to detect it it'd be too late. But...these guys HAVE detected it. Why aren't they doing anything? \"Why aren't you guys doing something about this?\" you say accusingly, glaring up towards the commander. \"You guys are so much more advanced then us. Can't you, I dunno, deflect it or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorilla just chuckles in response. \"No, we couldn't possibly hope to stop it. It is a black hole, after all. Does your species even know what a black hole is?\" \"<i>Yes.</i>\" you snap back, getting to your feet. \"I just mean...couldn't you possibly...there has to be a way to...\" you say, before trailing off, a wave of sadness rushing over you. Everything you've ever done. Meaningless. Everyone you've ever met. Doomed. Hell, everyone was doomed. Billions of lives were doomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, you weren't...actually, that was an interesting thought. \"...why am I here? Why not anybody else? Why am I worth keeping alive instead of, I dunno, the president or someone famous or a scientist or something.\" you ask, looking towards the imposing form of the commander. \"Our scanners have detected that you're the most perfectly average human being, and thus the perfect example of humanity in the wake of it's erasure from the universe.\" \"...Gee, thanks.\" you say, grumbling to yourself. The gorilla-commander-samurai-darthvader-knockoff puts a furry hand on your shoulder, suddenly snapping you back to attention. \"I believe your planet is about to be destroyed. Would you like to watch, or would it pain you too much to see your previous life end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll watch.\" you say quietly, suddenly being taken back to the seriousness of the situation. Looking up, a large, ultra high-resolution screen is lowered into view, sliding out of the ceiling. On it, the Earth is displayed, hovering in the void of space amongst the stars. \"Don't blink, or you'll miss it.\" the commander says, eyes locked on the screen. You stare at it apprehensively, not sure if you're entirely ready to see your entire life vanish in the blink of an eye. On screen, a timer comes up in the corner, counting down from 10. You begin to count down. \"10...9...8...\" you say quietly, a hint of fear entering your voice as it falters slightly. \"7...6...5...\" the commander says with you, joining you. \"4...3...2...\" comes two more feminine voices, the only two others in the room, the Rhino and the Warthog, as they join in, their translators now functioning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes.</span></div></div>",

But as it stood, you were too focused on the imminent destruction of your own home planet to care. As the clock ticked down, seconds away from your home planets destruction, you closed your eyes, too scared to watch your planet be devoured by a black hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, you open your eyes, only to see the counter displaying a big fat \"00:00\", except the planet is completely intact. You look over towards the gorilla...er, <i>captain</i> in concern, and he murmurs something in an alien language, looking about as confused as a gorilla-creature can look. \"What's going on? Why is earth still there?\" you ask the captain, no longer feeling as scared, merely confused. \"I don't know... the trajectory of the black hole should've decimated the planet right about now...strange...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the midst of all this, I finally decided to examine the room I was in. It looked like a fairly stereo-typical main deck, in that it wouldn't look out of place on TV. The room was hexagonal, with half of the 20 foot tall room's walls leaving a giant window in there place. On the rim of the room on the opposite side of the window, there were many computers and screens situated on a few different height levels, and the center of the room is where what you believed was the \"Captain's Chair\", or equivalent. All in all, it was very nice spaceship. If you weren't still shocked about the whole ordeal you'd consider taking pictures and sharing them with hollywood to use as references. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander's eyes remained on the screen throughout your observations. No doubt he was hoping that the time of destruction was merely off slightly, but as seconds turned into minutes he began to get concerned. \"So...my planet is fine?\" you say, getting his attention, although he doesn't turn to face you. \"So can I go home? If you brought me here to keep one of us alive when Earth was destroyed, if it's fine...you don't really need me, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander glances in your direction, looking quite serious, so you shut up, realizing you're unsure of how friendly they are towards you despite all that's happened. \"Well, you were right about the first thing. According to our new readings, your planet barely managed to avoid the black hole...but that doesn't mean it's safe from destruction.\" \"Huh? But it missed, shouldn't the planet be fine-\" \"It <i>nearly</i> missed.\" the commander interrupted. \"And it also sucked up a good chunk of the sun on the way there, I just didn't mention it because hey, the planet'll be gone before they notice, it wouldn't have mattered. But now your whole solar system is destabilized. The sun is now significantly weaker, the black hole may or may not have eaten Mars, and if the Earth survives the following chaos, there's no telling if your <i>species</i> will.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? Are you saying I can't go home?\" you ask somewhat forcefully. \"You brought me up here, don't I get a say?\" \"Not really.\" says the commander, still looking at the screen, which is now displaying the sun...only with random particles of bits of gas strewn about around it, probably from the black hole itself. \"But is that what you want? To go back to a doomed planet? No, it would be beneficial for both you and us if you came with us. I'm sorry, that's just how it's going to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're silent. Well, on the bright side, life on earth was quite boring. But these strange, animalistic...things...wanted you to go with them. To where? Their home planet? What did they need a human for, anyway? To 'observe'? That'd be ironic, all things considered. Put in a zoo created by animals. But that was unimportant and you shifted that out of your mind. \"Hey, so...what am I? To you guys, I mean?\" you say, looking at the commander, then towards the Warthog and Rhino girls, who had been mostly silent. The warthog opens her mouth to begin to speak, but the gorilla shakes his head, and she stops, clearly threatened by the commander's presence. \"Well...given the unique circumstances we're now presented with...you're our...\"</span></div></div>",

The warthog woman then walks up to the captain. \"Commander,\" says the warthog with a slight snort. \"He deserves the truth.\" \"Don't patronize me Zeck,\" says the gorilla man. \"He would not be able to handle it if he knew the exact reason why we had to choose him over the six billion humans on the rock.\" The rhino woman let out a snort. \"What I don't understand is why we even bothered to save even one human. I've seen the footage gathered by the probes and from the looks of it, it's a wonder that they hadn't destroy their own species or their own planet before the black hole even had the chance to.

You watched as a shadowy figure stepped out of the ship.  The figure was almost humanoid, and appeared to be shaken and battered.  You creep a little closer as it steps into one of the still working lights of the ship.  It was a tall kangaroo, and judging by the body shape, you assumed it was a female.  She had an extremely slim figure.  Purple fur covered a majority of her body.  Her hands and feet were black, while her belly and chest were grey, and a white patch of fur indicated where her pouch was.  She was wearing body armor similar to what a solider would wear.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, looking somewhat frightened.  \"H-hello.\" she said, her voice shaking.

You start sweating as he approaches the bush your hiding behind.  Then you heard silence, followed by the husky's voice.  \"Must've been the wind.\" he said.  You sighed with relief as he started walking away.  Then you felt something metallic smash against the back of your skull.  It must've been one of those aliens, but the blow caused your vision to go blurry.  You then heard voices above you.  \"Must be a civilian.\" the husky said.  \"Should we keep him?\" you heard the kangaroo ask.  \"Looks like it, we can't risk him revealing us to his own kind.\".  the husky replied.

The sky was clear, cloudless and lots of stars filled your view. One star seemed to be a lot brighter, shining more light than any other star in the sky. You just couldn't seem to look away as it became bigger and whiter. Trying to secure your eyes, you placed your hand over your eyes. This became too bright and eventually you had to look away. \"Is the whiskey doing this to me?\", you thought, just when a sound started to form from high above you. It sounded just like the wind, but different. It had a more humming sound to it, like an engine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt a strong force pulling you upwards. First you thought it was just your instinct, which wanted to see what in the world was happening here. But your instinct also noticed something different. Where was the ground? You struggled and waved with your arms, but felt nothing that was solid. Opening your eyes was impossible, as it sure would have blinded you. Helplessly you gave up. You didn't care anymore what was happening and figured it could have been the alcohol doing nasty things with your mind and balance organ. It seemed the situation would not change either, so falling asleep was the only legit option you had in mind. And that was what you needed, rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooehaa\", you groan while stretching out, slowly waking up. You never knew the wood on your porch could have been this comfy. You playfully kicked your legs in the air to get your body ready to stand up. But in order to do that, you had to open your eyes. Weirdly enough, it didn't seem to make any difference if you had your eyes open or not. \"Is it still night?\", you wondered, but that would mean even the stars were gone. The smell was also not from anything you could recall smelling earlier in your life. You stretched your arm, and felt metal walls on the left and right sides to you. Panicked by this discovery, you got up, carefully placing your hands before you, so you'd not run into something. No second later your hands hit another wall, and after you turned around and after setting a few steps you felt another one! It meant that you were trapped in a room which was hardly 3 by 8 feet long, slightly bigger than your body. Alarmed you bonked your hands on the metal walls. \"Hello! Somebody in here? Hey! Who did this to me? Why am I locked? What is this place! HELLO!!!\" Rhythmically and fiercely you hit the metal, not caring that it hurt really bad. You gave up shortly after and laid down on the ground, which softer than you thought, almost like a bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what had felt like an eternity, you heard faint voices from outside the box. You couldn't understand what exactly they were saying as it was too muffled to tell the words apart. Suddenly, you heard a squeak as a door were opened and soon later light erupted from above you. You looked up and saw to your surprise...</span></div></div>",

Even during the night, the rolling green hills in the area where you lived still seemed beautiful in their own right, something that, when coupled with your childhood love of camping, meant that every now and then you couldn't resist a night spent under the stars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you hadn't expected to happen was what seemed to be a meteorite impact - and so close to you! Interrupting your stargazing, it had slammed into the forest near your house, shaking the ground and pissing off a multitude of animals trying to sleep. If you could get a picture, or, heaven forbid, a fragment or two of it, you'd be the the happiest 25 year old in all of England. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTorch pointed ahead of you, you slowly walk through the forest in an attempt to find the fallen space-rock, making sure to look at the ground ahead of you to stop yourself from tripping on anything. Eventually, you come across a clearing in the forest illuminated by a mysterious light - and in the middle of the clearing, a crater! It seems you've found your meteor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking over the edge of the crater, you can't help but freeze in bewilderment at what you see. Instead of a large rock, you see a seamless silver sphere that gives off a soft light. You're not quite sure how big it is, but you don't think it's any smaller than twice your size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden bout of paranoia grips you as as a strip on the sphere recedes, and you scrabble backwards, standing up in the process. As you stand up, you feel the top of your head brush what feels like two warm spheres tightly constrained in a fabric of some sort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuppressing a yelp, you take a step forwards, turning around and looking upwards slightly as you do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive pair of breasts, bound in tight grey fabric, meet your eyes, firm nipples easily visible. Slowly looking even further upwards, and taking a trembling step backwards, you see what appears to be the face of a human-animal hybrid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what kind of animal are you looking at?</span></div></div>",

Her muzzle quivers as you begin to back away, almost tripping over your own feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn and begin to sprint as fast as you can, you hear the vixen break out into a joyous laugh. Her voice is deep and booming, and the laugh only serves to make you sprint even faster. Tearing through the forest, heart pumping, you can hear rapid, heavy footfalls coming up behind you-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a massive weight crashes into you from behind, forcing you down into the ground as your head is engulfed by two fabric-covered mounds of flesh. Laying there in the dirt, superior body completely covering yours, the vixen chuckles as she looks into her own cleavage - and into your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...\" she moans, \"I can't believe I found a human...

Frozen in fear, you can do nothing as the anthro lifts you up by the front of your t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we have here, hm? Are you lost, human? No matter, you'll be useful to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice is deep and powerful, and it fills you with a sense of dread you cannot remember feeling before. The wolf drags you to the edge of the crater, though her arm muscles seem to be straining farm more than they should be to keep you aloft. The silver sphere seems to have a rectangular piece missing from it, somehow - presumably, that was the section that began to retract earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wolf begins to descend into the crater, you come to your senses, and attempt to pry her paw off your t-shirt. Your attempts, however, are met with a close-up view of her glistening teeth and a bone-chilling growl. Once again stunned into submission, you screw your eyes shut, as if it could help you avoid the bizarre reality of your situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are dragged inside the silver sphere, and the wolfess talks once more - but not to you. <br>\r\n\"Clover, I found a human. We're leaving, for now.\"<br>\r\nOpening your eyes, you are greeted by the inside of the sphere, which is a mainly empty done with two seats similar in material to the sphere itself, arranged one in front of the other. Both seats are large enough to hold a being of the wolfess' size - and one of them is occupied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn anthro canary, seemingly even larger than the wolf, is sat in the back chair. She is dressed in bright pink jumpsuit that, like the wolf's, seems to be doing a poor job of containing her huge mammaries. Her bright blue eyes seem to pierce into your soul, even as she fidgets, readjusting a large pink bow tied to the back of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're leaving a-already? But we've been her f-for such a short time!\" Clover complains, her voice quavering slightly as she peeks over the seat in front of her to look at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we're leaving! When we've gotten all the use we can out of this one, we'll go and find another one. Now, restrain him for me so I can pilot this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf thrusts you at Clover, who seems momentarily stunned. The canary quickly picks you up, however, and positions you on her lap before wrapping her arms tightly around you, both ensuring that there is no escape and forcing your head right in between her massive mounds. Blushing deeply, you can't stop yourself from trembling slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover's beak gently bumps the back of your head. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry, little one. I- I'm sure it'll all be over s-soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, you're not exactly sure if everything that is happening is even real or not - there was a distinct possibility that you'd fallen asleep while stargazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA holographic interface surrounds the wolf's chair, and the only exit, the area of the sphere that had receded, closes up as she types rapidly. It seems that there really is no escape - if this is even real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clover, hold him completely still. I'm administering the sedative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover's arms tighten immensely, locking you in place despite your sudden squirming. A panel on the back of the chair in front of you opens up, and a minute dart-like object shoots out, sticking into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your efforts, you can feel yourself being overcome by whatever chemicals you have been exposed to, and you quickly fall into a deep, dreamless sleep...</span></div></div>",

Opening your eyes, you realize that you are in a sterile, ascetic room with little-to-no features besides the door opposite you and the hexagons seemingly embossed into the ceiling. The room is rather spacious, you'd guess maybe ten by ten by ten feet, or possibly larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at your body, you realize that you have been stripped of most of your clothes, revealing your pasty-white skin. Only your jogging bottoms and, presumably, your underwear have been left in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wrists are bound in place by what feels like a metal band; handcuffs of some sort, most likely chained to the wall behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in a breath, you finally look at the three huge, imposing figures in from of you. You recognized two from earlier; Clover and the wolfess. Now that they were side by side, it was immediately apparent that Clover was about a head taller than the wolfess. The new figure beside them appeared to be an anthropomorphic, brown-furred horse, and was about halfway between the heights of the other two. A form-fitting black jumpsuit concealed a moderately-sized pair of breasts. The wolfess is the first one to talk, and she does so with the same hate-filled tone as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you little worm, we have some questions. You're going to answer them, and then maybe we can answer some of yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow thickly before licking your chapped lips. <br>\r\n\"B-Branok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Branok. Second question. What year did the Grand Conquest take place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh?<br>\r\n\"The what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess looks intensely displeased as she takes off what seems to be an earpiece, tapping at it with a finger. Scowling, she puts it back in. <br>\r\n\"Clover, the universal translators are working properly, aren't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canary, who had been tapping away at an arm-mounted holographic panel of some kind nods. <br>\r\n\"Y-yes, they are. It seems that either he is n-not aware of the events due to a lack of education or the phrasing has changed in this cycle. We m-may have to take him to the holosuite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess screws up her muzzle, deep in thought. She huffs, biting her lower lip. She speaks again. <br>\r\n\"We need to cover his eyes so he can't see where we go, in case he tries to break out. Clover, detach his restrains from the wall. Miku, cover his eyes while we walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse, Miku, quickly moves in front of you, as does Clover - albeit with some hesitation. Clover fiddles with the restraints on your wrists, detaching them from the wall, and your vision is plunged into darkness as Miku covers your eyes with her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clover, take his restraints in front of him. Miku, cover his eyes from behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover guides you so that you are able to maneuver your arms to your front by lowering them to the floor and standing inside them, then standing up as usual. The canary takes the restraints in her grasp, indicated by a slight tug, and you're off, Miku covering your eyes the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must be a bizarre sight to any onlookers - a half-naked human being led off somewhere while his eyes are covered not with a blindfold, but with bare hands - however, this does not seem to affect their opinion of you, which seems to be extremely negative. All throughout your short journey to the holosuite you can hear growls and mutterings, all seemingly in reaction to your presence. Finally, you come to a halt, only to be tugged forward, Miku's hands leaving your head as you move. You find yourself in a room that is almost completely black, with glowing cyan lines and patterns seeming to emulate the appearance of circuitry on the walls, floor, and ceiling. The patterns pulse with a soft light, illuminating you and your captors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover fiddles with her haptic interface, and the pulsing 'circuits' begin to grow brighter, and brighter, and brighter...</span></div></div>",

You don't recognize any of the landmasses on it. Another map is summoned, and another, until the maps make up a small wall. The wolf begins to speak in her deep, low voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Grand Conquest has happened in every cycle to date. It always starts the same way - a nation beaten in war. The nation becomes intensely xenophobic as its economy, military, and pride are crushed by the winners of the war. A charismatic leader emerges-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small, black dot emerges on each of the maps. It is in a different location on each. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-and revitalizes the nation and its military. The nation attempts to annex others close to it, and another war begins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dots begin to grow and spread like a cancer. Other dots of different colours rise up to oppose them, often simultaneously, but they are struck down one after the other. Slowly but surely, the black dot grows to envelope the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nation wins, and over time, grows to exert control over the entire world. It reaches the stars, never forgetting its xenophobia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe circuitry once again begins to glow, but so much brighter than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, you rub at your eyes, which still burn after the assault from the glowing circuits. The wolf hoists you to your feet from the kneeling position you had inadvertently collapsed to, and with an unimpressed scowl, gestures in front of you. As you turn your head to look, you are conscious of Miku and Clover approaching the two of you from behind, signaled by their loud footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a second to take in what you are seeing, but you can think of a few choice words to describe it - words like ruin, devastation, and destruction. You stand in what appears to be the remains of a city block, the streets clogged with debris of all kinds. Partially collapsed skyscrapers dominate the skyline, and distant gunfire can be heard constantly. Thin red beams of light sweep slowly across windows and destroyed storefronts as snipers hunt for targets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... is the end result of the Grand Conquest. Every time, you are pushed back to your homeworld.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scenery blurs for a second, circuits pulsing gently, and you find yourself in a very dark room. Overhead lights flicker dimly into existence, illuminating a massive metal cylinder, pointed at one end, and surely three times as thick as you and ten times as long. Four slim robotic arms emerge from the walls, pincers grasping the rod as the floor beneath it begins to retract into the walls. Through the widening gap, you can see the far-distant troposphere, swirling masses of clouds hiding the land beneath them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms lower the huge cylinder down into the gap, and let go. The tungsten rod plunges downwards through the atmosphere, as do dozens of others. It takes a short while, but you can hear the impacts, even at your current height. The bomb bay doors begin to close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And every time, we are forced to destroy you. Then the cycle resets, and another few hundred thousand years later you appear again.\"</span></div></div>",

How ridiculous was it to ask that question in face of the overwhelming evidence? She groaned, only identifying the noise as coming from her own mouth by the taste of blood in her mouth as the dry surface of her lips split under the stretch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she tried to move her hands - and realised they were bound. From a strangely detached position a little corner of her mind noted that this might be the time to panic. The problem was, she was in by far too much pain for that. Opening her eyes only led to my sense of equilibrium adding its protests to the rest of her body. For a moment she just lay there, trying to make sense of what had happened to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer last memory: Friday night. The office. She had been first chair on her first solo case. So it had only been a small issue of petty theft and the kid had been too young to receive more than a slap on the wrist in any case.

She might only be a baby barrister - but now she at least could call herself one without wincing at the thought. She had been so charged up, so happy, she had wanted to finish all the paperwork that night. When she and realised the clock had already struck nine by the time she was done, she had even been a little proud, thinking she was the last one there. That little joy only dimmed a little when she met Carlisle before the elevator doors. He was a senior partner after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Miss Day.\" For a moment Jennifer was confused what he meant until she saw the amused glitter in his grey eyes. However he had found out, he clearly did know about her win today - and what it meant to a young barrister in training.<br>\r\n\"Than you, Sir.\" She just hoped her smile was not as foolish as it seemed. <br>\r\n\"The first one always matters.\" His smile turned inwards, wistful, chasing a memory only he could see. In that moment she understood that smile.<br>\r\n\"Sir, is it always like that?\"<br>\r\n\"The win.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\nHe grinned, the smile almost boyish - and then nodded. <br>\r\n\"A little, but that first one will always be the best.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that why you do it?\" The moment she asked the question she wanted to bite her lip and take it back. Had she gone crazy? How could she dare to ask him, one of best tax attorneys in London, something so personal. It was rumoured he even served some of the royals. Nervously she pushed one of the long blonde strands of her hair behind her ear and looked at him from below her eyelashes. Was he annoyed at her impertinence? But his smile just stretched.<br>\r\n\"Sadly, yes.\" For a moment he stayed quiet, then he asked: \"And you, young Lady - why did you chose this profession over all the others?\"<br>\r\nShe had been asked that question so often, in interviews, at law-school, in prep - and for a moment one of the thousands of expected answers, acceptable answers, lay on her tongue. But what she said was something completely different, something deeper:<br>\r\n\"Because I had to, because I can.\"<br>\r\nThey shared a look, a moment of absolute understanding. She had chosen this profession because the law had gripped her and was unwilling to let her go. It was like a jealous mistress, a God demanding absolute devotion - not in form but in substance. She had never told anyone that, had never put into words something so primal. No one else seemed to share this need, no one but this man. Then the moment broke and she stood, almost embarrassed, before this man, not knowing what to say. He seemed equally lost. The elevator pinged, the heavy steel doors gliding open. She had already turned to them, when his voice stopped her. <br>\r\n\"Miss Day, would you join me for a glass of champaign in honour of your victory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt no point were there any warning bells. At no point did she feel threatened, not even when her head began to swim and her eyelids drooped heavy, too cumbersome to hold open. A gentle hand had taken the glass from her, had helped her down and a deep voice had whispered into her ear:<br>\r\n\"There is no need for alarm, Miss Day. Everything will be alright.\"<br>\r\nAnd the next thing she remembered was hurting from head to toe. At least her nausea had subsided and her vision had cleared. She was in a small room without any windows she could see, the walls a generic greenish hue, the furniture in the style considered futuristic in the 1970s, though fortunately without the penchant for orange and brown so favoured by the era. She was laying on something resembling a bed, though its form was rounder than her rational mind considered appropriate for such a piece of furnishing. And her hands were bound. Oh, it was nothing as crude as rope, or steel - but broad cuffs made out of a soft, though surprisingly strong material. It did not budge at all as she pulled on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard a noise from behind her. She turned her head and met</font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What are you?\" I croaked.  My mouth was dry, and my throat was sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may call me Carlisle,\" the creature stated.  I felt the bed dip as he; I could only guess it was a he; joined me on the bed.  \"I am an a feline anthros.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's an anthros?\"  I croaked.  I could really use a drink of water.  As if Carlisle could read my thoughts he propped me up to a sitting position, and put a container that I could only describe as a glass to my lips.  I parted my lips obediently, and he tipped the glass so that the cool liquid inside ran down my throat.  I swallowed gratefully, and thanked him when he removed the container from my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your throat makes such interesting movements when you drink,\" Carlisle observed.  He watched with interest as I ran my newly hydrated tongue over my lips to moisten them.  He caught the tip of my tongue between soft fingertips, and examined it.  He ran one of his fingers of the smooth wet surface.  \"Your tongue is different then mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped when he leaned down and licked my cheek with his sand papery tongue.  He smiled down at me revealing a mouth full of glistening sharp teeth.  I flinched at the sight.  He soothed me by rubbing one of his smooth palms over my stomach.  This drew my attention to the facted that I was stripped down to my bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another difference between us,\" he observed.  He flipped his hand over and ran the fury side over my smooth skin; eliciting a moan of pleasure.  \"Do you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" I breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\"  He cupped one of my heavy breasts through my lace bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a breast,\" I gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you carrying offspring?\"  His thumb circled my stiffened nipple through my bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you have birthed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why is this so big?\" He tossed the mound of flest like a softball in his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been that big since I stopped going through puberty,\" I stated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was feeling a bit self conscious.  My anxiety heightened when I saw claws protrude from his fingers.  He lightly drug the tip of one between my breasts until he reached the center of my ba.  With a slight effort he sliced through it freeing my breasts from their lace prison.  His eyes were transfixed on the pink swollen tips of my breasts.  He retracted his claws, and circled one with his fingertip.  I sighed with pleasure, and gasped when he pinched it between his thumb and finger.  He seemed confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No milk,\" he observed.  \"Why are these protruding if there is no milk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were stimulated by your touch,\" I explained.  I managed to keep my voice steady as he pinched both of the firm buds.  My body wriggled as he pinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I hurtin\"g you?\"  He asked.  He released the pink sensitive flesh from his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touching them gives you pleasure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I free your hands will you show me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded.  He reached up, and unbound my wrists.  I slid my hands down my chest, cupped my breasts, and circled the tips with my thumbs.  I made sounds of pleasure, and wriggled.  He laid his fury body over me, and watched intently.  I licked one of my thumbs, and circled it over the point it abandoned.  He flicked his tongue over his teeth.  I cupped one of my breasts, and offered it to him.He leaned down, and circled the pint with his rough tongue.  I gasped, and moaned.  I'm not sure if it was instinct or curiosity that urged him to suck the tender flesh into his mouth.  He suckled greedily until I cried out, and arched my back under him.  He released me from his mouth immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that pain?\"  He inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, pleasure,\" I cupped the other breast and offered it to him.  He licked and suckled with more averous.  I reached another small crest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe released me, and sniffed all over me.  I giggled when he sniffed my neck.  He sniffed down my body until he reached my matching lac e panties.  I squealed when he pressed his nose to the crotch, and inhaled deeply.  He lifted his head, and gave me another sharp toothed smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in heat,\"he stated.  He disposed of my panties, and examined what lay beneath.  What he saw must have pleased him because he flicked his tongue over his mouth.  The low rumble in his throat, and the dilation of his pupils confirmed my suspician.  He surprised me again when he buried his muzzle in me.  His sandy tongue explored every nook and cranny, as I squirmed, and squealed.  He purred as he devoured me, and the vibrations sent me over the edge.  When he drank his fill he moved back up my body to look into my eyes.  His muzzle glistened wetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to mate with you,\" he stated.  \"Understand that if I do this it will bind us for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded my ascent.  He knelt up, and flipped me onto my stomach.  I instinctively positioned myself on my hands, and knees.  He gripped my buttocks with his hands, and with a guttural growl and and a firm shove he was buried deep inside me.  His organ was soft, but hard.  I wondered if it was fury too.  After a few slow movements from him I wasn't wondering anything.  He moved slowly, letting me feel every inch slide in and out of me.  As I tightened around him he increased his speed, and dug his claws into me.  I was riding too high on the wave of ecstasy to notice.  Just before he released he pinned me down and sunk his teeth into the soft spot between my neck and shoulder.  I cried out as both pain and pleasure brought me to my final destination.  He released my shoulder and howled as I felt a hot stream fill me and run down my thighs.  I felt a splash of liquid fall out of me as he extracted himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow, Jennifer, my mate,\" he whispered in my ear as he caressed my back, \"you will seduce me in the way your people do.\"</font></span></span></div></div>",

From the sky came down some strange looking spacecraft that appeared to look like it was made from dinosaur bones and follows from the cambrian period. You gasp and realize that aliens are invading the Earth. You had to tell somebody, fast and you started to run back towards town. But before you can do anything, you find yourself caught in a strange tractor beam of some sort. \"Oh no,\" you yell. \"Ah!\" You struggle hard to fight the beam but it pulls you into that strange ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the ship, you let out a scream as you see no less than twelve strange figures. You couldn't tell who or what they were given that there were hidden in shadows, but from the looks of it, they were anything but human. You scream and try to run but there is nowhere to run and you almost run into three of the strange figures when the lights go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you see terrifies you because they appear to be anthropomorphic animals. In front of you were three of them. There was a female anthropomorphic capricorn, a creature that from the waist up resembled a golden furred goat but from the waist down had scaly pink legs resembling the scales of a fish complete with fins. She was slightly obese and had an udder. She was wearing an amazon style breastplate complete with a tiara. She had long curved horns and red hair and on her left thigh was a tattoo that had consisted of a clover and the letter Q. To her side, there was an anthropomorphic zebra woman. The zebra woman was white with bright pink stripes and pink hair. She worn a pair of glasses and yet she didn't seem to wear anything else. She was very pear-shaped from the looks of it and on her neck was a tattoo of the letter Q but with a spade instead of a clover. There was a male anthro with them and from the looks of it, it was an anthro cobra with bright purple skin and yellow markings, except that he had hat appeared to be a pair of mechanical legs so he wouldn't have to slither around everywhere. The cobra man had a tattoo on his back of a spade and the letter K.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them spoke in a strange alien language and you decided to try and run again, only to be confronted by five more members of the crew. One was an anthropomorphic Chinese dragon man with blue scales and a black loincloth who let out a roar as he breathed blue fire. On his abdomen was a tattoo of a diamond and the letter K. The second crew member that you saw was an obese orange skinned frilled lizard woman who was dressed like a sumo wrestler except she had a red jacket. She also had long midnight black hair and on her stomach was a diamond and the letter Q. Next to her was a Bactrian camel woman with bright red fur who appeared to be wrapped in bandages like a mummy and had white hair. She had a tattoo on one of her humps with a Spade and the letter J. Then there was another anthro who had a tattoo of a J and a Diamond. From the looks of it he was an anthropomorphic cyan skinned chameleon who looked like his entire skin was covered in camouflage tattoos as he let out a hiss and flickered his tongue. he was next to a male deer anthro with green fur and large golden horns that looked like they had eyes. From the looks of it, he was dressed as an archer and had a tattoo of a J and a clover on his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizard woman spoke in a calm tone but since you couldn't understand her language, you just backed up before you turned and saw the remaining four anthros. There was a man in a blue hoodie with the letter J and a Heart on the back. He lifted his head and you saw that he was an anthropomorphic bluebird man who let out a tweet. He was between two other anthers. One was an obese and bright pink skinned hippopotamus woman with a checkered bikini and a heart tattoo with the letter Q on her left breast. She also had golden hair worn in a heart shape with a ponytail. The other was a pitch black tortoise man with a cybernetic mask and belt that appeared to have a pair of nunchucks inside.

You could see a glint in her eyes and her pitch white hair as she looked down on you. You were about to stand up but then you remembered that you were strapped in rather tight. Then you grunt because you felt a pain in your neck. You looked at your neck and you see that you now have a tattoo yourself. It was a clover symbol and the number two, to your concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at the camel woman and she let out a sigh. \"I guess it was wishful thinking that we'd find an Ace on that insignificant piece of rock. We could vaporize that planet and it would be of no loss to the galaxy.\" You couldn't believe it and you were somewhat afraid. The camel woman spoke and in <i>English</i>. \"Y-You understand English?\" you ask. \"Not really,\" says the camel woman. \"These symbols implanted into our body act as universal translators as well as display your rank.\" \"Rank?\" you ask. Then you see that there were two other anthros in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them was a chubby white and purple skinned sea slug woman who seemed to have a Barbie-doll like anatomy. On her stomach was a tattoo of a Heart and the number 5. The other anthro in the room was a purple and white feathered woodpecker man with his hair worn in a mohawk style. He was wearing a black loincloth and had a tattoo on the side of his head of the number 4 and a diamond. All these anthros seemed to be ranked like playing cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camel woman finally let you free as you stood up. \"I am Spade Jack.\" Said the camel woman. \"I,\" you said nervously. \"I am Bethany Jacobson, of Earth.\" The camel woman just let out a scoff. \"Not anymore. Your new designation is Clover Two. You were taken here because the Royal 12, of which I am a part of, believe you to be a peculiar specimen of your race.\" \"I don't follow.\" You said. Spade Jack lets out a snort. \"All of us on this spacecraft were brought here because we have unusual genetic codes that make us the pinnacle of our species.\" You found that hard to believe. \"And you think that I've got a strange gene?\" \"You have no idea,\" says Spade Jack. \"But unfortunately, the O.K.E. signature we picked up from you was weak compared to the rest of the crew. I'm afraid at your current level it will be a while before you are ready to face the coming storm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming storm?\" you asked more afraid than ever. \"What is that?\" \"All in time,\" said Spade Jack. \"Follow me.\" Without any other options you followed Spade Jack into what looked like...</span></div></div>",

In that second you were distracted you run into something large and furry. You start to fall down but someone grabs you.

She bends down to get a look at you and scratches under your chin. \"Not bad. My name is Rita by the way.\" You don't make a sound as Rita looks up at the tiger. \"Good job grabbing him Riley.\" she says. You stare up to see the tiger smiling down at you. Suddenly the first set of eyes you saw comes into view. It turns out to be a black panther woman. She's shorter than the others at about six feet. \"Hey Tammy.\" Rita says.

You silently curse yourself for not doing what she suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the cougar woman, 'Rita' knelt down to look you in the eye. Her face was full of compassion as she stared at you. \"We will not harm you little one, we only wish to Lear about your species.

What we want is a specimen that we can use as a sort of windows to humanity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a one sided deal either, well take really good care of you!\" Riley added, \"Plus how many humans get the chance to learn about an alien race!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a really good point, and if they were going to take care of you then you might be better off with them anyway. Still, you weren't entirely sure that you wanted to us and leave your world behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I refuse to go?\" You asked.

Your options were pretty limited at this point, you could either go with these aliens willingly, call for the orphanage staff and hope they 'save' you... though on the off chance they do you're not sure that you'd want to go back to that place.

It would be much easier on everyone, including you, if you just came willingly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained silent, you couldn't understand why it was so important that you want to go with them. They've already told you that you don't have a choice and you don't doubt them. So why would they go through so much trouble to try to <i>convince</i> you to go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if we did leave you here,\" Riley broke in, \"The government will be here within the hour. You're within one of your miles of our ship. They'll know where you've been and want to lock you up and interrogate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This was also true, chances are that someone or something somewhere has a record or picture of you being so close to their landing site. You might as well be E.T. At this point, because the Feds would be on you like white on rice. Besides, this could be the change you were looking for, and even if it wasn't, they said themselves that they weren't going to let you go, and you doubt you could escape them even if you really and/or still wanted to. At length you sigh and decide you should just go willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You win, I'll come with you,\" you sigh with a shrug. The three cats looked at each other gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We promise we'll take really good care of you!\" Rita exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You won't regret this! You'll have tons of fun!\" Riley beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thankyou for coming willingly and giving us a chance\" Tammy smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They talk as if you were actually given a choice. Guess they really appreciated the fact that you wanted to go versus them forcing you. Before you could give anymore thought to what was happening, Riley slung you over her shoulder and all three furries began making their way through the woods, presumably too their ship. You get a brief glimpse of an entryway before your world blurs as you're handed off to one of the other two girls. When everything comes back into focus you find yourself sitting in Tammy's lap at some sort of control station. Before you can move or say anything, she fastens a seat belt over both of you, in effect strapping you to her own body. It was rather comfortable for the most part, but kind of weird. You glance up at her questioning lay as she returns your glance with an apologetic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sorry, we're in a hurry and we don't really have any chairs that you'll fit in yet,\" She explains, \"So for now, when we leave and land on different planets, you'll have to sit with one of us.\" She said she was sorry but her face didn't really match her words, her expression looked more like guilty pleasure to you. But you let it pass and watch as she reaches around you to operate the controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The three felines start shouting technological space and code phrases to each other, you assume it's a preflight check. Before long though it gets quiet and the ship start to shudder and the sound of rocket engines fills the air and resonates through your bones. You look up and find an oval shaped window just above the work station, you watch as the faint outline of trees surrounding the ship fall away from the window. You feel your body being pressed into Tammy's although she doesn't seem to mind, you feel slightly uncomfortable being so close to someone you just me, especially when they're not even human! Eventually, the night sky in the window is replaced with a black star filled void, and the rattling ceases. You notice your body no longer feels so compressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So how'd we do? Did we make a clean getaway?\" Rita asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Several government vehicles are currently surrounding the area we launched from, and there's no doubt that they saw us leave.\" Tammy reported, \"Our stealth technology is advanced, but they found us because they know how to detect us now. We may not ever be able to go back without risk of detection upon entering the earths gravitational field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well I guess it doesn't matter, we won't be coming back here anyway\" Rita sighed, \"What about the ship? How is she doing, did that last minute takeoff damage anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We burned out a couple of relays but nothing more, they're an easy fix\" Riley replied as she confidently cracked her fingers, \"I can repair them when we land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good,\" Rita nodded, \"And how's our passenger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tammy looked down at you, you're face was blank. You were coming to grips with the fact that you were never going to see Earth ever again. Tammy waved a paw in front of your face to get your attention, when you seemed to come back to life she unbuckled you and slid you off of her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you okay?\" She asked as she tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, I'm just thinking... I'm never going to get to go back ever again...\" You replied. Just then she slowly stood up, forcing you to slide off of her lap and stand on your own two feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know it's a lot to take in...\" Tammy admitted. Before she could say anymore Riley walked over with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let's take your mind off of it, how about I take you...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Having a average build, the chopping of wood should help me if I need to chop a animal. My.. neutral nature would probably help me back away from an animal, or at the very least distract it. Making out unto the low grass, the lights and familiarity of my hometown fades out past the trees into the western woods. Theres a fair amount of trees with each other, then I see I've peft the water canteen and some foods for travel at home, but its to late to go back. Im making way through the trees, theres no.animals and the dim moonlight gives off a light glow against everything. Theres nothing but trees for maybe a mile, then I come to a small lake in the wood side, all around is more woodland. Theres definitely animals around here, all probably in slumber. So taking my coat and parka off, I bend down to the lake surface and get some fresh, cool water. Way to make the best of running away, I hope, but, a vibration rippling the surface almost un-noticeably stops me from getting ready to go again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems to move steadily, and nothing significant happens, losing my interest and getting up to leave. Then it shakes more, its a little freaky, and gives me the feeling im not alone. So I hastily start moving along the lakeside to get more southeast. Why's it freaky tonight? I dont know.

Then I just stop running, and it slows down almost with me. What the heck is this? Its triangle shaped, no lights or engines.. dark, it almost moves in on itself. Im mesmerized, its not doing anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lake goes calm, then from the middle of the ufo, a hatch opens and a bright blue light shines onto the grass. It illuminates around me, im tempted to go in the beam as I've already left my home. They must not be hostile or forcing me, as it just floats there. Why they're here, how'd.they come at the right time, I dont know, and without any other option to turn to in this world, I might as well go with them. Firstly putting my hand in the beam, it feels numb and almost pulls up with it. A tractor beam, obviously! The ufo sits there still, and I catch a glimpse of new lights turning on and moving alongside the triangles side. Withiut anymore wasting time, I decide to step into it, and immeditaly my body is pulled up and becomes numb, and a easy feeling stiff.. no freakout, I honestly feel better in the company of these extra terrestrials, and as im pulled to the lights source, my vision begins to fade.. and my body loses feeling..I wake</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My blackness is soon ended by me waking up, where am I!? Thats what I think, before opening my eyes to a lavish room with thick wool blankets and a pillow under my head. The room has a bookshelf, a flatscreen television, and carpeting.. next to me is a round, small window, which I cant see anything out of except colors flying past at immeasurable speeds, I stop looking as to avoid a headache. My body feel fine, and I see im still wearing the winter coat, and the parka is gone. My original jeans are there, but I have some weird new white-latex loose fitting tshirt on. Not sure where I am, its like home but isn't. So I stand up and stretch, hearing some of my arms and legs crack from fresh movement. How long was I out? Abducted by a ufo.. I need to find whoever is in this ship. A very grey door with no handles and a weird, black pad next to it is most obviously the choice. Coming to it and pressing on the pad, it goows green and a light green interface pops up. /HUMAN/OPTION/OpenDoor/CallAssistance/Memo/. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI choose Memo, and a long paragraph shows up. `Welcome to the Glinshoke, Human. You've been selected to be chosen as a abductee as our scouts or other species of `human` aboard our ship have found you a worthy canidate for living or recreation. You'll be givin the same basic rights as we would have for our own, with a few exceptions. You can read that later outside your temporary ships room, and if you feel as if you've not wanted another life, tell the council on our home planet with a appointment.` What the hell? Alien humans? `Feel free to roam the ship or call for assistance of any kind, guards are stationed around almost every hall during flight. Sincerely, the Kinum-Lux Crew.` im utterly mindblown and a little light headed from all this, and the interface pops up with the same chooseable options. The best I think is to get answers by exploring the ship, and press tbe OpenDoor option, just to have it `X` and go back to the interface. Really forcing me to ask them for assistance, it'd be best to do so anyways, it would give me the idea if who abducted me and where this ship is going. So I do so. A check appears, green, then the interface closes and goes to black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back down on my bed and waiting, I actually see a silver remote sitting on the bookshelf, and grab that. Pressing a ppwer button, the television on the wall flips on to some weird cartoon, a human like from our planet and a weird, kid-like catgirl with ears sticking from her hair and a bushy silver tail is running around him and poking him all over. What the heck? So weird.. I watch this go on for four minutes or so, the guy seeming a little confused but content.. as im about to switch it, the door slides open, and a curvaceous.. uh, a girl with fur sticking out from her thighhigh boots and a black jumpsuit which adds well to her `c` cup, and brownish-black fur sticking out of it from her shoulders, spiked in areas, her eyes a dark yellow and head hair a dark black with brown, layed down ears, and a human face with the exception of a small snout, all comes in vision at once. Almost incomprehensible to me, h- \"You called for assistance, human? I am Lovenider.\" She walks in and the door closes behind her, she looks at the tv show on as she comes to the bed. \"Hey? Feeling good?\" She ask, and im snapped out from oogling her and thinking about what the heck im into. \"Oh, I am.. my names Dave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turns around to sit down, I see her rather good-sized butt below her bushy.. black topped and brown botttomed tail. \"Like my tail? Im a german shepard mix.\" She noticed me looking, which saves me nervousness of asking her what she- mix? \"How can.. you talk? Where is this ship going?\" She smiles nonchalantly, showing her rather sharp teeth l, she noticed me looking at those to I think, as she leans in still doing so. \"We're split from your race by planet, and only a little by genetics. We're from space, all are..\" she whispers.. \"Plus, we've decided to start bringing humans to live on our planet because of earth`s dire conditions.\" Well, ok then. \"Uh, thats good.. I was running from home, how'd you spot me?\" I cant see anything except a zipper on the back of her jumpsuit, her perception.. I notice her micro eye movement almost barely! She turns her back a little towards me, smiling with some weird new joy. \"Our scanners picked you up away from other people, plus we wanted some fresh water. A win for both of us~\" Overall, I dont start to mind being abducted mysteriously, this female is rather alluring and the ship is alot more warm and comfortable than home. \"So I take it you called for assistance out of confusion?\" She asks. \"Partly, the door said I could feel free to explore but wouldn't let me leave.\" She looks suddenly confused for a second, I cant tell if its genuine or not. \"Probably the control room messing with you, wanting you to call assistance, hehe..\" she snickers, its a little cute, surprised to say. \"But anyway, what do you want to do? Assistance is available to anyone, I can leave, then you'll have to walk out with the captain and everyone later.\" Im feeling almost at home, beside from the nice fresh plant-selling air.. gives me an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This will continue as a one option story for now, writing to much plus other people very rarely adding makes the beginning choices more difficult to connect in the future. Plus I dont know how to connect and will just have a dead chapter sitting there if I do. Enjoy.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Im still shocked by advanced human-like species abducting me and bringing me through what must be hyperspace or something like it, so instead if walking around a big ship with other, maybe weirder creatures, I choose. \"I'll stay in here until we arrive, you can stay if you want.\" I dont have to excrete anything, which is nice for the moment, because I didn't see another door in here. Lovenider`s smile goes down to her lips, no longer bearing her teeth. \"I'll gladly wait until we arrive. It should be an hour or two.\" Probably the estimate time in their `control room`, I then stand up and look at some books on the bookshelf. Some are labled weirdly, like `Tales of a Albino` or `Glinshoke Geography &amp; Oceanography.` deciding neither, I look back to see her head move back up to mine, and give her smile back. What was she doing behind me, I dont know and probably wont want to. There is barely anything to do in this room, so I go back and sit almost a foot away from Lovenider. Her fur and figure, to say, are a little intriguing.. but I still feel my parents in my head, who knows what they've been doing with me gone, freaking out, or just dont care? \"Dave, will you miss your home?\" She asks, on que with my thoughts, it must show in my face. \"A little. My parents were ok, but dad constantly drinks and makes me do his work. My mom is almost never home.\"  I really dont know how to feel about being here with aliens, or if I stood on Earth, so for now I'll put it in the back of my mind. \"That sounds difficult, my parents were almost always home while doing their jobs.\" \"You have jobs?\" I ask. \"Gardening, planet-keeping, controlling autonomously-selecting miners in working condition, among a few.\" Uhm.. Ok. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds nice, but what is your people like?\" She flares up at this, her ears show to have a grey-white fuzz sticking inside of her ear. \"We are very diverse, think of almost any animal on your planet and we have a intelligent anthropomorphic counterpart of them, some rarer then others, some don't even exist as a normal `animal` to say so.\" At this point, I think im getting what kind of planet this may be like. Now, im interested in other things, like how they look so human and retain fur and snouts, but instead of getting into this with her, her body is what catches my interest. Its alluring, gives me a swarming hot feeling, must be arousal. So I avert back to her eyes from her curves, and Lovenider is leaning in with her head and leans in further, using her arms as support once getting within a few inches of me. \"Plus we've figured out cross-species mating as a natural thing, and im aware my body appeals to you, does it not?\" Sh.. she knew, im not really fearing her, but her perception of the smallest things amazes me even more, although it was obvious..  \"I'd say so.\" Lovenider does a close-eyed wide smile, showing me her once again sharp teeth. \"Ohh~ lets give the people in control a show, do you wanna?\" She shakes her chest a little, her tail is wagging fast behind her, body language wise, I think she wants to give them some `live entertainmenttainment.` and hell, I dont see why not now that im in space, going to a planet full of these furs. \"S-Sure.\" I stammer out, im a virgin.. going to lose my virginity to a space woman. \"The freshest are the best!\" Lovenider turns her back to me and throws her butt at me, which knocks me flat back onto the bed, and her bushy tails underside smothers my face. It smells like a rose-scented perfume, and her butt rubs against my chest in her bodysuit. Quickly im becoming aroused, and her hands grab onto my coats fur lining then going slowly toward my crotch. \"Animal fur, appropriate for your people..\"  with some kind of.. neutral-pitiful tone she says, but changes the situation back up as I feel her weight come off from me, and Lovenider lay on my body, face to face. A nice personality, figure, attitude, I feel myself getting harder and harder. Her thighs squeeze my pants bulge slightly, and she opens her mouth, her tounge and teeth both visible to me. \"Do want you want when you want, or I'll gladly take control~ Dave~.\" She  places her snout on my nose and licks my lips, incredibly weird but arousing nevertheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do what she recommended and place my hand on her head, bringing her lips to mine and entering hers. Feeling the curves of her sharp teeth before her tounge, she digs into the kiss and our tounges get into a passionately locked battle. Hers feels like wet sandpaper almost, her saliva and mind mixes and gives me a cherry taste. Running my left hand down her breast, then to her hips, I move up to her zipper and slowly move it down as we're still kissing. Lovenider pulls off of our kiss and my hand from her back, just to have her finish unzipping for me as she steps off the bed. This lets me see im fully hard, as she slips her bodysuit off of her along with her boots. Im givin sight of her breast, covered in grey fur all the way down to her pussy, which isn't visible due to her fur moving down infront of it. Her smile is of arousal and excitement as she moves back to me, while I dont waste time removing my pants and shirt, and coat, leaving me in my underwear. She comes back onto the bed and crawls on all fours to my dick, bringing it close to her mouth still under my boxers. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You know..\" she says, cutting off as she sniffles my dicks scent. \"Out of the few humans I've coerced to have intercourse, I've never heard one talk about his personal life as much as you have.\" She says as she brings her fur-tipped fingers around my boxers and slowly begins to stroke it around, looking at me while doing so. Im not sure if believing her in this one is the best. \"I dont really know wether it was best to go, but im here now and its definitely working better then being on Earth, in the dark wilderness or with my parents..\" Lovenider then pulls my boxers down, revealing my seven inch dick to her. She smiles and presses against it with her lips, then lightly licking my tip with her tounge. \"Smells like fresh skin, taste like sweat, your definitely a virgin~\" she says, but im confused in as to how she smells it. \"Right- uh, nice that you know.\" Her smile is mischievous, as she starts to lick below my tip and around it, it feels blissfully good, she stares me in the eyes as she does it, making my tip and a little of my base wet with her saliva. Now she tries to start speaking, but instead of letting her do so, I place my hands onto her head and quickly sit up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting force onto her head and making her take my dick into her mouth, Lovenider is only a little shocked, and continues to slowly move from my base-bottom to my dicks mid-section. It feels hot inside of her mouth, and her long tongue wraps around it in multiple ways every few minutes. From bottom to top, moving her mouth around me hastily and keeping eye contact almost the entire time.. her tail wags slowly and her ears occasionally twitch, she doesn't seem to mind my hand on her head. Suddenly her lips suck against my dick, and her tounge vigorously sucks around every inch of me. \"What a show-\" I mumble, and she curls up into a smile before coming to get me on edge. Sucking a little slower and pushing me there, I push her mouth onto my dick even more and release my load into her, her tounge coming up to my base and taking it all in. She coughs a little but does so well, swallowing alot of it. She pulls up with  my cum in her mouth, and moves her pussy onto my chest, able to feel the wetness through her fur, and the soft, warm skin of her pussy lips against me. \"Aren't you straight-forward?\" She says jokingly, moving her thighs around my face and squishing me against her warm fur. Now then moving her pussy over my face, I see her aroused smile and dark black fur around her lips, before she lowers her pussy atop my lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIm finding my own mouth taste her juices, which are unexplainable to me. Its nothing like I've tasted before, and her quiet moans are enough to slowly get me going again.. I dont know wether to be weirded out or amazed, and just continue focusing on these feeling of arousal and excitement. Her hands suddenly grab the back of my head and force it deeper aganst her pussy, and I start to use my tounge to dig inside of her warm layered insides and her furry crotch presses against my eyes and nose, making me breathe in the scent of her strawberry-smelling fur. \"Such..~\" she doesn't finish and lowers her body onto me while im still diggin into her and biting her vulva lightly, setting her arms on the bedframe and now slowly thrusting her hips. Im amazed I can breathe steadily with her body against my face, and bring ny arms up to her ass and feel it.. her skin is smooth and her ass is plump and jiggly. \"Oh.. harder!\" She nearly yells and forces her body weight onto my mouth, forcing my head against her as hard as she can. Then a torrent of her cum comes flowing out of her and into my mouth, and she leans herself back while forcing me even deeper, im surprised my gums and mouth are capable of such dimensions! I swallow it quickly to avoid choking on it, tasting nearly bland but sweet, Lovenider moves her body off of me and get back in her laying-position, this time very slowly rubbing against my dick as she lowers her head to mine, one arm for support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assertive, a nice trait..\" she smiles as she says this, bearing her teeth to me and purposefully moving them close to my eyes. \"Having such guts with a sharp-teethed woman such as myself.\" Her tone is calmly amused, then her smile becomes wide once again as I see her raising her ass over my crotch. \"Lasted not even five minutes in my mouth, how long with my other `lips`?\" She taunts me well, I can barely hold back a snicker at her teaseful attitude. Lowering herself onto me, I watch as she's like a animal in heat and looks at my dick with a good focus, probably not caring if the `control` people are turned on or not. She happily pushes me into her, shaking her hips against my dicks tip while slowly moving herself down. \"Ah- bearing children isn't my goal yet..~\" her eyes dart toward me in a evil, but playful look, as Lovenider forcefully pushes my dick into her, surrounding me in pulsing waves of her muscles and barely moving upwards then back down. This.. feels wonderful! Im barely able to not twitch from this feeling, she looks down at me with a almost triumphant look. \"No man can withstand a shepards pussy..\" then starting to move up and down faster, I can feel myself going on edge really quickly. She moans lightly as she does so, letting out moderately heavy gasps and as im close to cumming, she stops with me still inside her. \"Hehe.. I still want more. Not yet~\" she taunts me.. but im not in control as much anymore. Moving her body side to side, already being  close to releasing, I cant hold back anymore and she gets off just in time, my cum flying all over her breast and crotch area and into her fur. Lovenider laughs lightly as I do, me stuck in a small trance of escasty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the entertainment worked better for both of us, huh?\" She says joyfully, wiping my cum off of her chest fur and licking it off of her furry fingers.. uh, I just had sex with a furry alien, what a trip this took from running from home. \"More or less? That did feel wonderful.\"  She snickers a little after finishing, as my dick slowly returns to its limp state. \"If you, or control wants, I can be your personal assistant when we get back to Glinshoke for a little while.\" Her smile is mischievous once again, as she is probably thinking of more ways to make situations.. sexual. Not that I dont mind, its just that I dont think my stamina will allow for to much of that despite my old woodwork. \"I'll probably like that once im settled.\" Her smile is wide, as she slowly gets off of me, her bottom-thigh fur rubbing against my dick. \"I hope so.\" Now she reaches for her bodysuit, and I get that we're done for now. Putting my boxers on and my pants, she brings ber bodysuit up over her lightly cum-stuck crotch and body, to move her back to me with her zipper down to her tail. \"Try not to get my fur stuck.\" She asks, and I take precaution in trying not to, rubbing her back fur down and hearing a very small purr? Uh, then zipping it up to her neck, she takes a seat next to me once more and smiles.. I still dont know wether to be weirded out. \"That must've felt nice for the both of us, and those control yiffers watching~\" she laughs after this, and leans against me. \"Id rather just wait in here until you have to go through introduction, that ok?\" She asks, but I didn't have a problem in the first place. \"Sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so we sit there, for an hour or maybe more, sitting in peace in this warm room. Its nice assistance..</span></div></div>",

I dont know how long it was, but im awoken by the door opening and Lovenider jumping of the bed in slight shock. A six foot four.. woman, wearing a loose black robe with a weird insignia on her `B` cup breast, her only visible skin being scaled light green and some sharp ones going parallel to eachother that are a darker green, then I see a wide tail with even lighter top scales, and a dark green underside to it. \"Lovenider, Enjoy assistance? Your assistance is needed in the mess hall.\" She tells her, Lovenider waves bye to me as she slips past this woman, who is most likely their captain. She walks in after she leaves, I get a view of her red wide eyes and  back length neon green hair. She has a tanned complexion.. but I then start ti hastily put the white shirt back on, and stand up as she comes to the bed and crosses her arms. \"Nice show you two put on, now comeon with me, we're departing.\" I follow her into the halls which go up to fourteen feet, the door we came out of is eight, in comparison. The halls are lit but built in lights against the sides, and we turn down a longer hall which opens into a bigger area, the entry bay.  Her tail grazes my chest, and I see her look back a little aswe go into this room, two white armored guards wearing helmets looking at us. There's weird, small triangular ships in this bay, and as I look past them, a guard opens a massive sliding-door bay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIm blinded, ouch- a bright light encompassed my vision before she walked infront of me. \"You'll like this.\" She says, and as my vision comes back to me, im greeted to a massive rampway going through trees whose leaves cover it, letting a fair amount of sunlight in. At the end of it I can see what looks like a glass roofed building, and as we walk out, I see a few.. four tailed fox-eared but human looking woman, and one six tailed male, going into the ship. This is weird.. the air smells fresh, there are male monster humans, the planets sun is big and red, kind if cool, to. I then get out of my thinkin state by the captain pushing me forward. \"Comeon, thats nothing to be mesmerized over.\" I follow her down the path, and being abducted enough to mesmerize me..  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as we get to the building, there are six more paths that come from west? And behind the building is a cliff, that drops to a massive city, with numerous football field length domes surrounding almost the entire perimeter, and mile high brick-like buildings, with protrusions of green and what look like wide windows on it, tall maybe mile-high shiny, tall buildings, and my spaceships of many sorts on launch pads! The distance is scattered with  forest, lakes, rivers, and another city in thedistance! This is a freaking adventure.. \"Nice huh? I like looking at the capital better, comeon.\" This lizard woman walks into the building and I follow behind her, and it turns out that im the only real human here. Im shocked to see they didn't grab more, and there are alot of different looking men and woman anthro thingies sitting and talking about things. We come to the counter and theres a male wolf-looking, snout and all, there. \"Going where?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MS3, Capital.\" She says, and the floor below us opens and we fall into black. Instantly the floor comes up, and the environment switches just like that. \"What the hell?\" How'd that even work? \"Technology.\" She simply replies, while we are now inside some weird office, and the room we're in has a huge window and behind it a dome building, the door behind me is blackwith a doorknob? She takes seat behind a large desk, which holographic screen of white are visible with the black walls. A bookshelf and another key-coded door are to the fartbest right..  </span></div></div>",

I figure it, and press it in my arm while presses a button on the top. It fills up with a small cartridge, and I give it back to her, and it's put away.a thing appears on her screen looks like a ID, and sure enough a whiir is head and she hands me a warm slip of plastic with my name, IDN number?, blood type and name. And a picture of me face, looking confhsed. She gives me a wallet to, which has weird wuarter coins in it, about 100. I take my thirty dollars out of my pocket and put it in there, she doesn't say anything. \"You can get a house for cheap being a extraterrestrial, so enjoy getting employment and good luck, see the council if you ever feel like this isn't good for you.\" She's straightforward, and brings back the second thoughts, I'll try to enjoy this for now, not forever, I'll see my parents again. The floor under me opens, and it goes black again, and poof, the environment changes and im outside the building, in a park, next to a big fountain with a really massive looking wyvern-human beast, and a plaque in about 9 other language's. \"In Hynomicalx we believed, and the wars ended.\" Thats weird, but gives a slight glimpse of history into this world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing some young dog-human ears and tails, and full furry creatures.. this is a utopia for interspecies between lucky humans and aliens, I came from running in wilderness to this. I leave the park, and decide to get on to finding employment as a good option, I'd like to explore the planet and set up. The streets are massive walkways, and there are small booths at intersections, about ten, people come in and out of them. Occasionally ships fly above, some massive and others small and quick. I go to a buildng labled \"Terrestrial Production Industries.\" I decide to enter it, its the entrance to the dome. Theres a woma wearing all white, long sleeved, and has a dark face with what look like bunny ears, and flood~ \"Welcome, I guess you've come here for work, huh?\" \"How did you guess that?\" She laughs. \"You got on the update list quick.\" Eh, shoot, I wonder if that control watching was a video now. \"Im here for a job, can I get one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI go to the desk, there's not really a seat and twin doors that look like they slide, they're black and the walls white. \"I could get you a appointment, but since your a human, and my bosses like new people, ane they're here... I'll let you.\" Pressing something under the desk, the twin doors open and the doors open to a carted red room, with fancy lights and brown lined wallpaper, it has multiple doors and a master staircase leading into the dome. I see some dragon woman, a real one with all scales, sharp teeth, wearing suits that fit them well and their scaly tails. Some are like the one earlier, and then I see a group of them..</span></div></div>",

The dragon man leans on the wall, and looks like he got a cup of water out of nowhere. \"Lucky you came, good timing~\" She opens the suitcase, and it reveals ten vials of a crystal-goo substance, and four long strands of a red line, they smell like peaches. \"Here Joea.\" She throws the man one of the vials, which he opens the cork and pours it into his drink. She gives me three, and they take three, and I decide to try this out, this is freaking weird but im tripped out. Taking the cork off and drinking one, a rush of color comes to my vision, and I feel my bodies every movement, along with a numbing buzz, too.. no sensory overloadong.. this is weird. Since they probably mean for this to be my work, I open the other two and drink them, intensifying things and making me lose my sense of balance, while sitting down? Ugh, those two drink theirs and the cat woman next to me lays against my shoulder suddenly, as does Klonaw.. I think this is some interesting work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get a good view of their cleavage, and feel both if their arm furs covering my chest. \"My friend next to you is Loenoe, its nice to get a good worker like you tay, Dave~\" I get an idea of what might happen, and Loenoe grabs those three taffy like strands and gives me and Klownaw one. I eat it, and I can feel my body warming and spinning, and my dick swarm hot. Klownaw moves ontop of me and sinks me into the bean bag chair, her breast hanging over me as she comes to my face level, her friend smothering my cheek with her breast, I think her bra straps are being pulled off by her. \"You can go and get some yourself, Joea, have fun.\" \"Thanks miss.\" He leaves the room, and the two begin to intensify, Loenoe slipping her dress onto the floor and showing her puffy body, a darker grey spot going down with six nips, hah..? Her thighs thick, she wuickly covers my eyes with her breast, and I feel weight ontop of me lift to my crotch more. \"You'll like this one, laster you long the better you get `employed`.\" When those soft breast lift off me, I instantly feel her ass rub against my hafdening pants and her breast cover my mouth, she presses hard into me, rubbing her hands under my shirt and then to my pants..</span></div></div>",

I can feel her wet pussy through my pants, whatever this drug is doing.. its definitely unlike anything I've experienced. \"There is quite a lot to look on at, huh Dave?\" she snickers and my face is brought to Loenoes, and she invades mine. Her smooth, scaly tounge locks mine, and the cool air surrounds around my dick, the buzzing warmth gets more intense as its exposed out of my boxers. Klonaw strokes my dick and licks around it lightly, looking at me.. im getting hard quick, and Loenoe looks like she's fingering herself, ah.. damn, this is hotter, I take my shirt off, and Loenoe licks her little nose while looking at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlonaw likes stroking and licking me, and she starts to lick my base and tip in a circular motion. She then moves ontop of it while its at my full length, pressing it against my crotch and grinding against it with her wet, furry pussy. The warmth is killing me, and my nerves tingle pleasureably, then Loenoe climbs behind me, putting her thighs against my head and close to her pussy, surrounding me in warmth. She shakes her hips a little.. then she squeezes her thighs against my cheeks, letting out small moans, the both of them now. \"He's so calm, must be one of the new people~\" Loenoe says, and Klonaw stops grinding against my wet dick and begins to get a good place on it, moving my tip around inside of her and bringing me to what seems like the edge almost every time. Now she slowly thrust down, and moans a little loud as I go all the way in. Her insides are tight and squeeze me in pulses, then she starts moving back and forward while moaning and hanging her mouth open a little, its incredibly sexy. Loenoes fingers come behind my head and she starts to finger herself, leaning forward a little and encompassing me in her heat. My dick tingles greatly and Klonaw smiles evily, then starting to move up and back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cant hold it anymore and I cum inside of her, she stops and moves all the way down shaking her hips and kind-of milking me out. When she pulls off, Loenoe moves her legs off of my cheeks and moves to where she was, as she sets her dripping pussy on my lips quickly. It taste sweet and slightly bitterish, and her moans come past the noise of her pussy squelching. Then I feel myself being stroked and Loenoe cup my tip with her mouth, tracing around it before she stops this after a few minutes, and starts sucking me off and getting me harder again. I cant see this happening but feel it l, I really am enjoying this employment better then I expected. Shit- I feel my dick coming close to another climax, and sure enough she intensifies her efforts by suction cupping her lips against me, and I release another load, this time into her mouth. She starts stroking me and elongates my ejaculation, swallowing every drop of it. While I was eating out Klonaw this entire time, its like I cleaned her. \"Get it good, Loenoe, he's eating us up.\" She says to her friend as she moves to the position to where she was, and places her thighs against my head while looking down lustfully, feeling her warm fur.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like we're eating him up~\" she says devilishly, while lowering her pussy quickly on my dick, her moans are loud and she grits her teeth a little, this turns to a wide pleasured smile as she slowly moves, her really tight insides making me hard again fast. I cant handle this longer, my libido is not the best.. \"You've been so silent, just taking our advances well, I kind of like it.\" Klonaw says to me.. heh- \"A..hh I really do.\" I mummer out, and my dick twinges up again and Loenoe immeditaly pops off, bringing her lips back to my mouth and stroking me more again, she's really into it anx glances between my dockband me, blowing me to prolong it again. Once she's done and pulls off, she climbs onto me and sets her head below mine, layong on my body with my slowly-retreating hardon between her calves. Givin time to relax.. their both silent for a minute. \"Done your job well, would you like to go for more, for more? Or just take what you can get, our contact information to.. Hehe..\" she's probably serious, I dont mind either. \"I'll take whats earned, I'd like your contact info..\" \"Awe- well we'll look forward to when you `want` us.\" So the drugs taken still gives me a buzz, and we're relaxing here feeling those effects for maybe an hour or so. Then Klonaw moves off from behind me and I hear a drawer or something open, and Loenoe grinds my dick a little. \"Nice meeting ya, Dave, can't wait for more `employment` time..\" she says teasingly before moving off of me, I decide to follow them and start to get dressed, pushing my limp rod past my underwear as they put on dresses, Klonaw handing me 200 of those weird silver coin things. I add those to what I have, and did they wash themselves? I dont know nor care, and once they start to leave I follow them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have some things to do, like really real work.. so see you later.\" Klonaw tells me as they walk down the upstairs path, entering another room and going out of sight, and Loenoe winks to me. Huh.. I still feel quite hot in a good way, and maybe going out and seeing what this currency is worth fits well.. </span></div></div>",

Four separate ones shine erratically as I turned to look, the sky barely shining in the woods. O- blinded! \"Over here! Dave!?\" The lights then were moving <i>quick</i> at me- \"No! I'm don-\" a high 'whir' sound when they got close appeared, my eyes hurt! \"Get it! Move!\" Wo- ... bolts of lightning whirring past me from these assailants. A presence appeared behind me, then when I turned to see the black sky I was engulfed by something black- my sens- hyperventilating! What's happening, this soft spongy shit doesn't feel right! ... <br>\r\nThen the sudden Jerk of my body ejected me from this black, <b>liquid thing.</b> Whatever it is, I look up and see it immediately fly into the air, I'm at the bottom of the cliff on grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis entity started dodging lightning bolts firing from the cliff above, distant voices distorted as it approached the cliff quickly. It- \"RAEI-EE--\" a loud pitched shriek emitted from it and it's shape encircled the clifftop, I can't believe I'm seeing this. Four rod shape weapons were ejected from the mass and then it darted at them, a deep black flash, blinding me!? <br>\r\nLooking around in a slight panic- is it going to kill me!? What happened to those people! 'Human, you are safe.' <br>\r\nA serene-like voice spoke to me mentally, weird but only slightly relieved, I just wanted to run off, not this. 'Can you see?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! What did you do!?\" Stumbling around some, feeling the ground under my feet and reaching my hands forward, this smooth black sponge substance grew lightly around my hands.. it was cool and slightly relaxing to say the least, bu- 'Protect me and you, humans weren't friends.' Then this pencil-like vision takes my actual vision, my hand rest on what looks like a woman's palm. <br>\r\nThe way I perceive this, her skin is dark but nothing goes above her shoulder but darkness and drooping blackness. \"What did you do to them?\" I ask. 'I took them somewhere. Not dead.' ... I swear this thing read my mind. 'But you are here, human. I came to you for a reason.' This vision slowly expands, the arm and slight torso of a naked tall woman taking up what I can see. \"What?\" <br>\r\n'My species is in trouble. Earth people do not welcome us, we are being destroyed.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed to help?\" Then the rest came, a woman almost seven foot tall with shoulder length hair, pearly white eyes and flawless bodily features except for the scrapes in this 'vision', mesmerizing lights behind her spinning slowly and changing shades of grey and black. 'I can enter you. You can unlock yourself, but have to cooperate.' Cooperation at this point seems fair. \"No deaths is all I ask.\" <br>\r\n'No deaths. I wish that were the same for hunters.' Now this is a critical decision, what this <i>being</i> is and why exactly it needs my help is still mostly hazy..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The coolness slowly begins to engulf my back and this being in my vision fades away smiling, these lights becoming brighter and my spine shivering from base to tip. <br>\r\nEverything becomes weightless after it engulfs my feet and works it's way slowly up my chest, this spongy texture feeling like a second skin as it starts to come to my neck. 'Do not resist.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA- it engulfs my head and my vision becomes black, oa- it's entering my mouth and nose! Don't resist.. even I feel like I'm burning lightly on the inside. After this substance enters my mouth the rest absorbs itself into my skin, my vision slowly returning for me to see the night in almost perfect clarity.. I feel lighter, easy to move. 'Human, I have to show you first.'<br>\r\nMy body seemingly moves itself, but I <i>know</i> it's this woman. It's slightly wobbly when I try to move against it so I don't, walking into the woods closer to the cliff. 'We came here long ago. Your people..' My vision started to fade black, this entity showing me a vision of the Pyramids of Giza, Stonehenge.. weird.. South American ruined pyramids, and some weird pyramid covered in snow out in the Artic. <br>\r\n'Prevented disaster from yourselves. Then when you could do it yourselves, they turned on us.'  <br>\r\nChanting.. chanting against these entities people were, so many chants I don't know what to think. 'We were betrayed. Us used against us.' Orbs flying and exploding in the air, many crashing and evaporating.. what happened to this race? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We hid. Wait, now we come out and humans want us more.' The vision- a electromagnetic gun. I thought this stuff would just be fiction, it sure looks like it. \"Where do those taken go?\" I can't help but ask. <br>\r\n'I can't show you now.' <br>\r\nThe sound of wind blast my vision back- a deep black star spotted sky, I'm falling! 'Learn.' The faint voice speaks to me, and turning myself down I see Stonehenge coming close quick! Stop- I give my body a mental cue and I go numb, freezing for a second before bolting back down again- no whiplash.  <br>\r\nThis being makes me feel confident though I'm new to to this, my coat flies off and a light shined from around the dark ring of Stonehenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStop! I say, when I'm close to the ground! .. <br>\r\nMy speed drastically fell once I neared the middle, lights appearing on the ring to slowly rise a dim white and connect at the top.

What are we doing?\" Asking in curiosity now, the screen vanished into the wall and she swiftly walked to me over the brown carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Induction things, so, all you have to do is agree to what future terms you'll be givin from me and so on..\" I've already come this far. \"I agree.\" She stopped just a few inches from me, and that really made me flustered. \"Good!

Grief- I agreed and THAT`S first, \"For?\" Bringing her finger up to her suits collar, she pressed it and it began to fold down from there. \"Treating a inductee to me, I was told your my subordinate until further notice.\" As her suit came close to her breast, her fur went all the way down and I followed and began removing my jacket, parka and such.

I saw her face of ecstasy and it made me feel the same, her wetness now coming through more &amp; soaking my underwear and making me closer to release, I was surprised feeling her breast milk on my mouth and then tas- like weird egg nog, I wasn't opposed so much to that weird taste, but didn't go for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arched her back and pressed hard on me, almost making me cum but she stopped and went down to her knees before I could.

Im at six inches, and it feels blissful with the allure of her and my endorphins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her tail lightly and moved up, slowing down and grinning at me. \"I really hope your assigned in my troop.\" Maybe it was space military I got into, but its something new. \"I'll try if im not.\" Glenhope looked excited when I said that, wagging her tail faster. -Quickly moving her breast back and moving my dick into her mouth- it felt warm and a wonderful squishy.

This is alot of teasing, good grief, I can't say she's not charming though. Her tounge started moving around my length and she only went up &amp; down by inches, making me closer <i>really</i> quick. Putting my hands on her cheeks and hair some, I helped myself as she went a little wide-eyed, moving her up-- then I came in her mouth, feeling the straight relaxing release and let go. Groaning lightly, she softly sucked on me and swallowed what big load I gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done swallowing, she moved her head back up. \"Sweet taste, so~ can you last another go?\" The way she spoke was making me feel relaxed, and of course with how this was I could still keep going for another go or two, mm-hm.. what'd- \"I sure can, can you?\" She moved onto the bed and jumped back first onto it, opening her legs slightly, her pussy dripping and those folds looking <i>tight</i>.

And children who are already tasting rebellion and having one small adventure who have read all sorts of books featuring brave, rebellious children who run away to have adventures when grown-ups aren't looking...Those are the most curious children of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd only be gone for a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd peek around the address on the letter for a little bit, then come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what he told himself as he pedaled his bike to the abandoned studio, cold night wind stinging his cheeks and whipping his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Alvin reached the studio, the familiar tales of rebellious children and adventure were turning into stories of ghosts, and monsters that ate kids. The studio loomed in front of him, dark and dismal. Alvin let his bike coast to a stop as he stared up at it, scarcely believing the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew his uncle had worked at an animation studio, decades before he was born. He knew the Isabelle cartoons were made here \u2013 Uncle Paul had some of the cartoons in his house, and some of the original merchandise. He'd never allowed him out here of course, and he really didn't like to talk about his days out here, but he knew about it all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Isabelle cartoons were about Isabelle the Space Fox, an alien in future Earth trying to find her way back home. The show was me with generally positive reviews from the public, the narrative, characters, and presentation were lauded for it\u2019s delivery of normally sensitive topics. But on the other end of the spectrum, critics were critical of the Isabelle herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause it was technically a kids show, the fact that Isabelle was always portrayed as a hyper voluptuous fox was the most controversial part of the series. She always wore a white, spandex spacesuit that only drew more attention to her curves, and always managed to get into scenarios that took advantage of her body style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Alvin, he didn't care honestly how the character was drawn, he just liked her. Brave, smart, funny, he actually told his Uncle that she was his idol once. He didn't stop laughing for a whole three minutes. But despite what Alvin thought, the studio soon had to close its most beloved franchise down, and everything was downhill from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just...didn't know it looked like this. Falling apart in some places, holes in the rooftop, windows boarded up haphazardly, some spots had to be reinforced with even more planks of wood... All in all, it looked more like a haunted house than an animation studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind blew ominously, gliding between some of the wood and making whistling sounds. The studio groaned loudly, as if in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvin should have been more afraid than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something compelled him to drop the kickstand and venture closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was the fact he'd come this far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe the adventure stories were overpowering the ghost ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put her hands on the gate, pushing gently. It flew open, squeaking loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of the loud squeak, a light suddenly appeared in one of the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that was what compelled him to run inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoooaaaaa!\" Alvin whispered, letting the door close behind her. The studio was dimly-lit inside, casting an orange-brown glow to everything, and the halls were only in slightly less disrepair than the outside. Splatters of ink were on the floor and wall here and there, thick pipes swam in and out of the wood like a sea-serpent. The ceiling was hiiigh above Alvin's head, making him feel like Jack in the giant's castle. His astonished cry echoed around him, the floor creaked as if in answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was all by himself in here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only had one thing to say to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooooool!\" He shouted, fists clenched at his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ooool...ooool...ool...ol...\" His echo answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help the delighted laugh from bubbling out of his throat as he did a quick, jogging dance in the entryway. Who cared what the outside of the studio looked like now, the inside was awesome! And so much room and and and all to himself and and oh wow, he could bring his bike or his skates in here and go nuts with all this floor space and...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And Isabelle cutouts and posters on the walls and some really old-looking stuff too that he didn't bother investigating, he could have so much fun in here! Heck, he could grab some snacks and a blanket or something when he went home and then come back and make this place his hideout!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWouldn't that be a great story for when school resumed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvin finally took a few steps down the hall, looking around as he moved. Now that his echo had faded, the halls were quiet again. The only other sound was the squeaks his shoes made, the slightest creak of the floor when he pressed all his weight on one foot. And those were small sounds, so they didn't count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused in front of a cardboard Isabelle, smiling jovially as if to welcome him in. With a matching grin of his own, Alvin held his hand at the top of his head, then moved it to the cardboard Isabelle's. \"Hey, you're as taller'n me!\" He laughed. \"Uncle Paul always said you'd be shorter.\" He stood back, briefly waving at the cutout. \"Well, bye!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs he walked, taking in the scale and scope of the building, scattering pieces of paper in her wake, he wondered why his uncle had hidden the letter. Did he not want her to come here? He couldn't imagine why \u2013 this place was amazing! It was old and falling apart in places, but that only made it more interesting. Grown ups always worried about the silliest things, Alvin thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attention moved to some of the posters for Isabelle cartoons. There weren't many \u2013 well, there were many posters, but not much variety. Some had splatters of ink on them, but where they'd come from, he didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nclang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Alvin stopped, looking around. \"Hello?!\" he shouted down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer. Even the clanging noise had stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\" Alvin paused for a second, then shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis adventure continued, taking him further down the hall and around a few corners. As he moved through the rooms, he found a few desks and chairs \u2013 maybe one of them had been his uncle's! He could grab a chair and bring it back as a souvenir, maybe. It wasn't stealing if nobody was using it, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm, but how would he bring it back on his bike? Maybe if he tied a bit of rope to the seat, or the back wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, rope might work! There had to be some here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvin turned around, walking past the cardboard Isabelle that stood off to the side of the doorway. There was another room at the end of the hall. He could look there first and<br>\r\n<br>\r\nclang clang clang clang clang<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvin froze in the door, heart jumping into hid throat, blood turning to ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was in the room?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nThere was a spaceship in the animation studio. There was literally no other way to describe what Alvin was seeing. The room, which at first perspective looked rather small to Alvin as he was running down the hallway, was actually a massive hanger room, with a high vaulted ceiling supported by steel beams that contrasted with the normally wooded structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spaceship looked like the classic, old-timey spaceships from the old days. The flying saucer model. A stainless metallic disk with a large bulge coming from the center on both ends, supported off the ground by (presumably) extendable shafts. There were no windows, but neon lights flickered through the metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nclang clang clang clang clang<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banging was louder now. Alvin jumped, hand flying to his chest as he whirled around, looking everywhere \u2013 anywhere \u2013 but the strange device that offered no explanation.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-lo?! Hello, can you hear me?!\" burbled a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\" Alvin gasped, trying to sound as brave as he was ten minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause, and then he saw it. A small piece of black piping near the wall started rattling and bulging, ink squirting between the screws. \"Hello?! Paul, izzat you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul? As in Uncle Paul?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nuh-uh!\" Alvin shook his head so hard his hair whipped around and stung his cheeks. \"'m Alvin!\" He probably shouldn't be talking to a pipe, but the sudden change in atmosphere had him too startled and frightened to think rationally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Oh!\" The voice sounded disappointed at first, then ecstatic. \"Alvin! Alvin, you gotta get me outta here! You gotta lemme out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvin moved closer, giving a wide berth to the candles on the floor. He still refused to look at the massive spaceship in the room, and the flashy lights it illuminated onto the walls. \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There should be a wrench around here somewhere. Hurry and find it, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...a wrench...?\" Alvin mumbled. Where would he even know where to look? The place was huge, he knew that already-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLANG<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvin shrieked and whirled around. (Behind him, the gurgling voice yelped \"What is it?!\") Nothing. With a loud gulp, Alvin moved towards the door, still not looking at the metallic saucer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wrench was on the floor just outside, at the feet of a cardboard cutout. Alvin couldn't believe his luck! Quickly grabbing it off the floor, he ran back inside to the pipe. \"I found one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was quick...Okay! Unscrew those screws for me \u2013 righty-tighty, lefty-loosie!\" it added, perhaps sensing Alvin's brief confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really shouldn't be here. He should have turned and run for the exit the second he saw the spaceship \u2013 Isabelle\u2019s ship, he realized, the exact same one from the cartoon, he barely recognized it in real life... - he should have hopped on his bike and pedaled home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut children were curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially empathetic children who heard a voice calling for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screws were a bit rusty, and the edges were caked in dried ink. When Alvin tried to unscrew it, at first all he got got for her trouble were some loud squeaks of protest, and very sore hands. But he kept trying. He grit her teeth, propped one foot against the wall, the chair he was standing on threatening to give way as he made it shake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Isabelle cutout fell in the doorway, almost distracting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvin paused for one moment, catching his breath and wiping his red hands on his shirt. \"Okay,\" he grumbled. \"Once more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe braced his foot against the wall, one hand on the pipe. He turned as hard as he could-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-the screw gave way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud cry of victory, Alvin hurriedly unscrewed it the rest of the way until it fell with a clatter that echoed around the room. \"I got it!\" he shouted, hopping backwards from the chair. \"You-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of his sentence was lost in a loud gshshshssssh! of ink as the pipe suddenly moved. It was a bit like when the gutters broke, as the pipe suddenly swerved out diagonally, spilling ink in a thick waterfall to the floor. Alvin had to leap back to avoid getting drenched, though some of it splattered over his shoes. But that didn't matter \u2013 he just stared, transfixed and a little horrified, as finally, one large black lump was pushed from the pipe and fell with a splut to the middle of the puddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alvin was about to get a better look, the blob shuddered violently, then surged forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then two long arms attached with paws stretched out of it, followed by a head of a fox...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd...this really was the only way to describe it: Isabelle pulled herself out of the ink and into the shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, no, that\u2019s not exactly how it happened. After she climbed out of the puddle of ink, she was pure black and almost formless. After a few seconds, however, the black was replaced with the white of stretchy spandex, and her face became more defined, as well as her curves. Especially her curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath her folded arms lay a SHELF of tit meat, each globe must have been  genetically modified watermelons. Her crossed arms didn\u2019t allow those puppies enough room, and they were visibly squashed into her chest a bit, distorting the fabric of her stretchy suit. The outline of a marvelous bra was visible under the added strain. Despite being abnormally large, the bra still appeared to be a touch too small for the busty petite before him, though it was hard to gauge with her arms in the way. Damn, she was unbelievably huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her rear ended was not far behind. Each cheek was absolutely planetary, the size of beach balls on the fox\u2019s slender frame. The mighty tush wobbled and jiggled like a pond in which a stone had been cast. The fat spheres were snugly contained within the stretchy white suit, but did nothing to hide their enormity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remained on her hands and knees for a bit, coughing and sputtering violently. Black drops of ink spilled from her mouth to hit the floor, which soon gave way to actual spittle, she wiped at her mouth with her arm. \"Th-thank...you...\" she gasped like a woman saved from drowning. \"I dunno how long I've been in there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvin just stared, his eyes growing steadily wider. \"I...Isabelle...?\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'s'me!\" Isabelle looked down at him, her trademark grin appearing for a second-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-only to vanish, a cry of dismay escaping as she saw what was in front of her. \u201c...hey\u201d she said slowly. \u201cYou're not Paul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I know that.\u201d Alvin said apprehensively. \u201cMy name is Alvin, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d she started to move towards him, her massive chest and backside swaying in motion with her gait. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long, i was so sure that he would be the one to come back...and you look so much like him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-y-you must be talking about my Uncle P-paul.\u201d Alvin said getting more and more freaked out by the turn of events unfolding by the second. \u201cHe\u2019s my dad's b-brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, this isn't what was supposed to happen! Paul was supposed to help me and I-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle's elevated speech was slowly faded, replaced by wet coughing. Alvin cautiously approached her, reached to touch her side. He almost brushed up against her massive breast meat in the process. \"Maybe...?\" he whispered. \"M-Maybe i could help you instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle stilled. \"Of course,\" she whispered. \"I may not have who i wanted, but I do have someone to take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle was already moving behind Alvin. Without waiting permission, she scooped up the thirteen year old boy in her arms \u2013 easy, since this Isabelle was much taller than Alvin himself was  \u2013 and carried him against her massive globes. Like a little kid getting a piggyback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t worry,\" he was saying, propping her chin on Alvin's shoulder. \"I know this is a lot to take in right now, but know this--you get to help your uncle by clearing some nasty differences that had come between us. Alright, kiddo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...Okay!\" Alvin's voice began apprehensive, but ended confident. She reached down to hold Alvin up better, nodding as a grim look of determination appeared on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shouldn't have been here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe should never have come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe should have turned and run back to his uncle's as soon as he saw the spaceship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shouldn't have taken those first few steps out of the room, a living breathing cartoon carrying him. (\"I'm kinda glad a kid's the first friendly face I see 'round here. I always liked kids...\"). He shouldn't have gotten mixed up in all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut children are naturally curious</span></div></div>",
