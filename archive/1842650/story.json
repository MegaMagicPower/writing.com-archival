            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The smells are mostly familiar: the musk of hounds and beasts of burden, the acrid smoke of pine in their torches. The pinguid stench of greed and lust for fortune in their sweat comes to you just as easily. However, there is a tinge of something new mixed in to these scents- it's sharp like a spice, and stinks like the garlic that grows over the mountain range, but heavier, angrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waste no time and unfurl your wings, plunging gracefully from the cliff side. In a dynamic arc, you ride the winds high into the air and let out a shrill roar; a signal to the older dragons of danger approaching. The sun's light has not yet ducked under the mountain tops to the west, and the human hunters spot you almost immediately, pointing and drawing their weapons. You circle high above them- hopefully out of arrow range, yet daring them to try- and wait for the clan. Time passes and you watch the hunters light up fires and spread out at the edge of a clearing, using the treeline for safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is still no response from the clan. You signal again. After a wait, you try once more even louder. Why is there no response? Are they unable to hear you over Lyzann's party? It is unlike them to make the kind of racket that would require. If you delay any longer, the hunters could scatter into the forest and reassemble elsewhere. It will be dark soon, too. Eyeing the eerie light of the hunters' torches, just a bit too bright and red to be pine, you decide to advance alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are young still, but as a hunter yourself, your instincts are sharp. Without any warning or noise, you fold your wings close to your scaly form and begin a dive towards the men. The wind whips past your face and the men seem a hundred beats closer every moment. If your nostrils weren't closed to block against the incredible wind velocity, you would undoubtedly smell their terror. It is instinctual in man; an immutable fact of nature that they fear the sight of this dive just as a mouse fears an owl, or a fish fears a shark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the brief moments before you are upon them, you notice several oddities in the party. Their clothing is dark, twisted and spiny, like a charred newt near a bonfire. Their ponies and mules are adorned with the same shimmering black armor, and carrying blood red tapestries where there would usually be tarps and bags. The fires they had lit, the ones that burned too bright and red, were not torches, but rather iron braziers, staked into the ground with what might have been polished bone. Their weapons were those of hunters- bow and arrow, sling and rock- but they carried long, slender blades at their sides that no woodsman would have use for. In your relative youthfulness, you could not yet know their proper names, but you are learned enough to guess their volition: these are demon worshipers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucked into the treeline and spread out, the cultists are safe from a clean dive bomb. Instead, you swoop as low into the clearing as you are able. Your nostrils reopen- the scent of terror is overpowered by their garlic stench- and take a deep breath. Your chest is suddenly almost two thousand degrees. Before you crash into the treeline, you arc up just enough to clear the canopy and then unload your fiery breath into the party with a fearsome roar. The heat of the fire disintegrates the clearing's meadow grasses in an instant as the brilliant orange and blue flames light up the dusk. The treeline positively explodes: old pines ignite like match sticks, the duff of the forest floor is replaced with a burning lake. Branches crumple, wood shrieks. You are arcing back into the sky and preparing for another salvo before the first has even touched down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the din of destruction, you roar your only spoken warning. Your voice is thunderous, hard and ancient, despite its speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans, leave this forest now or perish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you circle back over the clearing to prepare for another pass, you feel a cold tingle in your right side. You glance down and spy barbed red arrows with black feathers lodged between your scales. Ordinarily, a dragon's scales act as much like armor as any suited knight, but bows were used to puncture armored suits when they first saw use in war. As a young dragon, your scales have not hardened to their full strength either. These barbed shafts seem to be poisoned, judging from the sting. What a nuisance. This proved the cultists were not out for game; you can't eat a poisoned catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou swipe the arrows out of your side and bear down again on the clearing. You can see that your breath has charred a swath of forest and every unfortunate cultist that it caught has burnt into something indistinguishable from the trees. However, they were properly spread out around the clearing beforehand; this will take several more passes unless they retreat. You wish the other dragons had joined you by now, but there's nothing else to do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whiz over the clearing and collect your breath again. It fills your heart with draconian strength and makes the pelting of fresh arrows around your wings and face seem as insignificant as bug bites. You spy a bearer of one of the braziers and his mule behind a sickly pine ahead. The gout of flame blasts from your mouth with even more force this time, obliterating the cultist and everything around him. The colors again blaze over the treeline in reds, oranges and blues. Pine sap burns very well. It is unfortunate that you must burn down your clan's own forests to be rid of these invaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the next pass over the clearing, you are startled to find that you can't feel your right arm. As the surge of power leaves your heart, you feel drained and numb. You have to work much harder to beat your right wing then you should, and your head is heavy. The poison is much stronger than you thought and it startles you. You slow and try signalling one last time, as loudly as you possibly can. But, you can't stop here: if the cultists have brought such a toxin with them, they could do far worse given time to retreat. They could hide away until they find Nosferus. They could slip through in the night, and target the newborns or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or the sky parrot stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new sense of panic fills your chest. Not of these men themselves, but of the new peril your clan is in, and the worry of losing them. Nobody has responded to your final call. It falls to you, then. You fight through the numbing sting spreading through your limbs, rake your claws over the arrows in your face, and descend on the clearing once more. These devil worshipers ought to pray to whatever petty deity they followed; a dragon's wrath is a force of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the light of the fires as a backdrop, you scan for the remaining cultists hiding in the trees. There aren't many of them, but they are even more spread out now than before. They notch their bows as you come close, the light reflecting off of their twisted black armor like poised scorpions. You feign another dive, and then rear up in the center of the clearing. The arrows come like hail, but you shrug them off and take a deep breath, as deep as you can muster. The fire in your chest again fills you with that ancient, indomitable will that has made dragons the most feared creatures in the known world, almost more so than the inferno that follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You quickly find the first cultist at the furthest left position and let your breath flow forth. But you don't stop there; between the beats of your wings, you sweep your flames right, torching the entire treeline and causing the whole clearing to ignite into a hellish landscape. At the furthest rightmost cultist, you sweep back again. Still, the arrows fly into your belly and wings. One makes its way into your throat and pierces the soft flesh of your tongue, but you take another breath and return it a thousandfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The clearing is getting very dark- and not just from the sun. Your thoughts have to swim through a thick syrup to register, and your whole body is numb save for your burning heart. Like some loathsome parasite, the cultists persevere despite the pyroclasm, scuttling through the burning forest as it falls to pieces around them. One with a gleaming golden horned helmet looks like he means to charge you. He is suddenly crushed under a great falling pine, squashed like bug. You huff small, exhausted, involuntary flames through your nostrils in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In that moment, you lose your breathing rhythm, and your fiery core is extinguished. Your wings betray you and you slump to the ground. At this point only your neck will respond to your demands. Surrounded by the warmth of the hellish meadow, you could fall to sleep in a moment. But is your clan safe? Are they even aware? Are they... you dare not consider it. You slowly, drunkenly survey the forest. The cultists are out of sight, but there could be more in hiding. Or they could have joined the new reserves of charcoal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt five points along the edge, you see the bony braziers which have miraculously remained in place through the blaze. Each now burns with a sickly green fire instead of a red one. You suppose if they weren't lit beforehand, you certainly ignited them yourself. It matters not at this point. Nothing matters but sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are drifting through a void. There is no light, no structure, heat, or smells. There is only one sickened young dragon, floating like a leaf on a windless lake. The fires of the clearing are far behind you now- or perhaps in here, they never were. Nothing makes sense for very long as your brain still combats the effects of the poison. You wonder if there is an afterlife for dragons. You had never considered it much before. Surely if this was to be your eternity, the arrow punctures would have been restored prior. Or else some cruel deity saw fit to let souls depart with all of their wounds and ailments. You pondered on that. What happens to a decapitated dragon? What if one starves to death? If an aging dragon passes on, do they continue to age here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have some serious grievances with this afterlife. You want another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the void shudders and ripples as if a current has passed through it. A low rumble permeates the blackness, and like a newborn's wing, it tears apart in a gaping hole. Light blinds you, noises deafen you in their sudden reintroduction. You feel an unbearable squeezing sensation from your tail to your snout and are sucked through the tear, back into reality. The travel leaves your poisoned mind reeling and furious, and out of reflex you lash the surroundings with your tail. You strike a hard, smooth surface with a clink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your senses adjust, you see a vast cavern of deep red and black bricks. A barrier has been erected all around you, tapering at the top several tail lengths above your head. The braziers seem to have made their way here as well, although there are only two now, and they have traded their cool black metal for greasy yellow wax. They are accompanied by various other objects: an enormous skull, an obsidian slab, a pool of blood carelessly slopped into an iron tub large enough to bathe in. The smell of angry garlic pervades your new prison, and the cultist's ululations in their demonic tongues assault your ears. You twist about, looking for the nearest human to crush for this outrage. You spy a group of them over a short of expanse of flat cavern floor and across a ridge. There is just one problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cultists are several stories tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reexamine your surroundings and come to a revelation: this is not a barrier, it is a bottle. The braziers are candles, the ridge is the edge of an altar, and the cavern is a filthy, murky room with no windows. The void must have been some rite of the cultists' to spirit you away from the clearing, and now you are no larger than a dwarven tea cup. You strike the glass bottle's edges with your claws and are rewarded only with more paltry clinks. You take a breath, let your chest ignite, and blast the bottle's top with a jet of flame. It produces a feeble yellow flicker that hardly even singes the cork. In a rage, you slam your full weight into the glass on one side and the other, first the bottom, then the top. The bottle only surrenders the tiniest rocking before settling back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped! Well and truly trapped! In over a hundred years, you have never known such a feeling of humiliation. It burns hotter than flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this time, the cultists have taken positions in a circle around the altar. They wear blood red robes over their black armor now, and draw the slender swords at their sides to point in the air over a grand five-sided insignia surrounding the altar. Their chanting rises to a fevered pitch. Even with the poison fading, it gives you a headache. Suddenly, in much the same way that you fell through the tear and into this prison, a rift splits into existence overhead. This one seems to claw at existence, greedily pulling at the air around it, ruffling the cultists' robes and setting the candle flames into a frenetic dance. Vile red light pours from within it, and the garlic stench reaches you even through the cork. You feel an unpleasant sensation- like an invisible leech has latched onto your heart. Odd lights and colors emanate from the other items on the altar. The tub of blood drains before your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto the world bursts a demon. Even now that it has stretched to thrice its size, the rift struggles to accommodate its bulk. It is mostly red, as one would expect, though its horns are coated in a thin membrane laced with shriveled black veins. Its limbs are disproportionate, heavily muscled in some spots while sickly and frail in others. Its black claws have grown out of control, twisting and spiraling off of its long feet and hands. A sinewy long tail slashes the air behind it as it climbs through the rift. It ends in bones sharpened and carved to resemble a primitive axe. Yellow pustules checker its body, some oozing green pus. Its face is like the bastard child of a bat and a boar, all flaps, rolls, and stretched pink skin. Long tusks stand out from a mouth overflowing with a wolf's teeth. Its jaws seem to be an ill fit for its mouth, as the gums extend out from its lips like a second creature lives in its cheeks. Its eyes are wide and swiveling, bestial and yet filled with an ancient, intelligent hatred. Wherever its gaze rests, light seems to fade. It hops to the old stone floor with a titanic thud and then hunches over, resting on two legs and a hand like a monkey. It towers over its summoners, silent save for labored, nasally breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cultists lower their blades and raise their hands. One of them steps forward and lowers his hood, revealing a shriveled face obscured by an unkempt grey mustache. He addresses the demon. \"Lord Shabelzoch! We, your faithful servants, welcome you into Grethbean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon gives him the most hideous smile you have ever seen. You wonder if it already plans to eat them. You certainly would. \"My ssservants!\" it shrieks, delighted. \"You have followed my brilliant instructions perfectly! When first I whispered into your hearts, you numbered only three. But now you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShabelzoch pauses to survey the room, perhaps counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Much larger in number! Armed, too! Sssplendid work, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head cultist bows. \"We are but worms under your heel, master. With your guidance, we will fill Grethbean with terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grethbean is only the beginning, my ssservants,\"  the demon hisses excitedly. \"When I have taken my fill of this realm, all shall be made into mire and excreta. Then I will feed on the next, and the next, until Shabelzoch is everywhere and everything is Shabelzoch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will follow you to the end, master,\" the cultist nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon looks puzzled for just a moment. \"Yes, and, you shall have your reward! Rewards! You will all be rewarded with your greatest desires. It will be great. All of them, every desire you have.\" The demon throws back its head and gives a shrill cackle. Your ears and eyes burn. \"Trust me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have prepared a sanctum where you can prepare, master,\" the cultist says. \"This shrine is not secure enough. If the lords find us now, it could be a hindrance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My clever, clever minions! While no mortal weapon can harm me, I see the wisdom in this plan! Prepare my vessel and let us be off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man blinks. \"Uh, vessel, master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great demon's bulging eyes roll. \"Yes, my vessel you cretin! The body that shall carry me under guise of a mortal, as I mentioned in my instructions. Do you expect me to walk there!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cultist's face shows no recognition. The demon coughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe I forgot. Maybe YOU forgot. Who knows. At any rate, you'll do just fine. Move over, I'm driving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShabelzoch takes one large step towards the old cultist, reaches out and pins him between its massive hands. The cultist raises his hands in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait master, I..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon's enormous bulk is solid one moment, viscous like a slug the next. In another, it is like a jelly, and the next a filthy red juice. It flows into the cultist's face through his mouth, nose, ears and even eyes. The old man screams and contorts as much as he is able. Yet it only takes about 20 seconds for the demon's full mass to enter the man. He first goes rigid as a plank. Then a familiar, hideous grin crosses his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssee? Perfect fit!\" The man says cheerfully. The expression looks somehow even more unnatural on his shriveled features. If the other cultists are terrified, only the one who fainted shows it. The demon's vessel sizes the other cultists up and picks one at random. \"You! Put a helmet on or something. You're the new leader while this one is away. Show me to my new sssanctum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new head cultist bows quickly and leads the group out of a passage at the north end of the room, which is suddenly much lighter and quieter. You are left alone in your glass prison to reflect on the events. What would your clan say of all this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour clan. The aching fear returns with a vengeance. The cultists have obviously used you in some way to summon the demon, which means that they entered Nosferu with the intent of capturing a dragon. That meant they knew where it was, which meant it wasn't safe. Which meant your clan wasn't safe either, not now, and not on the night of your capture. The evidence was grim, but you couldn't know for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes. With no sunlight or stars, it's difficult to discern how much. Dragons are slow to hunger, doubly so in extreme situations. you try rocking the bottle a few more times to no avail. You try your fire, you try mimicking the cultists' chants from earlier. You finally just try calling for help both in draconian roars and in mortal tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time passes. You are utterly alone. You dream of flying over the ridges of Nosferu, and wake up in despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill more time passes. You may well find out what happens to a dragon that starves to death in the afterlife. You are well and truly alone. So it seems that this is a rare moment where a baby dragon could be forgiven for allowing himself to cry. Draconian pride is for fire. Draconian grief is wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are two ways this adventure could unfold. One is an ending, the other a beginning.</span></div></div>",
