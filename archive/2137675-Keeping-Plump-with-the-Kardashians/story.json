Most observers had viewed the Kardashian rise to global stardom as strange considering none of the Kardashians were really know for much except Robert. He passed in 2004 and three years later, Keeping up with the Kardashians became the buzz in Hollywood on the back of a curvaceous Kim Kardashian with her physics bending hips and derriere.<br>\r\nAnd as the buzz grew bigger and bigger, observers rested their case and went back to complaining about California traffic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only the questioners knew the REAL story about the Kardashian rise, would they be able to understand what was occurring to the family now in 2018.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                         ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you sure this will work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Trust me Mrs. Kardashian, a drop of this and he will be dead in 6 months. You will have your wish and I will have my blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A scripture was pulled out and rolled open. A cloaked women began reading to the Kardashian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"o-Tay e-thay avenger-way I-way ant-gray ou-yay our-yay ish-way ill-tay e-thay irstborn-fay an-cay ear-bay o-nay ore-may\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" What are you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" I am reading the contract aloud to the Gods, for they may hear and bear witness to this. You have agreed to in exchange for the traitor gypsy's blood that you will be gifted glory throughout your kingdom and your bestborne will be gifted the body of a goddess with the ability to indulge with no consequences. This will last until she is unable to bear. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two ladies looked at each other and shook hands. It was thundering outside and as they shook, a loud boom could be heard. Kris Kardashian couldn't help but smile....she was going to be famous!        </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You can't be living in the world today and not know Khloe..Kim...Kourtney...Kylie and Kris. The Kardashian dynasty has ruled pop culture for nearly a decade now and doesn't look like it'll be stopping anytime soon. That is where YOU come in. You see I feel that the Kardashian clan has ran its course and it is time for new blood. And considering they've lived in Hollywood their entire lives, it would only be fitting if they were gifted a very ill-starred ending...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules will be<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No vore<br>\r\n2. Potions/Spells are allowed but have to be elaborate. Not just \"drink, gain 100 lbs\".<br>\r\n3.No ridiculous weight gain(Kim woke up and weighed 500lbs)<br>\r\n4. Weight limit should be around 600lbs<br>\r\n5. Male weight gain is allowed but should never be anything more than a minor subplot re: Rob and Kanye<br>\r\n6.No gay/lesbian<br>\r\n7. No scat<br>\r\n8. No incest<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd please no short basic chapters. I'm really looking for a certain level of quality. That being said, I won't be taking down chapters left and right unless you've disobeyed the rules above. I'm looking forward to contributions and making the Kardashians nice and plump<br>\r\n</td>",
