            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>15 year old, Boston born, Laura Kilburn was so excited she could wet her self, here she was at the Justice League Watch Tower were all the most famous superheroes lived and SHE was picked to be a superhero in training. Sure she didn't fit in with the other female superheroes, they were fairly feminine and girly looking, while she was covered in rock hard muscles from years of training. But that was the price of her powers, she couldn't take the easy path, her destiny was to work hard and prove her self daily that she was worthy of her powers. That was the price of being the Kilburn Warrior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the Kilburn Warrior meant Laura had to be a near perfect example of a Celtic hero to please the gods and the spirits. She thought back to only hours ago right before she got on to the shuttle when her grandmother, Samantha Kilburn, pulled her aside and told her \"Remember Laura. Brave hearts, hard working hands, honest tongs, and honorable actions are the trade marks of the Kilburn Warrior. It will requirer a lot of hard work and sacrifice to please the gods and there will be many temptations to take an easier path. But you must resist because you are the Kilburn warrior and if you loose that you will never fill complete. But don't worry, I know that you won't give in. After all you are my granddaughter.\" But despite the words of comfort from her granny she still felt like a 6'4 foot tall, 160 pounds, muscle bound freak. Now freak may not have been the best word to describe her, it wasn't like she was one of those body building hags with the wrinkly skin and tinny boobs. From her perfectly shaped legs and ass, to her rock hard six pack and arms, she was the ideal female Celtic warrior. Plus with her hour glass figure, messy brown hair, gold color eyes, and all natural DD cup breasts meant she was quite the looker. But walking past all the skinny athletic female superheroes didn't help much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't just her body that made Laura feel uncomftiblh, but other things as well. For instance since she was going to be the first Celtic superhero the gods wanted her to dress like a traditional Celtic warrior, and that meant she could only wear a pair of pants, a leather belt, bits of jewelry, a bra strap, and nothing else while she was on duty, and since the council had asked that she show up wearing her superhero custom all she had on was a pair of dirty old brown pants and some war pant, which meant that she was going to see the greatest heroes in the world and she had to dress like some dirty hobo without even a pair of shoes. And since her breasts had nothing to restrain them but a leather strap that barley covered her nipples she was forced to give every man and woman in the place a free peep show, her face burning red as she felt every one looking at her. Everyone else was dressed in such nice uniforms, even if they were skin tight at least they got to cover their boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fucking great!\" She thought to herself. \"How is anyone going to take me seriously if I can't even wear a shirt? Shit! I bet Wonder Woman is going to think I'm just some over grown hocker who decided to play dress up.\" She really wanted to make a good impression with the League but the person she really wanted to impress was Wonder Woman, who was her hero ever since she her mother and father told her that she was going to be the next Kilburn Warrior when she was 5. Ever since then she has always looked up to the Amazon as inspiration to become the greatest supper hero she could be. And now when she finally gets the chance to meet her icon she was forced to do it naked from the wast up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed to be an eternity of marching past staring eyes and whispering voices Laura and the other 12 superheroes in training finally made it to the out side of the Hall of Justice were the council sits and governs the league. Inside sat all the big wigs, Batman, Superman, Hawk Girl, The Green Latin, Martian Man Hunter, The Flash. and Wonder Woman. They told the teenagers that they would be interviewing them one by one, then they would test their powers and skills, and afterwords they would assign them to a teacher who would act as their mentor until they became full fledged superheroes next year. Since Laura was at the end of the line she saw what all the other kids could do. Most had some really cool powers, others not so much, however there were two things they all shared that she did not, one they all had really cool customs, while she did not, and the other was that they all had some sob story about how some random criminal killed their parents, or they were exposed to some kind of experimental thing that gave them super powers, or they were mutated as children and were now trying to help the world that rejected them. Now she was feeling really nerves because while she may have been born into a working class family she really had no sob story to explain why she was inspired to be a superhero. She was the Kilburn because she was born the Kilburn. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura watched as each of the superheroes in training was interview by the council. Soon they came to her and asked her to step up. To keep her hands from shaking she drew her sword and shield, holding them in her hands gave her the strength to walk up and face the council with out freaking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the members of the council she saw that for the most part they were all staring at her with warm welcoming faces, except for one. Wonder Woman was glaring at her as if to say \"Why our we even wasting our time?\" This made Laura stomach do back flips, but she took a deep breath and did her best to appear calm and controlled. They asked her to tell them about her self, her powers, and her reasons for joining the Justice League and she told them, \"My name is Laura the Kilburn Warrior, I'm from Boston Mass, I'm 15 years old and powers come from the Celtic Gods and Spirits who have passed down the mantle of the Kilburn Warrior through out my family's history. My powers included enhanced strength, and agility. I also have a spiritual connection with all of my weapons, so if I don't intend to kill then they won't kill, but if I do want to cut something in half with my long sword then it could go even through kryptonian flesh like butter. The same is true with the rest of my weapons.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any known weaknesses?\" Asked Hawk Girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not bullet proof or anything like that. The gods would see it as cowardly. But other than that no.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was the Batman turn to talk, \"I see that in your profile that you only get to keep your powers by pleasing your gods. What does that include?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things like fighting bravery, only using my full powers when I need them, not hiding behind a secret identity, not using non natural enhancements to give me edge, pushing my self my self as hard as I can with out relining on my powers unless I have too, and pretty much live in an honorable manner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are pretty strict rules, some could even get in the way of being a superhero. Tell us if you can't use a secrete identity how do you plan to keep your loved ones from getting hurt? What if someone threatens them to control, how could we trust you not to give in?\" Asked Wonder Woman, her voice was sarcastic and nasty, like she wanted Laura to fail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura felt hurt that her hero would would want that, yet she still kept control of her self as she answered the best she could. \"My father has been a Boston city police officer for 25 years and he never needed a secret identity so why should I need one? In the end I am nothing but a cop with special talents.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of our powers we use secret identities because our enemies often attack our friends and family so they could gain power over us.\" Said Superman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same was true for Martin Luther King jr but he didn't need to hide be hind a mask.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our you saying we should review our identities?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but that is because every one knows you by your superhero names. You have become symbols of justice and thats great. I just don't need one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman was impressed by this girl, so far she has been direct, honest, and seemed to be sincere about fighting crime, but now he needed to ask one of the most important questions. \"Laura we also need to know what has inspired you to be a superhero. We know that you are the Kilburn Warrior and therefore you must take heroic action, but you could have done it by becoming a cop or a solder and keep your powers a secret like the Kilburn warriors did in the past. So why do you want to be the first Kilburn Warrior superhero?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel that I could do more good if I came out about my powers instead of hiding them. I also think that the Justice League needs someone who has grown up in the kind of place were most criminals come from, someone who understands why they turn to crime.\" Laura said, her voice honest and true. The council was greatly impressed by her answers and felt that she made some good points. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>More or less pleased with their answers the Council decided it was time for the physical part of the exam. The test required the new superheroes-in-training to fight a group of 20 solder from Allied Security Team. Now these solders have only been training for 3 months so it would seem like they would be an even match for the super powered teens. However these warriors had received training from almost every non super powered member of the League including Batman and the Green Arrow and as well as from special forces from around the world, so these guys knew how take on super humans. Luckily for the junior superheroes the ASTs were armed with only form bats and other forms of light practice weapons. Both sides were also wear special made armor that could not only protect them but also let them know when they took a blow that would put them out of a fight so they would know when to leave the practice ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though they were wearing armor and the AST members were using form weapons in just a matter of minuets most of the superheroes-in-training lost and had to leave the practice grounds. However the ones that were left were able to put up a good fight, Laura was able to count 6 superheroes-in-training (including herself) and about 15 ASTs-in-training. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she and the other 5 superheroes-in-training were able to hold the ASTs off but one by one they fell until only Laura remained. Even she was being pushed to her limit by the more experienced and faster warriors. She punched, she killed, she blocked, she slashed, she did everything she could to keep from being brought down partly because she wanted to impress the Council but also she was just having way to much fun to stop. She was doing so well not only did she take out three AST members. But even Laura was over come by the remaining eight solders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they pinned her against the ground despite using every ounce of strength the gods aloud Laura to have. Her body burned with the all of the holy power cursing through her veins. But she just couldn't keep up with it and all of the power was taking a tole on the young Kilburn Warrior. Finally with her one last ounce of strength she screamed \"KILBURRRRN!!!\"Then collapsed from exohstion. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura Kilburn was sitting on a bench waiting her for her turn to try out for the Justice League. This was something she dreamed of ever since the League was formed when she was 8. She should feel excited or nerves or anything for that matter! But instead she just felt... numb. So much had happen to her over the past two months she was having trouble taking it all in, forcing her to separate her self from her emotions or else she would have a mental brake down. It all started two months ago on her 16 birthday when she was finally given the powers and weapons of the Kilburn Warrior by the Celtic gods of old. It was great because not only was she given super strength and magical weapons but she would also be the first Kilburn Warrior in hundreds of years who would not have to hide their powers and that was all thanks to the League becoming a legitament peace keeping organization recognized by over three hundred countries including the U.S and China. She would be aloud to fight bad guys and criminals her way with out having to become a vigilantly which the gods frowned upon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo celebrate this and to help her get in the League her father Frank let her get traditional Celtic warrior tattoos on her chest and back as well as her arms and ankles, and since they wouldn't let her ware armor the gods blessed the tattoos so that any enemy looking at would become slightly disoriented as well as intimidated them. At first she wasn't sure if she really wanted them, she never seen her self as a tattoo person. But once she got home and had a good look at them in the mirror, she had to say she liked them. Not only did they look cool with all the interlocking symbols, but somehow having them felt right, like getting these tattoos all over body completed her transformation into the Kilburn Warrior. She was still glad when she was off duty all she had to do was put on shirt to hide them. She also had no urge to get any body piecing, that was just to creepy.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next couple of days Laura felt like she was walking on clouds. Everything was going great, her father had started teaching her how to drive, and her spirt guides Brakas (male spirt of bards and legends) and Mordren (female spirit of heroes and warriors) were teaching her how to summon her super strength when ever she wanted and how much of it she wanted to use. (They warned her not to become dependent on her super strength in battle or else the gods would see her as weak and unworthy of being the Kilburn Warrior.) Every night she would check off the day on her calender as she counted down to the day she would try out for the League. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen just when everything seem to be going her way something terrible happen, something that turned her entire world upside down. Three weeks before the day she was going to try out her father was on patrol when he got a call of a bank robbery. When he and his partner got there they exchanged gun fire with the robbers, killing one and injuring the other three. It wasn't until after the gun fight that Frank released that he too had been shoot in stomach. Luckily because of his bullet proof vest the wound didn't go in very deep, however the wound got badly infected while he was at the hospital. The doctors tried to stop it from spreading but it quickly reached his kidneys which were all ready weaken from his years of heavy drinking after his wife Michael died and was going to need a transplant as well as continuing treatment afterwards. Laura's family were by no means poor, both of her parents had been high ranking police officers and had invested wisely, but with 7 mouths to feed at home there was no way they would have been able to pay for the surgery her father needed to live. The only silver lining was that if Laura was able to join the FJL they would pay for her father's treatment. So her oldest brother Thomas came back from touring with his Celtic rock band The Bar Room Brawlers to take care of their 6 younger siblings, freeing Laura to go off and join the League.             </span></div></div>",
