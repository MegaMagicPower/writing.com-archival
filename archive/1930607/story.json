            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The human world was...unusual. Ever since she had taken Yuu's body in place of the girl herself, Strength had become fascinated with how humans worked compared to their Other Selves. There was really no deep fighting, unless physical blows were exchanged. People met up and could actually be friends. And in the years since  Yuu took Strength's place in the Other World, the human realm had calmed some. Whatever pain that the tawny-haired girl had suffered in the first place seemed no longer relevant to her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, she wouldn't return. So Strength was left here in the human realm, wandering about with the years, attending different schools, keeping that same identity as she moved from place to place with Saya, trying to find somewhere that she could stay, fit in, and finally try to bring Yuu out of the shell she wove herself so long ago. However, her time was mostly occupied by trying to be a normal middle school student most of the time. Classes were hectic, and activities were fun. It was a great experience, a place to relax and, though she didn't like to admit it, a wonderful world where there was no harsh, life-or-death fighting all the time like the Other Realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were still some things she wasn't truly used to yet. She would oftentimes disappear from class, instead staying in the counseling room with Saya, drinking coffee, whilst her classmates went about the day. And of course, having actual, real friends in Arata and Mato and many of the other students at the school. She felt bad, occasionally though, that she had to fudge some of Mato's memories to be able to have such a close relationship with her. Sometimes it seemed, however, that even without that, they would've been the best of friends anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in the counseling room, sipping on a mug of coffee as profferred by Saya, Strength sighed happily despite her situation, relishing the taste of the sweet drink. It was near the end of the period, heading towards lunch time, and at that point she could spend the rest of it with Mato and her new friends. Looking out the window with her soft, orange eyes, she smiled, counting down the minutes until the bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe counselor, however, Yuu's friend Saya, was studying Yuu's body with her dark brown eyes. It was something she was noticing more and more often...being an Other Self, it seemed like Strength didn't actually need to eat. It was, however, taking a toll on Yuu's body. She was a bit thinner than she remembered last, and it worried her greatly that if Strength didn't end up nourishing her host body, it would lead to a grave condition upon Yuu's return. Knowing that eventually she would have to face this, Saya sighed, speaking up. \"Strength...there is something I'd like to talk to you about before you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Other Self turned her attention to the counselor at her desk, setting down the mug of coffee and straightening out the uniform jacket. \"Yes, Saya? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are some things you should know about...human bodies. I know you don't eat in the Other World, there's really no point in it. But over the years I've been with you while we've waited for Yuu to return, I've noticed that her body has....started to thin out. Rather dangerously in fact. Strength, in the human world  bodies need sustenance. I suggest you start eating until you get to a healthy weight,\" she stated simply. Strength looked at her strangely for a moment, fidgeting about in her seat as she tried to make sense of this. Of course, she had eaten before, but a lot of the times it was simple snacks, not full-blown meals. She honestly didn't think about it, but now that Saya mentioned it, she was right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrength nodded as the bell rung for lunch, standing up and stretching before draining her coffee. She smiled at Saya as she turned around, heading out into the hallway. \"I'll take good care of Yuu's body then. I'll make sure to eat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out into the hallway, the Other Self was caught by surprise as Kuroi Mato tackled her in the back, the dark-haired girl grinning widely as she wrapped her arms around Strength's shoulders. Giggling happily, she nuzzled Mato's cheek, getting a friendly one back in return. \"Hey Mato! How was the rest of class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twintailed girl stuck her tongue out, rolling her eyes and giggling a little more as they wound their way to the cafeteria. \"It was totally boring! only Yomi was keeping me awake after you left! The teacher kept droning on and on, and she eventually lost her place in the lecture. Seriously wish you were there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! I ended up getting transferred out for some weird reason,\" Strength replied, blushing a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee, it's okay! We still have a few classes and stuff together! And it seems like you're actually gonna eat today! I keep wondering if you bring your lunch or not,\" Mato giggled, walking next to Strength as they entered the cafeteria. \"So! What do you feel like today?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Strength had never eaten at the cafeteria before, so the smells that hit her were strange and interesting, much different from the cold, dry air and the scent of ancient battlegrounds in the Other World. Bombarded by these new sensations, the Other Self's mind takes a while to catch up, slowly spinning in circles as the information is processed. The primal instinct of her body, however, smells the food and instantly triggers the response for a person who's been deprived of food for days on end: it lets out an incredibly loud, dull roar that startles both her Mato. Placing her hands upon her stomach, she blushes darkly, eyes wide at her friend who's staring right back. \"U-uh...pardon me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Yuu...I didn't think that you'd be THAT hungry. You're smaller than me,\" Mato says incredulously. Indeed, the black-haired teen stood a good six inches taller than her, so for all Mato knew, the assistant coach of the basketball team just had quite an enormous appetite. Strength could only imagine that this reaction towards food would be a result of her...slight negligence toward her other half's well-being. Blushing darkly, she pokes her fingers together, looking down at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think so either...guess I haven't been eating as much as I thought,\" Yuu chuckles nervously, patting her outfit down. \"What do you suggest from the menu?\" She asked. Strength was totally unfamiliar with the school's lunch menu as she had never visited the canteen. At this point, she couldn't even figure out the different smells that were coming from the other students' lunches. It all smelled so...good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMato put a finger to her chin in thought as she strolled into the lunch room with her friend, looking about. Eyeing the menu, she found all the standard stuff: types of bread that one could buy from the canteen, as well as the standard school meal for that day. In this case, it was rice with miso soup and a few mother things, not to mention the curried rice sitting in the back. Wondering what exactly Yuu might like, she grins. \"Let's try some of the breads, and maybe some of the miso. Since you seem really hungry, I'll chip in too! I got some extra yen from my mom, so it should cover anything you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the menu too, Yuu blinked slightly, mouth watering as she began to pick...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n= = = = = =<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrmph, oh thish ish sho good, Mato! *ulp* Aaaah! I've never had anything thish good...not even the food at my old shcool wash thish good~!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been eating long past the lunch break, with the sheer amount of food she had gotten. Her twintailed friend sat next to her on the bench, a little worried, having hardly touched her own meal as she watched the tawny-haired girl scarf down every single morsel that she had bought. Loaf after loaf of bread, curry, melon, beef and just about everything else flowed past her lips almost like water, the girl known as Strength devouring them with reckless abandon. IT was at least an hour by the time she was done, her gut rounded out and swollen with the recently devoured meal. She had eaten so much it rested in her lap, straining the buttons of her custard-colored blazer as well as  the white dress-shirt underneath. A little uncomfortable, she burps softly, covering her mouth. \"Urp...oops! S-sorry Mato...oh, it was just so good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate more than most of the other girls do, even some of the guys...you must've been HUNGRY...\" Mato stares, incredulous at how round Strength's gut has become, pooching out even over the waistband of her pleated skirt as her shirt came undone. Looking at her friend's face, she sees that it's a little flushed, the poor girl a little too stuffed for her own good. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*burp* oooh...I think I ate a little too much...urf, s-stomach feels...*urp* little too full...\" Strength complained. It was true; she hadn't felt like this before. Again, new human sensations, but one that she hadn't experienced before at any of the previous schools. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well I don't have any medicine...maybe...er...\" Mato started, before looking to the side. Strength furrowed her brow and let out a little groan, belching a little again. She looked over at her dark-haired friend with a pathetic look that said 'End me now if you can't help.' Mato sighed, \"I can...um...give you a belly rub. I heard those tend to help upset stomachs. u-uh...my mom used to give me one if I overate at the table...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever works...urf...h-hadn't had a bellyache before...\" She reaches over, unbuttoning her blazer and then her shirt before popping the clasp on her skirt, letting her belly roll out to its full size. It sat on her creamy thighs, a full, round orb about the size of a volleyball and growling softly at its owner, a bit put-off by the sheer amount of food she ate. Mato's fingers shakily approach the swollen globe, the light touch of her fingers making Strength let out a low whimper, unsure of what to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mato's fingers sink in for a moment before being repulsed by the sheer fullness after a couple millimeters, the swollen orb grumbling slightly at her as she disturbs its contents. The tawny-haired girl bites her lip as she feels her friend start to dig in gently, squeezing the stuffed flesh and moving about in circles. Her skin is very warm to the touch, slightly flush from how full it is, and with every few rotations, Strength lets out a low burp, the pressure in her belly starting to ease. The black-haired schoolgirl puts her other palm to the side of the stuffed stomach, starting to knead it from the other side once she realizes it won't pop or become more upset with just a little more stimulation. It was a strange sensation; she had never done this before, and yet here Mato was, massaging the stuffed gut of her best friend in an attempt to calm down one heck of a bellyache! It was slightly comical and she held back a short little laugh, knowing that her friend was in a bit more trouble than she was letting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does this feel, Yuu? Much better?\" Mato asks, looking up to her friend's face. It was certainly working at the very least; Strength's cheeks were no longer flush with the effort of keeping her roiling belly from hurting, and a small smile was starting to curl on her lips from Mato's relieving rubs. Opening her eyes, she looks down, blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-much better actually...ooh...it's so heavy though, I didn't realize I could get this full from the first time...\" She moans, reclining against the seat a bit more. It felt even better than before, allowing the swollen orb to jut out to its full apex, the flesh growling softly in satisfaction at Mato's attention. Rather pleased with herself, the black-haired girl starts massaging just a bit deeper, squeezing the flesh a bit more than before, and really starting to sink her hands into it more than before. That's when it started becoming more than just a soothing belly rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warmth of Strength's flesh tickles her deft fingers as she massages the taut skin, the orb now giving in quite a bit more than before and allowing her digits to fully grasp its size. Pale hands sink into creamy flesh, her palms working circles around the relatively taut surface, the softness of it causing Mato to blink and grab at it just a bit more. The stuffed belly was so soft, so cushy! Almost like grabbing a giant marshmallow...perhaps a memory foam pillow, just sinking her hands into it and squeezing as much of it as she could in one go. The warmth made it even better; so very toasty, and the way it wobbled lazily from her touch just made her want to shake it even more. Leaning against it, she could even hear the noisy workings of Strength's belly as it tries to digest the massive meal the poor girl had earlier, the sounds curiously enticing to her ear and tickling her mind a bit with the sensation. Giggling for a moment, Mato kept rubbing at the swollen gut, tracing circles around Strength's deeper navel with her fingers, even fondling it just a bit as her face flushed a dark crimson, her tongue poking between her lips as she slowly delves deeper into the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Strength minded either. The roving hands of her friend felt so good on her sore stomach, the quick, relaxing strokes causing her to let out soft whimpers and moans of happiness as the pressure was eased off of her, her belly quieting itself as it was soothed by Mato's soft, silky palms. It felt so good, she could hardly stand it! Even her toes clench inside of her shoes as she brings up her legs slowly, enjoying the feeling of her flesh being played with and rubbed in such a way that was so unexpectedly delightful, none of this ever having happened before at other schools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, it wasn't going to last much longer...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mato's ears prick up as she hears footsteps coming down the hall. Thankfully, the lunch bell hadn't rang quite yet! They still had a bit to go. She could continue her ministrations, as she could feel Strength's belly wasn't quite satisfied yet, but they had to move before they were spotted! Looking around for an escape route, she notices that they're right beside the consultation room, one of their favorite hangouts. And Miss Irino was out for the time being...what perfect luck! Reaching forward, she pulled Strength up from her relaxed position, causing her to murmur in discomfort, eyes fluttering as her belly started to get angry again. \"Yuu-chan! Let's go! Someone's coming, and we don't want you caught out in the open!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrf...wha-? But...but lunch isn't over yet, people shouldn't be getting out...\" The tawny-haired girl mutters, rubbing her eyes. The belly rub was too good! Mato shouldn't have stopped so soon. As the murk goes away however, she can hear the sounds of footsteps as well, causing her to go into a panic as her volleyball-sized belly quivers and wobbles on her front.  \"Oh no! ohnoohnoohno! Q-quick! We have to get me out of here! W-where can we go!?\" Strength yelps frantically, looking around with wide eyes. Her raven-haired friend quickly clamps a hand over her mouth before starting to haul her into the room beside them, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUSH! We don't want them to hear and come after us! Just be quiet and I'll get you somewhere safe!\" She hissed into Strength's ear, pulling her heavy load into the consultation room. The sudden burst of movement jostled her belly again, and soon it was grumbling at its owner once more, the poor assistant coach looking a little worse for wear as her tummy is agitated. Bringing her in quickly and shutting the door behind them, Mato placed Strength on the accompanying couch, hearing her stomach burbling in discomfort with a satisfied smirk as she looked away. \"Gimme a minute, I'm gonna see who it is!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her friend to suffer for just a bit more, the twintailed basketball player moved over to the door, cracking it open to see who was walking down the hall. The smirk grew a bit wider as she heard an uncomfortable-sounding belch coming from the tawny-haired girl, knowing that she would more than likely need another belly rub before long. It grumbled too, an even wider smirk appearing as she realized that she might have the opportunity to make it bigger...and make her friend beg for her soothing touch. A blue eye peeked through the crack in the doorway, and caught a glimpse of a red tracksuit right before it went around the corner, another member of the sports club in tow. Sighing heavily in relief, she shut the door and looked back, grinning. \"It was just Kohata-chan making her rounds. Thankfully we pulled in here before we were found out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrength was in no way able to reply, however. She sat on the couch, holding her grumbling stomach in her hands, trying to massage it like Mato did but with little success. it didn't help that she felt hungry, either; the belly rub must've freed up a bit more room in her stomach than she would've liked to mention. Pressing into her now much looser food baby, she tried to quiet its noise, letting out a soft belch again as she pressed into its surface. \"G...goood...*urp* ooooh...T-the trip in here wasn't good for me at aaaaall...\" Hiccuping, she covered her mouth before her stomach betrayed her again, grumbling softly in irritation before letting out a moan of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMato smirked again, looking around. Miss Irino usually had a bit of food around, mostly little biscuits or similar treats to accompany the coffee. This wasn't like her at all, but at the same time...rubbing that stuffed belly felt way too good! Yuu was her best friend too, and she seemed to like having it rubbed, anyway! Maybe...maybe she could use this opportunity and fill that stuffed belly again...the tawny-haired girl was hungry, after all! Looking in one of the cabinets near the coffee maker, the basketball player picked out a tray of sweets, humming to herself. She just had to quiet that hungry gut. Despite having a bit of a tummyache still, Strength could only look at the food with want, the volleyball-sized orb rumbling in agreement. \"I found something to help soothe that belly of yours, Yuu-chan~! Because it sounds like your belly might need a bit more to eat in order to get it satisfied~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrength doesn't say a word, she simply opened her mouth with a deep blush on her face, toes curling in expectation of what is to come. Sure, a gurgly belly might ensue, but damn it, she was starved again! Mato gave a cheshire grin before she planted one of the sweets, a thick eclair, into her friend's awaiting mouth. She gulped it down greedily, without remorse, adding to a belly that was already upset. Strength didn't care. The food was so delicious! This one sweet, with a cream that filled her mouth with a light, fluffy texture that just tickled her tongue, wrapped in a thick chocolate-flavored crust! Her lips were greeted with another, and then another, her belly letting out thunderous rumbles of discontent but satisfaction at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a whole tray left...And Mato was all too eager to feed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn entire tray's worth of eclairs later, and Strength was sitting on the bench with an even more stuffed belly, easily basketball-sized now and groaning deeply in irritation. Moaning softly, she tried hard to keep her legs straight as Mato rubbed her massive gut, hands roving over it again in a spidery dance that made the sore globe tingle. Patting it, she smirked at her poor tawny-haired friend, whose eyes were just about closing with the bliss that the belly massage was giving her. \"Seems you ate a bit too much again, Yuu-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-ugh...a-and I'm already regretting it...\" Strength muttered, stretching her legs again. Mato's warm palms were a godsend, soothing the massive beast which jutted from her middle like a mountain, her navel now relatively deep compared to before and one of her raven-haired friend's favorite teases. Thinking about it for a moment, she let out a soft whimper as the basketball player's trim fingers tickled it, tracing lazy circles atop her mammoth belly. \"Oooh....d-don't stop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't plan on it~\" Mato replied in a singsong voice before stroking the pale sphere lightly, hearing it burble softly in happiness as she pleases its soreness. Humming a short tune, she grinned slyly again, getting another idea. \"Heeeey, Yuu-chan...since the day's almost over, and I'm sure it's a long walk to your house, how about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>General Overview</b><br>\r\n- Generally speaking, Black\u2605Rock Shooter (\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u2605\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc, Burakku Rokku Shuutaa) is a character created by one \"huke\" which would later popularize and become a main character in many different other projects such as games and even an anime series. While not exactly a \"series\", the settings featured in many of works featuring Black\u2605Rock Shooter have many other characters that are like her in some way shape or form. It's also interesting to note that, the settings in which the various games, anime and manga take place and the concepts present are varied from the original so, while Black\u2605Rock Shooter may be present as a main and titular character, various things about her may be different (for example, the Black\u2605Rock Shooter in the game is named \"Stella\" and is a clone made to combat aliens, in the anime, Black\u2605Rock Shooter is known as an \"Other Self\").<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this interactive, we WG enthusiasts explore our own brand of setting in the Black\u2605Rock Shooter universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Characters</b><br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blackrockshooter.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Characters\" target=\"_blank\">http://blackrockshooter.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Characters</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Keep in mind that there's really no need to use all the characters present on that page, but you're welcome to introduce them as you see fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Concepts</b> (for use of those who wish to build upon what's already established)<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blackrockshooter.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Terminology\" target=\"_blank\">http://blackrockshooter.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Terminology</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to expect/look for<br>\r\n-As with many of my interactives; be aware of the content rating, put forth an honest effort in the chapters you post, and try to keep any canon characters used in your stories...well, in-character when at all possible. I'll be dividing this up in the same fashion as my other Interactives so everyone can have their shot at creating a story with their favorite fetish as the focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Like many of it's kind, this interactive will only be focusing on bloating up the female characters of the Black\u2605Rock Shooter universe. It's only a minor detail, but I ask that you keep this in mind if you ever think about adding on to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStandard rules apply...<br>\r\n- Only female characters are to expand. Although this doesn't exclude male characters from appearing at all in the interactive.<br>\r\n- Please put forth effort in your chapters.<br>\r\n- Nothing completely outlandish in regards of expansion.<br>\r\n- Let's try to avoid the overly gross situations such as toilet stuff and the like. Burps are fine, but nothing past that please.<br>\r\n- This is an 18+ interactive so sexual situations are allowed, just...try not to go overboard with them. Use in moderation, basically and try not to have the story revolve too much around it.</td>",
