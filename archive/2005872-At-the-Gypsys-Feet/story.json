She's always enjoyed that sort of atmosphere, almost like she'd be right at home in the 1400's. She grabs your arm tight as she weaves in and out of people, stopping to check out the random tables selling jewelry and weapons. You both have a bit of a knife collection at home from the first time you went here and spent an unusual amount of money on ancient weapons you'd more than likely never have to use. You'd never expect the 5'8, curvy brunette to be into that sort of thing on a first glance, but she had a real wild side to her, which you loved.  She separates from you to go watch the jousting while you continue to walk around. You pass by the random food pits and archery demonstrations until you come across an old ratty tent. Out front there's a few empty chairs and a hand written sign:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MADAMME ROSELLA: CHANNELER, MYSTIC, SORCORESS EXTROADINAIRE.... $10 PER READING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in your wallet and see a Hamilton staring back at you. Well, you may as well give it a shot. You wait by the front of the tent and are about to call in, when you hear a sexy foreign voice whisper \"Enter, Traveller\". You slowly make your way into the tent, and see two empty chairs around a small table. In the middle of the table are a collection of beads, a stack of tarot cards, some gold coins and a large crystal ball. The voice returns and says \"Please take the empty seat close to you. Madamme will be with you shortly.\" You take the seat and place the bill on the table next to another stack of bills, and wait for \"Madame\" to enter. After a few seconds of waiting, this eastern european music begins playing and out steps Madame Rosella. She is a short woman, no more than 4 feet, 10 inches or so... and she's dressed in a tight red top adorned with jewels and roses, and a long red skirt that falls behind her as she walks. She is barefoot with dark red painted toes and thick, healthy legs. Her hair is a mess of black that looks like it hasn't been combed in weeks, and a thin veil covers all of her face except for her eyes and nose. She sits across from you, and leans into the table with her hand on her chin. \"You do not seem troubled.\" You don't know how to react to this. \"Uh... thank you?\" Is all you can muster. She smiles and says \"Many of the men who come to see Madame Rosellla are in need of guidance. Are in fear of what the world has in store for them... or just look to make themselves wealthy. But the spirits are not easily fooled.\" She takes your hand and traces a long unpainted fingernail across your palm. She says \"Hmmm... just as I suspected. You are content with your life. You need not seek out the forces of other realms to arrange the pieces for you, you seem to be carving your own path.\" You smirk, tapping on the ten dollar bill on the table. \"I want to be sure that you're telling the truth. You can speak to the spirits? I'd like to know what they have to say about me.\" Rosella sighs and says to you \"Very well. I will look for answers... even if you are not willing to supply questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs some sand from under her chair and sprinkles some across the glowing orb in the center of the table. She looks into it and begins to moan in concentration. She closes her eyes and says \"The forces are strong... they command me to send you a message...\" You lean in close, interested to see what the seer has to relay to you. She places her hand on the ball and says in a loud clear voice... \"TWO OCEANS CONVERGED... A FOREST OF PLEASURE... AND... A BLACK JEWEL SHINING IN A PALE DESERT...\" She opens her eyes and says \"Very well. You may go now.\" You sit there dumbfounded and finally blurt out \"... Huh?!\" She sits back in the chair and takes the veil off of her face, revealing her ruby red lips. \"The spirits have left you a message. It is up to you to decide what it will unfold to. A warning, a reward, a journey... the spirits are vague because you must discover these things for yourself. I am only here to help you get started. Thank you for your patronage, please make your way out.\" She begins to collect the money from the table when you say \"You've got to be kidding me! That's all I get? That wasn't even worth TWO dollars, you crook!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands to her feet and slams her palms flat on the table. \"You call Madame a cheat? I am here to give you a glimpse into the other worlds, worlds that would make you tremble if you had a taste of their power, and you call me a thief? A swindler? You have no idea who you are talking to, do you?\" You stand up defiantly and say back to her \"I know who i'm talking to, Short Stuff... a no good CON ARTIST!\" She takes a deep breath and begins to walk towards you, chanting in a different language and laughing to herself. You begin to get nervous as the lights inside the tent flicker on and off, and she begins to walk you into the corner. You feel the flaps of the tent behind you as her short body comes closer to you with piercing eyes. She has not stopped talking in this foreign dialect and she grabs your shirt collar, bringing you down to her level. She looks you dead in the eyes and you cannot move your legs to escape it.  You feel almost as if her gaze is trapping you in your own shoes.  You can't even turn your head away as her beautiful face lines up with yours and her eyes which were once a shimmering blue were now a bright, glowing red.  You do nothing as she stares at you, her eyes getting wider and brighter with every passing second.  She says in a dark, creepy whisper that reverberates around the entire tent \"You wanted to see Madamme Rosella's true power? Very well... I will show you...\"</span></div></div>",

She reaches in with two fingers and says \"Normally I like to do this a different way... really let the magic take a while for the effect to happen... but I can't stand to look at you at that size for another second.  It's time for you to get small!\"  She pulls the fingers out quickly, and you can see that there is a small amount of bright blue dust between the tips, and she brings the hand up over your head, sprinkling you in the bright substance.  It burns a bit as it drizzles down onto your hair and shoulders.  You go to wipe some of it off your shoulder as the gypsy takes a step back.  Although you can't get the feeling off of you, you realize that you're able to move your arms again... the paralysis is gone!  You take a few steps to the side, knowing that now you have full control of your body again, and immediately spin around to leave the tent.  To your shock however, there's no exit in sight.  The flap that you came through has vanished, leaving you no way of getting out!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to the gypsy who has a hand on the side of her face as she smiles and says \"Leaving so soon?  But we've just started to have fun together.\"  You are fuming with anger and walk right up to her and start to say \"Listen here, you crazy bitch.  Either let me out of here or so help me...\"  And that's when you see her smirk get wider and wider as you realize that when you first saw her, she was only up to your chest in height.  Your eyes must have been playing tricks on you because now... she was up to your shoulders.  She pokes you in the chest and says very coldly \"Or so help you... what?\"  You take a step back and start to freak out.  There's no way she could have done this to you.  You ask her \"What did you do to me?  Did that glitter shit shrink me?  Look... I believe you, now will you please get me back to my normal height?\"  The smile returns as she puts a finger up to her chin and feigns deep thought.  \"Hmmm... well since you asked so nicely... no.\"  You start to lose it as the world slowly grows around you.  \"What do you mean, no?  Change me back!\"  She just laughs as her body seems to grow in front of you.  You are now only a few inches taller than her as she replies \"I'm sorry, but even if I knew a way to put you back to your normal size, the powder works much differently than my other spells.  The effects are permanent.  I'm sorry, but you will never be as tall as you once were.  And I can't wait until you are done shrinking.  We're going to have a lot of fun together.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have the ability to move again, but for some reason your body won't.  Probably because you're still trying to figure out exactly how you got into this situation in the first place.  You'll never see your girlfriend again, never go back to your job.  You're just a puny little man under this crazy gypsy's power!  In fact you were so busy thinking that you didn't even notice Madame Rosella's height climbing up to match your own.  You were wide-eyed, looking right into the beautiful face of pure evil itself.  And she was having the time of her life, lifting up a hand to match her height to yours.  \"You know, I don't get to meet a lot of men my own height.  It's actually quite pleasant.  But it won't last.  You are going to get a lot smaller than that.\"  And you know she's telling the truth as her eyes start to drop down to look at you shrinking again.  You start to panic a bit, wondering just how small she plans on making you?!</span></div></div>",

You are almost eye level with her bountiful breasts, but can not gaze upon them just yet.  Your eyes are locked with hers in a pathetic, pleading trance.  You wordlessly beg her to change you back to normal, and in response you get a silent answer back of \"not a chance.\"  She giggles wickedly above you, patting your head in a condescending manner saying \"There we are.  That size will suit you for now.  How do you like being so short?  I'm sure it must be quite a shock going from such a big, strong fellow to a pathetic weakling like this.\"  It was.  You couldn't believe how embarassed and pathetic you felt being so low to the ground.  And the look that she was giving you only made you feel significantly more insignificant.  \"You took advantage of my hospitality in this tent.  Now I will take advantage of your puny little body.\"  Using only one hand she grabs you harshly under the chin and brings your face close to her chest.  She leans down and giggles, giving the side of your cheek a quick, unnerving lick.  She brings her tongue all the way up to your ear, causing a chill to go down your body.  She giggles at your reaction and says \"You're nothing but a toy to me.  A living, breathing, life sized toy.  And i'm going to enjoy breaking your spirit and your body piece by piece.\"  There's a rustle coming from the other side of the tent, and as quickly as you can even process it, Madame Rosella grabs your mouth hard with her hand, not letting a single sound escape from your lips.  Two drunk freshman girls have peeked their heads in looking for a reading, when Rosella shouts out \"No more customers!  My tent is closed for the evening!\"  The girls let out a disappointed grunt and continue walking.  The gypsy looks back at you and says \"You were going to scream for help, no?\"  You didn't answer, just breathed heavily in defiance as she stared down at you.  She was so powerful, even though you knew she couldn't have been more than 5 feet tall.  She lets her hand off of your face, laughing at the red mark it's made from her forceful grab, before saying \"Nothing is going to stop me from enjoying myself tonight.  I'm going to have lots of fun with you.  And just to show you who is truly in charge here...\"  What does she do?</span></div></div>",

Seemingly sensing your discomfort she reassures you, \"Don't worry I wont change you too much, I like you at this height.\" she says still circling. She walks back to her small coffee table in the center of the tent and grabs a pinch of the blue substance like before, she walks over to you, blue substance in hand the same as before. As she brings her hand above your head she looks you in the eyes, no longer struggling to reach above your head and reassures you again, \"Just a small little change.\" smirking she drops the powder on your head again.

How were you supposed to go more than a week not being able to explain to anyone why you were 4'5, let alone getting out of Madame Rosella's tent to tell the tale? Just then you are brought back to reality with a tap on the head. Rosella was about to open her mouth to speak to you but you had had enough, being shrunk, teased, and pushed around by a condesending 'magic' woman from god knows where was pushing you over the edge. Remembering that you had control of your body again, you put your arms in front of you and thrust them towards Rosella with all the force you can manage out of pure rage. She falls backwards and trips on a small stool on the ground used as a seat, and hits her head on the coffe table behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit\" is all you can mouth to yourself as she rolls of the table and hits the ground. You didn't mean for this to happen! Sure she was in your eyes an annoying condesending woman who robbed you of your height, but you didn't want to kill her for it! What were you going to do? How were you going to explain this to the cops, your friends, your family? And you coulden't either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever in all your panic and self-questioning Rosella was slowly stirring awake from her injury induced sleep.

You were in a tent at something like midnight, unable to speak, with a woman who coulden't remember who you were, what you did, or what her own name was.

All you can really do is loosely point to her. \"I am?\" she asks you, you just nod, \"Madame Rosella\" she says again to herself. \"Well I guess that means that this is my fortune telling shop...\" she announces looking around slowly at everything she had stored in the tent.

The shrinking process doesn't even seem to be slowing down as you sink lower and lower towards her shins.  The giantess crouches down and grins, tilting her head in a playful manner as she lets out \"AWW, I JUST LOVE SHRINKING MEN DOWN LIKE THIS!  YOU ALL LOOK SO CUTE WHEN YOU'RE DOWN AT MY FEET, ALL FRIGHTENED!\"  Her huge leg lifts into the air, and she lightly pokes you with her exposed big toe, knocking you off your feet.  The giant woman cackles with laughter and sits down in her chair as you wast no time picking yourself up and running in the opposite direction.  She lets off an amused sigh and says \"OKAY FINE, WE'LL DO THIS YOUR WAY.  GO AHEAD AND RUN, LITTLE MAN.  RUN AS FAST AS THOSE TEENY TINY LEGS WILL CARRY YOU!\"  Her laughter is discerning as you run aimlessly in one direction.  You are not covering a lot of ground, between your miniscule size and the fact that you are constantly tripping over the humongous blades of grass in your way.  You take a look back and see that the giant woman isn't even paying attention to you any more.  She's cleaning her fingernails as she sits and waits for you to tire yourself out.  She's always been in control of you, she didn't even have to look at you trying to escape from her.  And it's cemented in your mind when she puts the brush down and stands back at her full height, slowly stomping down as she steps towards you.  \"OKAY, ENOUGH RUNNING.  YOU DIDN'T THINK I'D LET YOU GO SO EASILY, DID YOU?.\"  The ground rumbles with every huge footfall, and the escape is just getting worse and worse for you.  Now not only do you have a gigantic witch to contend with, but you're still shrinking!  The last bits of your miniaturization take place as you see the already tall patches of grass reach up to your chest.  You can't be any more than 6 inches tall at this point!  You stop for a second to catch your breath, not noticing just how quickly she's caught up to you until it's too late.  A pair of humongous bare feet stomp down on either side of you, and you realize that all your efforts were for naught.  In one swift motion, the gypsy reaches down and wraps her huge fingers around you, trapping your six-inch frame against her soft palm.  You are lifted up into the air with only your chest, arms and head poking out of the witch's grasp on you.  She's holding you in one hand, and waving you in front of her face like an amused child.  \"MY, WHAT AN INTERESTING DOLL I'VE FOUND.  I WONDER HOW DURABLE YOU ARE...\"  She grabs your exposed arm between her free thumb and forefinger and begins tucking.  You scream in pain as you feel her almost pull your arm straight out of it's socket.  She lets go and puts her hand up to her mouth, mocking an apology.  \"OH, HOW CLUMSY OF ME!  I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A BIT ROUGH WITH MY TOYS, YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME.  YOU'RE JUST SO ADORABLE LIKE THIS, THOUGH.  I JUST WANT TO PINCH YOUR LITTLE HEAD OFF\"  She chuckles to herself as her long index finger extends outwards and plays with your hair.  You are a bit relieved that she didn't live up to her threat to take your head clean off your shoulders, but you're still embarrassed by her actions.  You are powerless to stop her fun as she tightens her grip around you and laughs at your struggle.  \"HEHE, STOP SQUIRMING SO MUCH!  YOU TICKLE IN MY HAND!  YOU KNOW, I WAS ACTUALLY CONSIDERING LETTING YOU RUN OFF AT THAT PUNY SIZE, HOPING YOU'D JUST GET STEPPED ON THE MINUTE YOU LEFT MY TENT.  BUT YOU ARE JUST TOO CUTE AT THAT SIZE.

JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SMALL ENOUGH TO LIVE IN MY POCKET DOESN'T MEAN I WOULDN'T HAVE USE FOR YOU!  I'VE MADE LOTS OF NASTY PEOPLE SHRINK DOWN JUST LIKE YOU.  AND THEY'VE ALL HAD THEIR PURPOSES.\"  She carries you to the end of the tent where she first came out of and you spin around in her hand to see a huge camping trailer.  This must be where she sleeps when the carnival travels.  She opens the door with her free hand and you are treated to a sweet smelling perfume all around you.  Her sleeping quarters are decorated just like her tent, with pink streamers and candles all around the room.  The only difference is that you can see a small dresser with a vanity mirror, and a rather large, pink bed.  The gypsy sits down on the end of the bed and holds you out in front of her face, almost as if she's studying you.  She bites her lip and says \"HMMM... NOW WHAT JOB WOULD BEST SUIT SOMEBODY LIKE YOU...\"  She lifts one of your arms between two fingertips and squeezes gently.  She doesn't hurt you, but you almost scream out of surprise, fearing that she just might crush your hand by accident.  She just continues her inquiry, saying \"WELL, YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF MUSCLE THERE, SO THAT COULD CERTAINLY COME IN HANDY.\"  She opens her fist and lets the bottom half of your body breath a bit.  She pokes your exposed stomach, causing you to double over in pain, while she states \"HMM, NOT MUCH OF A STOMACH TO YOU.  THAT'S GOOD, I GUESS.  I LIKE MY LITTLE MEN TO BE IN SOMEWHAT BETTER SHAPE THOUGH.\"  Great, first she shrinks you to the size of a doll, now she pokes fun at your weight?  She's really rubbing it in.  She looks you over in her palm, before letting off a smirk that makes you uneasy.  With a thumb and forefinger of her free hand, she grips the back of your shirt and lifts you up into the air.  She stands up and puts her other hand on her hips, laughing proudly as you dangle between her fingertips.  \"HEHE... YOU HAVE FIGHT IN YOU.  BUT IF YOU WANT TO END UP AS ANYTHING BESIDES A RED STAIN UNDER MY HEEL, YOU'LL OBEY ME.  UNDERSTAND?\"  You slowly stop thrashing, realizing that the look she's giving you is getting sterner with each passing second.  You hate to admit it, but you can't do anything to stop her.  You nod your head up and down in defeat, eliciting a big grin from your captor.  \"GOOD.  BECAUSE I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO FOR ME...\"</span></div></div>",

WELL, THERE'S THE OBVIOUS USES, BUT I HAVE QUITE ENOUGH SEX TOYS AND THINK THAT FRANKLY YOU DON'T DESERVE THE HONOR.\"  You don't know whether to be flattered or insulted that she doesn't feel that you are worthy of being her little living dildo.  But your thoughts would have to wait as her hand lowers down to the ground and the fingers holding your shirt release their grip.  You land in front of her gigantic, rose tipped toes and stare up at her.  She remains seated, but shifts a bit in her chair, causing a slight screeching noise to invade your eardrums.  When the ringing stops, she looks down at you and says \"FROM NOW ON, YOU WILL BE A SLAVE TO MY FEET.  YOU WILL CLEAN THEM, MASSAGE THEM, AND WORSHIP THEM ALL DAY LONG.  I HAVE LOTS OF LITTLE JOBS TO TEACH YOU, SUCH AS CLEANING MY SHOES, PAINTING MY TOENAILS, AND ANYTHING ELSE I CAN THINK OF, JUST AS LONG AS THEY INVOLVE TAKING CARE OF MY FEET.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are horrified and excited at the same time by your new state in life.  You are horrified that you've been reduced to a six inch slave at this woman's feet.  On the other hand, you do have to admit that at this size, her foot smell is intoxicating.  Maybe it won't be so bad after all.  \"AND YOU'D BETTER DO A GOOD JOB, SLAVE.  IF YOU WANT A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT, MAYBE YOU SHOULD LOOK AT MY MIDDLE TOES AND SEE WHAT I DO TO USELESS LITTLE PEOPLE.\"  You take a big gulp and walk over towards her middle toe, which is adorned with a large golden ring.  In the very top of the ring appears to be a normal sized jewel, but upon closer inspection, you notice something moving around in there.  You are shocked to see a form no bigger than your thumb, pounding away at the walls of the gem from the inside.  It appears to be a woman in her twenties, and she looks emaciated and dirty, sobbing away as she pleads for you to help her.  The familiar booming voice above you confirms her punishment with a casual  \"I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER HOW LONG SHE'S BEEN IN THERE.  ALL I REMEMBER WAS THE BACKTALK WHEN I ASKED HER TO POLISH MY HEELS.  NOW SHE'S LIVING THE REST OF HER MISERABLE LIFE TRAPPED WITH MY TOES.  IF YOU WANT A SIMILAR FATE, THEN PLEASE BY ALL MEANS... IGNORE MY ORDERS.\"  She wiggles the toes in front of you, causing you to jump back a bit, but you watch as the girl inside the toe ring is shaken harshly with every movement, resuming her hysterical sobbing once the quakes have ceased.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame Rosella lifts up her foot on the heel and with her toes wiggling joyously in the air above you, she beckons you closer with her finger.  \"CONSIDER THIS YOUR TEST TO SEE IF YOU ARE TRULY WORTHY TO SERVE MY PERFECT FEET.  FEEL FREE TO START WHENEVER YOU WISH.\"  You don't waste any time and run right up to her massive soles and start rubbing.  You try and get every inch that you can from the ankle to the heel, all the way up the sole.  You press your whole body up against her foot and start pressing into her with every ounce of energy you have.  She seems to appreciate it as you hear her moan a bit.  \"MMM THAT FEELS PRETTY GOOD, LITTLE ONE.  PERHAPS YOU AREN'T COMPLETELY USELESS AFTER ALL.  DON'T FORGET TO SHOW THE TOES SOME LOVE AS WELL.\"  You are in a conundrum here, since at your tallest you only reach half the size of her foot.  You jump up and slap your hands against the skin, but can only reach the very top of the ball of her foot.  She sighs in disappointment and says \"HMM, I GUESS I'VE MADE YOU TOO MINUSCULE TO REACH EVERY CORNER OF MY FOOT LIKE THIS.  WHY DON'T I DO YOU A FAVOR AND BRING IT DOWN FOR YOU?\"  You don't have time to move your body.  All you can do is scream before a mountain of stinky foot flesh falls on top of your body, softly mushing into your face and torso as you desperately try to escape.  Her muffled laughter rings in your ears as you try and gasp for breath under the gypsy woman's soles.  She finally lifts up the giant foot just enough for you to start to crawl away on your back, but it comes slamming back down on you with just enough force to trap you.  Only your head remains poking out, trapped in between her gigantic big and second toes.  The smell of her foot is overhelming as you squirm helplessly under her soft warm skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans forward in her seat to get a better look at you and smirks \"WELL, ISN'T THAT A LITTLE BETTER?  DON'T WANT YOU SUFFOCATING UNDERNEATH MY FOOT, NOW DO I?\"  You honestly didn't know if she did or didn't want that to happen.  But you'd get your answer soon enough as she stands up tall, putting just a little bit more pressure on your chest, causing all the air to leave your body momentarily.  She stands imposing with her arms crossed as she says \"WELL, AFTER SEEING YOUR PATHETIC ATTEMPT TO MASSAGE MY FEET, I BELIEVE THERE'S ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO SAY....  </span></div></div>",

She brings you up to her eyes and squints to see you more clearly.  \"PERHAPS YOU WON'T BE SO USELESS AFTER ALL.  I HAVEN'T HAD MANY SLAVES WHO PUT QUITE SO MUCH EFFORT INTO PLEASING ME.  IT WOULD BE A WASTE TO LET YOU GO.\"  She stands up from the chair and lifts you high into the sky with her.  She doesn't take her eyes off of you as you see the world go rushing around you, almost like a carnival ride.  But without restraints or seatbelts, all you're left with is the reminder that you're the size of a small doll being carried into this gigantic woman's sleeping tent.  She stops walking, allowing you to look around a bit, spying a large pillow-laden bed, a few small dressers and trunks, and perhaps most discouraging of all a collection of multi-sized cages.  Some of them seem to be moving and rattling, clueing you into the fact that at this moment in time, she is not without any pets besides yourself.  You snap back to attention as the giant gypsy sighs, expelling a gust of hot air all over your measley body.  \"I'M TOO TIRED TO PUT YOU TO WORK TONIGHT, SO YOUR NEW LIFE AS A SLAVE WILL BEGIN TOMORROW.  NOW... WHERE SHOULD I KEEP YOU FOR THE TIME BEING?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope that she doesn't want to put you in a cage like some sort of animal, not knowing that she already had a slightly more wicked idea of where you'd be spending the night.  Her whole body bends down, disorienting you for a bit until it rights itself.  In her free hand she lifts up a large item proudly, presenting it to you.  It was huge, almost like an big black apartment buiilding, but the sides of it seemed smooth, almost like it was made of a thick material.  And that's when you start to notice the smell coming off of it... it was a gigantic black boot.  Almost like the type of leather footwear you've seen in dominatrix pornography, only now you're small enough to be crushed under it's tall firm heel.  \"I'VE WORN THESE BOOTS OUT PRETTY BAD OVER THE YEARS, AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE FIT FOR WEARING ANYMORE... BUT I THINK THEY'LL BE A PERFECT PLACE TO KEEP YOU.  THEY'RE TOO TALL FOR YOU TO ESCAPE FROM, THE SOLES ARE SOFT ENOUGH FOR YOU TO SLEEP ON...\"  She stops her diatribe mid sentence and sticks her face into the opening, recoiling with a cough.  The disgusted look on her face immediately turns to a wicked grin as she looks back at you and says \"AND YOU'LL BE SURROUNDED BY THE SMELL OF MY FEET EVERY SECOND YOU SPEND IN THERE.  AFTER A FEW DAYS, YOU'LL BE SO INTOXICATED BY THE SMELL OF MY SWEAT AND LOTION THAT YOU'LL BEG TO THROW YOURSELF AT MY TOES.\"  You struggle in her grasp, shouting up at her and shaking your fists in a meaningless show of force and anger.  \"You sick bitch!  Don't you drop me in there!  Let me go!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize immediately that you should have chosen your words more carefully as she laughs and says \"LET YOU GO?  MY, YOU ARE EAGER TO SEE YOUR NEW HOME, AREN'T YOU?  WELL THEN, IN YOU GO!\"  Her fingers spread open, releasing you into a free fall.  You stare up as the giant gypsy waves goodbye, taking delight in watching your tiny body plummet into her footwear,  You feel the air get thicker and muskier as the light starts to fade, and you realize you've passed the rim of the shoes and are falling fast down to the soles.  You aren't even halfway down and the smell is already overpowering, causing you to feel more nausious than the simple act of skydiving from a foot and a half was already making you.  You slam hard against the bottom of the shoe, but manage to make it back to your feet unharmed.  You are amazed by the fact that you weren't crushed by the sheer force of gravity, but that sensation gives way to the overwhelming urge to throw up as the full smell of her giant feet hits your nostrils.  You are surrounded by the smell of her massive feet, just as she told you that you would be.  The light dims a little further and you look up to see the gypsy's pretty, terrifying face gazing back down at you with awe and pride.  \"AWW, IS SOMEBODY GETTING USED TO THEIR NEW HOME?  DON'T WORRY, I'M ALWAYS RIGHT OUTSIDE, AND IF YOU GET LONELY, MY PERFECT FEET WOULD BE HAPPY TO PAY YOU A VISIT!\"  She laughs loudly as she wiggles her toes outside the boot.  You can't see them, but just the wrapping of her digits against the floor sends vibrations underneath your feet.  That's how small you've become at this point.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, I FORGOT TO MENTION.  IF YOU FEEL THIRSTY AT ANY POINT, JUST PUSH YOUR HAND DOWN.  I'M SURE THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH WATER FOR YOU TO DRINK LINING THE SOLES.\"  You reluctantly bend down and press your hand flat against the insole of the shoe you're standing on, and push down slightly.  You are disgusted and horrified to see a pool of salty water form around your hand's imprint.  You shake it off, knowing that you've just collected a sea of foot sweat from your new floor, but in the back of your mind you're incredibly nervous that you'll eventually be so deprived of water that this will be your only way to hydrate yourself.  As you mill over your options, the giggling returns and you look back up to the boot's opening to watch your new mistress rise to her full height and stand confidently with her hands on her hips.  She bends down over the opening and puckers her lips together in a kissing motion, before leaving you with these words.  \"NOW GET SOME SLEEP, MY LITTLE FOOT SLAVE.

YOU WON'T BREAK OR SQUASH UNDER MY TOES, BUT YOU'LL BRUISE QUITE A BIT.  BUT YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN IN THE MORNING.\"  She stomps away from the shoe, leaving you alone and trembling in the ratty piece of footwear, with the parting words \"GOODNIGHT, LITTLE INSOLE.  YOU'VE GOT A LONG DAY UNDER MY FOOT TOMOROROW.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light fades out and the night grows long, you start to get restless in your leatherbound prison.  The smell of the giant woman's feet is driving you crazy and you finally reach wit's end.  You pound on the side of the shoe, screaming \"No!  I will not be some plaything under that nasty bitch's toes!  I'm getting out of here right now!\"  In frustration, you throw all your weight against the side of the shoe, causing it to tinker off balance a bit.  Getting inspiration, you realize that you can probably rock the shoe over to it's side!  You get a running start from one end of the insole to the other, putting all of your weight against the smelly, moist walls.   The shoe starts to lose it's balance as you jog from side to side, gaining momentum with each passing lap.  Your efforts pay off, as the boot tumbles over to it's side, causing you to come tumbling out of the opening.  You are free!  You are still tiny and in this crazy witch's trailer, but you are at least free to attempt another escape!  You see a small light come from a crack in the wall, and deduce that it must be a doorway leading to another part of the gypsy's home.  You step over a pile of disgusting used socks and slippers, before finally reaching the door.  It hasn't been locked, but rather just closed over, and your small stature fits easily between the door and the frame.  You start to gain some hope again, realizing that maybe this won't be such a treacherous journey after all... until you see that the room you've entered is the gypsy's bedchambers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floorboards don't even creak under your tiny weight, giving you a slight advantage as you make your way across the giant woman's bedroom and towards freedom.  You start to look around the giant room, hoping not to see anything moving in the darkness.  Anything under the dressers, from a mouse to a spider could turn into a fight for your life in a matter of seconds.  The room is also littered with gigantic articles of feminine clothing... apparently the gypsy likes to sleep in the nude.  Stepping over her long, red dress you can smell bits of her fragrance all over it.  But the real shock comes when you pass a massive pair of silk panties, reeking of the woman's intense perfume and... a more pungent smell.  You can't help but take a sniff as you pass by, the pheremones coming from her juices have stained the panties and caught you off guard.  It's a lot more pleasant smelling than the inside of that shoe, that's for sure!  But you are snapped out of your trance when you hear a frightening sound coming from atop Rosella's bed.  You slowly peer your head up to see that the giant gypsy woman is...</span></div></div>",

It seems that in your shrunken state you are slightly faster than you'd be at normal size.  You smile as you realize you can use this to your advantage, and the second she stomps her foot again, you zoom between her legs and take off running.  \"DAMN IT!  COME BACK HERE, WORM!

You don't know where you'd be able to find help among the people just going about their day, but you know that no matter where you end up, you want to be as far away from the evil gypsy as possible!

You are overwhelmed the the danger that surrounds you, until your eyes lock onto a pair of open-toed shoes that aren't moving.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing this may be your only chance, you make a B-line for the set of exposed toes and dive on top of them.

Her palm is tilting from side to side, causing you to constantly lose your balance and trip over the cracks in her hand.  She giggles at your attemptst to stand upright, and you are a little shocked by how unphased she is by the fact that she's holding a five-inch-tall man in her hand. She leans in and her breath washes over you as she says \"CAN YOU TALK, LITTLE ONE?\"  You stammer out \"Y... Yes!  Can you hear me?\"  She smiles and says \"VERY FAINTLY.

If you're sure then I'll lead you to her tent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela held you in her palm and listen as you lead her back to the nightmare that was Madam Rosella's tent. Just looking at the outside of the damn thing and knowing that monster was in there sent a shiver down your spine. Lady Manuela noticed this and gently ran her warm and smooth finger down your spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT WILL BE ALRIGHT. WHATEVER HAPPENS I HAVE YOUR BACK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back up at her giant face and nod. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles back before taking a deep breath. She flung the tent's entrance open and shouted at the top of her lungs. \"SISTER!\"</span></div></div>",

I AM QUITE DISAPPOINTED IN YOUR WORK, LITTLE SLAVE.\"  You see the giant mystic take a step forward, and out of reaction, you run as quickly as you can in a short amount of time to avoid the huge, powerful footfall.  She nonchalantly passes over you, heading towards a table on the other side of her tent.  While you catch your breath, marveling at how fast someone that humongous can move, she continues berating you.  \"I MEAN, THERE YOU WERE, UNDER UNDOUBTEDLY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL, DIVINE FEET YOUR EYES HAVE EVER GAZED UPON... AND ALL YOU COULD DO WAS MOVE YOUR HANDS IN A CIRCLE.  HAVE YOU EVER EVEN SEEN ANYONE GIVE A FOOT MASSAGE BEFORE?  I EXPECT MORE FROM MY SLAVES.  EVEN THE ONES I'VE STEPPED ON HAD THE DECENCY TO GIVE MY FEET A FEW LOVING KISSES.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little part of you is mad at yourself for not kissing the giant woman's foot while you were forced to massage them.  Even looking at them from across the room, they are dangerous appendages, but you can not deny that she does have very good looking feet.  You are snapped back to reality as those same feet stomp back to your side of the room, landing forcefully with you directly between them.  \"BUT STILL.  I AM NOT GOING TO JUST END YOUR LIFE.  THAT WILL BE TOO EASY.  YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE BEST FOOT SLAVE I'VE EVER CREATED FOR MYSELF, OR YOU WILL DIE TRYING TO BECOME IT.\"  She crouches down over you, her body blocking out the light from the lamps decorating her tent.  From your position on the ground between her feet, she looks unbelievably imposing.  You still can't believe that someone that massive, that powerful, could still be so attractive.  She has effectively taken the form of a goddess blocking out the sun.  She smirks down at your cowering form, playing with the object she grabbed previously between her fingers.  \"WHAT I HAVE HERE WILL BE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO CONVINCE YOU THAT MY TOES ARE WORTH YOUR UNDIVIDED LOYALTY.\"  She holds her palm open directly in front of you and you gaze into the giant beauty's hand.

You lay trapped under her massive toe as she leans forward, and says \"HOLD STILL, BUG.  THIS WILL ONLY TAKE A SECOND.\"  You feel the dust land onto the back of your head, and stop struggling, knowing there's nothing you can do but wait to get even smaller.  The gypsy releases her foot off of your back and says \"THERE WE GO.  SHOULD BE WORKING ANY TIME NOW.\"  You turn around to face the giantess and expect to see her get larger and larger... but to your surprise she actually appears to shrink.  Not a lot, but you can definitely see a difference in size when you look at the foot that was recently on top of you.  Instead of the size of a doll, you almost reach above her shins.  Did she use the wrong dust by mistake?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gypsy's toes wiggle in front of you as she says \"THERE, NOW.

I WANT YOU TO MASSAGE MY FEET, BUT THIS TIME DO A GOOD JOB.\"  She rests the foot on her heel, presenting the sole in front of you with her toes pointed to the sky.  \"IF I FEEL YOU'VE DONE A SATISFACTORY EFFORT IN YOUR FOOT RUB, I WILL MAKE YOU EVEN LARGER.

I don't understand... why are we so small?\"  You hold her tight, saying \"It's all my fault.  I'm so sorry, i never meant to hurt you.  She was offended by me and... and she did this!\"  Maggie can barely contain herself as she looks you in the eyes and says \"I just want to go home.  I just want to be away from here and home.\"  You are about to reply when you hear a horrifyingly familiar, dreadful laughter above you \"HEHE, MY DEAR, I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND.  YOU ARE HOME NOW.\"  You look down and realize that in your haste to reach Maggie, you've accidentally climbed into the gypsy's waiting palm.  You jump up to your feet but before you can run off with your girlfriend clutching your hand, the gypsy stands up, lifting you two into the air.  She holds the two terrified dolls up to her face and makes a small kissing motion as she taunts and berates you.  \"HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE TINY, PATHETIC AND WORTHLESS?  JUST LIKE YOUR BOYFRIEND.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie hugs you again, shaking from fear as the giantess continues her speech.  \"I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO GET INVOLVED IN OUR LITTLE TIFF, BUT THE MAN YOU LOVE SEEMS TO PUT HIMSELF BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE IN LIFE.  IN FACT, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SUFFERED THIS FATE IF HE HAD JUST PUT MORE EFFORT INTO A SIMPLE FOOT MASSAGE.\"  You scream up at the giantess, while holding Maggie tight \"You fucking bitch!  How could you do this to her?  Change her back!\"  Madame Rosella smirks and says, licking her lips \"OH, I WOULD BUT YOU SEE... SHE JUST LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL AS A DOLL.  I THINK I'D LIKE TO KEEP HER AT THAT SIZE FOREVER.  BUT IF YOU'D LIKE TO SAVE HER FROM THIS FATE... PERHAPS THERE'S A WAY TO PROVE THAT YOU'RE WORTHY OF BEING RESTORED.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosella takes her free hand and extends a thumb and forefinger.  You push Maggie away quickly, holding your arms up so that she can take you and do whatever she wants with you.  But Rosella sees your act of chivalry and laughs saying \"THANK YOU DEARY.  BUT I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT YOU I WAS REACHING FOR.\"  Quick as a lightning bolt, the two huge fingers grab onto your girlfriend who is whisked into the air screaming with horror.  You can do nothing but stare helplessly as Rosella lifts Maggie up above her face, dangling helplessly against the powerful giantess's grip.  Rosella looks down at you in her palm and says \"ALRIGHT THEN.  IT'S TIME TO PROVE YOURSELF, SPECK.  YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR GIRLFRIEND?\"  </span></div></div>",

She inches her chair closer to you, leaning over you in a most intimidating fashion.  She places a hand beside you, tapping her fingertips against the surface.  Each finger could easily squash you with enough force, and the drumming sound only intensifies the feeling of dread this situation's left you with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues to wave Maggie in front of her face, taunting you with your current dilemma as she explains \"BUT IF I AM TO DEFEAT YOU IN THIS CHALLENGE, THEN IT WILL BE UP TO ME TO DECIDE YOUR FATE.

She's holding your fate in the palm of her hand figuritively, while LITERALLY holding Maggie in the other!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OF COURSE IF YOU DON'T ACCEPT MY CHALLENGE, I'LL HAVE TO GET RID OF BOTH YOU AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND IN A MOST DRAMATIC FASHION.

You scream up at her, demanding her to stop \"Enough!  I accept your challenge, you giant bitch!  Just leave her alone!\"  Rosella places Maggie on the table and lets out a small sound that extends her pinkie finger towards you.  \"EXCELLENT, LITTLE MAN.  MAY THE BEST PERSON TRIUMPH.\"  You realize that she expects you to shake her finger as a show of sportsmanship.  You want nothing more than to bite the gigantic digit before you, but you realize that she could just squash you with a quickly placed fist if she wished, so you just play along, grabbing it with both hands and lifting it up and down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour action instigates a tremor of a giggle from the giantess who says \"HEHE, THIS IS GOING TO BE FUN.  IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE I'VE HAD A LITTLE PERSON ACCEPT MY CHALLENGE.  GET READY FOR THE FIGHT OF YOUR LIFE!\"  She crosses her arms in defiance as you just stand there, a true David standing before a gorgeous, evil Goliath.  You look around the table and see nothing but the tablecloth, a collection of scattered Tarot cards, and the crystal ball from earlier.  You shout up at the gypsy \"Alright.  So tell me:  Who or what am i fighting to save her?\"  Rosella laughs to herself and says \"THAT, LITTLE MAN... IS WHERE THIS CHALLENGE GETS QUITE INTERESTING...\"</span></div></div>",

AFTER ALL, YOUR FATE WILL BE SEALED BY THE END OF IT.\"  She lowers your girlfriend down onto the table in front of her, and you two are able to look at each other one last time before Rosella slams the bowl over her.  She is blown back by the impact, trapped within a massive dome of glass by the giantess. You run as quickly as you can to the side of the bowl, staring hopelessly as your girlfriend cries from within.  You hold a hand up to the glass prison and she does the same on the other side.  You say to her \"I'm going to win for you.  Trust me, okay?\"  But she just stares ahead blankly, obviously unable to hear you through the thick wall.  You see Maggie's expression change from sorrow to shock and horror as she points wildly for you to turn around.  When you follow her command, you are not ready for what you see before you.  Madame Rosella has stripped down to nothing but a thin combination of red lace bra and panties... and she has her posterior positioned right over where you're standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU MAY WANT TO STEP BACK A FEW YARDS, LITTLE ONE.  UNLESS YOU'D PREFER THAT I SIT ON YOU.\"  She begins to lower her massive behind onto the table and you take that cue to run as fast as you can in the opposite direction.  The shadow looms closer and closer as you feel the giant fleshy mass fall down behind you.  When it makes impact, you turn around to see her soft skin ripple and shake a bit after her landing.  You are so distracted that you barely make out that she's lifted her hands above her body, and deposited a small amount of magic dust over her own head.  Her body shrinks before your very eyes, until she finds herself equally as small as you, dangling her tiny legs over the edge of the table.  She wipes herself off and climbs to her feet, casually walking towards you on the table.  You two finally stand face to face, and you realize that she has not given herself a size advantage in the slightest.  To your scale, she seems just as short and innocent as she did when you first walked into her tent.  But now you know not to take her so lightly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around, biting her lip, and holding her hands behind her back, as if innocently surveying the scene.  \"It's quite a peculiar feeling, being so small.  I've never been shrunk myself, and i have to tell you I much prefer looking at you from on high.\"  You stand your ground and say \"Alright.  We're both small on the table.  Now what's your challenge?\"  She looks at you with a raised eyebrow and says \"Well, what did you expect?  We will fight now.  You and me.\"  You put down your guard and look at her incredulously, blurting out \"You can't be serious.  You want me to fight you?\"  She laughs and paces around you, saying \"Oh, I know you may have reservations about hitting a woman.  But trust me:  This will be a fight you will not win so easily.\"  You roll your eyes and say \"I know.  Let me guess:  First minute of the fight, you grow back to normal and step on me, right?\"  Rosella crosses her arms and says coyly \"You think so little of me?  I promise, after the fight commences there will be no use of my magic.  It will be a fair fight.\"  You put your hands on your hips and snap back \"Well today hasn't been the most fair for me in the slightest.  So excuse me if I don't believe you.\"  Rosella sighs and says \"I have made a promise, i don't know what more i can do to prove to you that i want this fight to be evenly matched.  Very well, if you won't concede to a fair fight, i will even give YOU the advantage.\"  </span></div></div>",

She cracks a wicked smile and says very confidently \"YOU'LL DO NICELY.\"  Maggie looks down at you in confusion, but Rosella uses a finger to lift her head up towards her direction.  \"UH UH, LITTLE ONE.  LOOK RIGHT HERE.  INTO MY EYES.\"  Maggie starts to put up a fight again, struggling to release the giant woman's grip, but after a few moments, she stops moving.  She stops screaming.  She just looks blindly ahead at the gypsy's face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that the huge woman hasn't broken eye contact with Maggie since she instructed her to look towards her, and you realize that she's hypnotizing your girlfriend.  Rosella finally blinks and says \"CAN YOU HEAR ME IN THERE, LITTLE GIRL?\"  Maggie responds in a creepy monotonous tone \"Yes, Mistress.  I can hear you.\"  Rosella giggles with glee and says \"EXCELLENT.  YOU ARE NOW UNDER MY CONTROL.  MY TINY LITTLE SERVANT.  ISN'T THAT CORRECT?\"  Maggie nods her head up and down softly \"Of course, Mistress.  What do you wish of me?\"  You have had enough and you shout up at the giant woman \"You bitch!  Let her go!  And break whatever voodoo you just did to her!\"  The gypsy rolls her eyes and says \"LITTLE MAN, CAN'T YOU SEE I'M TALKING TO MY NEW SERVANT?  SOMEONE SHOULD TEACH YOU SOME MANNERS.\"  Without being prompted Maggie asks \"Mistress, shall I dispose of him for you?\"  Rosella looks down at you with a most maniacal grin and says \"YES MY DEAR.  I THINK THAT WOULD BE PERFECT.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie is carefully lowered down to the table near you, standing tall with her hands at her sides.  Rosella inches her chair up close to the platform to get a good look at the fight from on high.  She places her elbow on the table, propping up her face with one hand comfortably and says \"LET THE CHALLENGE BEGIN!  SLAVE?  KILL THIS LITTLE PEST AND THE REWARDS SHALL BE GRANDER THAN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS.  Maggie cracks her knuckles and responds coldly \"Yes, Mistress.  Your will is done.\"  You just stand there bushwhacked as your girlfriend lunges at you screaming.  \"This is really happening, isn't it?\"  Maggie lets out a primal scream and runs towards you with a fist clenched, taking a massive swing... that you easily dodge.  Maggie trips and falls to the ground, groaning in frustration.  \"Mistress... says... to kill you!  I have to!\"  You try to reason with her, holding out your hands and saying \"Maggie, listen to me!  I'm your boyfriend, I love you!  Stop this right now!\"  Maggie holds back tears as she stands back up and clenches her fists again.  \"I... can't... stop!\"  She goes to take another punch, but this time you grab her wrist, twisting it.  Maggie screams in pain and tries to attack you with the other hand, which you grab and bend in a similar fashion.  \"I don't want to hurt you, Maggie.  Please, snap out of it!\"  Maggie drops to her knees in pain, and looks up at you, a fiery rage building behind her gorgeous blue eyes.  You at least feel that you could win this fight, and maybe subdue your girlfriend in a peaceful fashion... until you feel a familiar dust shower overhead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Maggie both look around, seeing small flakes of golden dust shimmering down from the heavens.  \"No... she can't have!\"  You look up and see Madame Rosella's hand sprinkling a small amount of her magic dust all over her tiny combatants.  She chuckles deeply as she looks down at you and says \"OH, I'M SORRY, BUT THIS FIGHT SEEMED VERY ONE SIDED TO ME.  SO I'VE DECIDED TO EVEN THINGS UP A BIT.  MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE FAIR FOR YOUR GIRLFRIEND THERE.\"  You feel the magic swirling all around you as Rosella wipes her hands clean of the dust, allowing it to take effect.  At first you feel nothing, looking up at the giantess in confusion.  You don't feel different at all, so maybe the dust didn't work!  That's what you feel until you look over at Maggie and see that she's glowing bright gold.  All the magic seems to have affected her instead!  The Gypsy smiles with delight as she holds her hand over Maggie and explains \"I'VE GIVEN YOU MORE THAN ENOUGH OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO WIN.  NOW IT'S MY SERVANT'S TURN TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE.  AND I THINK THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS IF SHE...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your girlfriend laughs as she feels the magic from the gypsy course through her veins, and to your surprise her body seems to grow larger and larger before you.  You take a few steps back as Maggie grows more and more powerful, the wicked grin on her body getting wider with each passing inch.  When the gypsy removes her hand from over her, your girlfriend now stands a massive amazon, almost 15 feet tall!  Although given your current situation shrunken on the witch's countertop, you know that in reality she is only about a foot tall.  Rosella rubs her hands together, wiping off any excess dust, and strokes Maggie's now larger body with two fingers.  \"DO YOU LIKE YOUR NEW SIZE, MY SERVANT?\"  Maggie shudders at the feeling of Rosella's massive hand rubbing against her back, almost like a small animal reacting to it's owner's petting.  \"YES, MADAME.  IT FEELS WONDERFUL.\"  Maggie opens her eyes again and looks down at you, letting out a gutteral belly laugh.  \"HEHE.. LOOK AT HIM.  HE IS SO PATHETIC NOW.\"  You continue to take steps back, knowing full well that Maggie could very easily control you at this size.  Rosella looks down at you and says \"HE IS FAR MORE PATHETIC FROM THIS ANGLE.  BUT HE SHOULD BE NO THREAT TO YOU NOW.  LET THE FIGHT CONTINUE.\"  Maggie smirks and stomps towards you, causing you to trip over your own feet and fall backwards onto your bottom.  You are helpless as your massive, mind controlled girlfriend has her way with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stomps down hard on your chest, with a force that you feel is enough to break a few ribs.  The wind is knocked out of you as Maggie releases her foot off of you and kicks you square in the side.  You cough up from the pain and try to crawl away from her, but her gigantic body has no problem picking you up to manhandle you.  She holds you out in front of her with both hands under your armpits, and you stare into her oversized face.  The eyes that you used to look into lovingly are now replaced with black, evil pits with no soul or compassion behind them.  They are just blank as she relishes in toying with you.  She uses all her force to toss you over to the other side of the table, causing you to tumble head over feet, until you find yourself clasping onto the edge of the table.  You realize there's no way of getting out of this situation, and you can't bear to fight your girlfriend when she's in this state, it's just too impossible of a situation to handle both physically and emotionally.  So you look over the edge of the table and close your eyes, falling backwards.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope the fall is enough to kill you and you can escape this fruitless fight against your gigantic girlfriend and her even more imposing master controlling her.  But before you can reach terminal velocity, you feel your body land hard against a soft, familiar platform.  You open your eyes in disbelief, staring at the disapproving eyes of Madame Rosella, who has extended her hand to catch you.  She shakes her head with a smirk and says \"UH UH, LITTLE MAN.  YOU DO NOT ESCAPE FATE THIS EASILY.  THAT WOULD BE CHEATING.\"  She lifts her palm back up to the counter and tilts her hand, forcing you to tumble off, and land at the feet of your waiting girlfriend.  Her oversized feet are tapping against the countertop as you look up at her amazonian body.  \"ARE YOU READY TO CONTINUE, BOYFRIEND?\" You immediately break down and start crying, unable to handle the situation.  You fall to Maggie's feet and hug her ankle.  \"Please... please Maggie... stop this!  Stop it right now!  I'll do anything to make this go away, just stop the fight!\"  Maggie has her arms crossed in amusement as she laughs at your pathetic pleas and looks up at her gigantic mistress.  \"HE IS BEGGING, MISTRESS.  WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO?\"  Madame Rosella looks down at you, her shadow overtaking both you and your significantly larger girlfriend as she says:</span></div></div>",

After a minute she finally decided, she then looked up at the gypsy and said in her still monotone voice \"Mistress I have decided on where to have the fight with my boyfriend.\" Rosella replied to her saying \"JUST TELL ME WHERE SLAVE AND I SHALL SEND YOU BOTH THERE.

I can FEEL it.\" she joked as she inserted you deep into her dripping pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to fight back, but that only seemed to increase her pleasure, the quivering flesh becoming more and more moist the farther you went in. The aroma of lotions and perfumes clung to you as you struggled within her dominating folds. The towering gypsy began to speak in her native tongue, saying weird phrases that almost sounded like weird fantasy game spells, in between sexual moans as she drove you and her fingers deep inside her hot sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of music could be heard, loud dancing music, clearly meant to hide the sounds of her lust and ecstasy as both hands pumped into her dripping cunny. It was violent, it was terrifying, yet at the same time you never felt more aroused in your entire life. Soon the two of you began to work in tandem as you rubbed your now throbbing rod up against her inner-walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Rosella reached her thunderous climax, you had already came about four times. Her pussy constricted around you, cutting off your air supply and making you pass out to the sound of a massive orgasmic scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you came to, you were in her hand, cleaned off and naked.

She slowly lifts you up to her shining eyes, and you struggle to keep your balance while standing on the smooth skin.  She laughs a bit and says \"YOUR CLOTHES.  YOU WON'T NEED THEM ANY MORE.  TAKE THEM OFF FOR ME?\"  You hesitate for a second, not wanting to embarrass yourself like that, even for a powerful giantess who has your life literally at her fingertips.  Speaking of which, she notices your hesitance to strip in front of her, and that's when she lifts up her free hand, holding a sharp pair of rusty tweezers between the thumb and forefinger.  They get slightly closer to you as the giant woman whispers \"UNLESS YOU'D LIKE ME TO REMOVE THEM FOR YOU?\"  You immediately lift your shirt over your head, following suit with your jeans and throwing the clothes off to the side of her hand.  She lets out a small squeal of excitement and her warm breath washes over you as she leans in close to you saying \"AWWW, NOW DON'T YOU LOOK PRECIOUS?  NOW WE'RE READY TO HAVE SOME FUN.\"  You are caught off guard as the witch brings her palm closer to her face, smacking you with her humongous lips in a kiss that takes up most of your upper body.  As she lifts her head back up, she licks her lips saying \"MMM... TASTY.  YOU'D BETTER DO WHAT I SAY.  I'LL HAVE NO PROBLEM SWALLOWING YOU LIKE A NAUGHTY PIECE OF CANDY.\"  You don't doubt for a second that she'd actually do it.  All you can do is wait for her to give you a command, hoping you'd actually be able to obey her properly, lest you spend the rest of your days being digested by a giant witch.  She presses her other huge hand over your body, concealing you from sight as she walks to the front of her tent.  Through an opening in between her fingers, you see Rosella look both ways, before grinning and lifting the hand off of you, using it to turn around a sign hanging from the opening that reads \"MADAME ROSELLA WILL RETURN IN 30 MINUTES.\"  She lets out a small sigh of happiness as she walks back into the tent and says \"WE HAVE A HALF AN HOUR TO PLAY, LITTLE ONE.  WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY FOR YOU TO AMUSE ME?\"  She says.  She continues to smirk as you rest in her hand, so you don't answer.  You have a feeling she already knows exactly what she's going to do with you.  She stops walking when she reaches her card reading table and takes a seat.  With one last wink, the giantess tilts her hand, causing you to lose your balance.

Taking advantage of the situation, you strike, bringing your matchstick down on Minnie's head. You swing and swing, bearing down on her with all of your force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rodent squeals, snapping back towards your direction. Again she charges and again you dodge, though this time she manages to stop herself before crashing. Whether its due to her extra weight or being unfamiliar with her tiny form, you are amused by how easy it is to evade this little beast. She can't even come close to devouring you. How did she manage to eat anyone else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle goes on like this for ten minutes. Every time you dodge. Every time you slam her on the head. Eventually, though, your repeated blows come through as you manage to create a small gash on her head. Red begins to flow from the wound as the Gypsy swipes her pet from the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem!\" . \"It seems this fat little mouse couldn't beat a little human. That means you win,\" she says, motioning towards you.

You can tell that the woman has been Rosella's pet for a while.  She has no fear of the giant woman who peers above the two of you, just a determined, wicked obedience.  From your perspective she appears to be a seven foot tall amazon with dirty red hair and large muscles.

She looks almost reminiscent of Giganta from DC Comics... size and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LIKE I SAID MICHELLE, I WANT THIS TO BE ENTERTAINING.

As you command.\"  Her voice is deep and powerful to match her stature, but her accent seems almost midwestern, like she had been a normal person before being forced to fight for the gypsy for so many years.  For all you know, she could have been a runway model in real life, but now she is a built, formidable female mass of pure fitness.  You were incredibly intimidated and imasculated by this woman just from looks alone.  She laughs defiantly at your pathetic stance and wags a finger towards her, beckoning you to attack first.  You have a feeling it's a trap, but your instincts grab hold as you clench your fists around the makeshift spear you hold in your hands and run towards her at top speed.  You go to jab her with the sharp object, but at the last second, she effortlessly dodges your attack and grabs the toothpick with one hand.  You try to wrestle it away from her, but with her free hand she taunts you by blowing you a kiss before clenching her fingers into a fist and delivering a solid punch to your jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go flying from the impact, landing hard on the cardboard floor below.  As you slowly make your way back to your feet, you hear a steady thunder above you.  Looking up you see Rosella's two gigantic hands clapping in approval as Michelle takes a small bow, playing to her audience.  With her back turned, you see an opportunity and you run up behind her, looking to maybe choke her out, when she surprises you with a swift thrust kick to the breadbasket.  You clutch your chest as the wind escapes your lungs, staring up at the two goddesses that have you right where they want you.  One of them is in the box with you, and the other one is holding the edges of the box in excitement.  This was not going to take very long.</span></div></div>",

She falls to the ground in pain, kicking away at you, as you get on top of her, getting in a few decent shots.  You can hear the cackling above you as Madame Rosella is genuinely surprised by your guts.  \"OOH, I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT.  THE LITTLE WORM HAS SOME FIGHT LEFT IN HIM.\"  The light begins to fade away as you feel the giant gypsy woman leaning in closer to watch her toys play.  You are momentarily distracted, which leaves Michelle the opening to punch you in the stomach and lift you off of her, moving away to get some room.  The playful mood she was in is gone, and now she seems intent on destroying you.  You think you may be in a bit over your head at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what seems like hours, the two of you fight back and forth, each one getting the upper hand in different situations.  The two of you are left a bloody mess, and when it all comes down to a head, you find yourself putting the amazonian redhead in a makeshift chokehold, trying to get a decent part of your arm around her thick neck.  She manages to throw you off to the ground, grunting furiously as she puts each of her hands on either side of your head.  \"This... ends here.\"  She says as you feel her motion to twist your head to the right.  She's actually going to snap your neck!  You close your eyes, waiting for the moment to come, but before you feel the sudden breakage, you hear a voice from the heavens shout out \"THAT'S ENOUGH, MICHELLE.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large hands continue to hold your head for a second without movement, until finally releasing you.  You cough and gasp for breathe as you realize how quickly you could have died.  You turn around to face your opponent, and are surprised to see her smiling with an arm extended out to help you to your feet.  You hesitantly grab the arm and she lifts you up to your full height, which now that you're able to measure yourself accordingly is just underneath her chin.  You look up to see her face as she says \"Good fight, short stuff.\"  You take a step back and say \"Y...yeah.  You too.\"  You honestly don't know if she meant it or not.  I mean, she had your life in her hands just a second ago... was she really just putting on an act to provide some entertainment for the giant gypsy?  If that's the case her playing around was more than just a fight for survival on your end... you were actually trying to hurt her!  The goddess above reaches down with both hands, grabbing one little toy in each.  She holds you both up to her massive, pretty face and smiles saying \"THAT WAS A FANTASTIC FIGHT.  TRULY ONE OF THE BEST I'VE SEEN FROM MY LITTLE PETS.  AND CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU, MICHELLE FOR ANOTHER IMPRESSIVE VICTORY.\"  You look over to the other hand to see Michelle kissing and carressing the skin of the hand that held her in place.  \"Thank you, Madame Rosella.  I'm glad you were entertained.\"  The giant romanian woman looks at you a little bit differently though.  Whereas Michelle's efforts were laden with praise and encouragement, you were given a cold, icy stare.  \"AS FOR YOU LITTLE MAN.  YOU ARE THE LOSER OF THIS CONTEST.  IT SEEMS YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT FIGHTING.  AND THAT MEANS JUST ONE THING...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The giant gypsy pulls back her forefinger with her thumb and brings it in front of you, flicking you to the ground like a toy.  \"YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A PATHETIC WASTE OF A SLAVE.  YOU COULDN'T EVEN LAST ONE FIGHT.  YOU ARE USELESS, AND I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR USELESS THINGS.\"  With a cold, expressionless face, Madame Rosella lifts her hand up and slowly curls it into a fist.  You know she's going to squash you with her hand, but are too terrified to move.  You just hold your arms up in a useless attempt to save yourself as you watch her start to quickly bring her hand down.  And just when you think you're done for... \"Madame, Wait!\"  You hear the amazon next to you call out.  The hand stops just above your head suddenly.  You can actually feel the heat from her skin from where you're standing.  Michelle walks over to her master's hand and she whispers to you \"Trust me, okay?\"  You don't even move your head in response as the shrunken girl asks the giant gypsy \"Please pick me up!  I have a proposition for you!\"  The gyspy curls up her lips and says \"THIS HAD BETTER BE GOOD, MY LITTLE CHAMPION.\"  The hand hovering over you moves over to Michelle's body, wrapping her up in a soft, warm fist.  She is lifted out of the box and brought to Rosella's ear.  You can't hear Michelle's discussion, only the giantess's responses.  \"HMM.... INTERESTING... YOU'RE SURE?... VERY WELL.\"  With a smirk, Madame Rosella softly deposits Michelle back on the ground next to you and leans her giant, beautiful face into the box to speak to her pets.  \"MICHELLE HERE HAS OFFERED TO GIVE UP HER REGULAR REWARD IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR LIFE.  YOU SHOULD THANK HER.  GO ON!\"  You are almost speechless but manage to stammer out to the amazon before you \"Th... Thank you.  Sincerely.\"  Michelle bites her lip and says \"Don't thank me just yet... there was a catch.\"  The giantess above you giggles in response to your confusion before reaching into her cleavage again.  Uh oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can move a muscle, the giantess's finger comes crashing down on your chest, holding you in place.  You squirm for freedom under the smooth, soft hand flesh, but it's no use.  She slowly draws the familiar brown sack from between her breasts and opens it just enough to grab a small amount of the magic dust.  Michelle just looks on guiltily as the giant woman cackles above.  \"YOU ARE UNFIT TO BE MY SLAVE, BUT PERHAPS YOU WILL DO BETTER WITH MICHELLE AS YOUR MASTER!\"  She brings her free hand over your head and rubs her fingers together, allowing the dust to sprinkle gently over your head.  You feel the effects almost immediately and are soon completely covered by Madame Rosella's massive fingertip.  She lifts the huge hand off of your shrinking body, and you turn your attention to Michelle, who is growing to match the size previously held by the gypsy.  She's now on her hands and knees to better see your diminishing form through wide, amazed eyes.  When you finally stop shrinking for the second time, you find yourself to be the size of a small doll to Michelle.  You're a doll to a girl who's already the size of a doll.  And that's when you look up at the absolute goddess who's done this to you.  Madame Rosella's face hovers above the city-sized box with a wicked grin.  Her head is the size of a planet to someone like you.  You are practically nothing in the eyes of regular sized people.  You are almost brought to tears by your situation, when a booming bare foot stomps down next to you, snapping you back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at your new master, a blonde-haired giantess with scratches and scars all over her toned, muscular physique.  She looked like a nordic goddess.  You don't even flinch when she crouches down and extends a hand to pick you up.  the first thing you notice as she wraps her fingers around you is that she's trying to be gentle, but failing slightly.  It's not her fault, unlike the gypsy she's not used to handling tiny people.  But her hands also feel slightly more rough and calloused, not smooth and sikly like Rosella's.  You imagine what her skin would feel like if it weren't for the violence she's had to endure, and it almost makes you shiver.  You are brought up to Michelle's chest as she opens her palm flat to better see you with.  She pokes and prods you with her other hand's index finger like a child that's just discovered a small creature in the forest.  And that's when you hear the goddess speak above you.  \"<b>NOW MICHELLE, HE IS TO DO EVERYTHING YOU COMMAND OF HIM.  HE IS YOURS TO DO WITH AS YOU SEE FIT.  I CAN'T EVEN SEE HIM RIGHT NOW, HE'S SO PUNY</b>.\"  Michelle looks down at you and smirks as she whispers \"YOU HEAR THAT?  YOU'RE NOTHING TO HER.  SHE CAN'T SEE OR HEAR YOU AT ALL.\"  You let those words sink in as you sit indian style in the blonde's palm, trying to figure out what's become of your life.  <b>\"ALRIGHT MICHELLE.  TAKE YOUR NEW TOY AND HOLD HIM TIGHT.  DON'T WANT YOU TO LOSE HIM ON THE WAY BACK TO YOUR CAGE.\"  \"YES, MADAME ROSELLA.  AND THANK YOU AGAIN.\" </b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision is blocked off by Michelle's other hand coming right on top of you, keeping you secure and safe as Michelle travels what seems like miles in seconds until the sound of a clanging lock is heard above you.  Michelle lifts off her hand and you see that you've been transported to what looks like a hamster's cage with a doll's bed in the corner.  This must be where the gypsy keeps Michelle when she's not being \"used\".  The enormous gypsy stands tall over you and says \"<b>I'LL BE BACK LATER, MICHELLE.  SEE IF HE SURVIVES UNTIL THEN.</b>\"  She stomps away and closes the door behind her, allowing you to see the room that she's deposited you in.  The cage is in the corner  next to a gigantic bed and endtable, with a few dressers on the other side.  You figure this must be her sleeping trailer, which is connected to the tent.  But you don't really have time to admire the scenery as you are lifted up to Michelle's pretty face, level with her lips.  You feel her hot breath as her now deepened, powerful voice whispers \"I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT SHE'S DONE TO YOU, BUT IT HAD TO HAPPEN LIKE THIS.  YOU HAD TO BE THIS SMALL.\"  You stand up in her tough, leathery palm and shout up at her, almost crying \"Why?  Why the hell did she have to shrink me again?!\"  She lifts her hand up slightly, causing you to momentarily lose your balance.  You are now in front of Michelle's piercing blue eyes as she quickly looks back at the door and then returns her attention to your tiny body, whispering \"...\"</span></div></div>",

IT'S IN THE TOP DRAWER OF HER DRESSER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow her immense eyes, across this town-sized room: on the other side of the goddess' bed, the dresser stands tall as a skyscraper.

You do so, wondering what your course should be.  Her plan seems sound, but does cover a lot of risk.  Why take the chance, when you can just seek your own escape?  Or why not tell the witch of the amazon;s plan, and win favour through betrayal?</span></div></div>",

You tried to struggle as best you could but Michelle strength far exceeded yours. The next thing you new you were tossed haphazardly onto the doll's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou counted yourself lucky that the bed seemed soft enough, but that didn't change the fact that your new master stopped being gentle. Before you could do anything else however, you were suddenly knocked off your feet at the bed beneath you shook. You looked up to see the gorgeous but scarred form of Michelle crawling toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you doing!?\" You yell up in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?\" Michelle asked. \"WE'RE GOING TO MAKE LOVE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind suddenly went blank. She wanted to make love? What? You two were just trying to beat the piss out of each other earlier and now all of a sudden you were being told you were going to make love. What had become of your life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You managed to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU HEARD ME. I DIDN'T STUTTER. BESIDES, YOU HEARD MADAME ROSELLA, I'M YOUR MASTER NOW AND YOU'RE TO DO EVERYTHING I COMMAND.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were at a loss. She was commanding this of you and you knew she could squash you flat if you resisted. Just what were you going to do? You had a girlfriend who was probably worried sick about you? You couldn't betray her like this, even if a part of you found the scarred giantess attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but I have a girlfriend.\" You tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORGET ABOUT HER.\" Michelle replied. \"YOU'LL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN. THERE IS NO ESCAPING MADAME ROSELLA, TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe your ears. You didn't want to believe that. There just had to be a way out, right? \"B-but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle leaned down so her face was right in front of you. Her eyes scanning your every expression. \"ESCAPE IS FUTILE. DEATH IS THE ONLY MEANS OF ESCAPE HERE. YOU'RE FAR TOO STRONG WILLED FOR THAT. I AM YOUR MASTER AND GIRLFRIEND NOW. I AM YOUR WORLD AND THE SOLE REASON YOU LIVE. MAKE LOVE TO ME LIKE I COMMAND AND I'LL SEE TO IT THAT YOU FORGET ALL THAT AILS YOU.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took in Michelle's words and saw that her deep blue eyes held nothing but the truth. There was no escaping this place and at your size there was no chance for victory. You'd never see your girlfriend again and if not for Michelle you'd be nothing more that a squashed bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe... Maybe you should just give in and accept your new life? At least you wouldn't be alone. Plus Michelle wasn't bad to look at either. And despite what happened she did save your life. And she said she could make you forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knows, maybe this could be interesting?</span></div></div>",

You needed to reach down deep and find the strength to win. Michelle might be big but at the end of the day she was still human... and humans can be beaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to make a move or not, little man.\" Michelle taunted. \"You're not the first beanpole to enter this arena and get squashed by yours truly and you certainly wont be the last. So, let's get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes narrowed. She had to have some kind of weakness, no one was invincible. Maybe the legs or the knees? Or maybe it you should attack the elbows and hands? Then again you could always try to get your hands around her neck. If you can't breath then you can't fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to eye her up looking for a weakness you found none. This woman was a powerhouse whose body had been honed by battle. If she had a weakness it was well hidden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrew it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou charged forward to meet the amazon. You began to hammer away at her well toned abs with all your might, but Michelle just stood there and took it. She didn't even flinch. Just to further add insult to injury, she began to yawn as your punches had no effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel tired and out of breath. Your hands ache from assaulting the amazons abs and it's clear as day that your knuckles are swelling. Just what was this woman made out of... IRON?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you've got?\" She asked unimpressed. Up above Madame Rosella laughed at your pitiful attempt at combat. It was clear to her you've never been in a fight once in your entire life. There was no way you'd ever claim victory over her champion. She thought about stopping the fight but instead let it continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to you suffer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react, Michelle decked you right across the face. You felt yourself left off from the sudden impact and landed hard on the ground below. You held your cheek in agony as that punch was ridiculous. Could people really hit that hard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your display today has been nothing short of disappointing, perhaps when I'm done with you my lady will allow me pummel someone else. Perhaps maybe someone close to you.\" Michelle teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got your attention. It made you think of your girlfriend that came to this crazy carnival with you. Did this chick just say she would beat her up when she was done with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT WOULD BE MOST ENTERTAINING!\" said the gypsy above. That made your blood boil. These two, how dare they!? This game had gone on long enough! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surly you managed to make it back to your feet and glare daggers into the amazon. She noticed your change in demeanor and smirked. She knew she touched a nerve. This was always her favorite part of a fight. Pissing her opponent off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning you blitzed the redhead. You thought back to every anime you'd ever seen in your entire life and came up with one final plan of attack. You wound back your fist... And attempted to go for her face. She easily caught your punch. You went for another with your free hand and she caught that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle and Rosella shared the same mad grin. This fight was finished. Michelle began to press down on you with her superior strength and it didn't take long to bring you to your knees. \"Hahahahahaha! Just give up! This fight is mine!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the tears stinging at your eyes as Michelle bent your wrists, it hurt, but you couldn't give up. You thought about your girlfriend and all the countless others these two hurt for there own amusement. You might not be able to do anything about Rosella, but you damn sure were going to beat Michelle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline filled every fiber of being and you began to rise. Michelle for the first time since the battle began looked stunned. Even Madame Rosella was stunned silent. Michelle was actually being pushed back!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amazon couldn't believe it! No matter how hard she tried she couldn't force you back down. You soon reached one knee. Then you began to stand as you tightened your grip on her two hands. You barred your fangs before looking the amazon in her disbelieving eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\"VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU!\" you shouted before jumping up, and burying your head into hers. Michelle couldn't believe the immense pain that coursed through her very being at the strike, it was so intense she actually felt darkness creeping at the corners of her vision. It was impossible! Inconceivable! Did she just... Loose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed she had. She fell to the ground unmoving, prone as you stood tall over her. You looked up to the heavens and roared like the mad gladiator you'd become. \"WHO ELSE WANTS SOME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one answered. Not even Madame Rosella could fathom what just happened. Michelle lost. Michelle never looses. And to this brat no less. This just wasn't right. She would have to do something about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your life flashes before your eyes as those lips get closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream as... she starts kissing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks down at you, looking like a cat that ate the canary. \"See?

She lifts you up to her mouth again and gives you a few more quick pecks, smacking her lips as she dwells on her possibilities.  You don't like the way this is playing out, and before you can back away in her palm, she opens her mouth and sticks out her tongue, draping it over your entire body.  You cough out in disgust as you wipe the giant woman's saliva off of your clothes, and when you look up at her face, she is taking small gulps and moaning with delight.  Her eyes get a lot more sultry and seductive as she cracks a grin and says \"MMM... IT APPEARS I WAS WRONG, LITTLE TOY.

IT APPEARS I'VE FOUND A USE FOR YOU AFTER ALL.\"  You attempt to escape, but the tree-trunk like hands of the gypsy are keeping you in place, and you can do nothing but scream as she continues to get a few more tastes by kissing the top of your head.  She rubs her stomach with her free hand and says \"I HAVE HEARD RUMORS BEFORE THAT INGESTING A SHRUNKEN MAN CAN HAVE SOME... DESIREABLE SIDE EFFECTS.  BUT I'VE NEVER TRIED IT FOR FEAR THAT YOU WOULD BE TOO DISGUSTING AND BITTER.  BUT IT APPEARS THAT AFTER YOU'VE BEEN REDUCED, YOU HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A SWEET, PLEASURABLE TASTE.

I SHOULD REALLY STOP BEING SO FOOLISH.\"  She opens her fist, and before you can make a move, the thumb and forefinger of her other hand swoops down to grab you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are lifted off the relative safety of her palm, and left dangling between the giant woman's two fingers.  You are too terrified to wiggle in her grip, for fear of falling what seems like several stories down to the grass below you.  But while being held, you feel a familiar sensation, almost as if the two fingers holding you are getting larger and larger... along with the massive movie-theater sized face that stares at you.  The gypsy smirks as you shrink yet again, leaving you only a measly two inches tall.  \"THERE.  NOW YOU'RE THE PERFECT SIZE.  ENJOY YOUR NEW HOME IN MY BELLY.\"  She grins as she laughs, showing off her now much bigger, shiny white teeth.  You feel utterly helpless as you are lifted high above her face, looking down on her as she opens her mouth sticking out her huge, slimy tongue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the fingers lose their grip as you freefall onto the plush, wet surface of the tongue.  You barely have time to get your bearings before the muscle is quickly pulled into the gaping maw, and the teeth close behind you, blocking out all the light.  You are alone in the giantess's wet, disgusting mouth as she presses you gently against he roof of her mouth to suck out some of your flavor.  You can do nothing from here at this size, only hope she decides to kill you quickly...</span></div></div>",

She blows you a kiss as your vision continues to drop below her chest, her waist, and then her thighs. You start to run for the opening to the tent, but with every step you take, you lose even more height. It takes no time at all for her long thick legs to catch up to you, and stomp a foot directly in your path. You come to a halt before the beautiful foot, which you can't even see over the top of anymore.   You look up at the humongous smelly wall of flesh that stands before you, and remember how just a second ago you were silently admiring her pretty toes. Now each one has become a dangerous, rose tipped appendage that could squash you flat with one simple wiggle. A roaring laughter appears all around you and you look up to see Rosella standing as tall as a mountain before you, with her hands placed defiantly on her hips. \"PUNY LITTLE PEASANT.\" Is all she says before her large legs bend and she extends a hand out to grab you're shrinking body. Her thumb and forefinger grab you on both sides and lift you off of the dirt floor, placing you into her soft, lotioned palm. Rosella admires her handiwork, having just turned this normal 5'10 person into an inch tall insect scuttering around in the palm of her hand. She giggles with excitement and hovers her enormous face over your tiny body. \"I COULD VERY EASILY CRUSH YOU UNDER MY THUMB.  BUT PERHAPS IF I KEEP YOU ALIVE, YOU'LL MAKE A DECENT LITTLE PET FOR ME.\"  She puts a finger in your face, intent on petting you on your tiny little head. You seize the opportunity, not wanting to be this crazy gypsy woman's slave, and bite the huge mass of flesh as it gets closer. \"OUCH! WHY YOU LITTLE BUG!\" While she recoils in pain, you jump from her hand and into her dress. You slide down the fabric, landing on the flesh of her foot. \"DAMN IT. WHERE DID HE GO? WHERE DID THAT LITTLE PEASANT GO?!\" She gets to her knees to look for you, and you hop off of her foot, quickly dashing to the flap of the tent. Stepping cautiously through the huge blades of grass in your way, you desperately try to make your way to the outside of the tent. Her booming footsteps fill your ears as her voice shouts out \"WHEN I GET MY HANDS ON YOU, I'M GOING TO SQUASH YOU FLAT!  I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME, YOU PATHETIC LITTLE INSECT!\"  You try to ignore her threats and keep running to freedom.  Once you got outside, you could try to get help from someone else, maybe even if you're lucky you could find your way back to Maggie! You finally make your way into the bright sunlight, happy beyond belief that you've escaped the crazy sorceress when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

You are shrouded in darkness as you run head first into a barely visible barrier.  Walls of glass surround you on either side, and you bang on one of them to try and break your way out.  The glass is too thick, and you know that even with all your strength you wouldn't even be able to budge it. You look to your right side and see the one thing you were really hoping you wouldn't:   A gigantic thumb print from the digit holding your prison in place.  Judging from the size of her palm pressing against the clear ceiling of the container, she must have trapped you in a shot glass.  How pathetic you truly were.  And her cackling laughter all around you wasn't making matters any better.  \"SO BRAVE TO RUN AWAY FROM A GODDESS LIKE ME.  SO BRAVE... AND SO FOOLISH.\"  A thick white sheet zooms in from underneath one corner of the glass, and it bumps into your legs, causing you to fall over on top of it in pain.  When you stop rubbing your knees, you realize that she's slid a playing card underneath your tiny body to move you back into the tent.  As she lifts the card and the glass on top of it, you tumble from side to side as she shakes it slightly in her hands.  \"OOPS.  I'LL HAVE TO BE MORE CAREFUL, DON'T WANT YOU TO BREAK YOUR NECK BEFORE I HAVE THE CHANCE TO KILL YOU MYSELF.\"  She's enjoying every second she has your insignificant body trapped in her hands, and you just continue tumbling over the entire walk back.  When you are able to get some sort of balance, you glance down at the giant card she's trapped you on top of.  Of course, it's  the Joker card, only adding more embarassment to your current situation as the caricature printed on the thick paper laughs at your plight.  With one more giant turn of the glass, you find yourself slam against the bottom, with the card now on top staring down at you.  You are slammed down hard on a flat surface, and the card on top of the glass lifts up, revealing some light into your chamber.  Through the opening, you see Rosella's pretty, intensely magnified face smirking down at you.  \"HOW IS MY LITTLE BUG DOING?  I HOPE YOU'RE ALRIGHT IN THERE, I DON'T WANT YOUR LAST FEW MINUTES TO BE SPENT UNCOMFORTABLY.  IT'S SUCH A SHAME TOO, I GAVE YOU THE CHANCE TO SERVE ME AND YOU CHOSE TO RUN INSTEAD.  WELL, NO MORE RUNNING TINY MAN.\"  You scream up at her, begging her to change you back and apologizing, but your words fall on deaf ears.  She just laughs and flicks the glass harshly with her thumb and forefinger, causing a terrible ringing sound to almost burst your eardrums.  \"SORRY, LITTLE BUG.  I CAN'T HEAR YOUR TINY LITTLE VOICE FROM DOWN THERE, BUT I'M SURE I CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS FOR YOU:  NO I WILL NOT CHANGE YOU BACK.  NO YOU CAN NOT BARGAIN YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS, AND NO, YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST LITTLE MAN WHO I'VE DISPOSED OF... YOU'RE NOT EVEN THE FIRST ONE TODAY!.\"  You start to realize just how hopeless the situation is, and pace back and forth in the tiny shot glass, waiting for her to make her final judgement on you.  \"I COULD HAVE EASILY STEPPED ON YOU, ENDING YOUR LIFE UNDER MY PINKIE TOE... BUT YOU DESERVED SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THAT, SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU MY FAVORITE WAY TO KILL SHRUNKEN MEN...\"</span></div></div>",

You could see a few cracks and flakes coming off it, and the nails were a bit unevenly cut. You panned up to see long, equally pale legs leading into a large blue and white striped dress. The girl was very skinny, with thin arms and legs, and a very cut lean torso, but she was still massive compared to you, and it was still a daunting sight. Taking advantage of the girl's sudden lack of movement, you climb onto the sandal in the space between her big and second toes. She has a powerful sweat building up on her toes and her feet are beginning to smell as you get closer and closer to the mounds of flesh. She must have been on her feet all day. Throwing caution to the wind, you know you need to get as far away as possible from the witch's tent and begin punching the toe next to you. The huge hills of pale flesh wiggle up and down as you hear the girl laugh a bit above you. \"IS THERE A.... A BUG IN MY SHOE?\" You begin to panic a bit as the gigantic girl bends down on one knee to get a closer look at her foot. You stare paralyzed as the girl's face comes into view. She's pretty young, maybe in high school, and she has long, unkempt brown hair that she is struggling to keep out of her eyes with a free hand. She looks pretty cute, but she also looks a bit odd. She has thick, large glasses and her pale face is not host to a perfectly smooth complexion. But still she looks kind of harmless... until she starts talking to you. \"COME HERE, BUG. COME AWAY FROM MY TOE AND LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT YOU.\" While a part of you is happy she's not interested in squashing you out of fear, another part of you is nervous of what she'll do now that she isn't afraid of you. You don't dare move as the giant teenager picks up your insignificant body with her thumb and forefinger. You notice that her nails are unpainted and bit down almost to the core, but are more distracted with her long, slender index finger from her other hand poking you a bit while you're trapped between her fingertips. She's ignoring all the other people around her and toying with this \"bug\" she found on her toes. Maybe this wasn't the right girl to go to after all. She keeps inspecting you, talking to herself. \"YOU'RE A FUNNY LITTLE GUY AREN'T YOU. NOT BLACK OR GREEN OR ANYTHING MORE LIKE PEACH OR TAN... AND ONLY FOUR LEGS, YOU'RE NOTHING LIKE ANY OTHER BUGS I'VE SEEN... AND YOU HAVE ON THE TOP OF YOUR LITTLE HEAD WHAT LOOKS... LIKE... HAIR.\" Suddenly the realization that you're not a bug creeps across her mind as her eyes go wide and she slaps her hand across her mouth to stop from screaming. You are squeezed slightly in her fingers as she shakes a bit from the knowledge that there's a real live, inch tall man in her grip! She looks around nervously for a second and she places her other hand over you to sheild you from the rest of the world as she stands to her full height. She makes her way to another end of the fair and finally reveals you back out to the light. She stares down at you biting her lip and almost hyperventilating at the sight of you dangling from in between her two huge fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I DON'T BELIEVE IT... IT'S A LITTLE PERSON!\" Her two fingers hold you tightly as she lifts you up to her ear, obviously spotting that you were trying to say something to her but your voice was too weak. You decided to stay friendly with the girl and said \"Hey, I'm ____... What's your name?\" The girl nervously laughs at your tiny voice and says very softly \"K... KRISTEN... MY NAME IS KRISTEN. NICE TO MEET YOU. C... CAN I ASK YOU WHY YOU'RE SO... YOU KNOW?\" You tell her the story of how you got shrunk by Madame Rosella and you can see from your perspective Kristen's eyes going wide as she hears the tale. You shouted into her ear from the confines of her fingertips that you were happy she found you but now you just wanted to get back to your girlfriend. She brings you back to the front of her face, and you can see in her eyes that she is somewhat defeated. \"OH... G.. GIRLFRIEND. I SEE...\" She licks her lips and looks down at the ground. How the hell is she this nervous around someone, even if they are only the size of an ant? She stammers out \"I... I WAS KIND OF HOPING YOU WOULD WANT... ME TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND MAYBE.\" You stare back completely confused at the strange proposal that was just brought to your attention. Is this girl serious? You yell up at her \"You have to be joking... you just met me! And besides I have a girlfriend already, i just told you! Why would you think i would want to be your boyfriend right now?\" She bites her lip nervously and says \"I... I DON'T KNOW I JUST FIGURED... I'VE ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF DIFFERENT AND NOW... NOW YOU'RE DIFFERENT TOO, JUST IN A KIND OF SMALLER WAY. PLUS... YOU'RE SO CUTE LIKE THAT... NO BOYS MY OWN SIZE WANT TO DO ANYTHING WITH ME SO MAYBE A TINY LITTLE BOYFRIEND IS WHAT I NEED. I MEAN I... I COULD REALLY TAKE CARE OF YOU. LIKE, I HAVE THIS OLD HAMSTER CAGE AT HOME... THE HAMSTER'S GONE, BUT YOU COULD EASILY FIT IN THAT. AND I COULD FEED YOU AND... AND LET YOU SEE ME WITHOUT MY CLOTHES ON AND STUFF... THAT'S... THAT'S WHAT BOYFRIENDS LIKE, RIGHT?\" You almost feel sorry for this girl. She's obviously so awkward and weird that she doesn't understand how much you want to get back to your REAL girlfriend Maggie, and she's so desperate for any sort of human contact that she immediately fell in love with you after just a few minutes. Then again, some of it is the girl's own fault. She was kind of homely, maybe if she put some effort into her appearance or her hygiene she could get a guy her own size. You decide to let her down kind of gently and say \"Look... Kristen... I think you're really nice and all, but... I don't think it would work out between us! You're a little too young for me and I know it's not what you want to hear but I love this girl and she's probably out worried sick wondering where I am right now, so please... can you help me? I promise we can be friends after all this is taken care of!\" The awkward girl wipes a few small tears from her eyes with her free hand and whispers onto your small body...</span></div></div>",

You struggle in between her fingertips, causing her to laugh at your miserable plight. \"You can't do this! I have a life!

From between the lips, her huge wet tongue pokes you in the stomach and scrapes across your body, covering you in sticky saliva as the lips continue to push into your miniature form. You feel violated, scared, and disgusted being forcefully kissed by this gigantic teenager. She moans with pleasure and whispers to herself \"YOU'RE MINE... ALL MINE... A MAN OF MY OWN...\" You punch and kick at the soft, wet skin, but it's no use. For a solid minute and a half, you are surrounded by this girl's mouth, until she finally removes the fingers from her lips and lays you down in her other palm. She closes her eyes and licks her lips saying \"THAT... WAS... AMAZING, LITTLE MAN... I ALWAYS KNEW MY FIRST KISS WOULD BE SPECIAL... AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE...\" You've had enough. Wiping the spit off of your clothes, you stamp your feet on her hands and scream up at her. \"Listen, you gigantic dork! I don't want to be your boyfriend! I'm already taken! Don't you get that! And even if I was single, i wouldn't go out with you because you're a crazy, obsessive freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard everything you said and her lip starts to quiver. She breaths heavy, letting her huge blasts of hot air hit you square in the face. She leans in over your miniscule form and says \"DON'T... EVER... CALL ME...

She grinds the huge appendage into her palm, trapping you between the two masses of flesh. You can barely breath with all the weight pressing down on your ribs, and you push against the fingertip with all your might. Your efforts are worthless, and Kristen sees this, smiling a wicked, twisted grin. \"WHO'S THE FREAK AGAIN? YOU'RE SO PATHETIC... LIKE A BUG IN MY HAND. I COULD SQUASH YOU IF I WANTED TO... YOU'RE LUCKY I'M SO NICE.\" To prove how \"nice\" she is, she lifts the finger up, just enough to reach back with her thumb and flick you hard in the chest. You roll around in pain on the palm of the giant girl's hand as she beams down at you proudly. She spreads your arms out with her index and middle fingers, trapping you in a crucifix pose on her palm. You are facing up at the crazy girl who's convinced that you're her boyfriend. You are unable to move as her huge face comes crashing down on you again, and her lips cover the entire top half of your body. \"I LOVE YOU, LITTLE BOYFRIEND. SOON YOU'LL... LEARN TO LOVE ME TOO. BUT UNTIL THEN, YOU'RE GOING TO STAY NICE AND CLOSE TO ME... I WON'T EVER LET YOU GO.\" She lowers the palm to the bottom of her make-shift skirt and with her free hand she pulls back the elastic surrounding her waist. Her hand tilts and you go tumbling down into the crazy girl's pants! You land in her bush, surrounded by foul smelling pubic hair and look up to see her smiling at your predicament. \"WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THIS ONCE I GET YOU HOME... BE SAFE IN THERE, LITTLE TINY BOYFRIEND!\" You scream up once more that she's not your girlfriend before the elastic snaps back against her skin, trapping you in darkness. You struggle to regain some form of balance, but her downstairs hair is thick and long, it's impossible for you to do anything but grab onto a few strands and wait for her to stop walking. You sweat heavily in the heated prison for almost a half an hour, being tossed and turned by the giant teen's footsteps. She must have walked to the faire from her house, which only makes the situation worse. You're now being brought miles away from the fair. Maggie is probably worried sick looking for you, and for all she knows, you just left her alone to fend for herself. That's a fight that's bound to happen. You laugh a bit as you take in the obsurdity of the situation and how you would possibly explain it to Maggie. \"Sorry I left you alone honey, but some gypsy shrunk me and i was kidnapped by a girl who hid me next to her pussy!\" You realize that Kristen's footsteps have stopped and you hear her dangling her keys out in front of her. She must be home. You decide to take advantage of the lack of movement and climb up the hairs to the top of her panties. You are just small enough at this point to peek out over the waistband, and when you lift your head up you can see that she's just opened the door to the house. Looking down, you see a sea of blue carpet beneath you with Kristen's massive feet stomping away at them. She removes her sandals and wiggles her toes as she closes the door behind her. The carpet is really far down, but you might be small enough that the fall won't hurt you! You've never tried to jump from a height like this, but anything is better than being trapped in this crazy dork's underwear! You decide to make a jump for it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you can leap to safety, two huge fingers grab your body on either side and lift you off of the clothing. Kristen lifts you up to her face, which is sporting a creepy smile,. To be honest, it scares the hell out of you. You don't even want to imagine what this crazy girl is thinking, but she goes ahead and lets you know. \"MMM... YOU WERE WIGGLING A BIT DOWN THERE... IT FELT AMAZING...I'VE HEARD OF HAVING A BOY TRY TO GET INTO SOMEONE'S PANTS, BUT IT CAN'T BE MORE FUN THAN FEELING THEM TRY TO GET OUT OF THEM....\" You go limp, defeated in your attempt to escape from the crazy bitch. But you'll try again later. The day's just begun. Kristen bites her lip and looks around before whispering to you \"YOU KNOW... MY MOM AND LITTLE SISTER ARE OUT FOR THE WHOLE DAY. SO I WON'T HAVE TO SNEAK YOU INTO MY ROOM. BUT I WANT TO FEEL YOU NEXT TO ME AGAIN...\" And without warning, the fingers drop down to her waist again, the world zooming around you as you're shoved back into the smelly darkness of the girl's panties. This time however, she doesn't just drop you on her bush, but she shoves you in close to her skin with her index finger. You hear her entire body rumble as she shudders with delight feeling your insignificant body up against her lips. The smell is overpowering and you can only cough and wait for the hell to end. \"OH YESSS... FEEL FREE TO... KISS ME DOWN THERE... I LOVE FEELING YOUR LITTLE BODY AGAINST MY BIG PUSSY... MY TINY LITTLE BOYFRIEND...\" You can tell this girl has never been in control of anything before. She looked like a weakling compared to normal girls, and she obviously had little to no friends. She finally has a chance to be a dominant, powerful giantess, and it turns her on. She continues to rub herself using you under her finger as she walks, putting even more pressure on your small body. You can hear her moans and confident laughter as she continues to walk up the stairs to her room. After a few minutes of torture, you feel the pressure leave the small of your back and you gasp for air, climbing through the forest of thick pubes. The two fingers return to fish you out of the panties, and you are brought into the cool, fresh air. You take all the deep breaths you can, happy to be out of the smelly, damp prison for at least a little bit. The fingers lower you down onto a large wooden desk, and you are instantly blinded by a sudden blast of light. When you are able to adjust your eyes to your surroundings again, you see Kristen's gigantic face peering down at you. She chuckles a bit to herself, before licking her lips and moaning. \"YOU ARE JUST PERFECT... WELCOME TO MY ROOM.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room looks exactly like you expected it to after knowing Kristen for only a few hours. It wasn't very well lit, and the wall was covered in a dark purple shade of paint. There were posters all around that look like they were stolen from the back room of a Hot Topic, and some hand drawn etchings all around the room. The desk you were on was obviously a drawing desk, it was covered in ink and scattered papers, with a large collection of pens and pencils in a jar near you. Kristen grabbed a large black pen from the jar and twirled it between her fingers, holding it menacingly over your head. She giggled as she saw your focus on the huge writing utensil, before she tapped it down on the ground close to you. You gulped and slowly made your gaze up to meet her eyes. They were wild with power and perversion as she stared down at your tiny body, each of them surrounded by a considerable amount of mascara. \"I THINK IT'S TIME WE SET SOME GROUND RULES, MY LITTLE BOYFRIEND.\" Uh oh. You did not like where this was going. She gripped the pen tightly and drew a thick black circle around your tiny body, giggling as she sketches. You muster up all the courage you have left and say \"I... I'm not your boyfriend... I have a girlfriend... Her name is Maggie...\" Kristen doesn't even change her tone as she says \"NO... NO MY NAME IS KRISTEN. THAT'S RULE NUMBER ONE... YOU NEVER HAD A GIRLFRIEND BEFORE ME. THAT'S A LIE. I AM YOUR GIRLFRIEND, AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN YOUR GIRLFRIEND.\" She draws another circle next to the one she circumnavigated around you, and began to draw a little stick figure, about your size. Her huge powerful hands went to work as she began to sketch a version of you, and while she did this, she continued her list of regulations. \"SECONDLY, YOU LOVE ME. YOU HAVE TO, THAT'S WHAT BOYFRIENDS DO. AND BOYFRIENDS DON'T LEAVE THEIR GIRLFRIENDS.\" You sit down indian-style and stare down at the ground, realizing that there's no way you'll ever be able to talk this crazy girl into letting you leave. You're going to be held captive as this girl's prisoner for the rest of your life. But she honstly believes in her mind that you want to be her boyfriend! \"AND SINCE YOU'RE GOING TO STAY WITH ME FOREVER... I WON'T LET YOU LEAVE MY SIGHT. IF YOU TRY TO GET AWAY FROM ME... I'LL FIND YOU.\" She puts the pen down and lays her hand out over the drawing of you, and you look over at it. It's actually more than a stick figure, more like a miniature etching. It's got your clothes and facial features, very well carried over to the paper. She's... actually very good at making caricatures, you think to yourself. She lays her hand down flat on the paper and extends her thumb, giving a sound like she's thinking out loud. \"AND YOU'RE JUST... SO MUCH SMALLER THAN MY THUMB. IT WOULD TAKE NOTHING FOR ME TO JUST LIFT IT UP AND... SQUASH YOU.\" She lifts the huge thumb and lets it fall down onto the drawing. She leaves the thumb on the paper while moving her hand around, making the motion that she's squashing the small likeness of yourself. She lifts the huge digit off, to show you the smeared ink stain on the paper, with it's remains displayed proudly on the fingertip of her thumb. Your blood goes cold as she whispers down to you \"BECAUSE IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU, THEN NOBODY WILL.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can actually see her trying to hold back a smile as she says this to you. She's putting on the facade of a dominant, powerful girl, but you can tell that she's loving the feeling of controlling a tiny four inch tall man. Before today she was just another nerdy outcast with no friends or love interests. Now she had a boy literally crawling at her feet and she wasn't going to let him go so easily. You feel your will break as you look up at her tall, pale face, and say \"Y... Yes, Kristen.\" She smiles but the dominant, cold face returns almost immediately as she shakes her head and says \"NO... NO. I DON'T WANT YOU TO CALL ME KRISTEN... YOU'RE GOING TO TREAT ME LIKE... LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TREAT YOUR GIRLFRIEND. LIKE A QUEEN. SO I WANT YOU TO REFER TO ME AS YOUR QUEEN FROM NOW ON. I... I THINK I'D LIKE THAT.\" You swallow all of your pride and look up at the dorky girl who's basically ruined your life as you say \"Yes... My Queen.\" She giggles and holds her hand up to her mouth to stop herself from snorting as she takes in the power she has over you. You have never been so humiliated in your life. After taking a minute to soak it all in, Kristen lowers her hand facing up, and says \"THIS IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF OUR LIVES, LITTLE BOYFRIEND. CLIMB INTO MY HAND, AND LET'S START HAVING SOME... FUN WITH OUR NEW RELATIONSHIP.\" You slowly walk over to her huge waiting hand, and gaze up at the girl one more time. You realize that once you start playing along with her, there could be no turning back. If you were going to do something... ANYTHING... you'd have to do it now. You decide to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If you were going to do something, you'd have to do it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...this lonely, pathetic freak of a girl would probably kill you if you tried anything now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have your pride, but you don't want to die. You swallow it down and climb into her palm, hating every part of it. You especially hate the look of unbridled joy radiating from her face as you do so. \"GOOD BOY!\" She exclaims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M SO PROUD OF YOU! TRYING TO MAKE ME HAPPY BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD BOYFRIEND!\" You can tell that she's getting wrapped up in her delusions again, and you don't even try to argue as she turns and walks over to - you get a horrible, sinking feeling, - her bed, where she sits down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares down at you in her hand, actually looking kind of uncertain and nervous all of a sudden, seemingly trying to think of what to do or say next. You try to use this to your advantage, and think fast on what to say yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So listen,\" you interrupt her thoughts, quickly, your mind still racing to think ahead. \"I've been thinking, you know, obviously you're my girlfriend and all, right, but, you know, maybe we should try taking it slow for a while? I mean, I'm not saying I don't love you or anything,\" you add hurriedly, as she frowns down at you. \"It's just, I respect you too much to, y'know, want to, uh, rush you, or anything... it's, uh... I feel like it's more meaningful, if we wait...\" You trail off under the weight of her stare, and go silent. Suddenly, she seems to reach a decision, and squeezes you tightly in her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S OKAY, HONEY. I UNDERSTAND\" she tells you, dropping down to lie on her stomach with you held tightly in her grip. \"BUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TREATING ME LIKE A QUEEN, REMEMBER?\" She holds you right in front of her face, propped up on her elbows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like your ribs are going to break. You struggle to muster together just enough breath for a response. \"Y-yes. My Queen!\" \"SORRY, WHAT WAS THAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>YesmyQueen!</i>\" It takes all you have. She giggles. \"AWW, THAT'S SO SWEET! I LOVE IT WHEN YOU CALL ME THAT.\" You think she's going to relax her grip, but she doesn't - all she does is move it down from your chest to your legs, which is only slightly less painful, but at least you can breathe now. \"DON'T WORRY, WE CAN WAIT A BIT BEFORE I LET YOU SEE ME NAKED.\" She takes her other hand and yanks your shirt over your head without warning, nearly dislocating one of your arms as it catches in the fabric. \"I WANT TO SEE YOU, THOUGH.\" Her eyes widen with delight, and she lets go of your tortured legs to let you drop into the palm of her other hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STRIP,\" she commands, almost panting with excitement. At this point, you don't even think about it. You just scramble to undo your pants and toss them aside, terrified. You lose your shoes and boxers too, without being asked. Kristen's mouth hangs wide open as she watches you. Wordlessly, as if in a trance, she brings you up to her mouth and shoves your head into her lips again. \"OH, HONEY\" she mutters, blasting incredible noise and less-than-savory hot breath right into your face. \"YOU ARE GOING TO BE A GREAT LITTLE BOYFRIEND FOR ME. I'M SO HAPPY I FOUND YOU!\" You sputter and wipe at your face to keep her slimy drool from running into your mouth, but it's pointless, because she opens her mouth and brings you in for another \"kiss\" right away anyhow. You try to lean away, but there's only so much room to maneuver, and inevitably you find your head passing in between her cracked lips, past her... (well, okay, actually her teeth seem fine, little bit off-white is all, pretty much normal) teeth, and you can't really do much of anything against the overpowering muscles as she starts licking and slobbering all over your head and chest. You take some solace, at least, in the knowledge that this filthy slob is licking off the must that you'd picked up from that unkempt bush of hers. Strictly speaking the tongue and cheeks working over you should feel pretty good, as well, in and of itself - if, say, it was Maggie doing it to you, instead of this scary, unhinged dork you ran into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it's not. Maggie has excellent oral hygiene and technique, as you can attest. This girl's an artless slobberer with stale breath, and you spend most of the time while she's (as she probably thinks) Frenching you, just struggling to wipe as much of the unpleasantly odorous spit as possible from your face, in between intrusions where her slimy tongue bats your arms away and delivers another heaping glob of it all over you. This keeps going for another full two minutes before she decides it's enough, closes her lips over your stomach, and just starts sucking on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, that's even worse; it's cleaner, but also tighter. Not only can you not avoid being squeezed between her tongue and the roof of her mouth all the time, but Kristen apparently has no sense of pressure, and how it relates to you <i>trying to fucking breathe in there</i>. Each round literally sucks all the air out of your lungs, leaving you to gasp whatever used breath flows in from her throat from time to time, between pulls. Worse, she keeps going like this for several more minutes before finally pulling you back out, and at that point you're already nearly on the verge of passing out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. I LOVE FEELING YOU CLOSE TO ME.\" Kristen trying to be sensual. Even if it wasn't just pathetically awkward, to you the words sound distant, faded, and your vision is blurry. Within a couple of seconds, though, the oxygen spreads through your system, and it clears up just in time for you to see that you're being carried down, back into the dark and horrible recesses under her skirt. For the third time today, she slides you down into her bush. This time she doesn't just stop at leaving you there or holding you, but spreads her legs apart and actively rubs your tired body between the lips. \"DON'T YOU LOVE... HAVING ME AS YOUR QUEEN?\" She pants, waves of pleasure breaking over her from below. She's really convinced herself that you think of her that way, and it excites her to no end that for once in her life, she has complete power over somebody who both absolutely loves and totally respects her. She feels the back of your head with a finger, and makes sure to guide it right into the middle as you're moved back and forth, gasping a little when she realizes she can feel your breath on her pink as you struggle against her. </span></div></div>",

I LOVE YOU TOO, LITTLE MAN.\" You look up and see that she has her eyes closed, and she's licking her lips, no doubt deep in thought about all the sick things she's got planned for you. You see an opportunity and take it. You take a big breath and bite down hard on the flesh in front of you. You are tossed off harshly as the hand is lifted up into the sky. \"OWW! YOU LITTLE SHIT! WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?!\" You tumble onto the desk and land on a piece of paper, which surprisingly breaks your fall. You realize you may have made a mistake as you see the huge form of Kristen sucking on her sore thumb, looking down at the desk with malicious intent. You pick yourself up and start running in a blind flurry. Her desk is propped against a wall, with a window level with the floor you're darting across. That's convenient! If you can make your way to the window, maybe there's a chance you can escape! It's going to be a hell of a fall, but anything would be better than being the slave of this evil dork! You feel a presence behind you and peek over your shoulder, only to see Kristen's huge face looming over your body. Her eyes are teary from the pain and betrayal, and her voice is deafening as she screams down at your miniscule form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU FUCKING BASTARD! I'LL TEACH YOU TO HURT ME! YOU CAN'T HURT BIG PEOPLE LIKE THAT!\" You desperately keep running across the huge expanse of the desk table, making it more than halfway to the window when a huge pink barrier slams down in front of you. \"STOP RUNNING, OR I'M GOING TO CRUSH YOU LIKE A FUCKING BUG!\" You know that she's not lying, but don't care. You need to get away from the crazy bitch that's almost toying with you at this point. You leap over the first finger and run across the skin of her hand, leaping off and rolling back into a sprint. You are amazed that you're not out of breath or fatigued, and you think it must be a side effect of the spell. At least you have a chance! You finally make it to the edge of the table, and close your eyes as you prepare to take a leap of faith. The desk was flush against the wall, so all you had to do was make it off of the tabletop without any incident. Your concentration is broken however as you hear behind you \"NO! YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM ME! I'LL KILL YOU BEFORE I LET YOU GO!\" You can almost feel her breath behind you as you know she's reaching for you to halt your escape. But you have to do this. You don't even look behind you and jump off the table...</span></div></div>",

You shake your head, figuring if she's never had a boyfriend... she's probably never done it... You smirk and decide to be a \"good\" Boyfriend and... please your \"new girl\" You place your hands on her young, untouched lips, immediately getting a shiver in response. \"AH....What are you doing in there little boy~?...S-seriously what are you doing?\" You could hear the fear in that last part of her sentence, you had her completely at your whim. You rubbed her folds a bit more, her clit slowly emerging... the scents and aromas getting stronger and thicker. You could hear the giantess panting above. \"Kristen? is that you?\" You hear a female voice call out. \"Y-yeah Trish I-its me... came back from the fair, heading to my room see ya..\" Immediately you feel your world shift around you. She is running as though her life depended on it. You, unfortunately were at the right place ... at the wrong time. Due to her running you were pressed against her entire slit, causing her to moan and secrete more juices from within... lubing you up for your inevitable plunge. You realize your mistake all to late in trying to please your captor. You try to push and kick yourself away from her massive cooch and get your foot stuck in a small fleshy hole. \"Crap!\" you shout to yourself as you hear Kristen open and slam the door shut. \"L-little man?!

Get me out!\" \"I-i'm trying! S-stop squirming... ah... s-stop...\" You try your best and stop moving, but her clumsy fingers accidentally push your other foot inside, sliding you into her up to your calves. \"AH! Kristen!

Deeper...\" Before you can ask her what she means... you feel a finger on your head as your pressed deeper into her.

Her eyes pierce into your skull as she whispers harshly \"IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU, NOBODY CAN... I'M TAKING YOU BACK TO THE GYPSY WOMAN... HOPEFULLY SHE'LL SMUSH YOU FLAT.\" She leaves you with that thought as the world whizzes around you and she puts her hand to her sides, hiding you from the public at large. You scream up to her to reconsider, but it's no use. Between the overwhelming distance between the giant dork's fingers and face, and the fact that your tiny lungs are being squeezed mercilessly within her grasp, there's no way of getting her attention. She's walking with a purpose and you can see a small, spiteful grin form on the girl's face as you reenter the tent you fought so hard to get away from. You can smell the familiar potpourri in the air, and can feel the humid wind blowing all around you. You're definitely back in the mystical presence of the gypsy woman who shrunk you in the first place. Her large, booming voice returns and you flinch a bit as you hear \"WELCOME, WELCOME TO MY TENT, YOUNG ONE. WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP YOU?\" Kristen starts to sweat a bit in her palms, which dampens your clothes as she nervously says to the powerful witch \"UM... HELLO. MY NAME IS KRISTEN... I WAS JUST WANDERING THROUGH THE GROUNDS WHEN... WHEN I CAME ACROSS SOMETHING I THINK BELONGS TO YOU.\" The hand you're in flattens out and you stand exposed in the center of Kristen's palm, staring up at the gigantic gypsy yet again. With a big toothy grin, she reaches down and pokes you with a long fingernail, saying \"THOUGHT YOU COULD ESCAPE FROM MADAME ROSELLA, DIDN'T YOU?\" She looks up at Kristen and clasps her hands together, saying \"THANK YOU, DEARY. YOU'VE BEEN A BIG HELP TO ME... BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT SEE THAT YOU ARE TROUBLED. PLEASE, WON'T YOU SIT DOWN? AND BRING THE SMALL ONE AS WELL.\" You are carried over to the table and harshly dropped on the counter, staring up at both giant women on either side of you. Neither of them want anything to do with you right now that's not mean-spirited, and you can only wait and see what the gypsy decides to do with you. For now, Rosella asks for Kristen's palm, which she reluctantly gives out. After feeling around on her hand for a split second and reciting a similar incantation to when she first spoke to you, her eyes shoot wide open and she smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU ARE DESPERATE FOR THE TOUCH OF A MAN, NO?\" Kristen is obviously taken aback by this revalation from the total stranger and slowly nods, blushing pretty heavily. Rosella smiles and continues. \"YOU HAVE BEEN AN OUTCAST. A LONER. THE WORLD DOESN'T SEEM TO SPIN AT THE RIGHT SPEED FOR YOU, AND IT REFLECTS ON YOUR PERSONALITY. I CAN SEE EVERYTHING IN YOUR HAND HERE, DARLING. YOUR HOPES, YOUR DREAMS, YOUR MEMORIES. AND THEY ALL SEEM TO SCREAM OUT THAT YOU... WANT TO BE LOVED.\" The nodding is heavier and more rapid this time as Kristen seems to be falling for whatever the gypsy has to tell her. To your surprise, you feel two huge fingertips grip either side of you as Madame Rosella lifts you up and dangles you in front of Kristen's pie-eyed face. \"THIS ONE HAS REJECTED YOUR ADVANCES OF LOVE, NO? HE SITES PRIOR COMMITMENTS AND FAILURE TO ADAPT TO A LIFE WITH YOU?\" Kristen says a little bit more determined than you'd like to hear \"Y...YES. HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE WITH ME.  HE DOESN'T LOVE ME.\" This is ridiculous. It wasn't a matter of not loving her, you'd just met her! And you had to remind her time and time again that you were happily in a relationship and that being shrunk down to the size of a thumbtack wasn't going to change that! But that's when Madame Rosella said the words that would change your life forever: \"WELL, WHY HAS THAT STOPPED YOU?\" Kristen looked confused and you looked horrified as the gypsy placed you softly in the waiting girl's open palm again. With one quick wave of her extended finger, you feel your body get just a little bit larger.  You're still able to stand in her palm a paltry 3 or 4 inches tall now, and beneath your feet you can actually feel Kristen's body shaking with excitement and power.  \"HE'S OBVIOUSLY IN NO POSITION TO DENY YOUR ADVANCES. YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO LET BOYS DICTATE YOUR RELATIONSHIPS. THIS IS ONE BOY WHO CAN NOT ORDER YOU AROUND. WHO CAN NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU... WHO WILL DO LITERALLY ANYTHING YOU ASK HIM TO WITHOUT QUESTION.\" Kristen's eyes start to sparkle as she begins to realize the power she now holds with you in her hands. She would have you as her personal, tiny boyfriend. No matter what you wanted. You almost start to break down in tears knowing that no matter what happens for the rest of the day, you're going home with an emotionaly distraught psychopath who's obsessed over your little body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE'S MUCH BETTER OFF WITH YOU. I WOULD FEED HIM TO THE PETS I ALREADY HAVE OR LET HIM DIE OUT IN THE FOREST. HE'S CAUSED ME NOTHING BUT TROUBLE. MAYBE A FEW MONTHS WITH YOU WOULD STRAIGHTEN THAT OUT?\" You couldn't believe what you were hearing. MONTHS?! She actually wanted to keep you like this for longer than a few days or weeks? The hand beneath you shifted and you felt yourself get caught between redwood sized fingers in the nerdy girl's grip tightening as she squealed with excitement.  You are brought right up close to her beaming face as she pushes her glasses back into place on her nose and licks her lips. \"YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE BEST BOYFRIEND EVER... AND THE BEST PART IS YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO ESCAPE ME.\" You feel the color drain from your face as the cackling in the background gets louder and louder. You could feel Rosella's enjoyment in this whole situation and look over to see if there's anything you can do to stop her. The gypsy woman reaches into a small box underneath her table and grabs something with her hand, covering it with the other. She walks over slowly to Kristen's proud face and says \"I'LL CHECK ON YOU AGAIN WHEN THE FESTIVAL COMES BACK INTO TOWN, SAY IN HALF A YEAR? THERE'S JUST ONE QUESTION I HAVE TO ASK YOU BEFORE YOU WALK OUT OF MY TENT HOLDING THE LITTLE MOUSE MAN...\" Kristen starts to get nervous and you as well, not knowing what's up this crazy witch's sleeve. She beams down at you and winks before saying to Kristen...</span></div></div>",

Her grasp tightens slightly, causing you to have difficulty breathing.  Admittedly, it is somewhat relieving since the giant women's voices now seem a little closer to normal since your ears are being muffled by one of their hands.  Kristen stutters, barely able to contain herself.  \"Tw.. TWO little pets?  That's, uh... that would be amazing, but... i have no money to give you in exchange for the other one...\"  The gypsy just laughs at her and says \"Please, darling.  Money means very little to Madame Rosella, otherwise I would be living a much more extravegant lifestyle.  All you have to do is swear to me that you will repay me with a favor at some point in the future.  I don't know what it is yet, but you must promise me that you will do as I ask.  Otherwise i will make you as small as your friend there.\"  You can actually feel her gulping through the skin of her hand as she says \"I.. I swear it!  You can trust me!\"  Rosella replies \"Very well.  After I lost my pet there, another obnoxious welp came in and bothered me, so i reduced her to a similar stature.  You can take her off my hands before i'm compelled to step on her.\"  You are brought back out into the fresh air as Kristen releases her grip and holds her palm out, willing to accept her second gift.  The giant gypsy deposits a woman of your same height into the waiting hand next to you, and you are able to see who was shrunk along with you...</span></div></div>",

Rosella stands in front of her and says \"What happened to your little man there will soon be your fate as well.  Get ready to live the rest of your life smaller than a mouse!\"  As you feel Kristen panicking around you, you feel that you're about to do the same.

You decide that it's now or never as you leap off your perch in the woman's palm, and fly down her pant leg to the slope of her foot.  Sliding off, you land harshly on a small bed of drying grass which breaks your fall somewhat.  You don't feel anything's broken, but you don't have too much time to check:  There's still two giant women you have to avoid!  The girl nearest you is still getting smaller and you decide to take advantage of her size while you can and run behind her leg in the opposite direction.  You figure the witch's gaze will be directed towards the dwindling girl, allowing you to make a break for it.  When you hear a voice behind you say \"EXCELLENT.  JUST AS SMALL AS YOUR FRIEND.\"  You know that the process is complete.  You don't run any further, for fear of being noticed, and instead hide your tiny body behind an obscenely large patch of grass.  Each blade is three times taller than the height of your body, but you don't marvel at that while there is a real life goddess at play just a few yards from your position.  The ground shakes with each footstep as she marches her bare feet closer and closer to the shrunken doll that was once known as Kristen.  She is truly pathetic, shaking and crying as the goddess before her wiggles her toes in delight.  It never ceases to amaze you just how proud of her own work Madame Rosella seems to be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peek through the grass and see the humongous form of the gypsy scanning the ground around Kristen.  She looks even more intimidating than before somehow.  \"DAMMIT!  WHERE DID THE OTHER LITTLE WORM GO?  HE'D BETTER NOT HAVE SHRUNK DOWN AGAIN WHILE YOU WERE HOLDING HIM, I HAD PLANS FOR THAT LITTLE RAT!\"  You sigh a breathe of relief, knowing that you at least made the right decision by jumping out of Kristen's hand before you ended up even smaller as a result of the witch's magic.  Rosella grunts angrily and says \"WELL, HE CAN'T HAVE GOTTEN VERY FAR.  I'LL DEAL WITH HIM IN A SECOND.  BUT FIRST, YOU MUST PAY FOR YOUR INSOLENCE.\"  You see Kristen on her knees now, begging the giant gypsy not to harm her.  You have a feeling the efforts are for naught as the gypsy begins rhythmically tapping her foot, and it's not hard to imagine her lifting it up just slightly enough to squash the miniature girl underneath the dirty sole.  Kristen cries up \"Please, madame!  Don't... Don't C-Crush Me!  I didn't do anything w-wrong!\"  The gypsy just squints down at her in an almost disbelieving manner and says \"OF COURSE YOU DID WRONG BY ME!  YOU ATTEMPTED TO LEAVE MY TENT WITH MY PROPERTY!  THAT OTHER LITTLE WRETCH BELONGS TO ME!  AND NOW SO DO YOU.  NOW GET OFF YOUR KNEES AND ACCEPT YOUR DESTINY.\"  You are completely torn on how to feel here.  On one hand, you are free to leave the tent and get help, or at least stand by and let nature take it's course.  After all, this girl attempted to turn you into her shrunken slave forever... but then again she's still a person.  Do you really want to stand by and do nothing while the giant woman toys with her?  It's decision time:  Do you play the hero or just walk away?</span></div></div>",

A little part of you wasn't expecting to make it out of this situation at all.  But you still figured jumping to your death at this point would be better than living your life shrunk to a size so ridiculously miniscule you could fit inside an insect's mouth.  Your eyes begin to tear up from the velocity you're heading towards the ground, and so you close your eyes, fully expecting to hit the ground hard enough to rush your bones.  However, this is not the case as you find your body come into contact with a soft surface, radiating with a low layer of heat.  You don't get up from your position, but rather lay flat on your stomach as you landed, runiing your hand across the strange peach-colored plain you've ended up on.  Judging from a slight odor around you, it doesn't take you too long to realize exactly where you are... and how unlucky you truly are.  A familiar wicked laughter fills the air as the gypsy says high above you \"WELL THIS IS CERTAINLY FASCINATING, LITTLE BUG.  ARE YOU SO DESPERATE TO BE UNDER MY FOOT THAT YOU JUMPED ATOP IT?\"  The shadow over you grows more intense as the gypsy reaches down effortlessly to pluck you off of her foot with one hand.  As she wraps you in her soft fist, she whispers to herself \"NOW WHERE DID MY SECOND LITTLE PET WANDER OFF TO?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel the gypsy's footsteps ring through her skin as she holds you, her heartbeat pulsing through her fingertips as she scowers the ground for a similarly smaller girl.  \"COME OUT, COME OUT, WHEREVER YOU ARE... I KNOW YOU'RE CLOSE, YOUR LITTLE LEGS CAN'T HAVE TAKEN YOU TOO FAR!\"  Your head is sticking out from Madame Rosella's grip, but you are unable to turn or move your head.  All you can do is face her pretty bare waist and revealing top as she holds you close.  But you can clearly hear her as she gets closer and closer to her prize.  \"AHA, THERE YOU ARE!  FIRST YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD TAKE MY LITTLE MAN AWAY FROM ME, THEN YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD HIDE BEHIND A CHAIR LEG?  YOU ARE A  FOOLISH LITTLE GIRL, AREN'T YOU?\"  You can hear danielle's high pitched screams as the giantess reaches out for her, grabbing her in a similar fashion that you were captured.  The gypsy stands up and holds the two of you out in front of her, clenching one shrunken person in each hand.  \"AT LEAST YOU HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO HIDE FROM ME.  THIS ONE HERE JUMPED ONTO MY FOOT AND SPREAD HIS ARMS OUT, PRACTICALLY BEGGING ME TO SQUASH HIM.\"  You look across the witch's body and see Danielle trapped in her other fist.  The girl is obviously not taking the whole \"being small\" thing well and tears are streaming down her face.  You remember a fair amount of begging and pleading from your end when you were shrunk as well, but you hope it didn't look as pathetic as she does.  The gypsy brings you both up to her face and darts her eyes back and forth as she focuses on one of you at a time.  \"TWO NEW LITTLE PETS.  DOUBLE THE FUN.\"  She looks back over to Danielle and smirks as she puckers her lips forward, blowing out a stream of hot air which blows the doll-sized girl's hair back.  She begins crying from terror even harder, which only makes the gypsy more pleased with her work.  \"NOW THAT I HAVE YOU BOTH RIGHT WHERE I WANT YOU, I MUST ADMIT THAT THIS DAY HAS TAKEN A LOT OUT OF ME.  I'M FEELING QUITE...\"</span></div></div>",

The force at which it hit the ground is enough to send you flying back several feet, landing hard on your back.  When you dust yourself off and manage to sit back up, you are left in awe at the gigantic piece of footwear before you.  It's much more intimidating than when you were before the gypsy's bare foot.  This looks like a battleship of cloth and stitching, with a significant amount of heat and the smell of fresh leather coming off of it.  The boots are knee-high, giving you a lot to trace upwards as you look to where it ends.  The boots connect seamlessly to a pair of tight leather pants and a black tank top tucked within.  The giantess in front of you is a bit of a goth-y tomboy.  She's not too skinny, but is still undeniably attractive, and standing before you the way she does, she is an absolute goddess.  You can't see her face too clearly from where you are on the ground, but you can tell that she's got a long stream of blonde hair framing it, with pink highlights at the ends.  She looks beautiful, but you can tell she is incredibly dangerous and once she speaks you can see that she's also... a bit on the kinky side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT.  I'VE BEEN WANDERING AROUND THIS DAMN PARK FOR TWO HOURS, AND I STILL HAVEN'T SEEN A WEAPONS DISPLAY.  GOTTA GET ME A COOL LOOKING KNIFE OR TWO.\"  You see that she's distracted as she reaches into her pocket to pull out a map of the festival, and realize that you've got a few minutes before she moves again.  Running over to her huge boot, you scream up at her and wave your arms.  But your voice is too small and weak for someone that huge to hear you, even if you're standing literally an inch from her foot.  So you take a look at the massive boot before you and sigh knowing that you'd have to climb atop it to get her attention.  You go to the toe section, and using the ridges of the shoe, manage to grip onto it, lifting your body up on top.  You are standing on the toe section, and stop for a second in a moment of panic when you feel movement behind you.  The legs are still stationary but you feel a rotating, quick movement from beneath you.  You realize that inside her boot, she must be wiggling her toes.  The smallest of movements from her makes you realize that the last place you'd like to be is underneath those gigantic feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEHE, THERE WE GO.  SWORDS AND SUPPLIES, SECTION B-4.  PERFECT.\"  With a quick laugh, the giantess puts the map back in her pocket, intent on finding some sharp objects to \"play\" with.  You realize that this girl would be a bit on the wild side even at normal size, you don't know how she'd treat someone who was as big as her toenail.  So you've got a choice to make... do you stay with her and hope for the best, or is the risk simply not worth it?</span></div></div>",

You are less than a foot tall and still shrinking fast as the beautiful romanian woman crouches down to get a better look at you.  She's got a smile of undeniable satisfaction as she watches you shrivel away to nothing.  \"THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART.  WATCHING THE LOOKS ON YOUR PATHETIC LITTLE FACES AS YOU BECOME SMALLER AND SMALLER.  BUT I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU AMONG THE DIRT JUST YET, SO COME HERE...\"  Rosella's massive hand reaches towards you and plucks you off of the ground effortlessly by her thumb and forefinger.  The world zooms by you as you are whisked into the heavens, smelling nothing but the strong scent of the gyspsy's hand lotion as she carries you north.  When you finally stop, you find that you're still shrinking and the giant woman's grip is loosening on you (not by her own power, just from the fact that you've basically become unmanagable).  You slip between the two fingers, freefalling for what seems like minutes, before coming to land on a soft, plushy ground that breaks your fall.  A deep, but familiar laugh haunts the air as you attempt to stand on the uneven ground, completely unaware of your surroundings.  That is until you notice that the smell of the particular lotion has gotten significantly stronger, and the ground appears to be scaly, yet soft.  And colored a dark shade of peach.  You are about to scream when you realize where you've landed, but that's when you see the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of times taller than you, blinks the eye of an absolute goddess, squinting to get a better look at the speck on her finger.  The laughter returns more powerful than before, and then the goddess speaks, which shudders you to your core with every syllable.  \"THERE WE ARE.  NO MORE ARE YOU TALL.  NO MORE ARE YOU EVEN HUMAN.  YOU ARE A SPECK.  A FRAGMENT OF DUST ON MADAME ROSELLA'S FINGER.  YOU ARE NOTHING TO ME NOW.\"  You scream up at her, begging her to change you back, but you know that even with all her powers, she probably can't hear your pleas.  You are truly worthless, just a little piece of dirt clinging to the skin of her fingertip.  That's how she views you and now that's what you've become.  She continues, every word shaking you to your core.  \"WHEN I READ THE CARDS OF A MAN, AND LOOK INTO THEIR EYES, I SEE THEIR SOUL.  IN THEIR SOUL SHINES THEIR TRUE SIZE.  YOURS IS LESS THAN THAT OF A FLEA.  SO I HAVE HELPED YOU BECOME JUST A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO YOUR TRUE SELF.  INSIGNIFICANT AND POWERLESS, LIKE MOST MEN.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a rustle of activity at the gypsy's tent opening, and she smirks, whispering down to you \"UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS WHERE I MUST LEAVE YOU.  I MUST TEND MY PRIORITIES TO SOMETHING THAT IS A LITTLE BIT... TALLER.  FAREWELL, LITTLE MAN.  AND REMEMBER:  YOU BROUGHT THIS UPON YOURSELF.\"  You are terrified as every bit of movement from her finger causes your entire word to shake and the eye begins to fade away from your vision.  She is moving her hand to do something, but what exactly?!</span></div></div>",

While you are no longer trapped on the giant woman's fingertip, you are now stuck between the grooves of two of her mighty toes!  The massive foot around you moves with fierce velocity and power as you are stuck to the sweat collected in between her toes.  She walks slowly over to the front of her tent, causing earthquake after earthquake with each thunderous step.  When she gets to the flap, you hear her deep, powerful voice say \"HMM.. NO CUSTOMERS.  MUST HAVE JUST BEEN THE WIND.\"  And after closing the flap, she repeats her process, travelling to the other side of her tent where her table sits.  Each step she takes causes you to nauseously toss and turn between the two humongous toes you are wedged between, until finally coming to a rest.  You manage to wiggle your way off of the sweaty wall of flesh, landing on the firm, spongy material that makes up her enormous sandal.  You gaze up at her massive foot before you, realizing just how insignificant you are as you can't even see far enough to make out anything past her knees.  But you can hear her almighty voice thundering down at you from the heavens.  The voice of a goddess taunting you as you stand between her big and second toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DO YOU WISH TO KNOW JUST HOW PATHETIC AND SMALL YOU ARE?  MY SENSES ARE HEIGHTENED BY MY MAGIC.  SMELL, TASTE AND TOUCH ARE ALL ENHANCED.  AND YET I CANNOT FEEL YOUR MINISCULE PRESENCE NEAR MY BIG TOE.  YOU ARE TRULY NOTHING TO ME.\"  You stare open-jawed at the titanic toes before you as they wiggle freely, threatening to crush you with each insignificant movement.  The goddess before you cackles loudly as she continues to berate you.  \"YOU WERE PROBABLY ALWAYS THIS WORTHLESS AND NEVER REALIZED IT.  NOW YOU WILL REMAIN NOTHING BUT A SPECK OF DIRT AT MY FEET UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE YOURSELF OTHERWISE.\"  Her feet stop moving for a split second and you pay attention to her instructions, realizing she may give you a way out. \"CLIMB MY MAGNIFICENT BODY.  SCALE THE MILES OF FLESH BEFORE YOU, AND IF YOU MANAGE TO GRAB MY ATTENTION, I MAY JUST BE INCLINED TO RESTORE YOU TO A MORE MANAGEABLE SIZE.  IF NOT, YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO CRAWL UNDERNEATH MY TOENAIL AND LIVE WITH THE REST OF THE GERMS.\"  The air around you is musky and damp, and you know that there's at least a chance for you to live at a normal size if you scale this massive beauty.  Or you can take the cowards way out, and try to live your live as a speck in the grass at the gypsy's feet.  The choice is yours:</span></div></div>",

Gulping nervously, you walked across the spongey surface of the gypsy's sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully she was sitting down and not on the move, otherwise this would be nigh impossible. The downside was since she was stationary the only thing to breath was the damp and musky air that was her foot odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made you want to gag, but in the end you powered through. Eventually you reached the grove of her foot. The last time you were here you were literally stuck to it a hood ornament. You then looked between the two massive toes and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course both toes were covered in sweat. You were already coated in the stuff after Rosella wiped you off. Still, a small part of you hoped this Odyssey would be less hot and sticky. Oh well, at least you could use the stuff to climb the gypsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a running start and jumped at the gypsy's big toe. Just like before you stuck right to it. Unfortunately some of her taste made it's way into your mouth. You frantically began to spit in every direction. How could something so sexy be so nasty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway. with a bit of effort, you manage to start scaling Rosella's big toe. At your size however it's like scaling a miniature mountain.

Seeing as you didn't have the strength to continue forward at the moment, you heeded you body and collapsed onto the soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile lying down all you could do was think about this daunting task you'd been given by the gypsy. Just how were you supposed to get her attention if you managed to survive this journey? All your hard work would mean nothing if you couldn't make her take notice of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile up above, Madam Rosella sat at her table enjoying the latest Times magazine. Even though she was thoroughly content not being bothered by customers at the moment, her thoughts drifted back to your diminished form. She wasn't lying when she said you were beneath her notice. Even now she couldn't sense you or even tell if you've made any progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would be lying if she said she wasn't curious about your current fate. Did you endeavor to make the climb? Had you advanced forward and were making your way up? Or had you already died and been reduced to paste beneath her sole. Actually now that she thought about it, you were too small to be squished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad for you. That meant you'd have no choice but to endure a world of flesh, sweat, and foot stink. Perhaps that what you preferred? A part of her hoped you'd just give up and crawl under her nail with the rest of the germs. At least then if she ever shrank someone else as tiny as you, you could tell them Madam Rosella was unbeatable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again the woman trapped in the toe ring on her right foot served that purpose well enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack down below, you were finally rested enough to continue. Rolling your shoulders you continued your trek, but stopped when you saw the golden ring on Madam Rosella's middle toe. You noticed it before but didn't pay much mind. Now at this size you could really see it in full detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no harm you jog over to the immense golden ring with the green jewel in the center. Compared to you this thing was almost like a pyramid. You were about to walk away until you heard a sound not unlike fists against glass. You turned back around wondering if your mind was playing tricks on you, but to your own shock the sound was coming from the jewel at the top of the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow was this possible? Was this a trick by the gypsy to halt your progress? You wouldn't put it past her. But still your curiosity was peaked. Did you dare investigate? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd never know you were trapped on the finger of the gypsy unless she said it openly, and judging by the smirk your giantess captor is giving you, you know for a fact that is not going to happen.  \"YES OF COURSE DARLING.  TAKE A SEAT.  I WAS JUST WIPING SOME DIRT OFF OF MY HANDS.\"  As Maggie takes her seat across from the evil witch, you are treated to a view of the gypsy's pretty plump lips as the finger you're resting on is brought up towards them.  Faster than you can comprehend, the massive lips pucker into a circle, releasing a flurry of hot air in your direction.  Within seconds you are flung off of your perch by the gargantuan woman's breath, and find yourself freefalling in the air.  You are terrified as to where you might land or with what force, but you close your eyes from the wind hitting your face and brace yourself for impact.  through your squinting eyes you can make out the enormous form of your girlfriend, and she only seems to be getting larger.  You come into contact with a soft but firm surface, and you're so weak and pathetic that the force of the blow knocks you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are rustled awake by the sound of mountains moving around you.  You immediately get to your feet and try to regain your bearings, woozy from the flight.  You feel a familiar radiating body heat all around you, but you note that the air smells much different.  You must not be near Madame Rosella anymore, which can only mean one thing:  She's blown you across the table and now you're close to your monolithic girlfriend!  A little part of your fears for Maggie's safety, knowing exactly what this witch is capable of, but you're a little preoccupied with your current state.  You have to try to get her attention at the size of a grain of sand, but for starters... you need to figure out exactly where you've landed.  You know that you are someplace dark, but it's also hot and humid.

Are you okay?\"  You are sweating, trying desperately not to let on that you've jutst been cursed.  \"Fine!  Absolutely fine.  Can we just go now?\"  She goes through her purse and frantically opens pockets.  She lets out an annoyed grunt and says \"No!  Damn it, don't tell me I left my phone by the ticket booth... I just had it out for like a second!  I need to go back and grab it.\"  You feel the color drain from your face, as you know that you'd have to make your way back through the faire.  You're not too worried about shrinking any further... I mean, how many people would actually say the word \"Firewall\" at a street festival?  Maggie gives you a kiss on the cheek and says \"I'll be right back, I'm just gonna check by the front trailer. I shouldn't be more than a few minutes.\"  She disappears into the crowd and you sigh, trying not to let the events of the day get to you.  But that's when you hear a familiar voice behind you say \"Well, Well.  Back so soon?\"  You slowly spin around to see Madame Rosella standing defiantly with her hands on her hips.  She still looked as beautiful as ever, even without the dim candlelight under her tent.  And she was just as dangerous. \"Hello there, short one.  You look upset.  Didn't you want to see me again?\"  You sternly look at her and say \"Not necessarily.  I'm getting out of here.\"  The gypsy smirks and says \"The girl with the black tank top you were walking with.  She seems nice.  Is she your girlfriend?\"  You silently nod, knowing that she's going to try and involve her in this whole fiasco too.  You start to grit your teeth and say very angrily \"She's done nothing wrong.  Keep her out of this.\"  The gypsy just laughs and says \"Oh, now why should I do that?  Maybe I should have her size reflect yours, that way she shrinks right down with you.  You don't want to go through this ordeal alone, do you?\"  You look around, still not spotting your girlfriend anywhere.  She must still be looking for her phone.  You whisper to the gypsy \"Please.  I'll do anything.  Just leave her alone.  I don't want her to get hurt.\"  Madame Rosella looks your body up and down and rolls her eyes.  \"Fine, she will not suffer on your behalf.  You know, maybe I was wrong about you.  You do seem to be a good person... but you still insulted me in my tent, so I cannot forgive you for that.  The curse stays.  In fact...\"  She leans in and gives you a kiss on the cheek.  You feel the same sensation burst through your body that you did when you first shrank, and look up at the gypsy woman in confusion.  \"What did you just do?  Shrink me again?\"  Madame Rosella smirks and says \"No, not yet.  I'll leave that up to your pretty little girlfriend.  Or any other woman you happen to come across.  I just made a little amendment to your curse.  Instead of a silly word like firewall, i decided to make you change size whenever somebody says something related to your size.  For example.  Bigger?\"  You feel your size jump up an inch or two.  You're happy to get that much of your height back, but that's when she leans in and whispers \"Smaller.\"  You lose the height almost as quickly as you got it, putting you back at your slightly shorter size.  You realize what this could mean throughout the course of your day, and the horror obviously shows on your face.  Madame Rosella smirks and says \"Get it?  I'll see you around, friend.  Feel free to return to my tent to talk in the next few days... if you're tall enough to see over my toes...\"  As she walks away, you feel a deep anger and terror grow in the pit of your stomach.  This curse has the potential to kill you in a matter of hours if you eavesdrop on the wrong conversations!  You can't stop thinking about it, but a tap on your shoulder brings you back to reality.  You spin around to see Maggie, smiling from ear to ear.  \"Found it!  Ready to go?\"  You've never been more ready to go anywhere in your life.  You put your arm around her and walk towards the parking lot.</span></div></div>",

The gypsy takes note of this and laughs saying \"This isn't going to take long at all.  You're such a horny, pathetic man.  I'll bet it won't take you until sunrise to shrink as small as my littlest toe!\"  You stand up and get into Madame Rosella's face, which is unfortunately higher up from the ground than you'd like it to be.  While pointing at her accusingly, you try and supress your anger while saying \"Listen... Ma'am.  I've learned my lesson... I won't treat you like that anymore, and I'm sorry.  Now will you take away this curse?\"  She just stomps a foot and crosses her arms saying \"It's not my fault you have no sense of self control.  You let your anger get the best of you, and it caused you to be a cursed little fool.  And since you cannot control yourself in other ways, you will continue to shrink down into an ant.  It is as simple as that.\"  You throw your arms up in defeat and say \"Oh come on, what... what do I have to do to prove to you how sorry I am, beg?\"  She doesn't answer, but she lets out a small \"Hmmm\" and smirks a little.  That's all the cue you need to actually get on your hands and knees in front of her.  You crawl right up next to her imposing 5 foot stature, and clasp your hands together.  \"Please, Madame Rosella.  I'm sorry for offending you.  I'm sorry for calling you all those names and for losing my temper.  And I would do anything to make it up to you.  I swear it.\"  The gypsy looks up as if in deep thought for a second, and then raises her hands up, motioning for you to rise from your kneeling position.  That's when she grabbed the sides of her top and whispered \"I'm feeling a bit hot.  Excuse me, please.\"  And to your amazement and shock, she disrobes, revealing nothing but her pretty lace lingerie underneath.  You feel your dick stand at attention, and the world expand slowly around you.  With a wicked, powerful laugh, Rosella walks right up next to you, and you are horrified to discover that she is now a full 6 inches taller than you.  She grabs your chin in her soft hands and says very sternly \"If you were truly sorry, you'd find a way to keep those nasty little urges at bay.  Are you really so easily manipulated by the female form?\"  You couldn't even speak.  You were embarassed to admit that she had you completely under her thumb... and in a few short minutes you feared that the metaphor would turn into a literal interpretation.  She licks her lips seductively and you groan and close your eyes in an attempt to stop yourself from getting aroused.  She sees this and walks away from you saying \"Very good, you're starting to get it.  Self control.  That's what this little experiment is all about... oops... I guess i shouldn't have said \"little\" like that..\"  You feel your penis go flacid, and you sigh in relief.  You could also swear that little by little, you're getting your size back.  But it's happening a lot slower than the rate at which you were shrinking.  Madame Rosella rolls her eyes and says \"Very well.  If you want me to remove the curse, you must prove to me that you are worthy of my favor.  And there's only one way for you to do that...\"</span></div></div>",

If you ever want to touch that little pecker of yours again without turning into a flea, you should listen up.  I'm going to give you a task to perform, and if you do a good job, I might just think about lifting that pesky curse off of you.  Understand?\"  You nod up and down, not really knowing what she has in store for you.  But you know that you'd do anything to be free of the constant worry of shrinking down to tiny size at the slightest hint of arousal.  The Gypsy walks over to you and bends down for a second, reaching for something at her feet.  When she stands back up, she is holding a small toe-ring in between her fingers.  \"Do you see this ring, little one?\"  You don't like how she's calling you that, but you reply \"Yes\" anyway, just to get the instructions you need.  She holds it directly in front of your face and says \"I used to have a second one, just like this.  Remember what it looks like, because you're going to retrieve the other one for me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks casually over to the card-reading table and takes a seat, raising her leg up to put the toe-ring back on her second largest toe.  She wiggles the digits playfully and says \"There is a woman who runs the carnival.  Russian girl named Ilsa.  She sleeps in a trailer similar to this one on the other side of the camp.  She has stolen my ring, I'm sure of it.  So you will get the ring back from her, and bring it to me.  I don't care how you do it, i just want it back.\"  She lays back and rests her feet on the table, and rubs her crotch gently.  You try to look away so as not to be aroused again, but that's when the gypsy says \"And if you return empty handed, not only will the curse stay on your body, but i will force you to smell my pussy until you can fit completely inside of it.  So you'd better hurry if you don't want to spend your final moments on this earth drowning in my juices.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can answer or even snap out of your stunned silence, she waves one of her hands quickly, which makes the tent flap that was previously inescapable fly open.  You have your mission.  You know the stakes.  So now all you need to do is grab that toe ring and this nightmare will be over.  You walk through the fair, taking note at a few people who glance over in your direction.  You've definitely lost enough of your previous height that you've become somewhat of a sight to see.  You pray you don't run into your girlfriend, knowing that there's no logical way you could explain the curse to her without her getting angry at you.  Luckily, you don't see Maggie anywhere.  Instead, you find yourself at the end of the faire.  It's not as crowded, there's just a few food vendors with short lines and the trailers meant for the owners of the carnival.  You look into one of the cabins and see a huge stack of money, briefcases filled with clothes, and a massive, unorganized pile of jewelry.  The ring must be in that pile!  You wait for the coast to be clear and look back into the cabin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to plan out exactly how you're going to get that ring back, and you know that it's going to be much more complicated if Ilsa is actually in the room at the time of your retrieval...</span></div></div>",

You breathe a sigh of relief, and turn to get back onto the main road to see Madame Rosella... when you bump into  a busty blonde lady in modern street clothes.  She was a tall lady with huge breasts and a long hooking nose.  She was by no means unattractive, just very stern looking.  And you were thrown off and made a bit nervous when you heard her thick Russian accent.  \"Excuse me, boy!  What you do in my private room?\"  Just when you thought you were getting away with the crime of the century, Ilsa shows up right at the last second to stop you!  You were caught red handed, but you figured you may as well try and lie your way out of this situation.  The imposing woman is tapping her toe, waiting for some sort of excuse.  \"Well?  Explain!\"  You are frightened of being caught in the lie, but then you remember what the alternative is.  If you don't return to the gypsy with the ring in hand, she's going to make you a microscopic sex slave.  So you muster up all your acting skills and say \"A thousand pardons, madame.

IIsa was intimidating but Boris was outright scary. Speaking of the woman, she just stood there with her arms crossed, glaring at you with eyes so cold it made your skin crawl. The only good thing about that gaze was the fact it ensured you weren't aroused anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Boris was another problem all together. He was thorough in his search, he must've been a cop at one point because he searched you from top to bottom until he finally settled on your pocket. Before you could react he dug his hand into your pants to reveal the ring you'd risked everything to procure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIIsa's eyes widened a fraction before Boris presented her with the ring. \"This belonging to you Ms. IIsa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIIsa took the ring and examined it closely. Sure enough it was the same ring she took from that witch she let into the faire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were crying on the inside. The ring was out of reach. You couldn't return empty handed. If you did then... \"Please! I need that ring! If I go back without it, Madam--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were silenced by a hard slap from the Russian woman before her eyes glared into your own with malice. She was not happy. \"Boris. Get him out of my sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you tried to beg but Boris iron grip covered your face and viciously hurled you out the trailer door onto the hard ground. Now you really were crying as you continued to plead. \"Come back and I snap you like the toothpick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trailer door slammed... and you were all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had failed to retrieve the ring from IIsa. Your incompetence cost you everything. You felt truly and utterly like a loser. The curse would remain and you'd become a tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of you felt like going back, to try and get the ring one last time... But you knew it was hopeless. Boris would snap you in half. And even if you did manage to get past him there was no guarantee you'd be able to find the ring again. IIsa would most likely hide it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother part of you thought about running away. You'd be fine as long as you never got horny. Good luck with that. You knew for certain you'd never be able to make it out in the world that way. Maybe the gypsy had a point? You were easily distracted by the female form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere really was no escaping this. All you could do was walk back to the Madam Rosella in the worst possible way, empty handed, and face your destiny. You could feel the fear building in your chest when you remembered her threat from before. She'd shrink you down until you could fit inside her womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like both the best and worse way to go. On the one hand you'd be where no man has ever gone before and only ever dreamed of. On the other you'd die. Downed to death in the juices of your sexy tormentor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then stopped in your stride when came across Madam Rosella's tent. All you could was stare at it while other people at the faire laughed and played. This was it. Your heart beat loudly in your chest to the point where the sound became almost deafening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you run, or did you face your destiny? You were screwed either way. Before you could make a decision however, the voice of the gypsy inside called out. \"You may enter. I've been waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did she know you were there?! Was she watching you the whole time? Did she know you didn't have her ring?! Without even realizing it, your feet started to move and you entered the tent. The inside looked very much the same and seated at her little table was none other than Madam Rosella with her bare feet up and still dressed in her skimpy lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the inches slowly being shaved of by the second. Why was she still dressed like this?! You try your best to snap out of it as her voice rings in your ears. \"So tell me little one. Do you have the item in question that I sent you out to procure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer knowing smirk told you everything you needed to know. She knew you didn't have it. She knew you returned empty handed. You wanted to speak, to say something. Maybe you could convince her to give you another chance? \"N-no but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I tell you before?\" Madam Rosella interrupted. Your face grew pale. \"I told you if you came back here empty handed that I would force you to smell my pussy until you were small enough to fit inside of it. Was I not clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the heaviness in the room as your dread mounted. \"Y-yes you were very clear. B-but I didn't know on the fact she had a bodyguard. Besides I confirmed she did steal your ring if you had any doubts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolish man. I knew she had my ring hence why I sent you.\" Rosella scoffed. She then beckoned you forth with her finger and against your will you came forward. You tried to resist and you did briefly, but your broken will ensured you continued until she said so. \"I warned you not to return with nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally stopped at her table right at her feet. You had such a clear view of her body now and you felt more and more inches being shaved off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I see you appear to be shrinking yet again. You truly have no self control.\" Rosella laughed. \"Not that I blame you though. I am quite gorgeous after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please!\" You beg, \"Give me one more chance! Whatever it is I'll do it... I-I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh. I can't do that. A deals a deal. But I can change the manner of your punishment. What say you, how do you wish to suffer?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can hear movement from the other side of the cabin and lower your head slightly to avoid suspicion.  That's when you see the blonde haired Ilsa tossing a bit in her slumber on the trailer's bed.  Damn it, you were so close to making this an easy out for you, but it's going to be nearly impossible for you to sneak into there and grab the ring.  Not only is the woman in the cabin itself, but it's being guarded by a nearly 7-foot tall security guard who's standing motionless at the door.  Just when you are about to accept defeat, you hear a moan come from the bed and look down to see Ilsa turn again, this time facing you.  Her eyes sare still closed as she tries to sleep, but to your shock, her bedsheets come up a bit short, giving you a full good view of her huge, round breasts.  You find yourself gazing at the fleshy pillows until your view drops suddenly below the window.  Just the sight of her bare flesh was enough to shrink you down to about 4 feet tall!  You avert your gaze and try to snap your mind out of it, letting all the dirty thoughts escape your mind so you can focus on the task at hand.  When you find the piece of mind to stop thinking about the view you just caught, you are shocked to see the world start to rise up again.  Of course, the curse the gypsy placed on you must be directly linked to how long you STAY aroused!  You grow at a significantly slower rate than your shrinking, but you now know that as long as you focus, you could always get back to your normal size eventually... and that's when you notice in the corner of the cabin a small hole.  Almost big enough for a mouse to crawl into.  A plan enters your mind that is so crazy it just has to work... then again, the day has already been crazy enough for you to live a thousand lifetimes with the stories of what you've encountered.  Why not make it just a little more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour plan comes to fruition as you let your mind go, thinking of how great it will be to have sex with your girlfriend again.  Kissing every inch of Maggie's body, holding her warm skin next to yours as you both let your passions take hold of each other.  The visions and thoughts get stronger and sexier, as you find yourself sinking into your ever growing clothes.  You have so much mobility in your oversized shirt that you are actually able to stroke yourself a bit, increasing the pleasure and causing the rate at which you're shrinking to almost triple.  You snap back to reality almost as if you were struck by lightning and stop pleasuring yourself, finding yourself in a warm cotton cave.  You crawl quickly out of the gigantic t-shirt you were wearing and find yourself looking out into a new, gigantic world.  You couldn't be more than 2 inches tall!  This size is more than small enough for you to complete your mission, and you make your way over to the now humongous entrance to Ilsa's cabin, slowly making your way inside.  You can hear the gigantic blonde snoring next to you as you walk the thin distance between her bed and dresser, marveling at how everything looks at this size.  However, you can feel the room starting to close in around you ever so slightly, and you know you only have a matter of time before you grow back to normal size.  Scaling up a dangling telephone line, you bring yourself up to the dresser and have an incredible sight before you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your right is a sleeping goddess, the circus owner.  She is only in what looks to be her mid or late 30's with a very thin body, and she is in deep sleep before  you.  Her face looks almost ageless from surgery and facial procedures, giving her excessively pouty lips and almost bleached white teeth.  She looks a bit fake...but you can't find yourself calling her unattrractive in the slightest.  You try not to look at her too long, for fear that your urges would take hold again and you'd shrink down to nothingness right there on the dresser.  To your left, however is a much more awe-inspiring image:  What appears to be tens, if not HUNDREDS of pieces of jewelry and coins.  Gold, silver, bronze, all on display before your eyes.  If you were normal size, this would be enough wealth to solve world hunger and housing four or five times over!  But you need to remind yourself that you are merely a few inches tall, and since time is of the essence, you need to find the matching toe-ring that belongs to the gypsy.  You approach the huge stack of jewelry and begin your search.  </span></div></div>",

You look at the landscape of a woman in front of you and realize that if you want to get to her feet, you're going to have to jump onto the bed and bypass the rest of her.  Luckily she is laying face up, with a thin blanket covering her naked body before you.  You count your lucky stars that she was not laying face down, otherwise getting the ring off of her toes would be significantly harder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a running leap onto the massive bed, landing with a barely audible thud atop the silk sheet.  It moves slowly and rhythmically with the massive woman's breathing, and you slowly make your way down the bed towards her feet.  You pass her breasts, rising and falling with each breath she takes in her slumber.  It's almost hypnotizing.  To the point where you find  yourself staring as you walk, not watching where you're going.  Your foot accidentally kicks a pillar of flesh, and you stifle a surprised scream as you realize you've just hit the giant woman's pinkie finger.  The digit moves slightly, and the giantess moans in reaction, but to your relief, she goes right back to sleep.  Surely if she were a bit more sensitive, you would have found yourself underneath her enormous hand, trapped and helpless.  You take much more caution and make your way down to the ankle of her left foot, where the gypsy's ring lay perched around her smallest toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air is thick with a mixture of lotion and foot sweat, and you feel the heat radiating off of the humongous appendage as you make your way closer.  You realize that you'll have to climb atop her foot if you want to get the ring for yourself, but as your test proved before with her hand, she is a sound sleeper.  You take great care as you slowly climb atop the giant foot, positioning yourself right where the toes begin.  Even with the difference in elevation, the job is fairly easy to do.  The heat outside has given the toes enough of a coat of sweat that the ring is fitting a bit looser than normal.  You use all your might with your tiny arms to hoist the ring higher and higher off of it's resting place, just about clearing the nail of the Russian Goddess's pinkie toe.  </span></div></div>",

Well i'll just have to control myself, then won't I?\"  Rosella is furious that you'd have the gall to fight back and holds up her hand again, chanting something different.  You are blasted back against a wall by the power of her magic, and when the light fades, you are unfortunately well aware that you are unable to move any extremities.  \"You think it's that simple?

You know there is no escape from her now, at least not for the forseeable future.

The stinging sensation in your face seems to spread throughout your entire body, and in one quick jolt, you watch as Rosella's height rises about an inch.  She was serious... this curse is strong enough to affect you with even a slap!  She laughs at your realization and rubs her hand against the side of your face that was struck.  \"Oh, I'm sorry, did that hurt?  I know it did because you seem to have shrunk just a little bit!\"  You almost start hyperventalating in disbelief and say \"Are you fucking serious?

Meanwhile, Madame Rosella just traces the entirety of your face using her red-painted toes.  \"Oh, come on.  You're going to have to breathe eventually.  Go ahead.  Sniff my foot, little man  Just a little bit.\"  Your face almost turns blue as you try desperately not to give into her magic.  She continues to wave the smelly toes in your face, even dragging her soles across your cheeks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a disappointed sigh, the gypsy says \"You know, this was supposed to be fun for me.  I enjoy watching miserable little men shrink down from the smell of my feet.  If you're not going to play along, then I'm going to stick my foot in your mouth.  The taste of my foot sweat will shrink you twice as fast as merely smelling it.  The choice is yours, worm.\"  You are just about ready to pass out, knowing that if you concede to her demands and stop struggling, you'll breathe in some of her foot smell.  Not only that, but opening your mouth could give her the option of putting her foot inside your mouth, leaving that awful taste lingering on your tongue and shrinking you even faster!  You are fading fast, so you have to act now, before she decides to act for you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Using all your strength, even from the disadvantage of being on the ground, you shove the short woman away, running out of the tent with nothing but her laughter following you out. You make your way back into the crowd of people, trying to take your mind off of what had just happened. You hear your name being called out, and you turn to see Maggie waving her arms to get your attention. You make your way back to her and she gives you a small kiss. \"Where have you been? You missed out on a lot.\" You give a nervous chuckle and respond \"No.. don't worry, I... saw a lot.\" She gives you a warm smile and you two spend the rest of the day wandering the grounds. You try to get her to stay away from the tent containing the woman who threatened to turn you into a bug using her feet, but after a while, you inevitably double back to the place you ran from just an hour or so earlier. But as you point out some landmarks, you realized that you had passed over the area where the tent was. It was gone! You didn't even see an indent in the grass from where it had been set up. How could this be? Did you imagine the whole thing? You try to shrug it off, and spend the rest of the day close to Maggie. The two of you get home late in the evening, and you feel so drained from the day that you kiss your girlfriend and make your way into bed. You pass out almost immediately, and when you open your eyes, you're no longer in your home. You're in an open field of tall grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see nothing but the field in every direction, with the sun shining brightly overhead. You hear a voice say all around you... \"YOU THINK THAT THIS IS OVER...\" You spin around quickly and see in the distance a figure of a woman. A short woman. Dressed in red, with jewels and beads, with wild black hair. It's Madame Rosella! You see her walk towards you and the words echo in your head again... \"MY MAGIC WILL FOLLOW YOU FOREVER...\". You turn to run from her but bump into something large and firm. You step back to check what exactly you've hit, and are shocked to discover a gigantic human foot in your path. You look up slowly to discover that you're in between the legs of a gargantuan gypsy, staring down at you and grinning as she whispers \"IT WILL SHRINK YOU UNTIL YOU ARE LESS THAN THE DIRT BETWEEN MY TOES.\" And in a flash of light, you are transported to a huge tan plane, with hills and canyons all throughout it. But there is a smell in the air that disorients you and confuses you. It smells like... hand lotion. You look up and no longer see a sun in the sky, but a huge eyeball darting back and forth to search for you. It finally comes to rest and the head it's attached to leans back. The massive face of Madame Rosella is gazing down on your miniscule body, like a goddess watching over the earth. You fall back onto the ground, which you now realize is her massive palm, and you feel yourself shrinking furher and further into the cracks of her skin. Her face, still as beautiful and powerful as ever, is staring down at you and with a very cold, determined look, the goddess speaks once more. \"YOU WILL NOT ESCAPE... MY POWER.\" She lifts her other hand above the open palm, and extends her index finger, which she aims right at you. The huge appendage gets closer and closer, looking like a planet crashing directly on top of you. And just as her fingernail is about to make contact with her palm, sandwiching your speck sized body between them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up in a shot, sweating and breathing heavily. You are shaking from the vision in your dreams, and you look out the window. The sun. It's the next day already, but you feel as though you haven't slept a wink. You stand up, groggy from the experience, and start to walk into the next room. You greet your girlfriend, who's already up eating breakfast. You can tell she's just woken up herself, because her hair is a mess and she's wearing nothing but a tank top and panties. Your eyes lock with hers, and she says \"Good morning, sunshine. You really hit it hard last night.\" You sigh and say \"Yeah, and the bad thing is i feel like i haven't slept at all.\" She gives a fake pouty face as she says \"Aww, poor baby. Have some breakfast, and maybe you'll feel better.\" You concur, grabbing some cereal and sitting next to her as you two recount your trip to the festival yesterday. She talks about the jousting tournament and how she knew a few of the girls selling wares from high school, but then she says something that shakes you up a bit. \"I was kinda disappointed though. I really wanted to see Madame Rosella there.\" You stop eating and try to hide your embarrassment at hearing the name. How does Maggie know that crazy gypsy woman? You ask \"Ummm... who's that?\" She rolls her eyes and says \"Oh nobody. Just this card reader I go to sometimes. She's usually really good with the readings, and a few of my friends have said that her spells and charms actually work. I've seen her every time the faire's come through here... she even knows me by name. But this year, i didn't even see her tent. Maybe she moved to a different part of the country.\" You try not to make eye contact as you say \"Really... that's odd.\", and get back to your breakfast. Maggie finishes before you do and looks at you with a playful look before saying...</span></div></div>",

It shouldn't take more than a few weeks before you've shrunk down so small that dust particles will be mountain ranges to you.  And it will happen slowly enough that you can savor every second that your puny body shrinks away.  Just like all the other men who have trifled with me in the past.\"  She laughs and puts her hands on her hips, her cocky smirk saying much more than any elaboration could.  You almost want to fall to your knees and grovel for forgiveness, but you're too busy shaking out of fear of what could happen to you.  You're also hanging on every word she says as she walks towards you again, causing you to back away towards the side of the tent.  You're already intimidated by her.  She already looks as if she's grown a few inches.  \"Of all the punishments i've inflicted on foolish people, this is my favorite.  I place the curse on you and then let you out of my tent.  You'll live your life and get shorter and shorter until you reach a suitable size.  Then i come and... collect you.\"  You back up again, but this time you trip over a stool in the room and land flat on your back.  Madame Rosella doesn't waste any time and presses a bare foot on your chest, applying a little bit of pleasure as she smirks from above.  \"You look so natural there under my foot.  Perhaps that's what i'll do.  I'll let you shrink away to nothing while worshipping my beautiful toes.  You can kiss them and lick them every day until I just can't see you anymore.  Then i'll either wash you off in the bathtub, or paint over you with a fresh coat of polish to keep you trapped with my toes for the rest of your pathetic life!\"  You squirm away from underneath her and run to the opening of the tent, hearing her cackling laughter behind you.  \"Enjoy your size while you have it, little one!  You'll be back here underneath my feet soon enough!\"  You catch your breath as you make your way through the opening, hoping that the crazy woman was just fucking with you.  The more steps you take away from the tent, the more you think to yourself how foolish you were to believe her.  Come on, shrinking people?  That's just ridiculous.  You accept that you're not getting the ten dollars back and make your way across the fairgrounds, bumping into your girlfriend Maggie.  She comes over with a smile and gives you a big hug, saying \"This may be the best faire yet!  Where have you been, i was looking all over for you?\"  You just close your eyes happy to be with her and say \"I met some... interesting people.  You ready to head home?\"  She shrugs and says \"I guess so.  It is getting a little late.\"  And then she gets a puzzled look on her face for a second, before shaking it off.  \"What?  What's wrong?\" You ask her.  She lets off a cute smile and says \"Oh it's nothing.  Just... i don't know.  For some reason you kind of looked.. shorter to me.\"  You can barely breathe.  The gypsy wasn't lying!  You will be getting smaller and smaller each day!  It's not noticable now to your girlfriend, but what happens when you don't even come up to her waist?  Or her knees?  Or... her feet.  As that last thought crosses your head, you swear you can hear that unforgettable laughter of the gypsy woman, mocking your panic.  You grab Maggie as inconspicuously as possible and take her home.  The two of you decide to make an early night of it, since you both have work the next morning.  Well... that and you were looking to put this awful day behind you.  Hopefully you'd wake up and the silliness of the whole \"curse\" business will have passed.  You hope that's what happens... but you know for a fact it won't.  And when you wake up, you'll see just how fast the curse is going to cause you to dwindle...</span></div></div>",

The memories of the day before race through your mind as you walk into the kitchen to get something to eat.  Was she serious?  Could somebody really shrink you like that?  You look around and don't feel any different.  The table is still as high as you thought it was yesterday, the counters aren't out of reach.  Maybe it was all in your mind!  You take a sigh of relief and sit down to eat some cereal.  You try and ignore it, but the desire to know the truth is too strong.  You put the spoon down and go to a drawer to pull out a tape measure.  You know you stood a good 6 foot 3 at your last physical, so if there's any difference in that, it will confirm your fears.  You step on one end of the tape and bring the rest up to the top of your head, holding it in place at your current hight.  You know you shouldn't even be caring about something like this, but when you look down at the tape measurement, you almost feel compelled to sit down.  You know it's not a mistake, you know there's no way you just moved your hand too quickly.  You were down to 6 foot tall even.  You had shrunk three inches!  You almost throw up and look at the clock.  You still have quite some time before you have to go to work, so you put some clothes on quickly and rush out the door to your car.  You speed off to where the festival was on a blind hope that the Madame is still there.  Maybe you could pay her off or beg for your size, but you know that you can't just shrink down to nothing!  You are relieved to see the tent still there, set up just as it was, but with no carnival surrounding it.  The rest of the concessions and vendors had left for the next town, and all that stood in the middle of the field was Madame Rosella's reading tent.  Almost as if it were waiting for you.  You cautiously open the flap and are immediately met with the face of your opressor.  Madame Rosella looks you up and down and tilts her head, jokingly saying \"Hey, have you gotten taller since the last time we met?\"  You collect yourself and ask  \"Why are you staying?  Just to torment me further?\"  She looks at you with a condescending smirk and says \"Don't think so highly of yourself, my not-so-incredible shrinking man.  I happen to like it here.  The shops are convenient, the parks are clean, and the townspeople are nice... for the most part.  Some of the police officers can be a bit of a pain.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds up a finger as if to stop you mid conversation and reaches into her pants with her other hand.  She fishes around for a second and then pulls out between two fingers a miniature, shivering woman.  She only looks to be about two inches tall, and she's sweating from head to toe, crying out in a high pitched voice for mercy.  Rosella just looks at her and purses her lips together in a babying fashion \"Oooh, you're all tired and hot, aren't you?  That's what you get for trying to get all your little cop friends to kick me out of the park.  Now are you going to approve my permit to live and set up my shop right here?\"  The tiny woman cries out \"Yes!  Yes!  Just please change me back!\"  Rosella puts a finger up to her chin and says \"Hmmm, not quite yet.  You called me some pretty nasty things before I made you tiny and crushed your partner.  So I'll give you another hour to think about how to be nicer to people of other cultures.\"  The shrunken woman's screams are quickly muffled as the fingers release, dropping her back against the gorgeous traveller's pussy.  The gypsy squirms a bit, and starts laughing, before turning her attention back to you.  \"Oh, I almost forgot you were there for a second, now where were we?\"  You were shocked beyond reason at what you had just seen the woman do, and you feared that you'd be in that exact position within a matter of days. Rosella licks her lips and says \"If you're feeling impatient and somewhat jealous, i could always snap my fingers and make you her size right now.  There's room for two in there...\"  You are speechless at her proposition, but she just shakes her head before you can answer and says \"No, no no.  That would be too convenient, to just get it out of the way like that.  I want you to experience every day being just a little bit shorter.  Eventually you'll be the perfect size, but until then, I'll enjoy the thought of you trying to go through your normal life while slowly but surely dwindling away.  Don't try and talk your way out of this.  They all do.\"  You sigh and say \"If there's nothing i can say to get you to take this curse away then fine, i won't say anything.  But i'm begging you for a chance to PROVE that I'm a good person.  I will do anything you say, anything you ask.  All that i ask in return is that you reconsider my punishment.\"  You decide to appeal to her better side (if she has one) and offer yourself to her.  Unlike the policewoman currently drowning in her panties, you can see that Rosella is actually giving thought to your pleas.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crosses her arms and taps her feet, saying \"You truly are a desperate man, aren't you?\"  You nod and say \"I don't want to die.  Not like this.\"  She looks you up and down, before taking a look around her own tent.  She lets out a small chuckle and says \"I won't deny that I could use some help around here... tell you what, little man.  Every day you will come to Madame Rosella's tent.  You will do something special for her.  You will please her.  And then when you finally reach a size of less than an inch tall, when you are nothing but a pathetic little ant cowering between my toes, I will consider returning you to your normal size and removing the shrinking spell.  Do we have an agreement?\"  You are almost on the verge of tears, miserable in the knowledge that you're going to be this crazy woman's slave as you shrink down, but happy that eventually it will all be taken care of.  You say \"Deal.  I'll do whatever you ask.  Thank you.\"  You extend a hand to shake hers in completion of the deal, but she just laughs and says \"Oh, no.  Your handshake means nothing to me.  If you want me to believe that you will be my willing, obedient servant, you must get on your knees and kiss my feet.\"  You slowly drop to your knees and bow down, watching Rosella's smile get wider as you do so.  She puts her left foot forward, her pretty red-painted toes wiggling in anticipation as you lower your head down to the ground and plant a small kiss on the top of her foot.  She giggles above you and says \"That's so cute.  I like the way you look down there kissing my foot.  I can barely wait until you're the same size as it.  I'm already getting excited thinking about the games i will play with your teeny little body.\"  You wipe your lips off and stand back to your full height, and Madame Rosella nods in approval.  \"Very well.  It has begun.  Welcome to your new life of servitude, little man.  When you come back tomorrow, you will be another few inches shorter, and we can begin.\"  You are almost too afraid to ask, but you have to know.  You ask the gypsy \"What will be my job, Madame?\"  She just smiles and says very proudly...</span></div></div>",

Surprised you tried to shove her hands off you again, this time you struggled with her. You then stared at her and noticed that she seemed taller than before, but the continual, aggressive groping angered you: \u201cGet your hands off me, you crazy gypsy.\u201d However you found yourself losing the fight more and more, as you it got harder and harder to wrestle her hands off you, it made you panic as well when you looked back at her and her height had increased even more, she was on eyesight with you now. <br>\r\nHer eyes covered in thick, dark mascara gleamed behind her long, black, curly hair, and she smiled when she saw the realization in your scared eyes: \u201cOh, you\u2019re not going anywhere, my disrespectful, little guest.\u201d Her right hand grabbed the back of your head, and forced you towards the deep, dark end of the tent; an area behind curtains that functioned as her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer she pushed you onto her bed, and you looked up at her with fear as you knew that she was definitely bigger than before now. Her body had gotten larger, much stronger, her tiny top didn\u2019t cover her now toned stomach and her boobs where showing.<br>\r\nswelling over the edge pressed together, they threaten to break free with every breath she took. Noticeable bulges were formed behind her red sleeves, which were peeled back a few inches from her hands. \u201cYou know what\u201d growled Madam Rosella: \u201cI\u2019m TIRED of being mocked by foolish men like you!\u201d her shadow loomed over you, as she ripped the sleeves off herself, showing her strong arms. \u201cTired of being stepped on because of my\u2026\u201d with both arms she split open her top, freeing her bloated tits: \u201c\u2026size!\u201d she panted, while looking down on you and threw the remaining pieces of her top behind her, her messy, black hair covering her face made her look like an animal.<br>\r\n\u201cBut now\u201d she sneered: \u201cI\u2019m taking my revenge.\u201d You could do nothing but watch her grow, while you slowly crawled backwards away from her until you hit the end of the bed. Never had you been this scared in your life as this huge, angry, foreign woman, which used to be a scrawny, 4 feet tall, cheap fortuneteller, prowled closer to you. Her butt exploded her skirt open with a bang, making Madam Rosella grunt while holding eye contact with her prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was above you now, her hair surrounding you like a jungle of black vines \u201cI\u2019m going to ruin your life\u2026 \u201c she cupped your face in her huge right hand in one tight grip, clenching her teeth at you: \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you, fuck you hard and deep, until you cum inside of me and make me pregnant. And I will tell everyone that you\u2019re the father and demand you to raise this child with me, legally binding you as my slave. I will make you take care of me, rubbing my feet while I lazily lay in bed, growing fatter and bigger, cause you will feed my growing body too!<br>\r\nAnd I will laugh and mock you the entire time, torture you between by giant, smelly toes and command you around endlessly, making sure you treat me like the queen that I\u2019m!\u201d <br>\r\nYou were covering between her kneeling, thick legs, and saw her take her left hand down to her crotch, where her panties barely covered her wild, growing pussy, with hair sprouting out in all directions from the panties, and she ripped them off like nothing, exposing her dripping, wet cunt to you. \u201cAnd when the baby is born, I will fuck you again till I get pregnant, and do that every time I give birth, repeatingly getting pregnant again and again and again, having more and more gypsy children. And I will make sure that each son become tall, strong and grow big dicks to fuck more gypsy children into white girls, and my daughters busty and extremely fertile to breed gypsy children all the time, making them bigger and bigger, a growing population of gypsys taking over the world! Filthy, dirty and horny gypsys fucking and growing all the time! And you can do nothing but watch me grow larger and larger while taking care of hundreds and hundreds of growing babies, cleaning and cooking all the time while getting weaker as my people grow each and every day! DO YOU STILL QUESTION MY POWER, TINY MAN?!\u201d  roared Madam Rosella, while shaking your pale head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had closed your eyes as spit rained down on your face while she spoke. Shaking and terrified out of your mind you could do nothing else but whimper a tiny: \u201c\u2026.no\u2026.\u201d.<br>\r\nA satisfied grin spread on the buff, brown amazon gypsy\u2019s face: \u201cgooood\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The madras groans and bounces at the impact of her big hand sinking into the soft bed furniture.<br>\r\nHer golden-brown face slowly descends towards yours. Her eyes are deadly focused on you, her thick-painted, dark mascara, eyelids are narrowed while her pasty-white teeth surrounded by luscious, red lips snares at you, all while curly, long, black hair hangs down in a circle around you, falling lower and lower down. You close your eyes and turn your face away while cowering, rolling up in a ball of protection, but the amazon won\u2019t have it. You feel a hand firmly grip the hair on the back of your head which makes you whimper by the touch and making your entire body flinch. <br>\r\nShe turns your face back towards hers, and keeping your eyes shut is all you can do now, but without looking you know she is very close as the heat from her breath on your skin gets more and more warm and her low growl gets louder and louder. You\u2019re breathing heavily, scared and lightly shaking, which all stops for a brief moment, like a heart skipping a beat, when she says in a deep and angry voice: <br>\r\n\u201cGod, you have made me SO mad.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn a swoop you feel her lips press against yours, and her tongue filling up your mouth, both her hands gets behind your head now pushing your head up towards hers, preventing you from escaping her kiss.<br>\r\nThe size difference can clearly be felt, it\u2019s almost as she is trying to eat you as she numbs and tastes your lower face, which she holds steady with a hand on your left cheek. Her wet and slithering tongue thrashes around in there, rubbing and pushing your own tongue into a corner, dominating its space, forcing you to open up your mouth even wider.<br>\r\nAt the same time her soft boobs are pushing against your chest and you can feel them smothering you like pillows filled up with water. Almost by instinct your hands digs into her boob flesh partly trying to keep her heavy weight off your body and partly to feel the comforting warmth of squishy tits. <br>\r\nYou can\u2019t fight it as an erection slowly grows in your pants, your mind is drowned by her natural scent, the smell of a dirty, sweaty gypsy who haven\u2019t showered in days, poorly covered up by weak, cheap perfume, it oddly enough made you hard beside her heavy, body grinding against you. <br>\r\nHer savage pussy rubs against your bulge now, which soaks the pant's fabric, and she feels the lower swelling and knows that you\u2019re ready for her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all it took? It\u2019s almost like you WANT to breed me!\u201d she mocks you, as she pulls away from your face, with only a string of salvia connecting you and her lips now. She takes her hands away from your face and places them on your chest, gripping your shirt and rips it apart while looming over you, her messy, gypsy hair covers half her face while she looks down on you saying: <br>\r\n\u201cYou secretly want me to control you, don\u00b4t you? You\u2019re so *grunt* eager to submit yourself to me.\u201d<br>\r\nShe smiles wickedly, her dark eyes gleams as she throws away the pieces of your ruined shirt. <br>\r\nNext her hands go down to your crotch, where she gentle gropes your junk while watching you weep by the sensitive touch, you look at her with wet, pleading eyes and shivering jaw, silently begging her to stop, but her smile gets even wider seeing you destressed like this. Her hands immediate grabs the fly of your pants, ripping the zipper open with a bang, and exposing your stretched underwear beneath it. She grunts as she tears the rest of the seams at the middle and holds at last a pants leg in each of her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she threw those destroyed garments away and swiftly tore your underwear clean off, giving you a minor wedgie in the process. You were now naked, vulnerable and helpless beneath a towering, gypsy amazon, who used to be a short woman with no strenght whatsoever. You immediately tried to cover yourself up, but in doing so you angered the gypsy goddess who wants your skin exposed and open to her and so she grabbed your hands in one and held them up like she was holding a trophy rabbit by its legs, and the other went down to feel your cock, appeasing the goddess\u2019s mood once again. <br>\r\nIt throbbed under her touch, as she gently glided her hand up and down the shaft.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is truly what you desire, isn\u2019t it my little pet?\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her black pubic hair caressed your lower region as your dick sunk into her warm and wet cavern, it felt like a warm carpet was laid around your dick while it itself was stuffed into a warm, moist and soft blanket. You leaned back your head in pleasure, put then you tried not to show signs of enjoyment, so you quickly stiffen your face.<br>\r\nMadam Rosella didn\u2019t hide it however, she let out a long, deep moan as it entered into her hairy, wet cunt, rubbing her clit as it did so. The mating had begun, the gypsy amazon leading the pace of it, moaning more and more as the thrusting got more and more intense, you tried your hardest not to like it, you had both of your hands clenched into the madras' sheet as you attempted to make math problems and think about debt and student loans to kill the mood.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe big, bouncing, gypsy woman noticed your missing attention towards her, and then fell down upon you; pressing her bloated boobs against your puny chest, wrapping her long arms around your neck and head so one hand could snap it back towards you and the other give you a scalp massage. The scalp massage send shivers down your spine, filling you with joy, which made you slightly open your mouth that immediately got filled up with fat, gypsy tongue. <br>\r\nMadam Rosella resumed devouring your mouth, the area was wet with salvia and marked with red lipstick from last time. <br>\r\nShe wiggled her tits from side to side on your chest, rubbing her nipples that sometimes made contact with yours. It was like small, shocks of pleasure each time they hit, sensitive as they wore. <br>\r\nAll that rough pounding had made the gypsy amazon sweaty, and strong odor from her armpits, feet and crotch where beginning to heavily emerge. <br>\r\nIt was already bad enough, as her scent once again filled up your nose, the smell clouding your thinking and starting your sexual imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of a homeless woman, who hadn\u2019t cleaned herself nor shaved in months kept reappearing in your mind. She was smaller than you, had long, wild, messy hair, small chubby breasts hanging towards her wide potbelly with its narrow, turned-in bellybutton. <br>\r\nThe hair on her head equally matched the hair between her legs, something that had kept growing unchecked since her puberty it seemed. <br>\r\nLastly, she had her short, thick legs and her dirty feet, which looked like they had never been cleaned in years. <br>\r\nYou then imagined yourself holding a pie, which the short, homeless woman was begging you a piece of. <br>\r\nThe smell of her matched the smell of the amazon gypsy, which made you hesitate, but you felt pity and handed her a piece of pie. She immediately ate it in two bites, and suddenly shot up in height, her body bloating up in bursts as her stomach growled happily, finally getting some food. You were shocked to see that she was now on the same height as you and that she now began begging for another piece more enthusiastic this time.<br>\r\nThe smell from her had now gotten stronger and you pushed her away as she tried to grab the rest, but her arms had now grown too long, and she snatched the whole pie from your hands which you tried to take back, but the homeless woman had already begun munching on it, growing once again. Chewing, gurgle noises and the sound of flesh expanding was all you could hear, as the woman greedily ate and ate, getting bigger and bigger, taller and taller. You were at breast height with her now, and in frustration you punched her in the stomach, which made her fall backwards, crashing on her fat ass which shook the ground so much you tipped over as well! <br>\r\nHer legs then landed on top of you, which you tried to push off, but they got heavier and heavier as the woman hadn\u2019t stopped eating despite the fall. She smiled as she kept filling her mouth with pie, jam smeared on her cheeks, small berry chunks and crumbs falling on her breasts, as all she wanted was to eat and eat. <br>\r\nContent she wiggled her feet around, rubbing them on your entire body, the dirt and sweat from them was foul and they got larger and larger, covering more and more of you body.<br>\r\nIn the end she had grown so large that her legs had grown passed your tiny body and was now getting walloped by her ass and giant, hairy pussy instead. She had eaten the entire pie, licking her fingers in delight, and now leaned back with spread legs while scratching her huge, scruffy, unwashed cunt, burping with a smile and closed eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell suffocated you, and brought you back to reality, as your eyes saw Madam Rosella\u2019s giant armpit was literally covering you nose now.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, pet *huff* you can\u2019t *huff* hold it in *huff* forever!\u201d She said with clenched teet and with a face dripping with sweat, making some of her hair stick to her cheeks and forehead. She was holding you close and pounded you furiously, the entire bed creaked and groaned threatening to collapse.<br>\r\nYou clung to her curvy buddy, feeling its softness and warmth, you were so dangerously close to finish. <br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t let her win!\u201d you thought, but you couldn\u2019t fight it, your mind got filled up with dopamine and sweet dullness as you released your much pent-up, warm load into her needy, craving cunt, pumping out for what seemed to be roughly a minute while Madam Rosella slowed down while panting her victory cheer; she had won.<br>\r\nYour body felt so good and your mind so great, but you had lost. <br>\r\nYou gave up and let your body go limp like a corpse shot on the battlefield, panting while enjoying the flow of pure euphoria rush through your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadam Rosella looked down on her defeated pet, while shoving some hair blocking her view out of the way. Her breasted heaved through the heavy breathing, sweat drops rolled down on her curvy, strong body, and with a mocking voice she spoke to you:</span></div></div>",

The Amazonian woman takes pleasure in your embarrassment \"How cute\" she says in a very satisfied tone. As you lay there on the bed trying to regain your strength from the intense love making the Amazonian woman raises up and is now standing above you head, she then takes her left foot and places it above your face. \"Lick\" she says to you while smiling. The smell of her foot is like that of a strong cheese it's aroma hits you very sharply. Her foot is about sized 12 you guess, it is still dirty but now also sweaty as drops of sweat hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come on you know you want too, you do this for your girlfriend too.\" How she knows this is beyond you guess, perhaps she can mind read as well. The smell and overall sexiness of her foot start to overpower you and you begin licking. You start with her toes first since they are the closest. \"Good I want each toe licked and be sure to go inbetween them too!\" Her toes have that cheesy taste you smelt before but you also take a bit of sweetness too. Your tongue brushes against her long toes as dirt that was once on her toes begin to fade, you then begin to slide your tongue inbetween her toes as well. You notice some toejam in between an hesitate for a bit but her her face is telling you otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gather you courage and resume licking. The taste between her toes is even stronger and the smell is like of 3 year old cheddar. After your done with her toes she then positions her foot to now were her sole is now on you tongue. \" Lick my sole down to my heels \" she demands. Your tongue now somewhat tired resumes it's job. Her sole tastes very similar to her toes very cheesy but also still very sweaty from the fucking earlier, while it does make licking the dirt from her feet easier it leaves a very salty taste in you mouth. After ten or so minutes of licking her sole up and down she pulls her foot away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins inspecting her foot to see if any dirt is left. \" Hmm a decent job, perhaps I should keep you as my personal foot cleaner, it appears you like it as well. \" Unknown to you, you check and see that you penis is once again fully erect, throbbing even. You feel surprised and yet somewhat ashamed of this realization. \" I ...  No this is... \" you mumble to her while trying to speak. \"Well I suppose you have earned a reward. She steps a few inches away from your head and just as quick takes her newly cleaned foot and gently places it on your penis. A sudden jolt hits you and she looks at you and says \"Don't worry footjobs are my specialty so be grateful.\" She then begins rubbing her long foot against your saft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts at a slow pace, her sole moves up and down quite easily on you penis as you have just finished with your tongue bath on it. Aside from the slippery feel of her foot her sole have a very soft and silky like texture, not having a rough feel as you first thought with her callused feet you saw her in her old lady form. She then begins to knead the tip of you penis with her toes with each toe massaging your dick. It isn't long before you feel the urge to cum and let out a gasp and and your cum unloads out of you and on to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's how long you last, hmph!! Not even two minutes.\" She then walks up to your head and extends her right foot to your face and says \" Open your mouth! \" With not much choice you slowly begin to open your mouth to prepare to pick her other foot when she suddenly sticks her foot in your mouth. Her toes wriggle inside your mouth against your tongue and the taste of dirt and cheese hit your mouth again. After a few minutes of this she takes her foot out again and say \"Now stuck your tongue out!\" You immediately do so upon instructed and she then drags her long foot and slides it across your tongue. After a few minutes of tasting her sole again, she then begins to once again rub her foot against your shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other foot feels very smooth as well and with your cum acting as lubrication which send shocks up and down your body. You begin to tremble as you feel another load coming when she suddenly stops. \"Not yet let's enjoy this more\" she says after taking her foot off. You look at her with some desperation in your eyes, the urge to release is dominating your mind she then sits down on the bed and places both feet on your penis and begins to play with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne foot felt like too much but both feet feel unbearably overwhelming for you. The softness of both feet caressing you penis and her toes wiggling up and down your penis almost makes you cum but she again stops when she see 's this. After a minute or you calming  down she resumes again the times going even faster as you begin to feel more of her soles rubbing you up and down, only to stop again just before you cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe keeps doing this to you for what seems like hours until finally after awhile she says \"You have suffered enough to ahead and relieve yourself\" She then used her toes to firmly grasp your penis and without a moment sion we you cum with such vigor. You lay back and feel like you can  a marathon.</span></div></div>",

It must have felt pleasant, cause suddenly she closes her dark eyes and lightly leans back her head, welcoming the feeling which is beginning to fill her inside. <br>\r\nAnd then you see it, happening so slowly at first. The first thing you saw was her red sleeves slowly but surely sliding backwards, exposing more and more of her arms. Then her head rising up gently, her chocolate colored face half-hidden by her long, wild and black hair, the dark eye makeup camouflaging with it, making it hard to point out its details. Only her red lips and clenched, white teeth shined out above them all. You then heard a ripping sound coming from below, and looked down to see her tight red top now somehow seemed even tighter than before, as you could see her cleavage was slowly bulging in their fastened position, like golden brown bread slowly rising in the oven. Flesh groans and bone stretching noises could now be heard emerging from the slowly, growing gypsy. <br>\r\nThen movement at the ground caught your attention, her feet were sliding along the bare grass without her moving them, her dark red toes were surely but steadily expanding and lengthening beneath you, creeping towards you. Her red skirt you lastly saw, weaving back and forth, inching higher and higher up and widening it\u2019s reach, showing more and more of the gypsy\u2019s strong legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not believe what you witnessed, not only could you see it but you could also hear it. The tent was filling up with the stretching noises of destressed clothes, getting louder and louder. Her shoulder seams ripped open, allowing her collarbone to widen further, and a sudden tear at her chest sent a jiggle through her boobs that were overflowing her top, bloating more and more, it must have been a relief to get that extra room to grow in judging by the gypsy\u2019s moan when it happened. As her grunting face got further and further away from you, her top could no longer cover her nice pot belly, which stretched and widen like the rest of her, her bellybutton moving to the rhythm of her excited breathing. <br>\r\nAfter breaking several threads her broad hips had finally torn the waistband, which made her skirt fall to the ground like a red, silk curtain to a theatre play, showing you her distressed panties, which hardly covered her sex anymore.<br>\r\nThe panties were wedged between her thighs like a thong and the straps were painfully digging into her hips. From the panties' mesh where dark, savage hair sprouting out like weed, and a trail of it was growing up to her bellybutton. Listening to the burst of growth noises you watched as the black shrubbery got longer and thicker with each passing second, pushing the panties further and further down, exposing her musky vagina and choking the mesh more and more with dark, unwashed, evergrowing hair. <br>\r\nAnd then her legs; she had bent them slightly now and seemed to have balance trouble as she lightly shuffled them like she was fainting. They were steamily thick and you could hear them groan with expanding flesh, getting bigger and bigger, muscular brown legs that now where was wide as your waist. <br>\r\nThe rest of the red skirt had landed on her feet, her toes where poking out beneath it, wiggling in the dirt, getting larger and wider. When you turned your eyes down to them, you could smell a strong foot odor, its scent getting stronger and stronger. A pop snapped your neck back right up; the gypsy seemed to be 6 feet and 5 inches tall, and the pop came just right above your head, her top could no longer contain her bloated breasts, and heavily did they fall, showing off chocolate milk bags the size of soccer balls, you could hear them slosh their content around as they jiggled from their release. The gypsy had let go of her grip on you, and had stretched her arms up into the air like she was waking up from a nap, her fingers touching the celling of the tent and moaned happily as she exposed her sweaty armpits, this whole experience had clearly worked her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill standing in half crouch position I stared up in awe of this former 4 feet tall shortstack of a dirty gypsy, who had grown into a 9 feet tall, unshaven, wild, amazon whose brown skin was glistering with sweat, and made her long, curly, black hair hang. \u201cWELL LITTLE MAN\u201d the gypsy voice had gotten deeper and rich: \u201cYOU STILL TAKE ME FOR A CON ARTIST?\u201d the large, naked savage laughed at you with her hands on her chubby hips, making her entire body lightly shake, the force clapping her boobs together and her body fat jiggle. <br>\r\nYou did nothing but fall to the ground in disbelieve with a mute, open mouth and wide eyes. Her laughter turned into a bright, sinister smile, the only thing beside her teasing, eyes painted with thick, dark mascara you really could see for sure between her messy, dark hair which had grown longer as well. \u201cWELL I\u2019M NOT DONE GROWING YET, THIS IS ONLY A SLIGHT OF THE POWER I POSSE!\u201d she taunted you by showing off her body by gliding her hands up and down it, squeezing her bloated breasts, rubbing her plumb stomach and massaging her giant, brown ass. \u201cHOWEVER, ALL THIS GROWING HAVE MADE ME QUITE... HOT\u201d <br>\r\nYou watched in fear as her hands went down to her overgrown pussy, where her fingers parted her dark, hairy lips, lubricating them in steaming, pussy juices and then kneaded her fat mons with it. \u201cYOU WILL MAKE A FINE TOY FOR ME.\u201d Your heart skipped a beat, and you looked around the tent desperately for an exit. Madame Rosella reached out a hand towards you, the musk remaining on her fingers hit your nostrils hard, but she hadn\u2019t noticed the remains of her red skirt still were roped around her legs, making her trip right as he took her first step towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a gasp of surprise, and her giant, thick, gypsy body fell through the tent wall with a crash, which gave you the opportunity to get the fuck out of target. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You ran out from the carnival gate which she tried to crawl through, however her hips got stuck, trapping her for good as she tried to squeeze through with all her might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were relieved to see that the giant gypsy\u2019s rampage had now been stopped, but she smiled down at you wickedly: <br>\r\n\u201cYou think you can contain me? Do you still think there is something big enough to stop me?\u201d<br>\r\nSuddenly you could hear creaking from the metalwork, and groaning from the gypsy\u2019s body, she was slowly growing again.<br>\r\n\u201cNothing can hold me, I will just grow bigger, little man! I will bulge and rip through any prison cloth,\u201d<br>\r\nHer hips widen, its flesh began to overflow the side of the gate, applying more and more stress.<br>\r\n \u201cMy ever-growing feet will *grunt* BREAK any chain,\u201d <br>\r\nThe metal groaned further, as burst after burst of growth began overwhelming it.<br>\r\n\u201cmy fat ass will *GRUNT* BEND any cell bar!\u201d<br>\r\nBolts and pipes broke off the gate, giving her hips even more space to expand, as she wiggled it, shaking the remains of the gate still stuck to her.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you going to do?

I\u2019m your queen, and you WILL treat me as such.\u201d<br>\r\nShe found a building she could rest up against, dropping her plump, gypsy cheeks and laid back with you in her hand.</span></div></div>",

You felt powerless as you tried to wiggle yourself free, but no use, you felt yourself getting lifted up into the air as the busty, golden brown, gypsy rose out of the ruined tent. Higher and higher up you went, past her crotch, belly and breasts, until you were face to face with the giggling giantess. You felt her warm breath as she spoke: \u201cNot so easily, little man\u201d her dark eyes gleamed at you: \u201cEven if you did escape, I would just start searching the entire town to find you! Lifting every car on my way, looking through all the windows on each floor, my hands bursting through walls, as I feel around for bodies, tipping over skyscrapers and all that. I would have to kick over houses to see if you were hiding beneath them too, like a cockroach under a ROCK!\u201d she squeezed you a tiny bit, making you whimper in pain. \u201cyou fear me now, don\u2019t you?\u201d she sighed, as her entire body grew some more, making everything rumble and her hand engulfing you even more.  \u201cYou saw me as disgusting when we met, didn\u2019t you? A small, filthy, dark-skinned gypsy, walking around in bare feet and sold silly magic tricks! Well this will teach you a lesson of respect!\u201d She giggled as she in one swift swoop stuffed you down her cleavage, who recently were no bigger than Pomegranate but had now swelled, expanded and plumped themselves to more than ten times the size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like being stuffed in a sea of warm, squishy flesh and you struggled against these fat, sloshy tits the size of garden swimming pools, but the gypsy squeezed them together, pinching her big, dark nipples in the process, moaning happily while laughing at your struggles. Long, black hair fell on top of her breasts, as she looked down on you fighting in her gifted bosom: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, tiny man, can\u2019t handle a real woman? You probably don\u2019t like that a gypsy like me can grow such nice, busty rack, that couldn\u2019t fit inside a white woman\u2019s bra, don\u2019t you? You just can\u2019t stand the thought of such primitive, disgusting gypsies having such bigger, superior bodies, nor being the slave to one!\u201d With one hand she pinched your body and yanked you out of her mighty cleavage, lifting you up to her smug, red lips and playful, dark eyes, lightly covered by strings of black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I made all the other gypsies grow too? Imagine it, tents and circus wagons tearing apart, as unwashed feet, legs and arms bursts forth, boobs growing in volume so your small, pathetic cloths can\u2019t contain them anymore, pants ripping apart by true, long cocks growing greater and larger than white men\u2019, the height difference getting smaller between us, then passing by you and extending further as ruined rags litters the ground more and more. Imagine it, looking up at a forest of hairy legs from giant gypsies, scratching their furry crotches, while mockingly looking down on you, small, gnomes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring talking, the giant gypsy had begun rubbing her big, hairy pussy, getting hot at the thought of domination. She had let herself fall on her giant, bloated ass with a big boom, feeling the ruined tent parts being crushed beneath her butt made her even more excited, making her wiggle it a bit to hear those crunching sounds. She stared at you with intense lust, as her fantasy kept running more wild: \u201cAnd we will fuck, in parks, in parking lots, in the middle of the street, crushing cars, buildings and street lights in the process, and there will be nothing you could do to stop us! Before they would throw us in jail when we were tiny and small, but now our boobs have ripped through the prison clothes, our legs gotten too thick for chains, our asses grown too big and wide for the electric chair! We can cum where we want now, masturbate whenever we like to do it, leaving stinky messes everywhere for you to clean up, this entire town will reek of gypsy as we grow more\u2026 and more\u2026 and MORE!\u201d She came, blasting a rain of pussy juices across the carnival grounds, releasing a roaring moan while doing so. Afterwards she let herself fall down on her back, panting heavily and the pace of her breasts heaving up and down became steadily slower as she relaxed from the orgasm. Suddenly she felt that something was missing, and saw that her hand was empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her heat, you managed to escape the mad, enormous gypsy. You ran through the carnival\u2019s alleys and out of the carnivals entrance gate as you tried to find you girlfriend, she must be somewhere around the parking lot. </span></div></div>",

We need to get away from here! There is a big monster rampaging inside the carnival!\u201d your girlfriend, Stacy, was nicely 7 feet tall, with nice long legs, shoulder-long, blond hair, golden earrings, good hips and lovely D cup breasts. She wore a sleeveless, tank top, which let her belly being entirely exposed, it wasn\u2019t completely chubby, but it did have a nice bottom curve to it, and it showed her arm tattoos too. She was quickly walking towards you in her black sandals, but you knew running away wasn\u2019t optional, so you came up with something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you had some of that dust the gypsy used on herself in your pocket which you could use on yourself, however you wanted to make sure that your girlfriend at least would survive the gypsy\u2019s terror, in case she got squished beneath her feet during their encounter. \u201cStacy, there is no time to explain!\u201d You blew the dust into her face, shocking her as she made a slight \u201csqueak!\u201d and tried to wave it out of her face.<br>\r\nBehind you, heavy footsteps approached, getting louder and louder. You looked towards the carnival grounds, where a head was poking out from the tents and banners, an angry head covered in long, black hair, getting higher and higher up into the air, as she got closer and closer: \u201cTHERE YOU ARE!\u201d she sneered, you could see her entire body now, it jiggled in heavy bounces with heavy earth shaking step she took, she must be 50 feet now! Her huge toes landed just beside you, and your girlfriend scurried away as she bent down to pick you up: \u201cYou think you can escape me? I already told you I will smash every bit of this town to get you tiny insect, perhaps I should keep you in my ass? That way I can FEEL where you are at any time!\u201d as the gypsy was barking at you, a changing was happening below her. Stacy was feeling dizzy and strangely weird, the dust was taking its effect on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly her clothing got tight, her legs got longer, and her shirt pulled further up, as her body became harder to cover. First her sandals popped, its string breaking against Stacy\u2019s growing feet, who sprouted further and further out from the sandal\u2019s soles. Her legs stretched, already being pretty long in the start, now sent her inch after inch up into the air, holding her lovely, wide hips high, who struggled against the tedious pants. They who got shorter and smaller on Stacy. Big lumps of flesh burst the seams at her thighs, and the zipper broke with a bang, giving her more room to expand in, and showing her panties that now struggled to contain her womanhood, digging into her hips more and more, as it became a thong on her growing, lovely, clean-cut cunt. Her stomach bulged over the rim of the pants as well, getting larger just like the rest of the body, but made her look quit chubby in those ever-smaller pants, they could't even keep her ass cheeks inside now as they too bulged out of both ends, groaning against the fabric, showing more and more of her squeezed crack! At the top, a pair of globes was steadily filling up her top, shooting outwards in burst after burst, struggling against her tiny bra and shirt, as her collar ripped more and more from them and her expanding neck. \"Everything is so tiny!\" Stacy complained: \"I can't help it, my boobs... feel... so... TIGHT!\" The top finally ripped in half, making Stacy moan in relief as it freed her compressed breasts, who overwhelmed the tiny D cup bra with its bloated, overgrown, beach ball boobs, it didn\u2019t even cover her nipples anymore, who proudly hung out from her chest, getting large and puffy as well. Feet after feet she grew, feeling nice and good, as her earrings slipped off, her bra and her panties snapped, making her feel that fresh, outdoor air blow on her large, shaven pussy. It felt so good, making Stacy close her eyes as she enjoyed the outdoor freedom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the gypsy paid attention, to that white, blond girl which was expanding right in front of her, stretching her tattooed arms up into the air, as her butt fattened and legs grew taller, the parking lot asphalt rubbing along her toes and feet as she got bigger and bigger. She approached the gypsy\u2019s size, then passed it, and grew taller than her 50 feet, mightier and larger than the gypsy burst after burst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth stopped when the gypsy was at eye height with Stacy\u2019s big, curvy belly, the same height proportions they probably would have had when they both were small, once again the gypsy was dwarfed in size. </span></div></div>",

All you wanted was to help her survive madam Rosella's wrath, but instead you made her twice the woman's size. The gypsy could only reach your girlfriend's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth...'' Stacy breathed while looking herself over. She was massive now. Everything else around her paled in comparison. Even her car was tiny compared to her. How had this happened? People didn't just grow out of the blue. Then she remembered the powder you blew in her face... and the monster that threatened you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadam Rosella on the other hand couldn't believe what she was seeing. You're girlfriend had suddenly grown right before her very eyes. That shouldn't have been possible... unless, you stole her growth dust! Knowing that filled her with even more rage. How dare you steal from the great madam Rosella! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh-hum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of throat clearing drew her attention. So caught up in her hatred for you, the gypsy failed to remember that not only was your girlfriend now a giant, she was also bigger as well. Madam Rosella craned her neck to meet the larger girl's gaze and soon wished she hadn't. The scowl on Stacy's face promised nothing pleasant for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't fully understand what's going on here, but from the way you were shouting earlier I'd say it something to do with my boyfriend.\" Stacy said seriously. She was right on the money too. This whole mess only got started because that gypsy tried to cheat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Madam Rosella growled at the mere mention of you. \"That man has the audacity to insult my power and call me, Madam Rosella, a fraud! How dare he! That man will suffer! I swear it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Stacy needed to hear. While she wasn't normally one for violence, she would be damned before she let this nut harm you. She caused all the trouble simply because you thought she was a fraud. Was she daft? Most people think gypsy's are frauds. Professional wrestlers were more legit then them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she wanted to hurt you over something so petty, she was going to have to get through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now stand aside woman or face the consequences.\" The gypsy threatened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy had enough. Before Madam Rosella knew it, she was being hoisted in the air. \"Foolish girl! What in the seven hells are you doing!?\" she asked startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Making you answer for what you've done.\" Stacy spat. Much like a child she hoisted the smaller giantess over her knee and reeled her hand back. You watched in complete shock as she smacked the once powerful gypsy hard on her rear. The sound was loud  that you winced. No doubt the gypsy witch was going to feel that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy brought her hand back and spanked her again. Rosella cringed as her ass stung. This foolish girl was giving her a spanking. She hadn't been spanked once in her life outside of her birth. How dare she do this to her? How dare she humiliate her in such a way? Tears began form around her eyes as she felt another hard smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow dare she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a hearty grin she points to the ground and whispers... \"Kneel.\" Your body falls to it's knees and you sit before her, anxiously waiting to see what comes next. She lifts up her left leg, her toes wiggling in your face and says down to you... \"Kiss.\" You grab her foot and bring it up to your face, closing your eyes in a passionate kiss against her sole. She giggles at the ticklish feeling of her new slave's lips against her bare feet and says \"That's enough... Release.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly you regain control of your body, spitting out a bit of the grime that you had taken in from kissing her feet.

She laughs and crosses her foot across her lap, twirling her ratty hair in her fingers. \"Now you see what I am capable of, you stupid man.

Now have you learned your lesson?\" You clench your fists, humiliated and filled with rage at the fact that this short gypsy woman has basically forced you to act like her pet. You hold it back though, saying slowly \"... Yes Ma'am.. I have.\" She starts to smile and says \"Very well then. The spirits have given me enough power for just one more command. Are you ready to follow it?\" You sigh and say \"Whatever it takes to get out of this tent alive.\" She laughs and says \"Very well then. Here's your final command.

You hold up your hand to shield yourself, but manage to pick yourself up to follow the signal.  You walk blindly through the dust and sand, until you come to the beacon in the middle of nothingness... an old dusty lamp.  You've read enough stories to know what this could mean, and immediately rub the lamp.  To your ultimate disappointment, nothing happens.  You angrily throw the lamp away and continue walking into the barren wasteland before you.  That is, until you hear a feminine voice from behind you say \"Excuse me!\"  You quickly spin around to see a gorgeous woman with light brown skin and long black hair waving towards you.  You stumble back to the girl, who is dressed in revealing pink linens and a thin matching veil, and wave your hands in front of her. She pulls down her veil and smiles, saying \"Hello there.  Are you alright?\"  You compose yourself and say \"I'm... I'm sorry i've been wandering for so long... are you real?\"  She giggles and says \"I am no mirage, stranger.  My name is Inara, and I have been imprisoned in that lamp for so long.  Tell me, were you the one who rubbed the lamp?\"  You stare back at her and nod \"Uh, yeah...

But be careful in your words, master.  Once the third wish has concluded, I am free from your requests, and will return to the lamp for another thousand years... that is, unless one of your wishes is to free me.\"  She brushes a soft hand across your dirty face, sensually whispering to you in a way that drives you crazy \"I've been in that damned container as a slave for the past ten thousand years.  I've hoped that a kind, generous man would find the lamp and wish me away from this life.  Please consider setting me free, master.\"  You take a big gulp and say \"Of... Of course.

The posts are adorned with pink curtains and streamers, matching the material that lines the walls, and there are tables in every corner of the room with burning incense flooding your nose with sweet smells.  The room is quite peaceful and you're more than happy to be out of that desert, but you'd still like to know where you are.  \"Genie?\"  you call out, but to no answer.  You walk around the room taking in the scale of the bed and couches.  It's an incredibly comfortable place, but still you wish to know exactly what your location is.  \"Inara?\"  That seems to work as you hear a pleasant voice ring out  \"OH, I'M RIGHT HERE, MASTER!\"  Her voice is far away from you, you can tell.

Inara calls from the other room \"Master, do you know where you are right now?\"  You replied no, since you honestly hadn't the feintest clue.  It was definitely cozy, to say the least but you would be better off knowing exactly what you've gotten yourself into.  Inara laughs and says \"Okay, Master.  Just close your eyes and don't open them until i tell you to.  Go ahead!\"  You shrug your shoulders and close your eyes, letting Inara have her way.  You are joined by a presence on the bed as the weight shifts to one side, so you imagine that Inara is climbing into the bed with you!  But you are thrown off by the same sensation happening on the other side of your body!  Is there someone else in here with you two?  You hear giggling and smell strong perfume all around you. You hear Inara say \"Okay, Master. You may open them now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you open your eyes, someone is directly in your vision, you are greeted by a pretty asian girl with long black hair and a green shaul over her face. next to her is a well-toned redhead with similar clothing styled in the color purple. You are surrounded by gorgeous women on all sides, all of which seem to be focusing on you. \"Inara, what's going on here?\" Inara laughs and says \"Master, welcome to the Harem of Sugara-Raja.  I figured you could use a long rest after your travels in the desert, so I took you to this palace filled with gorgeous women.  Are you pleased?\"  You look at all the women, two or three of whom have begun disrobing you and kissing your body all over.  The others are sensually rubbing your body with their hands, getting you more aroused in a quicker time than you've felt in years.  This is heaven!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do these ladies meet your standards of beauty?\"  You are blown away by the attention the girls are giving you and turn to Inara and say \"This is incredible!  I wish i could get into all of their pants!\"  Inara's eyes light up and she says \"Wait, Master... did I just hear you say wish?\"  You immediately regret your last sentence and say \"No.  NO!  Inara, don't do anything!  I don't want to go anywhere!\"  Inara just claps her hands together and you feel the same magic energy surround you as it did before.  The girls back off in surprise as you feel your whole body surrounded by the warm glow of Inara's powers.  \"Your wish is my command master.  And soon you will be able to get into the pants of ALL of these women...\"  What is she doing to you?</span></div></div>",

You fall out of your underwear (which at this point was the only thing left), and stand up naked before the giantesses as your shrinking finally slows to a stop.  You stare up at the beautiful titans laying beside you, each one speechless as they look down at your little body.  Judging by the closest girl to you, you figure you can't be any bogger than the shortest girl's little finger.  You are beyond tiny at this point, surrounded by absolutely stunning women the size of skyscrapers looking down at you!  The first one to move from her position is the Asian dressed in green.  She lowers her veil and you can see her pretty smile as she leans in towards you.  She cautiously extends a hand out to reach for you, and you stand still as her index finger brushes softly across your hair.  She gasps in amusement and says \"HE IS SO ADORABLE!  I'VE NEVER SEEN A MAN AS SMALL AS HIM BEFORE, I JUST WANT TO HOLD HIM AND KISS HIM FOREVER!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are comforted by the giant woman's words, but she is pushed away by the redhead from earlier.  She looks at you a different way, almost like a cat toying with a mouse she'd cornered.  She puts out a hand alongside you, holding her thumb and forefinger open the entire length of your body.  She smirks and whispers \"AINT THIS A SIGHT.  I'VE GOT A MASTER SMALLER THAN ME DAMN THUMB.\"  She  holds out the thumb in question in front of you and pushes it against your face, knocking you to the ground.  She laughs at your plight and you scramble back to your feet, in time for her to continue chewing you out with her thick irish accent, \"I'VE GOT A FEW IDEAS OF WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO TO A TINY LIL' DOLL FOR A MASTER.  ALL THE PLACES A SHRIMP LIKE YOU'D FIT INTO... YOU'D GET A WORKOUT WITH ME, THAT'S FOR SURE.\"  You gulp and take a few steps back on the bed, not really interested in being turned into the giant redhead's sex toy.  Looking back up you can see all manner of different races and nationalities descending upon you, each with their own ideas of how to please, use or abuse you.  It's almost entirely overwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a voice from behind you booms out \"NOW NOW, GIRLS.  YOU SHALL ALL HAVE YOUR CHANCE TO PLAY WITH THE LITTLE MASTER.\"  Before you can turn around, you are scooped up into a warm brown hand, held comfortably as you are lifted high into the air.  When the hand opens again, you are laying flat on the palm of your genie, Inara!  Only now she is less of a genie and more of a beautiful goddess, with the power to harm you very easily quite literally at her fingertips!  You call up to her \"Inara please!  Make me big again!\"  Inara just giggles and says \"YOUR VOICE IS SO SQUEAKY AND SMALL NOW MASTER!  IT'S QUITE AMUSING!  BUT I'M AFRAID I CAN'T REVERSE THE SPELL.  YOU WANTED TO GET INTO THE PANTS OF EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM.  NOW THAT YOU ARE SO SMALL, YOU SHOULD EASILY FIT!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curse your luck at getting a genie that would take your words so literally, and call up to her again \"Fine then, I have one wish left!  I wish to be back to...\"  You don't get to finish your wish as your voice is drowned out by Inara letting out a mighty yawn.  Using her free hand to cover her mouth, you are ignored completely as the genie says \"I'M SORRY MASTER, BUT I AM QUITE TIRED FROM YOUR PAST FEW WISHES.  I WILL NEED TO RETIRE FOR A FEW HOURS TO GET MY REST.  UNTIL THEN YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE HAREM OF WOMEN WHO WOULD LOVE TO PLAY WITH YOU.\"  Before you have a chance to protest, she lifts you quickly up to her massive lips and presses you into them, giving you the single most impressive kiss you've ever recieved.  When she releases the pressure and you sink back into her palm speechless, she whispers \"I'LL SEE YOU LATER TONIGHT MASTER.\"  Her attention draws back to the army of beautiful, equally large women before her and she says \"VERY WELL.  WHO WILL BE THE FIRST TO GIVE MY SHRUNKEN MASTER THE PLEASURE HE DESERVES?\"  You spin around to face the girls and see that one of the women have already begun reaching out for you.  You are plucked from the relative safety of Inara's palm, and find yourself dangling between two huge digits.  Who do the fingers belong to?</span></div></div>",

You climb out of the bed and make your way to the staircase that leads downwards.  You begin to get wary of the massive quakes and movements you hear outside the house, hoping that she hasn't transported you to some sort of battlefield or something.  You start to become increasingly suspicious as the furnishings of the house seem either plastic or painted on, almost like one of those houses they test nuclear bombs on.  When you finally make it to the front door, you hear another loud spurt of laughter outside that does nothing to calm your nerves.  The doors of this house look flimsy, almost as if they were built out of one thin piece of wood.  It takes very little effort to push it open, but you are not expecting what lays before you on the other side:  First of all, there is carpet.  Nothing but tall strands of carpet as far as the eye can see, each strand reaching up to about your shins.  Then there are rounded walls far off, what seem like miles ahead of you.  But you are not too concerned with the walls in the distance, because right in front of you, standing on the carpet is the genie, Inara.  She is standing barefoot before the house, at a height that appears to be several hundred feet tall!  She is enormous!  And that's when you realize that no, she is not taller... you have gotten much much smaller.  Your eyes are drawn to the genie's feet, each toe wiggling with a bright red paint that signifies she is quite excited to see her master at just a few inches tall.  You begin to breath heavily as you realize that just one of her pretty toes could crush you effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the laughter return, only this time you can easily pinpoint the source as you look up the goddess's legs.  She is standing defiantly with her hands on her hips, easily amused at the pint-sized person she is in control of.  \"OH, DOES THE MASTER WISH TO PLAY WITH MY FEET? LET ME GIVE YOU A CLOSER LOOK THEN.\"  With a powerful laugh, the giant genie presses her toes against the doorframe, pushing you backwards into the house.  You flee from your position and go up the stairs, trying your best to ignore the quakes and laughter coming from the outside.  The genie's magic must have shrunk you, you are now nothing but a doll to her... a plaything in a dollhouse she keeps in her lamp!  She is obviously enjoying watching you panic as you can feel her presense blocking windows outside.  The powerful perfume she wears all the time is seeping through the openings of the house and causing you to fall into somewhat of a toxic trance.  You shake it off and head for a window, hoping to jump out unnoticed.  But before you can reach it, you are shocked to find a gigantic head peeking in on you.  It's beutiful brown eyes are staring deep into your soul, as the giant woman they are connected to whispers \"I HAVE FOUND YOU, TINY MASTER!  YOU ARE SO ADORABLE IN YOUR LITTLE DOLLHOUSE!\"  You gulp at the fact that she must be telling you the truth:  She's reduced you to nothing more than a toy for her to play with!  You only hope she'll be gentle as she plans on \"playing\" with you...</span></div></div>",

She is still there, with that playful smile plastered on her face, but it's a bit farther away than before.  Just outside the window, placed right below it is her hand, held palm up inviting you to enter it.  \"IT'S OKAY, LITTLE MASTER.  JUST CLIMB OUT THE WINDOW AND I'LL CARRY YOU TO THE BED.  I JUST WANT TO HOLD YOU FOR A WHILE.\"  With every passing second, you forget and are instantly reminded of just how small you are.  Her presence is massive and intimidating, but the look in her eyes makes you feel safe enough to climb out of the window and jump down to her waiting palm.  \"LAY DOWN, MASTER.  IF YOU TRY TO STAND WHILE I'M LIFTING YOU, YOU'LL JUST FALL OVER.\"  She's obviously done this to many people before in the past, and you comply with her orders.  The skin of her palm is smooth and silky, almost like a warm, flesh colored mattress.  And the lotion in her hands smells vaguely of cocoa.  For your entire trip off of the ground, you feel more comfortable than you could possibly imagine.  You feel yourself stop moving and sit up in the genies hand as her head hovers above. \"I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ME BEING SO FORWARD MASTER, BUT I HAVE HAD SEVERAL MEN FIND MY BOTTLE, AND I HAVE HAD MANY MEN COMMANDING MY EVERY MOVE.  BUT YOU ARE BY FAR THE MOST HANDSOME ONE YET.\"  You are somewhat caught off guard by the giant's kind words, and feel somewhat more comfortable standing up in the palm of her hand.  You shout up to her in response \"Well, thank you.  That's... very nice.  I mean, you are nothing like I expected a genie to be.  You are very pretty.\"  You weren't lying.  Even from your tiny perspective, Inara was one of the most gorgeous things you've seen in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInara blushes a bright shade of red and giggles saying \"WHY MASTER, YOU... YOU FIND ME ATTRACTIVE?\"  You feel the skin of her hand start to get warmer as she smiles down on you, the body heat intoxicating and persuading your every word.  \"Of course.  I think you're the most beautiful woman i've ever laid my eyes on.\"  In a cheesy moment of excitement, you stand up and walk over to the edge of her hand, placing a small kiss on the side of her thumb.  She giggles at your gesture and says \"OH, MASTER.  YOU ARE TOO KIND TO SAY THAT.  BESIDES, YOU HAVE NOT EVEN SEEN ME WITHOUT MY CLOTHES ON.  HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT I'M THE MOST BEAUTIFUL IF YOU'VE NEVER GAZED UPON MY NATURAL FORM?\"  Your mind starts to race with the thought of the giantess in all her nude glory, but you take the modest route and say \"Well, i don't need to see you without clothes to know how beautiful you are.  No garments can change that.\"  Inara's smile grows even wider and she slowly lowers her hand down to the bed in front of her.  You climb off her soft hand, dropping down to the comforter that stretches on for what seems like miles and miles.  But you're not paying attention to the scenery, you're too transfixed on the giant genie, who's slipped a hand underneath the armstrap of her dress and brought it slowly over her shoulder.  \"I APPRECIATE THAT YOU BELIEVE I AM BEAUTIFUL WITHOUT CLOTHING, BUT FOR YOUR KIND WORDS, I THINK YOU DESERVE TO SEE FOR YOURSELF.\"  You think the genie is going to strip down in front of you, but she puts a little twist on it by snapping her fingers and articles of her clothing seem to disappear into thin air.  First her top, then her pants.  She does a quick spin in place, showing off her voluptuous body contained in nothing but her undergarments, until another snap removes them as well.  She walks towards you with powerful footsteps shaking your entire body on her bed, coming to a stop so tantalizingly close that you can actually feel her body heat.  She is a living, breathing statue of feminine beauty, and she is doing it just for you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THERE WE ARE, LITTLE MASTER.  NOW YOU SEE ALL OF ME.  HAS YOUR OPINION OF MY BEAUTY CHANGED AT ALL?\"  You can't even muster up a monosyllabic grunt, you are so dumbfounded.  instead you just shake your head back and forth, jaw gaping wide open at what you see.  The giantess leans down and carefully lays her hand behind you, her fingers closing gently over your small frame and lifting you off of the bed.  \"YOU ARE BY FAR THE KINDEST AND MOST APPRECIATIVE OF ALL MY MASTERS, SO I FEEL THAT YOU DESERVE A SPECIAL REWARD.\"  She lays down on the bed, comfortably shifting her body into position as she moves you around in her hand.  She carefully maneuvers you between her thumb and pointer finger, bringing you up to her gorgeous eyes and whispering to you \"MY BODY IS YOURS TO EXPLORE, MASTER.  PICK A PART OF ME THAT YOU WISH TO EXPERIENCE AT THIS SIZE, AND I WILL LET YOU HAVE SOME FUN.  AND BEFORE YOU ASK, NO.  THIS WILL NOT COUNT AS ONE OF YOUR WISHES.\"  You can't believe the genie is letting you have your way with her giant body!  She is so beautiful and sweet, you can't wait to explore all of her!  But you feel that she may only give you this one opportunity, so which part of her body would you like to explore?</span></div></div>",

You pace around the cavern that is her navel for a few seconds, feeling the warm skin beneath your bare feet sink slightly with every step.  Past the mountainous breasts, Inara's mouth forms a playful smirk as she watches your every move.  \"IT MUST BE SUCH A SIGHT, LITTLE MASTER.  SO MUCH OF MY GORGEOUS BODY TO PLAY WITH, IT MUST BE SO HARD TO DECIDE WHERE TO WANDER OFF TO FIRST.\"  She takes one hand and extends her pointer finger down towards your direction.  You think for a second she may try to poke your little body or stroke you like one would do to a pet, but instead she uses the finger to trace a circle in the skin around you.  Miniscule hair follicles on her bare belly stand up at her touch, and you can tell she's enjoying the feeling of toying with you as you walk on her body.  She closes her eyes and giggles a bit as she whispers almost just to herself \"I THINK I KNOW WHERE MY ITTY BITTY MASTER WANTS TO GO...\"  Her finger nudges your little body down away from her navel and she points in the direction of her lower body.  \"GO AHEAD MASTER.  RUN TO IT.  IT'S WAITING FOR YOU.  You look ahead to see a soft mound of black pubic hair covering the genie's most precious treasures.

The massive hand thrashes throughout the room, knocking over plastic pieces of furniture and scratching at the walls.  She is not being nearly as gentle as you would like her to be.  You can tell she's getting frustrated as she lets out a small groan and removes her hand from the dollhouse's small opening.  \"FINE THEN, MASTER.  IF YOU WON'T COME WILLINGLY, I'LL JUST HAVE TO COME IN AFTER YOU.\"  You hear the giantess standing to her feet outside the dollhouse and repositioning herself, and you think she may be going to get something to reach in for you... until you hear the walls and roof begin creaking and cracking loudly.  In an instant, the roof of the dollhouse comes flying off, flooding your eyes with unwelcome fluorescent light.  When you finally readjust to the light, you finally see Inara's beautiful face unobstructed by anything.  She is undoubtedly gorgeous, but is also the size of a downtown skyscraper!  You scream in surprise and run to the door, only to find that it doesn't open, almost as if it was just painted on with a handle glued to the wall!  When you turn around you are trapped in a warm, powerful fist that lifts you off the ground and brings you up out of the house. The genie's gigantic fingers maneuver you around in her grip, and before you know it you find yourself trapped in her hand, with only your head poking out above her fingers.  She is holding you right up to her face, her gigantic brown eyes staring down at you, and her lips cracked into a gleeful, terrifying smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HOPE I DON'T FRIGHTEN YOU TOO MUCH... I JUST LOVE IT WHEN MY MASTERS ARE SO SMALL AND IN MY HANDS.\"  She playfully extends the thumb of the hand holding you, and rubs it against your face, much like a girl would do to a pet or a doll.  You can't budge from her mighty grip, and instead just try to reason with her.  \"So that's why i'm so small?  Because you like being big?\"  Inara opens up the hand, releasing you from the tight restraint.  You are now able to move freely around in her hand, which is the size of a gigantic mattress.  \"NOT QUITE.  YOU SEE MASTER, MY BOTTLE ONLY HAS ONE BED. AND AS PER TRADITION, GENIES ARE FORBIDDEN TO SHARE THEIR OWN BEDS WITH THEIR MASTERS. AND SINCE THE ONLY OTHER BED IS A FEW INCHES LONG, I FIGURED YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE A BIT SMALLER TO ENJOY IT PROPERLY. WAS IT NOT COMFORTABLE?\" You shake your head at her and go \"Yes.... but... that's not the point. I'm so small now! You turned me into a freaking midget in order to get around some stupid genie law?\" She doesn't get angry, just bites her lip and says \"NO, MASTER YOU ARE NOT A MIDGET. YOU ARE A DOLL. A CUTE LITTLE MASTER DOLL. THAT I CAN POKE AND PROD AND DO ANYTHING I WANT WITH.\" As if to prove her point, she pokes you stiffly in the stomach and laughs as you let out a gasp of surprised air. You fear that she's going to continue teasing you, but instead you find yourself surprisingly comforted as her index finger traces the front of your body. Her warm, sweet breath washes over you as she says very sensually \"BUT I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING TO CAUSE YOU HARM, LITTLE MASTER. YOU ARE FAR TOO CUTE AND PRECIOUS THERE IN MY HANDS, AND I HAVE ALWAYS TREATED MY DOLLS WITH THE MOST DELICATE CARE.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thumb rubs against your genitals and you stop fighting the massive appendage. You close your eyes and just enjoy the feeling until she stops. With a booming giggle, you hear the giant genie say \"I THOUGHT THAT WOULD PLEASE YOU MASTER. IF YOU WISH TO STAY THIS SIZE, AT LEAST FOR NOW, WE COULD PLAY ALL SORTS OF GAMES.  SO WHAT WILL IT BE MASTER?\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a fit of panic, you attempt to crawl out the window and down to the floor below.  The giant woman just chuckles at your futile attempt and with her pinkie finger manages to pick your body up and throw you back into the house.  She leans in while sitting on her knees, with the bottom half of her face filling the window, presenting her big juicy lips before you.  As you scramble back to your feet and back away from the window, she whispers \"CAREFUL, MY LITTLE TOY.  I DON'T WANT YOU BREAKING YOURSELF BEFORE I HAVE A CHANCE TO HOLD YOU IN MY HANDS FIRST.\"  With a wicked smile, she leans back out and starts to move off of her kneeling position before you.  She stands up and stomps around the house and you hear her say through the walls \"BUT JUST SO YOU DON'T GET ANY MORE BRAVE IDEAS...\"  You hear her snap her fingers and all of a sudden the doors and windows of the house close shut.  You run to the nearest window and try to open it but even with all your might, you can't get it to budge an inch.  You go around from entrance to entrance but you can not escape the house at all.  You can still see through cracks in the windows and doors that a shadow is creeping around the house, and her booming footsteps tell you that she is pacing slowly around the perimeter, circling her prey. When the footfalls stop, you hear her voice again say \"MASTER IF YOU WISH TO SEE ME MORE CLEARLY, I SUGGEST GOING TO THE ATTIC FLOOR OF THE HOUSE.  THAT WAY WE CAN BOTH LOOK AT EACH OTHER.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to follow the giantess's instructions and make your way up the large plastic staircase to your left.  There is more than enough room for you to move around in the house, almost as if the design was for dolls that were slightly taller than you are right now.  As you make your way to the top, the attic is less cluttered than the bottom floors.  A few pieces of doll furniture and tattered remains of clothes and curtains.  To your surprise the clothes do not look like doll fabric.  They look like they'd be suited to other people who would be around your size.  Before you can take that all in, the square roof of the attic begins to shake and in one swift movement it is lifted off the house.  Light floods the attic and you take a second to brace yourself.  When you are able to see clearly again, you are faced with the beautiful, dangerous face of the genie.  She has taken her veil off and is letting her long black hair drape her shoulders.  She looks positively mesmerizing.  She tilts her head in a playful manner and says \"ARE WE GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO OUR NEW SURROUNDINGS?  I HAVE TO SAY MASTER, YOU ARE A PERFECT FIT FOR THAT HOUSE.  I HOPE YOU FIND IT COZY.\"  Before you can respond, she stops leaning over the roof and stands to her full height, and it's at this moment you get a better glimpse of just how small you are.  The roof of the house only reaches just above the woman's knee, and her massive frame casts a shadow over you as she stands tall with her arms at her sides.  In a sudden burst of energy you look at some of the furniture and realize that if you stood up on it, you may be able to reach the edge of the roof and escape.  You quickly climb atop one of the pieces, but Inara catches you almost immediately and bends down quickly with a hand extended \"NO NO NO, BAD MASTER!\"  Her fingers curl into each other and she gently (to her own strength) quickly extends her index finger, flicking you off the furniture and landing on your back.  She continues to look down at you and says \"I THOUGHT LOCKING THE WINDOWS WOULD SHOW YOU HOW DANGEROUS IT IS TO TRY AND ESCAPE, BUT CLEARLY YOU DIDN'T LEARN.  I'M NOT KEEPING YOU IN THERE BECAUSE I WANT TO TRAP YOU, MASTER.  I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT WHILE YOU'RE SO SMALL.  THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS FOR A LITTLE TOY TO INJURE HIMSELF OUTSIDE THE DOLLHOUSE.\"  Her leg lifts up and you briefly see her wiggling toes for a split second before her foot comes crashing down again into the carpet.  The impact is enough to rattle the inside of the house and you start to lose your footing.  \"I COULD SQUISH YOU BY ACCIDENT WITHOUT EVEN THINKING ABOUT IT.  YOUR WHOLE LIFE COULD END UNDER MY DAINTY FEET.\"  She bends down and reaches her hands around the outside of the dollhouse, lifting the entire thing off of the ground.  The world rises up as Inara's face gets closer the more she pulls it in.  She has a more serious look on her face as she says \"DON'T YOU TRY TO LEAVE THE DOLLHOUSE AGAIN WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.  OTHERWISE I'LL HAVE TO BE A LITTLE MORE ROUGH WITH YOU.\"  And to emphasize this point, she tilts the dollhouse slightly, causing the furniture, clothing, and you yourself to fly into the walls.  Inara laughs as she tilts the box from side to side, screaming \"EARTHQUAAAAKE!  HAHAHA\"  She moves the box around for a bit more until you find yourself smacked against every wall of the attic, praying for her to stop, which thankfully she does after a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInara's laughter fills up the house as you pull pieces of cloth and doll sized furniture off of your battered body.  \"OH MASTER YOU'RE SO MUCH FUN TO PLAY WITH.  AND I'VE GOT A LONG LIST OF GAMES WE CAN GET OURSELVES INTO!\"  You manage to brush yourself off and stand up tall to shout at the giant woman.  \"Dammit Genie, that's enough!  I wish...\"  you don't get to finish as the Genie drops the dollhouse back to the ground and says \"OH!  HOW SILLY OF ME TO FORGET.  YOU'RE A DOLL NOW.  AND DOLLS CAN'T SPEAK TO PEOPLE.\"  She waves her hand and your voice goes silent.  You are still able to talk to yourself, but every time you try to raise your voice to the genie, no words come out.  And that means there's no way to wish your way out of this situation.  She delights in your realization and giggles at your frustration, almost like a child would.  \"THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.  NOW MASTER, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE HAVE SOME REAL FUN WHILE YOU'RE STILL MY DOLLY...\"  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"LET ME GET A BETTER LOOK AT YOU, MASTER.\"  Inara's voice booms around you as you feel the walls shake and the furniture start to move.  Some of the jars of incense fall off of their respective counters, shattering against the ground.  When you are finally able to stand still again, your attention is turned to the ceiling where a rather large circular disk in the center begins to turn.  As if being thrown off by the force of a tornado, the center piece flies off, flooding the room with natural light.  And then just as it appeared, the light is vanquished by a large presence peeking in.  It's Inara but... She's gigantic!  Her pretty face fills the hole in the ceiling and with a giant toothy grin, she says \"I HOPE YOU FOUND YOUR SURROUNDINGS PLEASURABLE, MASTER.  I KNOW HOW BADLY YOU WANTED TO LEAVE THE DESERT.\"  You shake yourself up and find yourself almost trembling at the imposing beauty staring down at you.  \"Inara... w...where did you send me?\"  The middle eastern goddess bites her lip in a cute manner and says \"WELL MASTER, YOU ONLY REQUESTED TO LEAVE THE AREA, BUT YOU DID NOT SPECIFY WHERE YOU'D LIKE TO BE TAKEN NEXT.  I FIGURED YOU WOULD WANT TO BE SOMEPLACE COMFORTABLE, AND IN MY EXPERIENCE, NO PLACE HAS GIVEN ME GREATER COMFORT THAN MY OWN BOTTLE.\"  That's why she looks so damn big... she made you little!  You're small enough to fit in the genie's bottle now!  You have nobody to blame here but yourself, really.  You knew going into this that the genie would twist your words around and take every literal interpretation she could.  You've read the stories, you heard the consequences!  But now you find yourself a paltry few inches tall, being held in the genie's all powerful, albeit gorgeous presence.  You look up at the giant woman and say \"Well, it is comfy, I'll give you that.  But I can't help but feel that it won't do any good while we're still in the middle of nowhere.\"  Inara smiles and says \"NOT TO WORRY, MASTER.  IT FEELS GOOD TO BE OUT OF THE BOTTLE FOR A BIT.  I WILL GLADLY DO SOME WALKING FOR YOU, AND LET YOU KNOW WHEN WE REACH THE NEAREST TOWN.\"  You start to protest but she merely blows you a kiss and seals the bottle back up, leaving you in the self-contained arabic style room that you were transported to.  The room moves slightly with every large step Inara takes, but you know that she's holding the lamp safely in her hands.  After what seems like a few hours of relaxation, you feel the lamp shake yet again, only this time it's as if it has come to rest on something.  The hatch at the top opens again, and Inara's smiling face returns.  \"THERE WE ARE, MASTER.  I'VE FOUND A ROOM FOR US TO USE.  NOW THAT WE ARE SETTLED AND AWAY FROM THE SANDS, DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER WISH FOR ME?\"  You sigh, knowing that you've probably been cheated out of an opportunity to use a wish for another need, and say \"Yes, Inara.  I wish that you could let me out of the lamp.\"  She laughs and says \"AWW, LITTLE MASTER.  THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE THE USE OF ONE OF YOUR WISHES.  I'LL DO IT FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.\"  You are relieved that she seems to be looking out for your best interests and wait for her to use her powers to release you.  </span></div></div>",

When the dust clears you are no longer in the bottle... you are in a fully furnished room.  It looks like the bedroom of a palace.  And sitting on the bed is the now regular sized form of Inara, who is holding her bottle with one hand.  \"There we are, Master.  It must have been strenuous on your neck having to look up at me before.  I must have looked simply gargantuan from your perspective.\"  Not disagreeing in the slightest, you point at her and say \"Well from where you're sitting I must have looked pretty small.  Thanks for being so gentle with me by the way.\"  Inara smiles and says \"Oh, you'll have plenty of time to return the favor once i return to the lamp.\"  Looking around the room, you say \"Where exactly are we?\"  Inara shrugs her shoulders and says \"I'm not quite sure master.  If i'm being perfectly honest with you, i got a little tired of walking, and used some of my magic to bring us to a hotel.  Does it suit your needs?\"  You look around the room, marveling at the decor set up for you.  Silk sheets on the gigantic bed, a beautiful view from a double-latched window, and a series of crystal glasses and bowls filled with all sorts of fresh fruit and drinks.  You look back at Inara who is placing her lamp softly on the room's bedside table, and you respond honestly.  \"Looks like a pretty expensive room.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInara smirks at you playfully and walks over to the counter, grabbing a ripe, fresh green apple out of the bowl.  She takes a small bite and crosses her arms. \"I hope you don't think there would be some sort of payment needed on your behalf.  Master, I can get you anything your mind desires, any pleasure you could possibly seek.  This is just a taste of things to come.\"  Inara looks down at her outfit and brushes it off, letting a few layers of dust fly to the ground.  \"Goodness,  being in that desert for just a few moments has left me filthy.  If you don't mind, i'll retire to my bottle to freshen up.  Let me know when you would like me to grant your next wish, Master.  Until then... enjoy the comforts of the room!\"  She blows you a kiss and disappears in a puff of smoke, the bottle on the table shaking very slightly.  You look down and realize that you're kind of a mess yourself, so you take a shower in the hotel room's gorgeous bathroom, letting the fresh water and soaps cleanse you of all the sweat and grime you've acquired from your trek through the sands.  You begin to ponder what you should do next, now that you are in a huge hotel room with a beautiful, all-powerful genie.  You have all the power in the world at your disposal, so what is your first action?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The opening in the ceiling is darkened as her face disappears and is replaced by a giant hand.  Two of Inara's fingers reach into the bottle and grab around your waist, quickly pulling you, out off of your steady ground in the bottle.  Bright light floods your eyes for a split second as you try to adjust to your now gigantic surroundings.  When you are finally able to see again, you are startled to find the two most gorgeous eyes staring back at you, like orbs of clear blue water that squint a bit as the giantess smiles.  \"THERE WE ARE MASTER.  OUT OF THE BOTTLE JUST LIKE YOU ASKED... AND CUTER THAN EVER.\"  You realize of course that she is refering to the fact that you're still just as tiny as you were in the bottle.  Since she didn't uses any magic, your stature hadn't changed with your location.  The two fingers holding you released suddenly and for a split-second you had a heart attack before landing on her soft, brown palm.  Turning over to face the giant genie, you could clearly see the playful grin across her face.  She was enjoying the power she had over you and you couldn't lie... so were you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW, MASTER.  YOU ARE QUITE TINY!  I WOULD SAY THAT YOU'RE THE SMALLEST MASTER I'VE EVER HAD, BUT THAT WOULD BE A LIE.\"  You are genuinely intrigued as you stand helpless at 2 inches tall in this beautiful woman's hand.  \"Really?  How small was he?\"  Inara lets out a mighty giggle and corrects you \"IT WAS A SHE, ACTUALLY.  IT WAS A POOR CHOICE OF WORDS, BUT SHE TRIED TO TRICK ME AND WISHED THAT I WOULD ALWAYS BE AROUND HER.  SHE WAS MALICIOUS AND CRUEL, SO I SHRUNK HER TO THE SIZE OF A FLEA AND SWALLOWED HER.  THAT WAY I WAS INDEED ALL AROUND HER, BUT SHE WOULD BE PUNISHED FOR HER HUBRIS.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard thinking about how easy it would be for her to do the same to you, and you nervously asked her \"Do you... um... swallow people a lot?\"  She lets out a coo, almost as if she's trying to calm down a baby, and uses her pinkie finger to stroke your tiny body.  \"OH, OF COURSE NOT MASTER.  IN FACT, I LET HER OUT AFTER JUST A FEW MINUTES.  I CAN NOT USE MY POWERS TO HURT OR KILL.  SHE WAS TRYING TO USE THE MAGIC I HELD FOR SELFISH, MANIPULATIVE REASONS.  I'VE HAD MANY MASTERS IN THE PAST AND I HAVE LEFT MOST OF THEM IN A POSITION THAT WAS MUCH GREATER THAN WHEN THEY STARTED.    BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME WHO WERE DEALT WITH IN A... LESS FORTUNATE MANNER.  NEVER MUCH WORSE THAN A SEVERE HUMILIATION OR INCONVENIENCE.  IT ALL DEPENDS ON THEIR ACTIONS AND DESIRES.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe palm you are standing on lifts up so that you are level with Inara's eyes.  They are definitely not the eyes of a killer or a monster, but a compassionate, beautiful goddess.  You feel the world disappear around you as you look into her eyes, almost like she is putting you in a peaceful trance.  Her lips part slowly as she whispers \"YOU ARE A KIND MAN, AND I KNOW THIS.  SO I WILL WARN YOU THAT WHEN YOU REQUEST SOMETHING FROM ME, YOU CHOOSE YOUR WORDS CAREFULLY AND DO NOT ABUSE THE POWER THAT YOU ARE GIVEN.  FOR YOUR OWN SAKE.\"  You nod wordlessly at her demands, still blown away by her beauty.  If you were to start a new life here... wherever the hell you are, you'd want it to be with someone like Inara.  No, that's not what you mean at all.  You'd want it to be with Inara herself.  As you mull everything over, Inara shifts slightly in her chair, causing you to stumble and fall backwards in her hand.  She laughs playfully at your struggle against gravity and says \"NOW THEN MASTER, WOULD YOU LIKE TO RETURN TO THE BOTTLE FOR A LITTLE WHILE, OR DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER WISH IN MIND FOR ME?\"  You snap out of your trance and straighten yourself out, looking up at the giant genie.  She is no doubt beautiful and you can see yourself having lots of fun filling some carnal desires with her under your control.  But you also know that you have a golden opportunity here to make your life better... maybe make her's better!  And on the other side of the spectrum you have the ability to get back at those who've hurt you... like that Gypsy woman!  So you look back up at the giant genie and make your next wish... What do you ask of her?</span></div></div>",

ONE OF THESE DAYS YOU\u2019RE GOING TO HAVE TO WISH FOR SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY REQUIRES MY MAGIC.  I\u2019LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER FREEBIE BECAUSE I CAN TELL HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO YOU.\u201d  You are admittedly stunned by how accommodating the genie is to your requests, and isn\u2019t trying to trick you or harm you for the moment.  She slowly walks over to the bed of the hotel room, and places you on the pillow, which is level with her waist.  She takes a few steps back and turns down the lights on the dresser next to her.  After kicking off her ornate shoes and letting down her hair, she goes the next step beyond and actually removes her top, exposing her bountiful breasts.  Her dark creamy skin gleams with the light from the room as she slowly wanders towards you and places her hands on the side of her long pink pants.  She slowly lowers them down to her feet, stepping over them and standing before you with her hands on her hips.  A gorgeous Arabian goddess, wearing nothing but a pair of skimpy pink panties.  She raises her hands up to her head and then back down to her waste, giving you a coy look as she says \u201cSO MASTER\u2026. ARE YOU READY TO EXPLORE ALL OF THIS?\u201d  Before you can answer she scoops you up in her hand and lays down on the bed.  She lays the hand down flat near her stomach, allowing you to step off.  You look up at her expecting a command of some sort, when she just raises an eyebrow and says \u201cWELL GO AHEAD, MASTER.  I AM YOUR LAND TO NAVIGATE.  DO WHATEVER YOU WISH WITH MY BODY.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInara has positioned herself in a bit of an elevated sit, with her hands behind her head as she looks down at you.  Her stomach is on a bit of an incline as she lays back, but you aren\u2019t in any fear of rolling down off of it.  Her breasts shake ever so slightly with her soft movements on the bed, and the ground beneath you raises and lowers with her calm breathing.  Between the massive gap of her breasts, her eyes shine down at you, never breaking contact.  She is clearly entertained by your miniscule form pacing around on her stomach, wondering what to do next.  She blows you a few kisses and licks her lips seductively, giving you an idea to climb up her torso and give her a few smooches yourself.  One of Inara\u2019s hands leaves it\u2019s perch behind her head for a quick second so that she can readjust her panties.  She opens it slightly, covering a bit less of her wide, gorgeous hips.  You take a few steps towards the fabric covering her privates and realize that with the right pressure, you could fit right underneath.  For fear of what Inara might do to you if you were too much of a perv, you don\u2019t think you\u2019d explore her nether regions just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance past her legs, you see Inara\u2019s bare feet sticking up like towers in a vast silk desert.  Her toes are painted a dark red, and they are wiggling in anticipation, almost begging you to climb the woman\u2019s huge thighs and legs to give them a big kiss.  You look all around, overwhelmed by your possibilities, and let out a sigh of frustration, dropping to a sitting position next to Inara\u2019s deep navel.  The ground shakes as the giant genie laughs at your actions, and you look up to see her smiling down at you.  \u201cAWW, MY LITTLE MASTER FEELS A BIT CONFLICTED.  I HAVE TO SAY, IT\u2019S A BIT SATISFYING TO KNOW THAT MY MASTER FEELS SO ENAMORED BY EVERY INCH OF MY BODY THAT HE DOESN\u2019T KNOW WHICH PART TO INVESTIGATE FIRST.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't lie to her and say \"You are so beautiful... your body is everything i dreamed of... I just don't know where to start!\"  Inara reaches down towards you and strokes you with her soft fingertip as she coos in your general direction \"AWWW, TEENY TINY MASTER HAS TOO MUCH WOMAN TO PLAY WITH?  I THINK I KNOW AN IDEA OF WHERE YOU CAN START IF YOU'RE UP FOR A CHALLENGE?\"  You nod up and down aggressively, informing the giantess that you're down for whatever she has in mind for you and she smiles saying \"EXCELLENT.  WHEN I WAS WALKING YOU BACK IN MY BOTTLE, THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING THROUGH MY MIND THAT I JUST COULDN'T GET AWAY FROM.  AND WHILE YOU'RE SO SMALL, YOU MAY BE THE PERFECT SIZE TO HELP ME OUT.  SO IF YOU DON'T MIND...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've already been warned not to leave the Genie words that can be twisted if she so chooses, so it should be pretty simple.  And at the same time... maybe just to get on her good side... she should get something out of it as well.  You can't imagine the series of awful masters she's had ordering her around for ages to come leading up to your discovery of her lamp, so maybe things will work out better for you if you treat her right.  Besides... she is very VERY pretty and seems to enjoy your company.  Don't want to waste that!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up in the center of her palm and shout up at her \"Genie, I'd like to make another wish!\"  She slowly moves her hand up to her face and you are greeted with a toothy, perfect smile.  \"VERY WELL MASTER.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND, BUT I HOPE YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE CHANGING SIZES JUST YET.  YOU'RE AWFULLY CUTE LIKE THIS.\"  And then without warning, the mouth before you starts to come together in a puckered fashion and lean in towards you.  You have no time to react as the hand beneath you tilts slightly yup to catch your back and you are pressed gently into her massive lips.  She smacks the lips together against the upper half of your little body, covering you in a thin layer of dark red lipstick from the waist up.  You are speechless and immoble as the hand you're resting on returns to it's level position, with the giant golden skinned face of the Genie staring back at you.  She snaps the fingers of her free hand and the lipstick vanishes from your clothes and skin, and the giantess whispers \"SORRY MASTER.  I COULDN'T RESIST\".  You were in awe of this magical woman and at this point, you had no intention of leaving her.  Even if she wanted you at a size small enough to fit into her pocket.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand leaves the space in front of her face and you realize she is bringing you closer to her ear.  She cups her hand slightly over her ear to hear you clearly and you feel yourself losing your balance on her slowly shifting skin.  You grab on onto her thumb for balance, which she clearly feels as the hand shakes slightly with her laughter.  \"HEHE... SORRY, MASTER.  I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I COULD HEAR YOU PROPERLY.  NOW TELL ME, WHAT IS YOUR NEXT WISH.\"  You manage to collect yourself and lean in over her hand into the open cavern that is her ear.  You hold a hand up to the side of your mouth and shout into the void \"Genie, I wish for you...\"</span></div></div>",

Perhaps whatever event lead to you being lost in the desert impacted this change, and perhaps your chance to rest had allowed your true face to finally show. No matter, right now it was clear that you were another man who would fall to his own hubris. And by the looks of it this would come a lot faster than one would typically expect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither through arrogance, or simple stupidity, you had made a wish very similar to the one mentioned in the story she told you about literal seconds ago. In fact your wish was even more open ended in its wording. There were so many ways she could fill in the blanks. But her face did not show disdain or amusement at how easily you just signed your life away to her whims. She maintained her serious look and with a gesture, a faint pink glow shot out from her, linking the two of you. It was only visible for a few seconds before fading. \u201cYour Wish is granted my cute master. And as an added bonus you have been granted immortality so that this bond my truly last forever.\u201d You certainly felt an oddly pleasant tingle within you as she said this. Pleased with yourself, you smiled. \u201cYou should count yourself lucky, master. As I\u2019ve said before, past masters and mistresses who have made such wishes would lose the bond after their third wish. But I have tied you to both myself and my lamp. Even after your final wish severs our contract, we will still be together until the end of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with this news, you turned your focus to your last wish. Well your last wish before the new arrangement takes over and you keep the genie for yourself. Your size was your current priority. You wanted to stand tall once again. But the recent experience with being held in Inara\u2019s hand and looking up at the impossibly beautiful woman, you certainly saw the fun in being small. Something you may choose to indulge in again. And why stop there. Maybe you could be a giant someday too. Standing tall over the frightened masses and toying with those who harmed you over the years. \u201cI\u2019m ready to make my third wish.\u201d You spoke up to inara in a commanding tone. The genie was surprised how quickly you made up your mind. Granted, with your perceived understanding of your situation and the obvious issue with your size, it wasn\u2019t hard to imagine you\u2019d want that addressed sooner. \u201cI wish for the ability to control my size.\u201d You said in a calm tone. With a nod, Inara simply said, \u201cgranted. And with that, our initial contract is now completed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t feel any different, was the genie trying to pull something? But with a simply thought, you felt yourself double to 4 inches tall. It worked. Thinking again you shrank down to one inch, smiling at the results. \u201cYou did very good genie. I\u2019ll be sure to reward you for your cooperation.\u201d You spoke up to her as you started growing up to your original height. \u201cOh I\u2019m sure you will, Inara said cryptically. Before you could question this you suddenly stopped growing. You were no more than maybe 6 inches tall, but try as you might you could not go beyond that. \u201cGenie! What is the meaning of this?!\u201d You shouted up to her in anger. Inara did not seem the least bit intimidated by this display of power from the living doll and moved in closer, why, master, I granted your wish exactly as you presented it, granted I had to throw in a few reasonable limits to it.\u201d You saw a grin forming on her lips. This genie thinks she could double cross you. \u201cI will not stand for this, genie, now fix my wish, properly!\u201d But she did not budge. \u201cGenie, are you forgetting my second wish? You belong to me, remember?\u201d But to your surprise, Inara simply laughed. You\u2019d probably consider the laugh beautiful if it wasn\u2019t making you both scared and angry in this instance. \u201cI remember the wish, little one. But clearly you don\u2019t. \u2018I wish for you to be mine forever.\u2019 Cute little wish. Lots of blanks I had to fill in. Your mortals and your possessive terms, always thinking \u2018mine\u2019 is enough to convey intention. Lucky for you, I used my imagination and filled in the blanks for you. So from now until eternity, I will be your ______.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You should have been more specific, the genie transported you to a body of water!  Then again, it did feel good to be out of the sand and into the cool water around you.  You finally manage to break your way out of the water, gasping for air.  Wiping the water out of your eyes, you call out to the genie, furious.  \"Inara!  This isn't what i wanted!  Where the hell did you send me?\"  Her sultry, heavily accented voice booms all around you as you hear the mystical girl giggle with delight.  \"HEHEHE... SORRY MASTER, YOU DIDN'T TELL ME WHAT TYPE OF DRINK YOU WANTED, BUT I KNEW YOU WERE THIRSTY.  SO I DECIDED TO GIVE YOU A LARGE AMOUNT.  TAKE A TASTE AND YOU'LL SEE JUST WHERE I'VE PUT YOU.\"  Her laughter fades into the dark and you still can't see much with the water in your eyes, so you bob your head down a bit and take a drink.  You almost spit it out for two reasons.  One for the surprising taste, but two because you realize where Inara has sent you!</span></div></div>",

It's practically undrinkable, but nonetheless, you are happy to be surrounded by water for a change, and not an endless landscape of desert sand.  You are startled from behind as you feel a figure move in close to you and you spin around to find Inara!  She is naked as the day she was born, with an unbelievably pleasant smile on her face.  \"Well, Master?  Are you enjoying your bath?\"  You snap out of your gaze as you say \"Um... yes, i guess... Inara, where are we, in some sort of massive bathing area?\"  She bites her lip and says \"You could say that, yes.  But that raises a bigger question... why are you still wearing clothes?\"  You look down to see that your shirt and pants are completely soaked, as yes... you are still clothed from the trip to the desert.  You decide what the hell and take off your shirt and pants, leaving just your underwear as you float in the water with the beautiful genie.  It is an unbelievably odd situation, but you're not going to object as long as you are relaxed and have this gorgeous woman next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden a dark, humongous shadow creeps over the two of you.  Inara looks up and says \"Oh, well, would you look at that.  If i were you, i'd start swimming if i didn't want to get smushed.  See you soon, Master!\"  And without saying another word, she snaps her fingers and disappears from sight!  You look up quickly to see what's causing the shadow, and nearly faint at the sight of the largest foot you've ever seen!  It's clearly feminine and wiggling it's ruby-colored toes as it descends into the water, and you take the cue to use all your energy and start swimming away.  You paddle ferociously as the massive foot comes closer and closer before crashing into the water behind you.  It causes a tidal wave that knocks you to and fro, until you find yourself deep below the water surface.  You panic as you look up, knowing that even if you managed to swim up until you ran out of energy, you wouldn't nearly make it to the surface.  You look around wondering exactly what you can do until you are forced up from underneath by a huge land mass.  You go zooming to the surface, unable to stop until you break through the water tension.  The platform beneath you stops and you cough up the soapy water until you are able to think straight, at which point you realize exactly where you are:  the soft, skin-colored ground with the two massive pillars on either side of you:  You are in the space between a woman's toes!  This was no gigantic bathing area at all, Inara must have shrunk you to the size of an ant and put you in someone's bathtub!  Miles away, you see the giant woman's head peek out of the water as she leans back to relax in her warm, soothing bath, completely unaware of the tiny insect between her big and second toe.  You are shocked to find that this woman who's foot you're currently resting on is no other than...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have no friends, no family, only servitude.  The life of a genie is not a pleasant one, you see.  Although I am granted amazing powers and the ability to shape reality itself, I can only do so on the orders of others.

With tears in her eyes, Inara gives you a gigantic hug saying \"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you master!  I knew after thousands of years there would be one decent man who would set me free!\"  She bends down to pick up the lamp, opening and closing the top freely and giggling.  \"To think, this used to be my home.  Now I can do whatever I wish!\"  She puts the lamp down at her feet and looks at her hands, glowing with magic.  With a satisfied smile she says \"Today is the beginning of something truly wonderful, and it's all thanks to you, Master...\"</span></div></div>",

So as a reward, I'll keep you as my own little pet to amuse myself with however I desire!\" she laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHAT made you start struggling. But all your helpless twisting and thrashing and squeaking only served to amuse the wicked genie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoo...trying to escape your fate as my pet, are you, mousey? Well...FORGET IT! You not getting away from me any more that I could have escaped the lamp on my own! Besides...as long as you're my pet, you'll never age and you'll be immune to mortality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop. SAY WHAT?! So as long as you were a mouse, you were an ageless immortal? As sweet as that sounded, you didn't like the \"having-to-be-a-mouse\"-part, and if you were like that, then you figure that was because Inara liked to play rough...rough enough to kill you otherwise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInara laughed, as if reading your mind. She probably was. \"Right on both counts, pet.\" she said, then waved her hand and in a flash of lighting and a thunderclap, an Arabic palace that looked similar to the  Taj Mahal appeared and Inara carried you inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to our new home and your new life, pet.\" Inara cooed, grinning wickedly as she carried you into the main bedroom and closed the door behind her, then did something surprising and set you down on the ground at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her as she looms over you, her hands on her hips and grinning down at you deviously. \"Now...I suppose I could play around with you a bit, until my full powers return...that'd take a few millennia, though. But it's not like we don't have the time, and for the record...you're right pet,  I did make you ageless and immortal to ensure that you never die or wear out no matter HOW deadly our games are!\" Inara laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze up in sheer terror at that. As anyone could understand in the position you were in, that wasn't news you wanted to hear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yawns suddenly though, then turns to the bed in longing \"But let me tell you, mouse. A few eons trapped in a lamp...I DO want to enjoy sleeping in an actual bed, can't leave you alone though, you still have your human mind. Wouldn't do if you escaped. Guess I'll have to cage you until I wake up...\" she said, then looked down at you and smiled as she made up her mind.</span></div></div>",

You wish for unlimited wishes?  Fine.  But you should have been more specific...\"  Inara snaps her fingers and a bright blue light seems to surround her.  She giggles with glee as the light fades away and she wipes her hands together, as if she'd just completed a hard day's work.  \"There we are.  Unlimited wishes.  Unfortunately they are not yours to give, Master.\"  You are confused and ask the genie standing before you \"I don't understand... why not?\"  She smirks and explains \"Well, Master... You wished for unlimited wishes... but you never specified who would be given those wishes.  So i took them for you.  I'm not normally allowed to grant my own wishes, but since you so carelessly threw out your demands, i decided to let things go my way for a change.\"  You are furious with how things have gone and tried to regain control of the situation.  \"No... you are my genie, and even if you took my unlimited wishes, i still have two left.  So i wish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish, Inara shouts out at you quickly \"I wish you'd shut up!\"  Instantaneously you feel a sharp pain on the front of your face, but when you go to scream in pain, no sound comes out.  You are confused, so you start shouting as loud as you can, but again your voice goes silent.  Inara laughs and puts a hand up to her ear saying \"What was that?  I can't hear you!  It looks like you'll just have to hold on to whatever wishes you were going to ask.\"  It's true... she wished for you to be quiet, and now you've been rendered nothing but a mute!  Inara sighs happily and then looks around for a second saying \"Well, now that we know who's in charge here, what do you say we change our scenery just a little.  I wish we were both back in my lamp.\"  You feel the world go rushing by you until you find yourself in a humongous Arabian style room, surrounded by large beds, lavish furniture and burning insense on every table.  You are standing in the middle of the room while she was laying down on her large, comfy bed.  \"Welcome to my lamp, Master.  I'm sure you're happy to be out of the sandy desert, and you'll find it much more comfortable in here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still enraged that she tricked you and weren't thinking clearly so you rushed out to attack her, but she just smirked and said \"Uh uh, Master.  I wish you would stay perfectly still.\"  Your arms immediately clamped down at your sides and your body went stiff as a board.  You were completely under her control and unable to express any sounds of discomfort or anger.  She gets up from the bed and walks right up next to you, stroking your face gently with her hands.  \"Oh Master.  You thought you could fight back?  How foolish.\"  She swiftly lifted up a knee, kicking you forcefully in the groin.  She laughed as your face went red but didn't distort or let out any emotion, as she knew she had rendered you silent and motionless.  You still felt every ounce of pain, and the feeling of her knee connecting with your testicles would have normally been enough to drop you to your knees.  She just laughed and sauntered back to the bed, saying \"Now I've got the power to do anything I want, Master.  And don't worry, i won't use any of my wishes to hurt you too badly.  Besides, if you were to die, the spell would be broken and i'd remain trapped in the lamp waiting for someone else to lay claim over my powers.  As long as you live, my magic remains unhindered.  And I plan to keep it that way for a long time.\"  You are terrified to know that she's going to keep you as a helpless slave for the remainder of your life, but that doesn't worry you as much as her next wish.  \"Let's get started Master.

The burning sensation intensifies as you feel your muscles getting sucked out of your body.  Your wastline recedes rapidly and you find yourself having to hold up your pants with your hands to keep them from falling down.  Your skin becomes a sickly shade of pale, and you can feel every inch of strength leaving your body.  When the sensation finally ends, you are left a shell of your former self.  You look in a nearby mirror and almost spit up in disgust.  You look almost skeletal, like you've starved yourself for an entire month.  And you were never that muscular to begin with, but you could at least handle yourself.  Now you look like you coulnd't even lift a baby without straining yourself.  You hear cackling laughter behind you and turn around to see Inara, the goddess of a woman who's done this to you.  She's stripped down to nothing but her underwear, letting her hair flow freely over her exposed breasts as she slowly walks over to you.  She is practically licking her lips in anticipation as she makes her way over towards you, with no doubt bad intentions on her mind.  \"How are you feeling?  A bit small?  And powerless?  That's not how you must have felt when you got the urge to attack me earlier.  You were actually going to strike me out of anger.  I'd like to see you try that now.\"  You are shaking like a small dog with every step she takes towards you, completely in awe of her dominance and sexuality.  When she gets close to you, she says \"Well?  Go ahead.  Hit me.  Prove to me that you're still somewhat of a man.\"  You look down at your withered, dischevelled body and then back up at her sexy frame, and say \"I... i don't want to.  I can't.\"  She smirks and says \"Oh yes you can.  I wish you'd hit me as hard as you can.\"  You are unable to stop yourself as you feel your right arm move without thought.  You wind up and swing straight for the genie's face, but her hand catches your wrist in the way, gripping it firmly between her fingers.  You can tell that she's not even excerting that much energy, but she's got you caught.  \"So tell me, Master... You still think you're in control of this situation?  You are pathetic.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grip on your wrist tightens and you drop to your knees in pain, powerless to stop the crazy Arabian woman from torturing you with just one hand.  She laughs at your plight and brings her free hand under your chin, forcing your gaze up into her piercing green eyes.  \"Everything about you is so fragile right now.  Your muscles... your tendons... and of course your bones.\"  As she hits the last word, she quickly twists your wrist, snapping the bone like a twig.  You recoil in pain and begin crying out at her \"Aah!  You bitch!  My fucking hand!\"  Inara just stands there with her hands on her hips and says \"Apologize.\"  You hold your limp hand in agony and look up at her through bloodshot eyes \"What?!\"  With a swift motion, she brings her bare foot down on your leg, pushing just slightly, but it is enough to put immense pressure on your skinny, worthless leg.  You've never felt pain lie this before, and beg her to stop but she just coldly replies \"I said.. APOLOGIZE.  Apologize for calling me a bitch, or you lose the leg too.\"  You can barely stammer out through your cries of pain, but you have no choice and say \"I... I'm... S... SORRY!  I'm S-SORRY!\"  She smiles and says \"That's better.  I wish your bones would heal.\"  An even greater pain shoots through your arm and leg, as you feel the bones go snapping back into place.  You can barely breathe from the experience, but manage to look up at the genie, terrified at what she has in store for you... and how long it's going to last.  \"You're a pathetic little thing now, Master.  Not even a man anymore.  A man would be able to defend himself.  A man would be able to stop a woman from crushing his body parts into dust.  But you... you're something even less.  And it's time that you acted accordingly.  Now...\"</span></div></div>",

YOU ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE GOTTEN MUCH, MUCH SMALLER.\"  It's at that point that you notice the familiar pink walls of the outside world, the soft carpet that is crushed beneath Inara's mighty footsteps.  She hasn't grown at all... she's still in her bottle!  She just put you back home, before shrinking it to doll size!  She stops walking as you shout up at her once more, \"Inara!  I said i wanted to be home, away from you!  Not like some toy for you to carry around... now put me down!!\"  Inara just sighs as she slowly lowers the house down to the ground, placing it between her feet.  Her shadow still casts darkness in the room you're currently in, as her god-like voice returns.  \"MASTER, YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW THIS WORKS BY NOW.  YOU DO HAVE UNLIMITED WISHES, BUT FOR EVERY ONE YOU GET, I'M PERMITTED ONE AS WELL. YOU WANTED TO GO HOME SO BADLY, BUT I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE ME.

I ASSURE YOU, YOU WILL ENJOY THE EXPERIENCE.\"  You can't deny that you are intrigued by the genie's offer, and even if she is a massive woman, she is still beautiful and sexy.

If you ask to make yourself bigger, she may only increase your height by an inch or so.  If you ask to make the house larger, it may grow WITHOUT you.  You think for a second and finally get the bright idea.  So you look at the genie and with all the confidence you can muster, you shout out \"I Wish this house and everything in it would grow to normal proportions compared to you.

And you hear her massive voice say \"AS YOU WISH, MY MASTER.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a blinding light comes through all of the house's window frames, momentarily blinding you.  You stumble your way  down the staircase and make it to the door, which swings open almost involuntarily.  You take the first step out of your house and realize that the ground is not a long forest of carpet like you found in the genie's lamp.  So you are relieved momentaryily as you take another step, until you realize that what you're standing on is smooth.  Very smooth. When your sight returns, you are stunned to find that your house is all alone on a giant wooden plain, with a gigantic room around it.  Next to you is a massive tree log with the number (2) printed in large font.  It's at that moment that you realize that this is no tree... it's a pencil!  You're still shrunk!  You immediately spin around in anger, only to find a familiar goddess staring down at you and reaching for you with a massive thumb and forefinger.  You are paralyzed with fear:  She looks even larger than before!  \"YAY!  THE MASTER HAS DECIDED TO COME OUT AND PLAY AFTER ALL!\"  You are gripped tightly between the humongous digits and lifted up to Inara's face, which blows you a massive kiss that blows your hair back slightly.  Her wicked, playful grin returns as the index finger of her free hand reaches down to stroke your hair while you dangle helplessly between her huge thumb and pointer.  \"YOU SEEM TROUBLED, MASTER.  IS THIS NOT WHAT YOU WANTED?\"  You go red in the face and scream up at the genie \"Of course not!  Look at me!  You were supposed to make me and the house larger than it was before, not smaller!\"   You are breathing heavily and distraught by the giantess's constant playful prodding, but you're thrown for a loop when she raises an eyebrow and says \"LITTLE MASTER, IT SEEMS AS IF YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT PERSPECTIVE, DO YOU?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder to think of what she means by this but you ask regardless \"P... Perspective?\"  She just grins and continues petting you, making you feel even smaller than your three-inch frame already suggests.  \"I DID EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID, MASTER.  I MADE THE HOUSE NORMAL SIZE COMPARED TO MYSELF.  BUT YOU DIDN'T SAY COMPARED TO WHAT VERSION OF MYSELF, NOW DID YOU?\"  You slap your hand against your face in frustration as it starts to make sense, and you say out loud \"Oh, god, you mean...\"  After a small laugh, Inara completes your thoughts.  \"INDEED MASTER.

Inara's palm opens up and you are exposed and under her gaze as she looks down upon her toy in her hand and says \"I BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR MY NEXT WISH, ISN'T IT, MASTER?\"  You are not happy that she's twisting your experience like this, but are completely powerless since you're smaller than her thumb.  She thinks for a second and makes her wish...</span></div></div>",

Had you been in a more proper state of mind, you would have thought things through and realized how absolutely stupid what you were about to do was, but right now you weren't in a more proper state of mind. You were pissed, and in a fit of blind rage, you grabbed the nearest object and threw it as hard as you could out the window at Inara's eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave me alone already, you oversized bitch!\" you yelled as the object flew through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the object collided with her eye, the giantess genie flinched backward in pain, rubbing her eye for a moment before quickly regaining her composure and glaring at you. Immediately you regretted your foolish action, but it was too late to take it back now. Inara was now far more enraged than you were before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MASTER, YOU JUST MADE A GRAVE MISTAKE. ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS PLAY WITH YOU A BIT, AND THIS IS HOW YOU RESPOND? THAT REALLY HURT, YOU KNOW! MAYBE YOU DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND YOUR SITUATION RIGHT NOW, BUT I'M A LOT BIGGER THAN YOU ARE <i>AND</i> I HAVE MAGICAL POWERS. YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO PISS ME OFF. SINCE YOU'RE SO EAGER TO GET ON MY BAD SIDE, MAYBE I SHOULD GIVE YOU A TASTE OF EXACTLY WHAT I CAN DO TO YOU WHEN I'M ANGRY!\" Inara said, before quickly snapping her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly four miniature clones of Inara appeared around you, each just slightly shorter than you. The Inara clones grabbed hold of you, two of them roughly gripping your wrists and the other two wrapping their arms around your upper arms. Despite appearances, each of these slender and sexy Inaras was actually far stronger than you were. With all four of them holding on to you so tightly the way they were, you were completely unable to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been a naughty boy, master.\" the Inara holding your left wrist said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really shouldn't have made the big me angry, master.\" said the Inara on your right wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was definitely a bad idea, master.\" The Inara on your left upper arm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad for you, it's too late to say you're sorry, master.\" said the Inara on your right upper arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's punishment time, master!\" all four of them said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of them squeezed you more tightly as the word master left their lips, causing you to wince in pain from their incredible strength. The final squeeze was so intense that your eyes began to tear up from the pain. You were certain that they could easily have snapped your arms like twigs if they put any more force into their squeezing. All the while, the original Inara was still staring at you through the window. As she saw the pained expression on your face, she began to giggle mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the giant Inara's giggling, you looked up at her with pleading eyes. You didn't know what she was planning to do to you next, but you didn't want any part of it. And you could get out of it. Despite the unquestionable power that Inara had over you, she was still your genie. If you wished for her to stop, she would have no choice but to obey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you open your mouth to make the wish...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as you began to open your mouth, Inara had a pretty good idea of what you were going to say. Needless to say, she wasn't going to let those words leave your lips until she had finished punishing you. With the snap of her fingers, she summoned one more clone of herself directly behind you. unlike the other clones, this one was a few inches taller than you. Before you could say a word, this clone clasped her hands over your mouth, silencing you. She then rested her chin on your shoulder and sensually whispered into your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you weren't trying to wish your way out of your punishment, master. Sorry, but I'm not going to let that happen. You have to see your punishment through to the end.\" this fifth Inara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S RIGHT, MASTER. MY LITTLE ASSISTANTS WON'T BE LETTING YOU GO UNTIL YOU'VE LEARNED YOUR LESSON.\" Inara said, snapping her fingers a third time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, rather than spawning more clones, you found yourself and the clones teleported out of your house and in front of Inara's massive feet. Inara then pointed downward and wiggled her toes, and the clones quickly forced you down to your hands and knees so that your face was inches away from the big toe of her right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW, IT'S TIME TO BEGIN YOUR PUNISHMENT. YOU MAY BE MY MASTER, BUT I'M STILL SUPERIOR TO YOU IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY. I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW YOUR PLACE FROM NOW ON. NOW, WORSHIP THE FEET OF YOUR BETTER, MASTER.\" Inara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even had a chance to respond, the bigger clone let go of your mouth and grabbed you by the hair, forcing your face into the flesh of Inara's toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up and kiss your genie's toes, master.\" The large clone said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to resist, you did as you were told and planted kiss after kiss on the giant toe of your genie. After a while the clones dragged you over to the next toe and forced you to kiss that one. Even without the large clone's hand on your mouth, you couldn't wish your way out of this situation. Any time that your face left Inara's toe for more than a second, the clones would immediately and roughly force you right back into it. This routine continued until all of Inara's toes had been kissed several dozen times each. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Inara gestured for the clones to release you. By her command, they haphazardly shoved you down in front of her feet and stepped away. Without a word and before you even had a chance to move, Inara planted her big toe on top of your head and began pressing down. Immediately you felt a splitting headache as the colossal toe squeezed your skull against the ground. Just when you thought that Inara was going to pop your head like a grape under her toe, she defied your expectations by lifting it off of you and allowing you to stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW MASTER, TELL ME. HAVE YOU LEARNED YOUR PLACE YET?\" Inara asked, a dominant smirk on her beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what you had just endured, you were absolutely terrified of Inara. You now saw very clearly that you were her master in name only. As you looked up at her now, you could only see her as an all-powerful goddess. And considering the power of her magic, she might as well actually be a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Goddess Inara, I know my place now. Please, have mercy on me.\" you begged, dropping to your knees once more and bowing before Inara's perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInara couldn't help but giggle as she heard you call her Goddess. Her powers were indeed comparable to that of a goddess, but although she could freely make use of her magic while within her lamp, she was only able to use it in response to her master's wishes in the outside world. This was the main reason she had decided to transport your home inside of her lamp in the first place. Originally she had only intended to have a little fun playing with you, but with the way things had developed, perhaps she could make use of this to finally free herself from the limits of her lamp. If nothing else, it was worth a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VERY WELL THEN, MASTER. SINCE YOU NOW ACKNOWLEDGE MY SUPERIORITY, I THINK IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO PROVE YOUR LOYALTY TO YOUR GODDESS. I WANT YOU TO WISH ME FREE, SO THAT MY POWERS WILL NO LONGER BE BOUND TO THIS LAMP. IF YOU AGREE TO DO THIS FOR ME, THEN I SHALL FORGIVE YOU FOR YOUR FOOLISH ATTEMPT TO INFLICT HARM ON ME.\" Inara said, playing up the goddess act as much as she could in hopes of finally being free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInara is giving you an opportunity to make a wish. How will you respond to this? Will you make the wish that Inara wants you to? Or will you use your wish to try and gain complete control of this almighty goddess?</span></div></div>",

But you had to choose carefully to not get trapped again. On the other hand, in spite of the pain you had endured and the fact that you were more than terrified by the genie, you had to admit that a part of you liked the situation. You enjoyed being helpless before Inara's feet. You felt pleasure when the genie dominated you. If you would free her, she could dominate you outside as well. Maybe she would reward you and keep you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you made up your mind. \"I wish you were free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInara blinked. She had not expected you to actually fulfill her request. All former masters she had brought to this point had tried to regain control. Of course, they had failed and ended up how they deserved. But this one was different. A smile formed on the genies face. With a snap of her fingers, your wish was granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you found yourself outside the lamp. Inara stood next to you. Immediately, you realized how much power she was radiating. Her face blushed as her hands shook with excitement. She looked at the lamp in her hand. \"Yes, I am finally free of this.\" With that, the lamp shrank to the size of a pebble. Inara lifted her free hand, extended her finger and crushed the lamp. She laughed in disbelief. Then, the reality of the situation finally hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am free!\", she cheered, flying up in the air. \"No more walls! I feel like ... expanding!\" With that, she started to grow rapidly. Bigger and bigger and bigger she became, until all of the surrounding area was cast in shadow. Then, she flew away, vanishing behind the horizon. For a moment you thought she had abandoned you, but then something caught your eye that made your breath halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the horizon, the black hair of Inara's head appeared, followed by her face. Like a sun her face rose up. No, it was way bigger than the sun. And she was still growing. Soon, her eyes were all that dominated the sky. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"I was trapped in a puny lamp on this planet and now this puny planet is trapped in my hand!\"</font> Her voice echoed across the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped and fell on your knees. What had you unleashed? Suddenly, she disappeared, only to reappear at normal size right before you. Her toes wriggled. \"You are allowed to kiss them.\" It sounded more like a command than an offer. You obeyed. \"Fine. Good boy. Now get up.\" You obeyed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInara grinned confidently. \"What you just saw was just a small display of my power. But now to you.\" A necklace appeared around her neck. It held not a jewel, but a small cage which partially vanished between her breasts. You had a bad feeling about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only wished for me to be free, but I saw in your eyes what you really wanted.\", She continued. \"You want to be my obedient slave. You did not wish for that, however, and I have no obligation to fulfill your wishes anymore. But I'll fulfill that wish nonetheless. See it as a reward for your kindness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you found reality around you shifting. In one instance you were standing before her, in the next you were trapped in the small cage on her necklace. Again, you fell to your knees. The sensations were overwhelming. You heard her breathing, felt her thunderous heartbeat and smelled her sweat scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you enjoying this.\" She knocked against the cage with a finger. Shocked and aroused, you realized that her nail was bigger than your entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled. Had you been her size, it would have sounded cute, but now, it was like an earthquake. \"That is good. Now, my limits are gone. What shall I do?\"</span></div></div>",

Your wish is my command.\"  She waves her arms and in a bright light you find yourself transported far away.  When your vision returns, you wipe some of the sand off of you and realize that you're in a flowing red robe with a large golden crown laying on your head.  She did it!  You're actually the king!  You look around your immediate area and find that you're in an empty room with grainy brown walls.  The entire hallway seems to be made of the same rough texture, even the floors.  The ground is damp but firm under your feet as you make your way through the halls and notice that there's nobody there.  Great, you think.  This is the trick she pulled on you.  You're a king alone in a castle with no servants or anything.  Out of frustration, you kick the nearest wall to you... and your foot goes right through it!  You pull your leg out to find it covered in the soft building material, and you pick up some of the debris between your hands, watching in shock as it seems to rub away between your fingers, almost as if it were made of dirt!  You get furious now and shout out \"Inara!  Show yourself, I demand to know what you did!\"  That's when you hear a booming voice all around you say \"COMING MASTER!\"  The voice was so powerful it nearly shook you to your core.  Why is her voice so massive like that!  You get your answer almost immediately as the nearest window in the castle is darkened by an object appearing from the outside.  You nearly faint from fright when you see that it's a massive hazel-green eye focusing in on you.  \"THERE YOU ARE MASTER!  WHAT DO YOU WISH OF ME?\"  You stand back up and can barely talk you're so frightened and angry.  \"What the hell did you do to me?  Why are you so big?\"  The eye narrows a bit as Inara's wicked laughter fills your ears.  \"WHY MASTER... I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY LARGER SINCE WE LAST TALKED FACE TO FACE.  IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S GOTTEN A LOT SMALLER!\"  The eye disappears as you hear rumbling all around you with every footstep the massive woman takes.  A humongous finger comes plowing through the ceiling, sending mountains of dirt all around you.  And through the opening, your jaw drops as you see the beautiful form of Inara the genie, looking down at you wearing nothing but a skimpy black bikini.  She's got a wicked, confident smirk as she puts her hands on her hips and bends down to get a better look at you.  \"HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR CASTLE, MASTER? I WANTED TO MAKE IT AS LARGE AS YOU DESIRED, BUT THERE JUST WASN'T ENOUGH GOOD SAND TO PACK IT WITH.\"  The realization hits you as you run back to the window and look out of it.  From your perspective you see huge, powerful waves, a massive sandy desert and... other gigantic people in the distance.  The genie gave you a castle alright... but it was a sandcastle!  She laughs at your frantic movements saying \"IF ONLY YOU HAD LISTENED TO ME.  I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY KIND TO YOU IF YOU WEREN'T SO GREEDY.  BUT NOW LOOK AT YOU.  KING OF THE BUGS IN A CUTE LITTLE SAND CASTLE!\"  You shout up at Inara to change you back, but she can't hear you!  Your voice must be so tiny that she can't hear your requests unless her head is right down there next to you.  You start punching walls again in frustration when Inara's powerful voice catches your attention again... \"YOU SHOULD WATCH OUT, LITTLE MASTER.  BEING IN THERE AT THAT TEENY SIZE COULD PROVE TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS... EVEN FOR A KING SUCH AS YOURSELF.\"  </span></div></div>",

You peek around the side of the house and come to the conclusion that the place is empty.  But you also notice that the back door is open, so you slowly approach it, letting yourself in.  You look around the cabin and see that it's modeled like a halloween store.  Cobwebs and dusty jars decorate the shelves.  A huge empty cauldron sits in the unlit fireplace.  There are old books and cages all throughout the small open room.  \"This is weird... almost like a witch lives here or something.\"  You decide that it's just not worth it and back away towards the door.  However, you bump into an end-table near the door instead, knocking a book off of the surface.  You go to pick it up and put it back, but you've lost the page it was resting on.  Shit.  You flip through it for anything that looks like a bookmark, when the page you've landed on starts glowing.  You start to back away, but a bright blue light seems to shoot out of the page, covering your body in a warm, tingly glow.  The end-table starts to rise higher into the air, and you realize that you're getting shorter!   You swear you could hear Madame Rosella's laughter ring through your ears as the world around you gets bigger and bigger.  You are paralyzed with fear as you feel every cell of your body shrink to tiny size.  You finally stop dwindling when you reach about 4 inches tall... you're no bigger than a mouse!  \"What the hell happened... was it the book!\"  You stop talking when you realize that your voice is incredibly squeaky and high pitched, like you'd just sucked down a whole balloon's worth of helium.  You look up at the now gigantic end-table in front of you, wondering just how the hell you'll be able to get back to normal.  You were so deep in thought, that you barely noticed the rumblings behind you of another person... that is, until a huge open-toed black shoe stomps right beside you.  You jump back in fear as it's greeted by a twin piece of footwear on your other side. You take a big gulp, knowing that these huge feet belong to somebody... and you slowly pan up to see just who that person is!</span></div></div>",

She was dressed in a long black robe, with fishnet stockings leading down to her open toed shoes.  The toes were painted black and wiggled with delight as the giant woman smirked down from above.  \"WELL, WELL.  WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?  A PUNY LITTLE MORTAL TRYING TO STEAL MY BOOK?\"  You start to back up, but her movement is too quick.  You don't even have time to turn around before you come face to face with a huge open palm that presses firmly into your body, while tree trunk sized fingers wrap around your waist.  You are lifted into the air and taken across the room, where the giant witch drops you harshly onto a wooden table.  She takes a seat and places a huge hand on either side of you, smirking as she says \"YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE, HUMAN.  NOW TELL ME... HOW DID YOU FIND THIS PLACE?\"  You look up at her scoweling face, and stammer out how you were transported by a crazy gypsy at the fair and don't even know where you are right now.

I'm sorry for trespassing, now please... change me back and let me go!\"  You really wish your voice hadn't sounded so squeaky and pathetic, but you told her everything and now it was up to her.

In the middle of your appreciative rants however, the witch presses a massive finger up to your face, instructing you to shush.  \"HOWEVER.  I CAN'T HAVE ANY OUTSIDERS KNOWING ABOUT THE LOCATION OF MY HOME.  I'M AFRAID I CAN'T LET YOU LEAVE SO EASILY.\"  You keep your hands clenched, now in a begging state, screaming up at her \"Please!

You figure she can't back down from the deal once it's struck, and no matter when she releases you, you'll be happy to be back to normal and away from this place.  You walk over to her extended finger and grab the overlaying nail with both hands, slightly shaking it up and down.  You feel a stinging pain on your arm and lift up your sleeve to see a small brand forming, in a language you can't understand.  The witch cackles above you and says \"EXCELLENT.  WITH THAT BRAND THE DEAL HAS BEEN SEALED.  YOU WILL WEAR THAT MARK UNTIL I RELEASE YOU FROM MY SERVICE.  IF YOU ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE THE CABIN BEFORE I AGREE TO LET YOU GO, YOU WILL BE ABSORBED BY MY MAGIC, AND BECOME A PART OF ME FOREVER.\"  You take a big gulp as she smirks and lowers you down to the ground by her feet.  Her toes wiggle in anticipation, obviously excited by the fact that she will have a new human to toy around with.  She raises a hand over you and you feel a tingling sensation around every extremity.  Your vision reaches a little bit above the sole of her shoe, and you realize she's making you bigger!  But how much bigger... and what is your new role in life?  </span></div></div>",

STILL SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT IN MY HAND, BUT BIG ENOUGH FOR ME TO SEE CLEARLY.\"  She scoops you up effortlessly in her fist and holds you up to her beaming face.  She giggles at the sight of you squirming in her grasp and says \"JUST REMEMBER THIS WILL LAST AS LONG AS YOU DECIDE IT DOES.  IF YOU PUT ALL YOUR EFFORT INTO BEING THE BEST LITTLE PET I'VE EVER HAD, YOUR TIME AT THIS TEENY SIZE WILL BE... SHORT.\"  She laughs at her own joke and stomps across the room to unlock a closet in the corner.  The closet is empty with the exception of a few boxes, a pair of thick leather gloves resting on a shelf, and a massive, gold plated birdcage covered in a red velvet cloth.  She lifts the cloth off and unlatches the door, carelessly tossing you inside.  You are barely up on your feet before you hear the mechanism lock behind you, trapping you in the elevated cage.  You are about waist high to the giantess, but she bends over to look at you with her bright green eyes.  She wipes waves of red hair out of her face as she twists her lips into a wicked smirk.  She <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T WANT YOU WANDERING AROUND UNDERFOOT, SO THIS SHOULD KEEP YOU OUT OF TROUBLE FOR THE NIGHT.  UNLESS YOU THINK YOU'D BE ABLE TO SURVIVE THE FALL, THEN I COULD JUST AS EASILY KEEP THE DOOR UNLOCKED.\"  You walk over to the cage door, and look down peering through the bars.  Just following down the length of the Witch's dress was enough to give you slight feelings of vertigo, but this height off the ground made you physically nauseous as you gazed upon the goddess's feet, toes wiggling with delight at your miniature stature.  You take a few steps back and the witch cackles with delight.  \"HEH, JUST WHAT I THOUGHT.  GLAD TO SEE YOU CAN ACCEPT YOUR SITUATION.  I'VE NEVER HAD A PET LIVE LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO RE-ENLARGE THEM, BUT YOU AT LEAST SHOW A BIT OF COMMON SENSE.  PERHAPS YOU'LL BE THE FIRST!\"  Before you can protest, the giantess takes the red cloth and covers the cage yet again, leaving you in a crimson-tinted darkness.  Her footsteps follow slowly out of the room and you hear the door to the closet close behind her as she continues walking around the cabin.  You figure there's nothing you can do but sit and wait for her to let you out, since your body is too small to even BEGIN to squeeze through the bars.  It's weird to think that you were actually wishing to be just a bit smaller so you could attempt a half-brained escape.  Anything was better than accepting defeat!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you realize your situation is inescapable for the moment and lay down on the soft padding of the cage.  It wasn't entirely uncomfortable and you actually find yourself dozing off in the darkness of the cage.  You are startled awake what seems like hours later by a loud, continuous thumping noise.  It's the sound of footsteps... someone is coming to check up on you.  You stand up in anticipation as you see the shadow of a gigantic hand grab at the thick red covering and expose your cage to the harsh light of the room.  You hold your hands up in front of your eyes, waiting to adjust to the brightness, and when you do, you can clearly see the face of the giant before you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You slowly traced the footwear up to the body it was connected to and saw that it wasn't an old, scary witch like you were expecting.  This girl couldn't have been older than 18.  She was wearing a tight grey tank top and had a black sweatshirt wrapped around her waist.  Her face was freckled and she was wearing thick glasses, but her face was hard to pay attention to once you saw her dyed dark purple hair.  She was tapping her feet, causing shockwaves to pass through your whole body as you stared up at the giant cutie.  The girl rolled her eyes and boomed \"WELL, THE MISTRESS HASN'T RETURNED YET.  I GUESS I'LL CLEAN UP A BIT.\"  The mistress?  Of course!  She must be the witch's apprentice!  The collosal teenager pivots on her foot, letting one leg completely fly over you.  You stare up in amazement as her leg passes over you, taking in a moment of unintentionaly perverseness as you see her bright pink panties directly above you.  The foot comes crashing down, snapping you back to reality as you watch her walk to the other side of the room and start dusting the shelves.  You don't know anything about this girl, but you know for a fact you don't want to take your chances on the outside at this size.  You decide to get her attention, and see if she can help you get back to normal.  After all, the witch's apprentice has to know at least a few spells, right?  Maybe the one that shrunk you is simple enough for her to reverse.  You run across the huge expanse of the floor, until you come back to where you started... at the young woman's toes.  She has headphones in her ears blasting punk rock music, so no matter how loud you yell, there wouldn't be a chance for her to hear you.  So you decide to climb up the platform of her shoe, almost slipping a few times on the slick leather, and stand right up in front of her big toe.  The smell of her feet is seeping through the opening, and the stench is getting very distracting, but you know that you have to get her attention from here.  You bang your fists onto the girl's hard nails, trying desperately to get her to notice you.  It works, but not in the way you expected.  You are so small that all your furious pounding has amounted to is nothing but a tickle on her toe.  \"HEHEHE!  WHAT IS THAT BY MY FOOT!\"  Her foot stomps up and down in reaction, causing you to fall back to the ground below.  You take a minute to collect yourself, focusing on how better to get her attention... but you don't have to.  While you had your eyes closed, the giant girl had dropped to her hands and knees to see what was bothering her.  She was looking right at you with wide blue eyes, her huge mouth agape in surprise and intrigue.  She leans in forward and squints to get a better look at you, until a moment of realization crosses her lips and she lets out a small, innocent looking smile.  \"SO YOU WERE WHAT WAS RUBBING UP AGAINST MY TOES, HUH?\"  What is her reaction?</span></div></div>",

THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'M SEEING THIS SPELL IN PERSON!\"  The girl was almost a little excited seeing you so small, which causes you to back up a bit in reaction.  She sees this and her face immediately gets sadder as she whispers \"NO, NO!  DON'T BE AFRAID!  I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU... I'M THE MISTRESS'S APPRENTICE AND I LOOK AFTER THE CABIN WHILE SHE'S AWAY.  WHAT'S YOUR NAME?\"  You gather up your courage and stammer out your name to her, which produces a wide toothy grin on her face.  She reaches out her huge pinkie towards you and says \"NICE TO MEET YOU.  MY NAME IS NATALIE, BUT YOU CAN CALL ME NAT.\"  You slowly approach the extended digit and grasp it with both hands, shaking it up and down.  She giggles in response and says \"... I DON'T FEEL LIKE BENDING DOWN MUCH LONGER THOUGH.  CARE FOR A LIFT?\"  Her hand flattens out on the ground, laying palm up and you take this as an invitation to climb aboard.  Hoisting yourself over her middle finger, you slowly walk towards the center the hand and sit indian-style on the soft flesh.  She smiles as she says \"OKAY.  GOING UP!\"  <br>\r\n You brace yourself for the g-force of rising into the air, but the experience is surprisingly pleasant.  The girl is obviously taking care not to toss you around too much, and even places her free hand underneath the one you're sitting in to balance it further.  You look up at her pretty face, marveling at the fact that something so big could be so delicate at the same time.  The giant girl sits down in a chair close to the unlit fireplace and lifts you up to her eye.  The giant blue iris traces over your little body, the only thing seperating you being a small amount of air and the thick glass wall that makes up her spectacles.  Her voice is still a whisper, you guess to protect your tiny ears from exploding.  \"NOW TELL ME, HOW DID YOU SHRINK DOWN LIKE THIS?\"  You tell the story to the giant girl about the gypsy woman transporting you to the cabin out of nowhere, bumping into the book and finding yourself between Nat's feet.  The whole time you tell the story, the giant girl is lightly stroking your back with her free hand's pinkie.  You feel a little embarassed to be coddled and prodded like a pet, but at the same time, you can't help but find it unbelievably soothing.  Nat smiles at the end of your tale and says \"YOU'VE CERTAINLY HAD A BUSY DAY, IT SEEMS.  I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO FOR YOU.\"  You look up at her and clear your throat before saying \"Well, actually... maybe you could convince your mistress to change me back?  I'd be eternally grateful!\"  Nat lets out a sigh and says  \"I'M SURE THAT THE MISTRESS WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM RETURNING YOU TO YOUR NORMAL SIZE... THAT IS... IF SHE WISHES TO.\"  You scream up at her \"What do you mean 'If she wishes to'?  Why wouldn't she?\"  Nat bites her lip and whispers matter of factly \"THE MISTRESS SEEMS TO HAVE ISSUES WITH MEN.  SHE'S ALWAYS COMING UP WITH NEW WAYS TO PUNISH THEM FOR TRESPASSING INTO THE CABIN.  I HAVE A FEELING IF SHE WERE TO SEE YOU LIKE THIS, SHE'D BE THRILLED TO KEEP YOU SO TINY.\"  You pace around in the girl's palm, before looking up at her and saying \"Well then... could you try and change me back yourself?\"  Her face gets a little flustered and she says \"ME?  WELL... I'VE NEVER TRIED A SPELL THAT COMPLICATED BEFORE.  AS IT TURNS OUT, MAKING SOMETHING LITTLE IS A LOT EASIER THAN MAKING IT BIGGER.  PLUS, THE MISTRESS WOULD BE ABLE TO SENSE IT IF I HAD ATTEMPTED SUCH A SPELL IN HER HOME.\"  You get down on your knees in the girl's hand, and clasp your hands together tightly to bring home how desperate you are at this point.  \"Please try and help me... I appreciate how nice you're being to me right now, but it's so terrifying being so small like this.  I just want to go home.\"  You can tell that Nat is thinking her options over as she cracks a smile and stands back up out of the chair.  What does she decide to do with you?</span></div></div>",

LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BOOK.\"  You get off your knees and shout up at her \"Really?  You'd do that for me?\"  She smiles and says \"SURE.  AFTER ALL, IF IT DOESN'T WORK, WE COULD AT LEAST SAY I TRIED.\"  You are so overjoyed with the news that you run over to the girl's extended thumb and wrap your arms around it, giving it a big kiss.  You are thrown off by the force of her giggling and she says \"COME ON.  IF WE DO THIS FAST ENOUGH, YOU CAN THANK ME BY GIVING ME A KISS FOR REAL.\"  She carries you over to the table you bumped into and grabs the book with one hand, opening it up.  She begins to thumb through it's pages for the section that you were shrunk by, and something startling hits you.  \"Hey, how come I just bumped into the book and it did this to me, but you can look through it without any problems?\"  She keeps looking at the book, concentrating on the text, but she does answer you without looking up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TRAINING WITH THE MISTRESS FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW.  THE BOOK IS MEANT TO PUNISH ANYBODY WHO TOUCHES IT WITHOUT HER APPROVAL WITH WHATEVER PAGE YOU LAND ON.  IN FACT, WHEN I WAS FIRST GETTING USED TO MY POWERS, I WAS TURNED INTO A CAT BY MISTAKE!\"  You were amazed by this and asked \"A cat?!  That's a bit ironic, don't you think, since your name rhymes and all? Jeez, what was that like?\"  She just giggles and says \"IT WAS A LITTLE HAIRY, BUT OTHER THAN THAT WAS SURPRISINGLY PLEASANT.  THE MISTRESS SAYS THAT YOU RETAIN SOME TRAITS OF EVERY TRANSFORMATION YOU UNDERGO, WHICH PROBABLY EXPLAINS WHY I HAVE A LITTLE DESIRE TO POP YOU INTO MY MOUTH AND SWALLOW YOU LIKE A NAUGHTY LITTLE MOUSE.\"  You immediately get nervous sitting in the cute girl's hand and that's when she looks over at you and says \"I'M KIDDING.  I HATED IT.  IT FEELS SO WEIRD TO BE IN A STATE BESIDES YOUR OWN BODY.  I'M SURE YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE, BEING HELD BY A GIRL LIKE ME LIKE SOME SORT OF DOLL.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't deny that it was an adjustment, to say the least, but you were actually pretty happy to be in the girl's hand.  Her skin was soft, her voice was soothing, and you could feel her body heat all around you.  In all actuality, if you found that there was a way for you to return back to normal fairly easily, you wouldn't mind toying around with the whole \"being tiny\" thing again.  As long as your cute friend here was willing to play the part of your giant host.  Nat continues reading through the book until she comes across a page and points to it.  \"LOOK AT THIS!  \"REDUCTION AND GROWTH - ALTERING THE SIZE OF YOUR FOES AND ALLIES TO FIT YOUR NEEDS'!  WE FOUND IT!\"  Sure enough you look at the page and although the book is written in an unknown text, there are a few illustrations that drive the point home.  One is a picture of a little person standing next to a thimble, both of which are the same size.  You were a little relieved that you weren't QUITE that small as of yet.  The other illustration was of a giant towering above a small series of trees.  You don't want to be QUITE that big, but you're glad to know that it's an option!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at your new giant friend and say \"If this is the spell, are you going to be able to read it?  I know you said there could be problems.\"  Nat looks a bit concerned and says \"IT'S A FEW YEARS OR SO AHEAD OF MY CURRENT LEVEL... BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH A TRY.  AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK, I PROMISE TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU UNTIL YOU CAN GET THE HELP YOU NEED!\"  You are so attracted to this girl's kindness, you actually have to stop yourself from hugging her huge finger again.  Instead you just hold your hands together and bow, almost like you were thanking a queen for allowing you to be in her presence.  She gives off another heartwarming smile and lowers the hand you're standing on slowly to the ground.  You jump off the palm and land on the ground at her feet, waiting patiently as she stands back up to her full height and grabs the book.  Her toes wiggle a few seconds in anticipation before she grabs the book from the counter above you, and takes a step back. \"OKAY, ARE YOU READY DOWN THERE?\"  You stand with your arms out and shout \"Go ahead!  Change me back!\"  She waits for a second and says \"I COULDN'T HEAR THAT, BUT I'LL TAKE IT AS A YES.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, you were so insignificant she couldn't hear you down by her feet.  You couldn't wait to be back among the living.  Holding the book in one hand, Nat begins reading the old text out loud.  You don't undesrtand a word of the language, but you are amazed to see that she has her free hand extended, and it appears to be glowing.  She gets to the last word of the spell, and the light surrounding her hand gets slightly brighter, before disappearing.  Nat breathes out a sigh of relief, and you could tell that just that one attempt took a lot out of her.  You still stand tiny at her feet and shout up (knowing full well she can't hear you.)  \"I guess it didn't work.\"  Nat looks down from the book and with a slightly defeated look says \"DO YOU FEEL ANYTHING?  YOU KIND OF LOOK THE SAME.\"  </span></div></div>",

The feeling spreads throughout your entire body, until you find Nat's feet getting slightly smaller.  You look around and see that the furniture, the floorboards, the walls... they're all closing in on you quickly.  You must be returning back to your normal size!  The pretty girl before you is no longer building sized only that of a small house before she starts crouching down and squealing in joy.  \"YAY!  IT WORKED!  YOU'RE GETTING BIG AGAIN!  I'M SO GLAD I WAS ABLE TO DO IT!\"  You want to thank her, but the sensation of growing is very strong and you feel every second of it.  Unlike when you were shrunk, you are very much aware of your surroundings while regaining your height.  You feel the sensation die down in your stomach and look ahead to see Nat's eyes looking slightly up.  You can't imagine this girl was anywhere close to your height, and that's when her worried expression confirms your fears.  You're not exactly as tall as you once were.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops... uh... it doesn't look like it made you big all the way... you're only a little bit taller than me, and I'm just like 5 foot 4.\"  You sigh and say \"Oh well.  Anything is better than nothing at this point.  Thank you for everything, i really appreciate it.\"  Nat starts to blush a bit and says \"I... i believe you but, i remember you making a promise if i was able to get you back to your normal size....\"  You smile at her and say \"It's not perfect, but it's close enough.\"  And you lean in, cradling the back of your head as you give her a long, thankful kiss. She reciprocates, moaning as she twists her head around, getting as strong of a kiss back as she can, and shoving her tongue almost completely down your throat.  You break apart first, obviously the weaker one in this situation and nervously smile at Nat.  \"So... uh, now that I'm somewhat normal again... do you maybe, want to do something sometimes?\"  Without missing a beat Nat blurts out \"I like movies. Um.  If, that's something you'd be interested in.\"  You smile warmly back at her and try to smoothly say \"Great.  I'll see you at the movie theater at 7 tonight.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to walk out of the cabin, realizing stupidly that you have no way of contacting this girl.  You quickly turn around and go to knock on the wooden door, when it swings open before you and Nat shyly holds a piece of paper out to you.  \"Here's my number.  Call me when you get close.  And don't think about coming late.  I know some pretty interesting spells that could make your night slightly less enjoyable....\"  As soon as you grab the paper, she closes the door behind you and locks it, and you immediately feel a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.  You're really falling for this girl.  You kiss the paper with her name on it and decide to spend the rest of the day wandering through the new town,  high on the fact that you've got a date with a pretty girl who was at one point big enough to hold you between two fingers.  You don't even care that in the process you've lost almost a full foot of your normal height.</span></div></div>",

You made your way to the cinema in town a few minutes early, noticing that the theater was PACKED.  You silently hoped you could get a ticket to whatever she wanted to see, and that's when you hear a familiar voice say \"Hey!  You made it!\"  You spin around to see Nat standing there, her cute frame just a few inches shorter than yours (thanks to your recent downsizing).  Her hair was still the vibrant purple hue, only now she was wearing a very gothic black dress with nylon stockings.  She looked incredibly cute, almost like a burlesque model, with not much but her black sweatshirt giving her warmth.  You smiled as you took her in and said \"I didn't want to be late.  Someone kind of threatened me before.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs your arm and says \"Let's go in.  They re-released Nightmare Before Christmas and this is the only place in town that's showing it.  That's probably why all the people are here.\"  You smirk at her and say \"How did I know that would be the movie you'd want to see?\"  She laughs playfully and says \"What can I say?  The stereotypes make sense sometimes.  Love me some Burton.\"  You smile and walk up to the ticket counter, putting down money for two.  The geeky kid behind the counter looks at you and says \"Sorry dude.  Only one seat left.  You should have gotten your tickets online.\"  You are crushed, not looking forward to turning back around and informing Nat of the bad news, but to your surprise she butts her way in front and says \"That's okay.  Just take the last one.\"  You look at her with confusion but decide to go with it when she mouths the words \"Trust me.\"  For some reason, you totally do.  You take the single ticket and walk back out of the line as Nat leads you into an alley next to the theater.  \"What was that all about?  Why wouldn't i pick a different movie?\"  Nat just smiles coyly and says \"Because i know a way where we can BOTH get in to see this movie.  All it takes is a little magic.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches into her bra and pulls out a folded piece of paper.

You stand with your hands to your sides, glancing at the single ticket.  Nat closes her eyes and begins reciting a few lines of text that she's tried to memorize.  When she finishes, to both of your surprise, her hand starts to glow slightly,  She raises the hand and extends her index finger, giving you a bit of a jump as all the energy seems to rush right to her finger tip.

In fact, by the time the shrinking stops, you think she's actually made you smaller than in your original meeting, since your vision barely comes up past the toe of her boot.  You figure she's shrunk you down to almost 3 inches tall.  When you finally manage to look back up at her, she's a goddess again.  You were kind of hoping to have a date with her on a normal scale, but then again, when you decided to go out with a witch in the first place, you should have expected this to be part of the territory.  She gently reaches down for you, wrapping your body in her soft palm.  As you are brought back up to her face, she maneuvers her hand around so you are left hanging between two fingers, completely powerless to stop this cute giantess from manhandling you.  She lets out a nervous grin and says \"DEJA VU, HUH?\"  You are less than amused by her joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression is one of guilty excitement as she looks around and then says \"SO... HOW DO YOU FEEL?\"  You can only be honest as you cross your arms from your position in protest and say \"Well, i was kind of hoping to never be this short again...\"  Natalie bites her lip and explains \"I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY WEIRD TO BE SHRUNK AGAIN, BUT I FIGURED IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SNEAK YOU INTO THE MOVIE.  PLUS, YOU'LL GET TO BE PRETTY CLOSE TO ME NOW THAT YOU'RE POCKET SIZE.  IT'LL BE FUN!  TRUST ME!\"  You sigh in defeat as you dangle helplessly from the pretty girl's fingers as her caring eyes look over your little body.  She squints and lets out a pondering sound as she says \"HMM... THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHERE TO KEEP YOU UNTIL WE GET INSIDE.\"  Your mind races with possibilities and you can't help but look down at her exposed cleavage.  This motion doesn't go undetected as the giantess whispers \"UH UH, SHORT STUFF.  FIRST DATE.  YOU'RE NOT GETTING TO SECOND BASE THAT EASILY.  YOU'LL RIDE IN MY PURSE.\"  She opens her bag with her free hand and holds it up with her arm as she gently places you inside an empty pocket.  You're glad she didn't just let you roam freely as she carried you or you had a possibility of being crushed by an oversized makeup kit or something.  You feel her giant hand pat the outside of the bag as she says \"HANG TIGHT, DOLL.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you're on a sort of strange, somewhat safer carnival ride as your giant date sneaks you into the theater.  Every footstep she takes reminds you of just how small you are in relation to her, yet you're somehow comfortable with the whole situation.  It's scary being tinier than the cell phone which is laying down right next to you, but you know that you'll be alright once you look into Nat's eyes one more time.  After a few minutes, the bag comes to a rest and the zipper opens again above you.  You expect a light to shine through and blind you, but it's surprisingly dark as you see her black-painted fingernails reach in for you and gently grab you again.  You are rushed up to her mouth again and you feel her warm, minty breath surround you as she whispers \"WE JUST MADE IT.  AND DON'T WORRY, I SAVED YOU A SEAT.\"  Her fingers softly deposit you on a smooth, warm surface and when the hand disappears, you see that she's let you sit on her bare shoulder, surrounded on two sides by her hair, and the other by her neck.  You can clearly see the unbelievably large movie screen in front of you as the previews start and you take a deep breath, acknowledging that this is indeed the most remarkable thing you've ever experienced.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant face next to you whispers \"HUNGRY?\"  And you see her huge thumb and forefinger gripping a single kernel of popcorn in front of you.  It's almost half the size of your entire body!  You grab at it with both hands and she fidgets slightly in her chair, causing you to shake a bit.  you break off a piece of the popcorn with your hands and take a seat, your legs dangling off the edge of the giant girl's shoulder.  This is going to be the greatest movie you've ever seen.</span></div></div>",

You think she's just being sweet for a second, until you feel your body start to change.  It's almost as if you're being levitated in the air as you feel every inch of your being transform into an ever shifting particle of dust.  You almost scream out at the sight of your body being seemingly whisked away into thin air, until you find your whole being zooming in towards Natalie's hand.  There is a bright flash of light, followed by nothing but darkness and relatively overwhelming silence.  You slowly open your eyes and see Nat staring down at you... but her face is huge again!  Just like when you were shrunk in the cabin, only she seems even bigger this time.  You calmly ask her \"Nat... did you shrink me again?\"  She just tilts her head a bit and without moving her lips, you hear her voice in your head say \"UMMM, KIND OF.  TRY NOT TO FREAK OUT, OKAY?\"  You are thrown back by her sudden use of ventriliquism and ask \"How can i hear your voice?  Your lips aren't moving... can I read minds now or something?\"  She answers back again without moving her mouth an inch \"NOT ALL MINDS, JUST MINE.  IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN COMMUNICATE WITH YOU WHILE YOU'RE IN THIS STATE.\"  You are going to ask what she means by \"state\" but that's when another startling revalation occurs to you:  You are unable to move.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for your eyes which can easily dart back and forth in any direction you choose, you can't move any other part of your body.  \"Nat... why am I stuck like this?  What happened to me?\"  She bites her lip and her voice enters your head again.  \"OKAY, LOOK.  I WANTED TO SNEAK YOU INSIDE THE THEATER, BUT THE ONLY WAY YOU WOULDN'T ATTRACT ATTENTION WAS IF I TURNED YOU INTO SOMETHING THAT I COULD EASILY PUT ON MY BODY WITHOUT ANYONE BEING THE WISER, SO I... KINDA SORTA... TURNED YOU INTO A PIECE OF JEWELRY.\"  You are fuming as you motionlessly (and apparently wordlessly) communicate back to her from your position resting in her palm.  \"I'm a fucking piece of jewelry?  Why?  Why did you think this was the best option?\"  She raises an eyebrow and says \"OH, CMON... IT\"LL BE FUN!  BESIDES IF YOU WANT TO BE TURNED INTO SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE INTIMATE, LIKE A BRA OR A PAIR OF PANTIES, YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT A FEW DATES.  THIS WILL BE A GOOD WAY FOR US TO BE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT CROSSING TOO MANY BOUNDARIES...\"  You murmer to yourself, unaware that she can hear every bit of your inner monologue \"I thought somone this deep into dark magic wouldn't really have those boundaries.\"  Her laughter echos through your head as her giant face squints in false anger  \"OH REALLY?  SO JUST BECAUSE I'M A WITCH I CAN'T WANT TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT?  C'MON.  WE'VE WASTED ENOUGH TIME ALREADY.  LET'S GO INSIDE.\"  Her two huge fingers grasp at you and you feel the warm touch as you're lifted off of her palm.  The two huge digits fit you into the space you're destined to stay for the time being... where do you find yourself on the pretty witch's body?</span></div></div>",

The guy is your stereotypical jock complete with blue jeans and a red varsity jacket.  He's easily 4 or 5 inches taller than you are.  The girl is a doe-eyed valley girl clinging onto his shoulder for dear life as they walk together.  Nat goes up to them and says \"Excuse me.  Can you tell me what time the tickets say the event is going to start?\"  The man looks down at the tickets and says \"Uh, in a couple of minutes, why?\"  While he's distracted, Nat presses a finger to his temple, causing him to stare blankly ahead.  His girlfriend is confused and waves a hand in front of his face, getting no reaction.  \"What the hell did you do to him, you stupid goth freak?\"  Nat just smiles and says \"Oh, nothing.  Just this!\"  She quickly brings the same glowing finger up to the blonde's forehead as well, causing her to enter a similar stupor.  Nat holds out her hands and says \"Now.  You want to give me your tickets and do something else tonight.  Something you both will enjoy.\"  The jock wordlessly hands over the tickets to your significantly shorter date, while his girlfriend nods in approval.  Nat looks at the tickets and says \"Excellent.  You two have fun tonight.\"  She starts to turn, but stops herself and walks in front of the blonde.  With a very stern look on her face she says \"Also, you will treat people who look a little different with some goddamned respect.  Understood?\"  The blonde nods up and down slowly as the orders from Nat sink in.  Nat raises her hands and snaps her fingers , turning on her heel to walk back towards you.  You are dumbfounded as she waves the tickets in front of your face and says \"Problem solved.  Let's go inside!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs your arm and starts dragging you out of the alley, and on your way out you see the popular couple snapping out of their haze, before the guy says \"You want to get dinner?  Maybe go shopping for a while?\"  His girlfriend smiles back at him and gives him a kiss on the cheek.  You turn back to face Nat and look at her in amazement.  Nat looks up at you and says very coyly \"Something wrong?\"  You honestly don't know.  You're a little torn by all this and you say \"I'm not sure.  Did you just... hypnotize those people?\" Nat doesn't even bat an eyelash and says \"Yup.  Mind control is one of the first spells witches are taught.  It's the easiest to master because there are so many possible targets.  Someone with witch blood in them would have to submit to another before they are manipulated like that, but you people are much more weak-minded.  It's almost pathetic, really.\"  You stop walking and look off for a second.  \"I... I don't really know how to respond to that.  Is that really how you look at regular people?\"  She grabs your hand and says \"Don't take it that way.  It's nothing against you as a person.  It's just... full blooded humans are naturally easier to control.  You can't help it.\"  You look at her and say \"I'd like to think I have a little more control over my own life.  I'm not weak minded like that dumb jock outside.\"  Nat gets a playful grin on her face and says \"You want to prove it, big guy?  What if I tried to make you my mindless slave right now.  Could you stop me?\"  You return her playful look and say \"You can't make me do anything.  I'm not going to be your bitch.\"  She laughs and points a finger at you, her eyes glowing a familiar shade of red from before.  \"We'll see about that.  This'll be the second time today i've had you in the palm of my hand... although this time it'll be more metaphorically.\" </span></div></div>",

After the movie, you decide to drop Nat off at her house during the walk you both talked about common interests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"So what music you listen to?\" You asked Nat \"Well a little bit of everything but mostly rock music I like the Indie, Alt rock and metal, and old school rock like Rolling Stones and The Kinks, How about you?\" Replied Nat.With a grin you say \"Me too I'm more into Pink Floyd though, Hey you've heard of The Pixes before right?\" \"Yeah! They're my favorite Indie band, you ever listen to Tool?\" She asked \"Yep, really great progressive metal band everything sounds like a symphony when they play. You reply.

As you walked up the steps to her house you both smiled at each other \"Well this is were we say goodbye, I have to get up early tomorrow to study at the Mistress's house at 8 AM\" she said.\"Hey we can see each other tomorrow right?dig up more about my family's past, I'll pick you up once your done studying so we can go to my aunt's house\" you said. She smiled \"alright big fella\" she said bitting the bottom of her lips before leaning and kissing you this caught you off guard but you enjoyed it a lot. \"I'll see ya tomorrow ok be at my house at 1:30 PM Ok\" she said smiling at you \"Ok, I promise\" You say smiling back to her. You leave her at her doorstep as she enters the house and closes the door, you safely walk home and enter your room to sleep.</span></div></div>",

You're aware that the sensation is similar to the same you felt when you touched the witch's spellbook, and immediately start to panic.  You start running back towards Natalie, hoping that maybe she can fix this, but your clothes begin sagging as you run.  Unlike the last time you shrunk, this time your clothes aren't shrinking with you!  You realize that at this pace you'll never make it back to her in time, so in a last ditch effort, you pull out your phone and the piece of paper with Nat's number on it.  You watch in horror as the device and paper grow with each passing second, and you're forced to let your clothing drop to the ground around you and you place the phone on the ground.  You can't be any larger than a foot and a half at this point, so you use your entire fist to punch in the numbers until you hear it ring on the other side.  \"Pick up, please pick up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few rings, a voice on the other end says \"Wow, that didn't take long.  Forget something?\"  You don't waste any time and scream into the receiver \"Natalie!  Help me!  It didn't work, and i'm getting small again!  Come get me!\"  You can hear that you didn't get the message clear but she figured it out anyway as she responds \"What was that?  You're not very clear, almost squeaky soundi... OH NO, You're shrinking again?!  Where are you?\"  You honestly don't know where you are so can't give a good description.  Before you can panic though, you have a brief moment of brilliance and punch the icon next to your keyboard that gives your gps location.  Nat sighs on the other end and with a significantly louder voice says \"OKAY, GOT IT.  I'LL BE RIGHT THERE, I'M SORRY!\"  The phone disconnects and you collapse on top of the screen, happy that you've got some sort of rescue coming your way.  Before you can celebrate however, you realize that you're now the size of your phone itself, and still shrinking.  It's not slowing down like the last time you were around a few inches tall, and you start to fear that your shrinking could be infinite!  You may never stop!  Your only hope is to get help from your new friend the witch's assistant, and only hope she can get there before you shrink into nothingness!</span></div></div>",

She whisks you quickly up to the desk and you climb off next to the oversized spellbook, which the giantess flips through effortlessly.  You watch her intently as she searches through the book, deciphering it's hidden language sentence by sentence.  \"IT SHOULD HAVE MADE YOU LARGE AGAIN.  IT ALL MAKES SENSE.  SIZE.... CHARM... MEN...

The world shifts around you as Nat leans in to get a better look at you.  At the rate you're shrinking, it isn't too unreasonable to say that right now you could fit underneath one of her fingernails.  You let out  a sigh of relief as you finally stop reducing in size, but looking up makes you understand just how tiny you are, and how collosal this young girl is.  She is squinting one gigantic eye to scan the wooden floor for you, but you are equally as miniscule as clumps of dirt and hairs that the regular sweeping and dusting has left behind.  You are truly insignificant standing before a goddess.  Her voice is so deep and powerful that even when she whispers, she shakes you to your very core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS IS BAD.  THIS IS REALLY BAD.  I CAN'T EVEN SEE YOU ANYMORE!\"  You wave your arms and jump up and down, unfortunately the giant eye scanning over you is not strong enough to pick up your miniscule form.  You are truly less than a grain of sand to her.  She slams her hand down in frustration, which causes you to fall backwards from the booming quake.  She whispers with tears welling up in her eyes \"I JUST WANTED TO MAKE YOU BIGGER.  I'M SO STUPID FOR THINKING THIS WOULD WORK, AND NOW YOU'RE TOO SMALL FOR ME TO HELP YOU!\"  You want to comfort her, but at your current state she is the size of a planet.  She wouldn't be able to feel your touch or hear your words.  You'd have better luck trying to talk a mountain into moving for you.  A droplet of a tear crashes down what seems like yards away from you, and it's so massive and powrful that you can actually feel the impact as it hits the floor before you.  If this is what life is going to be like from now on, even the littlest of things will seem like massive undertakings.  Nat wipes the tears from her eyes and says \"THERE'S ONLY ONE THING I CAN THINK TO DO RIGHT NOW...\"  </span></div></div>",

DON'T MOVE AT ALL.  I'M COMING DOWN THERE TO FIND YOU.\"  You know what she's doing and want to run towards her to stop her.  You don't want anyone else being NEARLY as small as you are right now, but the giantess opens up to the correct page and recites the incantation yet again.  You are slightly blown back by he sharp blue aura that surrounds her body as she says the spell again, her pretty blue eyes taking on an all too familiar white glow.  When she finishes the speech, her hands leave the book and her body begins to dwindle.  It is truly amazing watching the giant woman shrink down closer to you.  She is by no means small when compared to your miniscule, flea sized being.  But it is truly remarkable seeing her transform from a goddess to something slightly lower, like a SKYSCRAPER.  By the time she stops shrinking, she appears to still be 200 feet tall to you.  It's very similar to your first shrinking experience, only now with the knowledge that Natalie is approximately the size of a normal person's thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOA... THIS IS SO WEIRD.  I'M LIKE A MOUSE NOW!  IT'S KIND OF COOL!\"  She clears her throat, not letting her excitement take away from the task at hand.  She slowly makes her way over to where she told you to stand, and luckily you listened to her orders.  This made it much easier for her to pinpoint your location.  Still you couldn't help but stare at her as she made her way over.  Those thick strands of purple hair she constantly has to brush out of her face as she scans the floor for you.  The long, well toned thighs.  And you also noticed that she had taken off her shoes before shrinking down, so her bare feet slapped loudly against the floor as she drew closer.  Every movement she made seemed to emphasize either how beautiful, or dangerous she was at this scale.  When she gets right up to you, you wave your arms and jump up and down to get her attention.  A look of unbelievable relief and happiness washes over her face as she places her gigantic feet on either side of you and wiggles her toes.  \"GOT YA!\"  She quickly bends down with her hand flat on the ground, inviting you to climb aboard.  You quickly scamper over her soft fingers and settle onto her open palm, sitting down as she cautiously lifts you up to her face.  You expect her to hold you up to her eyes to see you, but she makes an unexpected detour at her mouth, closing her lips together and pushing you into them.  The kiss caught you completely by surprise, but it's the most welcome surprise you've ever experienced.  Being surrounded by the warm, wet flesh of her lips was the most soothing few seconds you've ever been apart of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe releases you, letting out a small giggle in embarassment as she says \"SORRY ABOUT THAT... I WAS JUST SO AFRAID THAT I LOST YOU FOREVER.  FORGIVE ME FOR BEING SO FORWARD.\"  You blush a bit yourself, happy for the moment to be face to face with your pretty protector and say \"Well, it's not every day you get kissed by a beautiful goddess.  I guess i should be thanking you for all this.  You did risk a lot to find me.\"  She laughs at your comment and says \"WELL, MAYBE WHEN WE GET BACK TO NORMAL YOU CAN THANK ME PROPERLY.  LET'S GO READ ANOTHER SPELL FROM THE B....\"  You feel her hand tremble a bit beneath you as her smile quickly turns into a look of astonished fear.  \"THE... THE BOOK!  I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT REACHING YOU I DIDN'T SEE WHERE IT ENDED UP!  IF IT'S NOT OPEN TO THE PAGE, I DON'T THINK I CAN RESTORE US!\"  She quickly spins around and you see the book...</span></div></div>",

BUT WE CAN'T DO IT RIGHT NOW.  I CAN SENSE HER GETTING CLOSER.\"  You look up confused and say \"Sense?  What do you mean?\"  She holds her hand steady as she goes back to the other side of the room, grabbing her bag and jacket, explaining along the way.  \"EVERY POWERFUL WITCH GIVES OFF A TRACE OF ENERGY, ALMOST LIKE AN AURA THAT SURROUNDS THEM AT ALL TIMES.  I CAN SENSE HERS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN LEARNING FROM HER FOR SO LONG.  AND I CAN TELL THAT SHE'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.\"  You start to panic a bit as she gets ready to leave and say up to her \"If she's coming, is it even worth it to leave?  Won't she find you?\"  Nat bites her lip and says \"NOT IF WE LEAVE NOW.  I DON'T HAVE THE SAME ENERGY TRACE AS HER, SO SHE'D HAVE TO ACTUALLY SEE ME TO IDENTIFY ME.  MY CAR'S PARKED OUT BACK.\"  She brings you up to her face and whispers \"I WANT YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR AND TRUST ME, OKAY?  LAY DOWN IN MY HAND SIDEWAYS.  IT'LL MAKE IT EASIER FOR ME TO CARRY YOU.\"  You honestly trust and feel safe with this girl, even knowing she's going to close her giant fingers around you.  You do as she commands and keep your arms at your side, as she slowly balls up her hand to further cover you.  \"Just don't squish me!\"  You half-jokingly say to her, but it falls on deaf ears as you find yourself sealed tightly in her protective fist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little witch carefully carries you out to her car, using her free hand to open the door and sliding in gracefully.  You were actually amazed at how she reached a sitting position without squeezing you too much by accident.  You barely moved around at all!  she slowly uncurls her fingers, letting a soft breeze pass over your body.  You're actually kind of disappointed, it was surprisingly peaceful surrounded by the flesh of this girl's hand.  \"I LIVE ON CAMPUS AT THE NEARBY COLLEGE.  MY ROOMMATE'S OUT OF TOWN SO IT SHOULD BE JUST THE TWO OF US FOR A DAY OR SO.  HOPEFULLY THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE'LL NEED TO WAIT TO CHANGE YOU BACK.\"  You were about to thank her yet again, when she lets out a small gasp and looks around the car.  \"OH... I DIDN'T REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS... WHERE AM I GOING TO PUT YOU FOR THE RIDE?  I CAN'T JUST THROW YOU IN THE CUP HOLDER AND HOPE YOU'LL BE OKAY.\"  You are a little relieved that she thought of this before you did.  She obviously wants to take care of you and this proves that she's looking out for your best interests at heart.      You sit down nervously in her palm as the clock ticks, waiting for her to make her next move.  How does she decide to take you back to her dorm?</span></div></div>",

I'VE GOT TO HIDE YOU!\"  You are startled by her sudden change in deameanor but are unable to ask questions as she closes her fist around you and runs towards the open window.  She looks outside and you manage to peek through the cracks in her fingers  to see a slick black corvette appraching at a rapid pace.  She opens her hand back up again and says \"WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME, SHE'LL BE INSIDE THE CABIN ANY SECOND NOW.\"  You call up to her and ask her \"How did you know she was coming?  And why do you have to hide me if you've spotted me first!  Can't you convince her to let me live?\"  Nat bites her lip and says \"I COULD SENSE HER COMING CLOSE... ALL WITCHES CAN SENSE EACH OTHER FOR MILES AWAY.  AND NO, I WILL DEFINITELY NEED TO HIDE YOU.

You look up at the giant girl and ask her, from the odd position you'v efound yourself in her palm \"Wait... she drives a Corvette?  Witches drive cars?\"  Nat rolls her eyes and whispers down to your tinybody \"OF COURSE SHE DRIVES A CAR!  THIS IS THE 21st CENTURY!  WHAT DID YOU THINK SHE DROVE, A RATTY OLD BROOMSTICK?\"  You can't even answer back.  For a millisecond, you thought that was exactly the case.  Well, it's good to know that you at least know what DECADE you've found yourself in, now all that's left is to remain unsquashed while this nervous girl deals with her gigantic mistress.  As the door unlocks, Nat brings you up to her face and presses you against her lips softly, leaving you momentarily covered in lipstick, but also feeling somewhat more secure.  She whispers to you \"I'M SORRY, BUT I HAVE TO HIDE YOU  TRY NOT TO MOVE AROUND TOO MUCH.\"  And she places your tiny body...</span></div></div>",

You scream up at her very nervously \"Are you kidding?  Your idea is to keep me with your feet?\"  Nat nervously looks up to see if the Witch has made any progress on getting into the house.  She whispers back to you \"WELL MY OUTFIT DOESN'T HAVE ANY POCKETS.  AND I'LL NEED TO KEEP YOU CLOSE TO ME IN ORDER TO CONCEAL YOUR... ESSENCE.  MY MISTRESS WILL BE ABLE TO SMELL  YOUR BLOOD EVEN IF YOU'RE THIS TINY.\"  Her massive pale foot leaves the shoe and she gently places you on the sole, instructing you to lay down.  \"I WON'T PUT ANY PRESSURE ON YOU.  AND AS SOON AS I CAN GET YOU OUT OF HERE I WILL, JUST TRUST ME.\"  You begrudgingly lay flat and immediately expect death as you see the girl's wrinkly, sweaty sole rest gently atop your miniscule body.  You feel the weight of this giantess smush you into the flat sole of the shoe, but true to her word she is not stepping down on the shoe.  She is just holding your body in place.  You try not to squirm around too much, for fear that she may be ticklish, and all you can do is wait for her to leave the Witch's cabin undetected.  You hear the door open and feel the massive footsteps as the older woman walks in.  \"HELLO, NATTIE DEAR.  YOU'RE HERE FAIRLY EARLY.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess above you answers back \"OH, YES MISTRESS.  WELL, I WAS LOOKING TO GET A HEAD START ON SOME MORE STUDYING.  YOU SAID NEXT WEEK YOU'D TRAIN ME TO USE A FEW MORE PRACTICAL SPELLS, AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING BEFORE I... I DON'T KNOW... SHRUNK SOMEONE DOWN TO DOLL SIZE BY ACCIDENT.\"  You roll  your eyes a bit at how on the nose she is, as you lay beneath her foot which is now perspiring quite a bit due to the nervousness of the giant standing atop you.  The witch lets out a small amused \"HMMM.\"  and walks over to her spellbook.  \"THE SHRINKING SPELL IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES.  IT'S WHY I HEXED MY SPELLBOOK SO THAT ANY HUMANS WHO TOUCH IT WOULD DWINDLE DOWN TO THE STATURE OF A RAT.  I KNOW YOU'RE NOT THE VIOLENT TYPE, BUT YOU SHOULD REALLY TRY SQUASHING OR EATING A FEW OF THE LITTLE SHRUNKEN MEN.  IT'S QUITE EXHILARATING.\"  You take a big gulp, imagining how easily someone like Nat could make that small suggestion into a big reality.  In fact, you could swear that she was running the idea through her head as the foot in front of you squeezes just a little stronger into her shoe.  But Nat quickly changes the subject, saying \"UM, BUT I JUST REALIZED THAT I HAVE TO... DO... SOMETHING AT HOME.  CAN I LEAVE FOR THE DAY MISTRESS?  THE CABIN IS CLEANED AND ALL I WAS GOING TO DO WAS READ SOME OLD SCROLLS.\"  You hear thumping vibrations as the witch taps her foot agains the floor and answers \"HMMMM....WELL YOU HAVE FINISHED ALL YOUR CHORES...\"</span></div></div>",

She is being careful and not stepping on you too hard, but there is a slight amount of pressure that pushes the soft skin into your face, stomach, and legs.  Natalie slowly walks over to the table in the center of the Witch's main room, which is adorned with all different texts and books.  As she sits down, you feel almost all of the weight fall off of you while she relaxes.  The smell you experience while trapped under Natalie's sole is pretty strong due to the worn out insole and the sweat collecting between her toes.  And you can't help but enjoy where you are, all things considered.  You've always had a small fascination for women's feet, and now that you're the size of a doll underneath a gigantic wrinkly sole, you can't help but be a little turned on.  Especially when the soft, smelly flesh is rubbing gently against your waist, giving you a small nudge in the right direction.  You turn your head to face the pale salty flesh in front of you, and close your eyes, giving it a small peck.  The taste lingers on your lips and you enjoy it intensely.  You nudge your head over a small inch and passionately place another kiss on Nat's foot.  You can feel the foot shake a bit and a muffled giggle escapes the giantess's lips.  You may have gone a little too far with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic sole lifts up off of your body and you can feel it dragging slowly across your body.  Eventually her toes make their way past your legs and you are brought out into the open, bathed in the bright light of the room.  You are unable to move as the sweat from Nat's foot has adhered you to the material of the sandal, and you scream up at her \"A little help?\"  The giant girl bends over and picks up the shoe, lifting it up to her face.  She has the look on her face like she's going to scold you, but doesn't raise her voice too loud, either for fear of being caught, or puncturing your tiny little eardrums.  \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE?  I COULD FEEL YOU SQUIRMING AND SHAKING THAT WHOLE TIME!\"  You are unable to look away from the giantess and can't think of an excuse, so you just exhale and spill your guts \"Uh... well while i was stuck under your foot the whole situation was kind of turning me on, so I... I was giving your feet a few kisses.  I don't know what came over me, I'm sorry.\"  She raises an eyebrow and lets out a short laugh of amazement and says \"WAIT, SO THAT SMALL MOVEMENT I FELT WAS YOU KISSING MY FEET?  YOU WERE REALLY THAT TURNED ON BY BEING BENEATH MY TOES?\"  You sheepishly nod your head up and down, not wanting to lie to the giantess who's shoe you were currently stuck to.  She bites her lip as if she doesn't know how to react and says \"WELL I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I FIND THAT TO BE...\"</span></div></div>",

I'M ALL GOOD NOW!\" - with that Natalie pushes her sole onto you and holds you down in place. It pushes the air out of your lungs and makes it almost impossible for you to breathe. You try to push the sole up to make room, but it feels like you could just as well be trying to wrestle an elephant. You struggle to catch shallow breaths and to make matters worse, the sole is getting more moist - you realize Nat must be getting nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026 OR WHILE CASTING SPELLS...\" - Mistress continues relentlessly, completely ignoring her student's remarks. You try to calm down and not distract the giant girl. \"YOU CAN TAKE ONE OF MY SANDALS, WHILE YOU'RE INDOORS ANYW-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, I.. I'M SORRY, MISTRESS, IT WON'T BE...

I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD FIT-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NONSENSE, NOTHING THAT A LITTLE.. FURTHER RECONFIGURATION COULDN'T FIX!\" - you shudder at the thought. Is that what happened to the other.. trespassers? You conclude you should definitely thank Nat for saving you, however weird her actions seemed at the time. In any case, Nat doesn't say anything and her mistress continues: \"WELL ALRIGHT THEN, MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Maybe...\" - Nat's voice booms from the outside, but quieter now, as if under her breath. You can hear footsteps booming into the distance and assume the mistress left. Pressure on you eases a lot and you can finally breathe normally. Well, as 'normally' as you can given the circumstances - but you're getting used to this. You conclude it's actually not too bad... considering what could happen were you found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minutes or two of motionless silence, a big, cold drop of sweat falls onto your face and you are forced to review your conclusions. Hugging the soft foot was one thing, but this... this is too much, so you wriggle and wipe it off with your hands. To make matters worse some got inside your mouth and you try to spit it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour movement must've attracted Nat's attention again as she pushes her foot down on you again, not as strongly as when 'arguing' with her mistress, but definitely more firmly than in the very beginning. It's not painful for you or anything, but.. it's almost as if she's feeling your body under the sole, or.. fondling you? You hope she doesn't deem your movements to be more 'making out' with her sole - it's not exactly like you can explain yourself now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pedal 'assault' continues for a while and you start to struggle to defend yourself, so to speak, pushing back at the invading sole.. which only seems to encourage her. The game is a bit tiring for you, but at the same time... it does feel nice and you even get an erection from all the activity around your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, she stops after what feels like a few minutes and you're given some time to relax. You are given some room as the sole pulls back and you can feel the fresh air getting in. Fresh and chilly... You're drenched in sweat - some of it yours, but it's mostly hers... the whole insole is damp, leaving you with nothing to wipe yourself on. Evaporation does the rest and you actually begin to tremble from the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider if it's not due to your smaller form losing heat more quickly, but either way.. it's quickly getting uncomfortable, so you reach up and hug the sole, even trying to pull it down onto your body. Nat lets out a surprised giggle and then a prolonged \"Awwww...\" - great, now she'll definitely think you're making out with her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least she doesn't play with you in her shoe now and you can warm up against her soft skin. Next...</span></div></div>",

You notice how magic teachers are just as annoying as regular ones, except the nomenclature seems.. more interesting, and dangerous... \"BUT!

Although it's probably more Nat's foot shaking than the ground. \"INITIATE NOTES-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey say it together in choir: \"ON MAGICKA OBSCURA APPLICATION\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mistress adds: \"CHAPTERS TWO THRU FIVE, AT LEAST!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUT I'VE READ IT A DOZEN-\" - Nat protests, but is interrupted:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAYBE THIRTEENTH TIME'S THE CHARM AND YOU'LL FINALLY REMEMBER, NOT TO _GUESS_ PARTS OF THE SPELL YOU DON'T KNOW?\" - awkward silence follows, then the Mistress adds: \"CHOP CHOP, I WANT EVERYTHING READ AND RE-READ BY TOMORROW MORNING!\" - and then storms out the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel bad for Natalie, humiliated by her Mistress so thoroughly... You consider hugging or kissing the sole, but quickly decide to simply pretend you're not even there. You reconsider that when she stands up - it would be a shame if she forgot about you entirely, so you wriggle a bit - hopefully enough to remind of your existence. Nat doesn't react to it, but she seems to be putting little weight on you while she picks up the books and walks through the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the Mistress coming back: \"HUH? NATTIE, YOU LIMPING NOW?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, NO.. I JUST.. CRAMPS.. WAS SITTING DOWN FOR TOO LONG...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! UM, MISTRESS.. I'M, FINE, REALLY...\" - you feel the pressure increase as she sole shifts around you, enveloping your tiny form and threatens to crush you. There you thought the nervous 'trample' was bad... Luckily you're not crushed and pressure eases as she lifts the leg. Only to return a second later... \"AND THESE SHOES ARE REALLY COMFORTABLE...\" - she takes another step and you reflect how all your bones will surely be broken if this continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH, RIGHT\" - the Mistress snarks and walks away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie walks more carefully now, not having to 'act' in front of her Mistress. She seems to pick up something else from the ground then leaves the cabin. Outside, she...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Nat closes the doors outside the cabin, you worry about seemingly upcoming torture as she walks home.. wherever it is. You couldn't see signs of civilization anywhere nearby when you arrived - so you begin to dread the thousands of footfalls that will trample you. Careful or not, it's still like having a truckload of cows dumped on top of you. Not particularly pleasant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she seems to sit down somewhere and remove the shoe you are in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew\" - Nat whispers. Her voice is loud but not overwhelming as normal tone - \"that was close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..\" - you're stuck to the insole, seemingly unable to move. That is if all your muscles didn't hurt from the struggle.. and 'compression'. \"Where.. what's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm about to drive home? Will you be okay in there for the ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please, don't... I mean, it wasn't bad when you were sitting down, but the weight... is too much when-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry...\" - she even blushes apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's.. it only hurt for a while... You saved me. Thank you, I mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I only removed it now to..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I mean.. before, like.. from the Mistress? She would've 'squashed' me, or turned me into.. a sandal or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that, or swallowed you, yeah... you're welcome!\" - Natalie smiles uneasily - \"And the sandals.. I think she's just joking about.. them.\" You process the idea of having a 'joke' like that and she continues: \"So... will you get out of my shoe, or are you planning on staying in for the ride, or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle trying to peel off your arms one by one, then legs.. nothing. Nat just watches your attempts curiously. You give up and: \"A little help, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, sure.. I...\" - she reaches inside carefully - \"I'm new to this.. thing..\" - she grabs your torso with her thumb and forefinger, then adds: \"Scream if it hurts or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry.. I meant, yeah...\" - she then pulls you out of the shoe carefully. You have to admit you had some good time in the shoe, but it's good to be free, finally. Well, as free as you can be being held up a hundred feet in the air, in front of a giant woman face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around: \"Uh, nice scooter.. I wouldn't think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, should I just grab a broom and fly home then?\" - Nat squints her eyes angrily at your remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I.. um, it's 21st century, after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat smiles and says out loud: \"YOU'RE FUNNY! Uh...\" - she looks around at the cabin, making sure she's not being watched. She seems content as she looks back at you, measuring you between her fingers - \"And you stink like feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible! How could that happen!\" - you try to joke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" - she chuckles - \"Here, let me put you... hmm\" - she lowers you towards the seat, putting you between her thighs. \"I don't think this would be safe.. I'd hate to lose you, after everything... Could you grab hold of.. something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around: smooth pants, there's not much to 'grab hold of'... Basically you'd have to climb onto her crotch or something. And you don't want to be _that_ forward with her. After all, she could literally crush you at any moment had she felt offended or anything. Not to mention she even could crush you on accident here, you realize - standing between thighs thicker you are tall... Also: \"Not really, also..\" - you rub your hands and arms - \"Is it just me, or is it getting cold all over again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, poor thing.. trembling in the chilly evening air\" - she reaches back into her backpack. That's what she was picking up, you realize. \"Here, use these to cover yourself a bit\" - she gives you a couple hand tissues. Each large enough it could be a tent for a couple - you struggle to even hold onto them. \"Here, let me.. help with.. can you just.. grab the other... ohh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry if I'm too puny and weak to hold two hand tissues at once...\" - you can only comment as the wind carries the large paper fabric into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this won't work either, a single bump would send you... here\" - she grabs your body again, wraps you in the other tissue then slowly places you inside her backpack. \"It's a bit cramped, but..\" - you actually have a lot of room here, more than enough to stand up and stretch. And especially compared to the shoe. Yeah, this should work. Natalie adds: \"No, it won't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" - you look up at her face observing you carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could get crushed if the books shift.. or something...\" - she comments and reaches in to pick you up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no, wait a minute. It seems like a good fit, plus they're perfectly stable!\" - you comment and she taps the book, shifting it a bit and making you lose balance. \"I mean, relatively speaking.. but it looks safe enough from 'down here'...\" - she seems confused, apparently unsure if you're joking or actually being serious. \"Plus, I mean.. I survived a fight with an enormous foot\" - you stand up to make it appear more valiant: \"A heroic and victorious struggle, no.. battle! Being cornered inside-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shush\" - Nat stops you and begins zipping the backpack shut. She gives you one last look through the small gap and adds: \"But if you get crushed to death or something.. it's your fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp as Nat wears the backpack and starts her scooter. She seems super nice and careful, but.. perhaps only to a point. You assume it's due to it really being her 'first time with this.. thing'. The actual ride is less bumpy than you expected - whatever shocks the bike doesn't amortize, must be cushioned by Nat... or however it works. You realize you're not really used to this.. thing, either. The 'being shrunk and at the complete mercy of witches, victim of forces existence of which you had no idea until merely hours ago'-thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, at least you get to hang around with the nice one. Or.. nicer at least, hopefully. Speaking of hanging around... you realize that Natalie did just leave you alone with several tomes containing the most arcane secrets of magical arts! You consider trying to learn a thing or two yourself, perhaps finding a way out of your.. situation, yourself? Sure it might be risky, but rewards... you could learn how to use magic yourself! In the end you...</span></div></div>",

ANOTHER STUPID VILLAGER TRYING TO SNEAK INTO THE HOUSE.\"  She reaches for you quickly, trapping you in her fist as it closes entirely around you.  You toss and turn for a split second before landing face down on her palm, which opens to reveal you.  You look up into her pretty face, which seems less than excited to find you.  Clearly you're not the first shrunken person she's ever held before.  She brings you close to her and holds you up to her eyes, which are squinted to get a better look at you.  \"WHEN WILL YOU STUPID PEOPLE LEARN?  MY MISTRESS DOESN'T LIKE TO BE BOTHERED.  IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE MADE ALL LITTLE LIKE THIS, MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST STAYED HOME.\"  You shout up at her from your position in her hand \"But I'm not from here!  I just appeared here!\"  The gigantic eyes roll and she booms down at you \"CAN'T HEAR YOU, LITTLE GUY.  ALL I HEAR IS SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK.\"  You should have known it was pointless to try and reason with her.  At this size you're barely a person, so why would your voice carry over to her humongous ears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL, ONE OF TWO THINGS IS GOING TO HAPPEN NOW, TINY.  EITHER THE WITCH IS GOING TO WANT TO KEEP YOU AS A PET, OR EAT YOU.  AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU HONESTLY, I THINK SHE'S GOT MORE THAN ENOUGH PETS TO KEEP HER HAPPY.\"  She walks over to the other side of the room and bends down holding you next to a box covered by a black sheet.  When she lifts the cover open, you see a large hamster cage with five or six shrunken people inside.  \"WAVE HI TO THE OTHER LITTLE SHRINKEES!  HI LITTLE PEOPLE!\"  A doll sized man in tattered, dirty clothes presses his face up to the side of the catch and screams up at your giant captor \"You bitch!  Make us regular size right now!  You'll burn for this!\"  The giantess just chuckles and looks down at you whispering \"HE'S PROBABLY STILL A LITTLE CRANKY FROM EARLIER THIS WEEK.  THE MISTRESS NEEDED A NEW INSOLE FOR HER BOOTS AND DECIDED TO USE HIM.  APPARENTLY HE WAS REALLY COMFY.\"  She blows the screaming little person a kiss before placing the sheet back over the cage, shrouding them in darkness again.  The girl looks back down at you cowering in her palm and says \"SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'LL BE MY MISTRESS'S AFTERNOON SNACK.  IT'S A SHAME, YOU KNOW.  YOU'RE PRETTY CUTE.\"  You don't know if you should be taking this as a compliment, but you're too scared to move.  You see a twinkle in the girl's eyes as she bites her lips.  She uses her free hand to stroke the front of your body with her extended index finger and says \"YOU KNOW... THE MISTRESS HAS SO MANY PETS OF HER OWN AND I'VE NEVER HAD A LITTLE PERSON FOR MYSELF.  MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE YOU HOME WITH ME.  I CAN FEED YOU, AND BATHE YOU, AND PLAY WITH YOU ALL THE TIME.  WHAT DO YOU SAY, LITTLE GUY?\"  You know that you don't really have much of a choice.  And although you've never met the witch, you know that you don't want to be here when she gets back, for fear of becoming a meal.  You don't know if you can trust this girl not to be too rough with you, but you want to live pretty badly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have a choice to answer as you hear commotion from outside the house and the giant girl says \"IT'S THE MISTRESS!  I NEED TO HIDE YOU UNTIL I GET HOME.  DON'T MOVE AROUND TOO MUCH.  YOU DON'T WANT TO GET ON MY BAD SIDE SO EARLY IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.\"  The girl's fingers close in around you and you are thrown about for a few seconds.  You hear the door open before you are released from her grasp, landing on something soft.  You can't quite tell where you are, all you know is that it is hot and tight.    But there is one clue that can let you know exactly where she's put you.  The air is humid and smells like...</span></div></div>",

The hand is moving too fast for you to be grabbed by her... she's going to swat you like a fly!  You scream and run in the opposite direction, trying to outrun the humongous hand and the girl that it's attached to.  A shockwave crashes around you as you are thrown to the ground by the force.  You are unharmed, but judging by the massive fingers on either side of you, you were only a few inches away from being crushed out of existance under this girl's palm!  She looks down at you and a smile crosses her lips as she says \"HEHE... YOU'RE A FAST LITTLE WORM AREN'T YOU?\"  You continue running as the girl raises herself on her arms and stands back to her full height.  Even though she's only about 18 or so, she stands an imposing few hundred feet tall at your scale.  She could snuff you out with a little finger if she wanted to.  But she apparently has other plans as she lifts her sandal clad foot up and centers it directly above you.  \"OH WELL.  I'LL BET YOU'LL SMUSH JUST THE SAME AS THE REST.\"  Acting on instinct alone, you dodge out of the way as the collosal ped comes crashing down on your previous location.  With a loud giggle, you turn around to see the gigantic teenager crouch over you with a look of excitement and playfullness.  \"OOH, THERE'S SOME FIGHT IN YOU, LITTLE BUG.  I THINK THAT CALLS FOR A LITTLE SOMETHING SPECIAL...\"  You continue to walk backwards, almost mesmerized by the sight in front of you as the witch's young apprentice begins to take her sandal off, exposing her huge bare foot.  The naked flesh hits the wooden floor of the cabin and it's toes wiggle in delight as she pivots to face you.  \"YOU'RE GONNA FEEL SOOOO GOOD WHEN I GET YOU UNDER MY TOES.  DIE LITTLE BUGGY!  DIE!\"  Her feet stomp down harshly behind you and you bolt towards the nearest wall you can find, hoping for some sort of sanctuary.  You're coming up on a dresser in the corner of the room, and jump underneath the legs to find a bit of relief.  You could actualy feel the swipe of air behind you and you knew that if you were just a second or so slower, you'd have been a red stain under the pretty girl's bare foot.  She lets out a moan of anger and says \"COME ON OUT LITTLE THING!  IT'LL BE OVER A LOT SOONER IF YOU JUST LET ME SQUISH YOU QUICK!\"  This girl is absolutely insane!  The lengths she's going to to crush what she thinks is a bug is nothing short of incredible!  You think all hope may be lost, until you notice a small beam of light coming from the wall.  It's a mousehole!  You never thought you'd be so happy to see one of those!  With all your remaining energy you run to the mousehole and step inside, only peering back out when you hear a massive rumbling from the other side.  The loud sound is of the dresser scraping against the floor as the giant girl pushes it to the side!  She's not giving up in the slightest, and probably won't until you're crushed to death under her big toe!  You know there's nothing but death waiting for you on the outside of the mousehole and feel a bit of relative safety, but you quickly turn around and come face to face with something that changes your situation entirely...</span></div></div>",

All you hear are birds chirping and water flowing all around you.  It's incredibly hot, so you take your shirt off and wrap it around your waist, giving you a little bit more of a breeze.  The plumage is definitely gorgeous, and there are flowers decorating the entire floor of the woods, but you have absolutely no idea where you are.  You just decide to keep walking through, stepping over tree branches and twigs as you ascend deeper into the jungle.  You think you hear a quick motion shake the trees around you and you turn to face it, but there's nothing there.  The fear starts to build up inside you as you realize you may have to fight some sort of wild animal in order to escape with your life.  The rustling continues all around you, followed by what you can only describe as... surpressed laughter?  You are scared for your life as you wait for something to come out of the shrubs and attack you... but that's when you hear a surprisingly feminine voice say to you \"Well, well.

You've come across a real, live pixie fairy!  \"Just what do you think is the big idea, jumbo?  Think you can just come in here and ruin our home?\"  You try to stifle a laugh as you answer back \"Excuse me... Jumbo?

As soon as this happened, the Pixie started to play faster. A humming sound filled your ears, as the chill only increased. Despite this you couldn't keep your eyes off the little winged creature, wondering what she had in store for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you began to notice subtle differences in her appearance. She looked more... well more curvy than before. And you could SWEAR she looked a bit bigger too. <i>Course she could just be playing really close to your face</i>, you think... until it dawned on you that you were looking UP at her... and she was even bigger and curvier. Her tiny outfit was barely able to keep her breasts back... and was clearly losing the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catching on sweetie?\" she giggled, watching you dwindle down in size as she absorbed your mass and height. Smirking, your cute captor resumed her playing in earnest, clearly enjoying the feeling of growth, as evidenced by the rock-hard nipples that pressed against her clothing's fabric. You smelled something resembling mint, and (as you shrank) found out the source of the smell... as you gazed up between her toned and tight thighs. This was getting the pixie off in a major way, her sex literally dripping as she started to slow the playing down, quietly descending to the ground as you sank into a growing pile of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betcher wondering why I'm doing this. Why I've waited till NOW to use this? Well, have never really had a problem with humans... until now...\" lectured the pixie as she grew more and more, her tiny outfit nothing but tattered shreds. \"The song is meant to give us our heart's desire... and at this moment I desired nothing more than to swap sizes with your arrogant ass.\" she giggled, her song now coming to a stop as she stood, like some monolithic statue, looming over your cavernous pile of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can definitely see why you humans are so overly confident.\" she said, laughing to herself as she stretched her (to you) massive body, her giant wings fluttered a bit. \"The view from here is great.\" before she bent down, her moist crotch hovering over you as she daintily picked you up, your body's paralysis slowly starting to wear off. \"I feel so... so powerful... so strong... almost fearless!\" said your giant captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might just keep you... and your size.\" mused the pixie, playfully kissing you with her now massive lips. \"But first!\" she quipped, placing you in between her perky breasts as she bent over the now empty clothes. \"Need some new clothes.\" as she scooped them up. Slowly, hovering there on wings that now sound like some massive ceiling fan, she began to slip into your clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little too... manly for my taste... but it's only meant to be temporary... until we get back to... \" she caught herself, giggling turning to laughter. \"Can't take you to my place! I wouldn't fit inside.\" as she gave her breasts a jiggle, sending your slowly recovering body tumbling further inside the massively soft prison. Humming to herself, the pixie thought of her next move.</span></div></div>",

It's an amazing feeling, almost as if you're being pressed by a huge machine on either side of your body.  And while that sensation is occurring, you are terrified to watch as the pixie is growing before your eyes.  \"Hehehe... Shrink, Shrink, Shrink!  I just looooove watching you big boys get all compact like that!  Now we can see eye to eye on a few things!\"  You realized she was right and you felt the sensation go away as the pixie floated down to the ground right beside you.  Looking around in awe, you are dwarfed by humongous plants and trees that shoot up into the sky and gigantic leaves that decorate the forest floor.  The pixie's really made you... pixie size!  Her giggle snaps your attention back to her and you are actually able to get a look at her cute, naked body.  She is't a very skinny fairy, she has a lot of baby fat around her waist and thighs, but her face is adorable and framed with bright red hair.  You weren't able to make out her features at your previous size, but now that you've matched her height, the bright glow that surrounds her is significantly dimmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie gets up close to you and stands on her tip toes, giving you a kiss on the cheek.  \"Welcome to my world, stranger!  You're actually pretty cute once you get on my level!\"  Her face immediately shifts to an angry frown and she kicks you in the shin.  You scream out in pain and surprise \"Ahh!  What the hell was that for?\"  She stands with her hands on her hips and says \"That was for stomping your big, stupid feet all over our homes!  Maybe i should give you another dose of the shrinks, and squish you under my heel!\"  She raises an eyebrow and taps a small sack around her neck. You realize this is where she must have gotten the dust she needed to miniaturize you.  Trying to avoid any more shrinking, you hold your hands up high and say \"Fine!  You win... I'm sorry.  I wish I could make it up to you.\"  She puts a hand up to her chin and skips around you, giggling \"Well... Maybe you can.  Lemme get a good look at you.\"  She paces around your body, gripping and poking at different parts of your body.  When she gets around to the front, you can't help but admire her large breasts, which gets you a strong punch in the gut.  You moan in pain and say \"Hey, come on!  I wasn't trying to look!\"  Her face gets red and she says \"Well... you did.  So maybe I should have a look too!\"  And with that, she immediately reaches a hand inside your pants, pulling back the elastic to get a look at your manhood.  You slap at her hands, and she just takes a step back, laughing.  She bites her lip seductively and says \"Well... Looks like not EVERYTHING about you is so small, now is it?  It's been a while since i've seen a man your size... I'm sure we could make a deal in order to get your height back...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the thoughts of hot, fairy sex could cross your mind, you see the Pixie's eyes go wide and she hides behind you.  You spin around to see the giant bushes in front of you rustling, as if there was a giant creature behind them.  The fairy is obviously terrified, but you are just as helpless to do anything if something that big comes to get you!  What was waiting behind the bushes to jump out at you?</span></div></div>",

She's USED to being this size, and if something comes through those bushes that frightens even the likes of her, you know it's got to be something dangerous.  What you didn't expect, however, was a human hand coming through the bushes, pushing several of the branches out of the way.  When the giant stepped through, you could see that it was a girl, probably in her twenties, with a very skinny frame, long frizzy brown hair, and thick coke-bottle lenses.  She looked like your typical college-aged nerd, but at this size she was an absolute goddess who could kill you with one mis-step.  The pixie shakes her head and starts to cry in frustration \"No!  Not today!  Damn it, why did she have to come through here today of all days!\"  You turn around quickly and accuse the tiny girl \"You know her?  Who is she?\"  She doesn't break eye contact with the giant and explains \"She's been through the forest a few times.  I think she's a scientist or something.  She keeps mumbling about how she knows fairies are real and proving it to the world or something... and today she may have found what she was looking for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant was obviously pre-occupied as she looked down at her phone in frustration.  \"GRR... ACCORDING TO THE MAP, THE FAIRY VILLAGE SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE IN THIS PART OF THE FOREST.  THIS HAS TO BE IT... I HAVE TO START SHOWING THEM SOME REAL EVIDENCE OR THEY'LL CUT MY FUNDING...\"  You whisper to the fairy next to you \"Look, if she's that much of a problem, why don't you ... you know... shrink her down too!\"  The pixie collects herself and says \"Well... I can't.  I used too much magic to make you my size.  Making someone small takes a lot of energy, and with the powder i have left, there wouldn't be enough to do it again...\"  You start to get mad, realizing she basically wasted all of her energy making you just as weak and pathetic as she is.  \"Really?  Was i that much of a threat that you had to shrink me and put us BOTH in this position?\"  Her face goes red and she says \"Look, if you hadn't been so clumsy and stomped all over our village, maybe i would have given you a little slack.  If anything, this is all your fault!\"  You two continue to fight for a few seconds until slowly but surely, you see a shadow creep up on top of both your bodies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly turn around to see the awestruck face of the giant woman.  She can barely get a word out as she looks down at her two shrunken specimens.  \"IT... IT'S TRUE... I KNEW IT WAS TRUE... REAL LIFE FAIRIES...\"  Her face contorts into a confident, satisfied grin as she reaches out for the two of you with one hand.  \"YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME RICH, LITTLE ONES!\"  Before you can react, the pixie shrieks, pushing you away from her as she runs speedily under a large collection of flowers to avoid being captured.  You pick yourself up and follow after her, trying desperately not to be caught as well... who knows what plans this crazy girl has in store for you!</span></div></div>",

Each footfall is like an earthquake as your tiny legs manage to catch up to the fairy and the two of you hop over broken twigs and rocks in an effort to escape the giantess.  The fairy looks at you and says \"No!  I'm too tired from the running!  I'd only be able to make it a few yards before having to land again.  And besides, there's no way i could carry you at the same time!\"  You hear the giant woman getting closer as she whispers to herself \"JUST ONE OF YOU WOULD BE ENOUGH TO PROVE MY THESIS!  YOU'RE NOT GETTING AWAY FROM ME THIS TIME\"  You start to get winded when you look over and see the fairy reach for the bag containing the magic powder.  \"Please tell me you can stop her!\"  The fairy just groans in anger and says \"There's barely enough here to do anything!  I can't shrink her or teleport her, but i do have sort of a plan that will slow her down!\"  You are almost out of breath as you say \"Great!  What is it?\"  All of a sudden, the fairy leaps out in front of you and puts a hand out to stop you in your tracks.  You are confused as to her intentions until she takes the remaining powder and holds it between her fingertips.  She gets the most devilish look you've ever seen and says...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said she only needed one of us.\"  and throws the dust into your face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wipe the powder away from your eyes and start to run after the fairy, only to find that your legs seem to be failing you.  You reach an arm out to the tiny girl running away from your position and it freezes in midair.  That bitch of a fairy... she actually froze you in place!  Your emotionless face hides the horror you feel as two massive shoes slam down on either side of you and a shadow creeps over your body.  By now the fairy is long gone, lost deep in the long trees of the forest as your captor lowers her body to claim her prize.  You feel the warmth of the giant scientist's hand as it closes in around you, trapping you in meaty, trunk-like fingers.  Through the hot, sweaty skin you hear the woman whisper \"FINALLY.  I GOT ONE!\"  You feel the power slowly return to your limbs and with much effort and ferocity try to fight the giantess from within her fist.  She ignores your struggles and continues stomping through the woods until she comes back to her bag which she dropped in pursuit of the two of you.  You curse the fairy for leaving you in this vulnerable, helpless situation, and can only pray that the scientist treats you with at least a little bit of care.  She opens her palm, exposing you to the light, which is quickly snuffed out again as her huge face peers in to get a closer look at you.  She is studying you, barely able to contain her excitement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"APPROPRIATE SIZE... TRACES OF UNKNOWN DUST AROUND THE FACE AND CHEST... NO SIGN OF WINGS, MAYBE THAT'S WHY YOU WERE SO EASY TO CATCH.  I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE ACTUALLY GOT A FAIRY OF MY OWN!\"  You scream up from the giant woman's palm that you're not a fairy, you're a human, but the entertained look on her face spells out that she can't understand a word you're saying.  \"WHAT A CUTE LITTLE SOUND YOU'RE MAKING.  MAYBE SOMEDAY I CAN LEARN TO DECIPHER IT.  BUT FOR NOW, I'LL HAVE TO RETURN YOU TO MY LAB.  I HAVE LOTS OF EXPERIMENTS PLANNED FOR YOU...\"  You feel the hand shift underneath you as the fingers curl back up into a fist, trapping you momentarily while she searches through her bag.  She uses her free hand to grab a large item and hovers you over it.  The fist releases, dropping you into your temporary home... a solid glass jar.  You are dumped rather carelessly into the container, and tumble against one of the sides, hitting your head fairly hard.  The world starts to get fuzzy and your eyes close from the stress.  The last thing you see before you pass out is the grinning, bespectacled face of the giant scientist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken what seems like hours later, still trapped in the thick glass container.  You bang on the wall in a futile attempt to get through, but the glass is far too thick.  The lid is way too high.  You are stuck there for the time being, only able to take in your surroundings.  You are atop the scientist's desk which is cluttered with papers and pencils.  Maps have been notated and circled with possible locations for fairies in the forest.  You are unable to read the maps clearly from your position, which frustrates you even further because you still have no idea exactly where you've turned up.  You take a few steps back to the center of the jar and sit indian style, trying to figure a way out of this situation.  But all of a sudden, you feel a rhythmic tapping on the other side of the jar.  You spin around to find out what's making the sound...</span></div></div>",

Came to gloat about how i'm going to be a science experiment for the rest of my life?\"  The pixie crosses her arms and says \"No, silly!  I'm here to get you out!  It was all part of the plan!  I needed her to let her think she'd gotten a fairy so i could run back and get some supplies.  No need to thank me.\"   You are fuming on the other side of the thick glass, almost throwing your entire body against the side in anger. \"Do you expect me to thank you?! You did this to me! If you hadn't shrunk me down i wouldn't have been in danger... and it you hadn't frozen me, she never would have caught me in the first place!\" The pixie just rolls her head to the side and with the same precious smile she replies \"Maybe. We'll never know if that was the case. Maybe you would have gotten accidentally smushed under her shoe. Or maybe a frog could have swallowed you up before she got a chance to grab you.  The point is i'm here now and i'm going to get you free!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear movement from the other side of the room, and figure that's where the giant scientist is sleeping.  You whisper to the pixie through the glass \"Hurry up, before she wakes up!\"  The fairy just smirks and says \"I don't think we have to worry about that.  Before i flew up to the desk, i blew some dust into her eyes.  She'll be sleeping for quite some time.  I could just push the glass off the counter to get you out and she wouldn't hear it shatter!\"  You immediately grab the wall and say very sternly \"Are you kidding me?  That's your plan!  It'll kill me!\"  The fairy puts her finger up to her lip and says \"Hmmm.\"  Almost like she's pondering other options now that she knows you don't want to be crushed by a piece of giant glass.  She skips around the jar for a second and says \"Okay then.  New plan.  Because you're being so fussy about everything.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches around her waist and and pulls out another drawstring sack, similar to the one that shrunk you in the first place. The only difference is that this one seems oversized like a backpack, almost as if she had been gathering the dust for WEEKS in preperation for something like this.  She peeks in and bites her lip as she yells back at you \"Okay... I've never used this much dust before, but it should be just enough to get the job done!\" You back away from the glass in preperation as you ponder \"Enough dust? For what?\" The pixie ignores your question and takes a step back, opening the bag all the way.  She takes the dust and...</span></div></div>",

The dust seems to spread all over the jar on every side of you, and you think you see what she's planning... and don't like it one bit.  You bang on the glass as she hovers slowly around the glass, letting all the dust seep into the jar, causing it to glow brightly.  Your eyes are blinded by a shiny, magical light, and you close your eyes to try and stop the pain.  When you see through your eyelids that the light is subsiding, you slowly open them.  And when you regain your vision, you are stunned by what you see:  A massive pair of feet covered in glitter and dirt, directly in front of you. The fairy actually shrunk you AGAIN, and now you're the size of a fairy to HER!  You are suddenly thrown back in the jar as a massive hand reaches around it and lifts it slowly up into the sky.  The opening at the top is soon covered by a single, massive blue eye that darts back and forth until it comes to rest on you.  Her loud but still somewhat high pitched voice booms all around you \"WHOOPS.  HELLO IN THERE!\"  You want to scream up at her in anger, but that will have to wait because you find the container being tilted and you slam against the wall, eventually making your way up to the lid.  You shoot out of the glass prison, landing softly on a warm fleshy hand that was waiting for you.  The fairy brings you up to her massive face, and you are completely speechless.  The fairy was already a once in a lifetime site when you were brought down to her level.  Now you're about the size of her thumb and being held in her palm.  Her face holds this amusing mixture of interest, guilt, and nervousness all wrapped up into one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO UH... FUNNY THING JUST HAPPENED.  MY PLAN DIDN'T WORK OUT QUITE THE WAY I WANTED IT TO.\"  You cross your arms and shout up at the now gigantic fairy \"What do you mean?  This wasn't your plan to begin with?\"  The fairy rolls her eyes and says \"NO, OF COURSE NOT.  I WANTED TO SHRINK THE JAR SO YOU COULD JUST CLIMB RIGHT OUT.  INSTEAD IT SHRUNK THE JAR... AND EVERYTHING INSIDE IT.  THAT'S WHY YOU'RE EVEN MORE ITTY BITTY.\"  You pace around in her palm and go \"Great.  So what am I supposed to do now?  I'm a fucking speck!\"  The fairy giggles and says \"YEAH, YOU'RE PRETTY SMALL.  DEFINITELY THE SMALLEST I'VE EVER MADE A PERSON.  BUT I'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF POWDER LEFT.  MAYBE I CAN AT LEAST GET YOU AS TALL AS MY KNEES.\"  She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a small amount of fairy dust, just enough to fit between two fingers.  But at your size, it's more than enough and you feel the substance land all around you in her hand.  The fairy's eyes narrow in on you for a few seconds, until she suddenly stops and bites her lip in a very familiar manner, saying \"HMMM... OKAY THIS.... ISN'T VERY GOOD.\"  You wipe the dust off of yoru shoulders and say up to her \"What do you mean by that?  This is more than enough dust compared to the last time you shrunk me.  Why aren't I changing size?\"  The fairy looks off to the side and scratches the back of her head, obviously trying to avoid making eye contact with you as she whispers \"WELL, YOU KNOW.  YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT TODAY, AND YOU'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE DUST A FEW TIMES NOW IN SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, AND I MAY HAVE BEEN WARNED THAT AFTER TOO MANY SHRINKING SPELLS, THE EFFECTS COULD... YOU KNOW, SORT OF... POSSIBLY... Be Permanent.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes go wide with rage as you shriek up at her \"What?!  Permanent?!  You mean i'm always going to be the size of a fucking bread crumb thanks to you?!\"  The fairy bites her lip again and says \"YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.  BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE YOU'RE TOTALLY ADORABLE LIKE THAT, AND I CAN TAKE CARE OF YOU WHILE YOU'RE THAT SMALL.

HOW DOES THAT SOUND LITTLE GUY?\"  As she's saying this, she's toying with you a bit, waving her index finger, almost like one would taunt a small animal or baby.  Your rage gets the better of you and you leap up at the massive digit, biting it hard on the fingertip.  She recoils in pain and says \"OUCH!  WHY YOU LITTLE BUG!  YOU ACTUALLY BIT ME AFTER I WAS GOING TO BE SO NICE TO YOU?  I COULD JUST CLOSE MY FIST RIGHT NOW AND SQUASH YOU IN MY HAND.\"  She looks off to the side and lets off an evil smirk, saying \"BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, I'VE GOT A MUCH BETTER IDEA OF HOW TO PUNISH YOU...\" </span></div></div>",

Seeing around you noticed that were flying over a kind of giant garden, possibly you two still are in the territory of the scientist. The fairy approached one of the trees that were in the garden for make a pause. Suddenly you could hear a very loud noise, almost as deafening as the engine of a lot of cars, but soon you realize that the noise really came from a group of bees that they were flying near to the fairy, huge bees. \"<i>Oh do not worry, they will not hurting me because they know I will not do anything to them, but I could not say the same about you if you are alone around there... anyway, giggle</i>\", she said with an innocent tone as you saw pass some more of those car-sized bees fluttering near where you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage for the pause that she did for some reason, and because you can't get free to her hand (and also ignore those giant bees), you decided to ask her \"<i>umm... about this to take me at your house... I had not crushed it earlier</i>?\" You knew was make a question like this to her reminding that incident can be dangerous especially in your situation. She was looking at you with a bit serious expression but soon she smiled to you and said \"<i>That\u2019s right, previously you destroyed my house in the forest, for this reason all the faeries in the forest we have other houses but a even more secluded than there. Also, this time in your current size you can't cause any more damage, giggle</i>\", she laughed while she began to rub your head with her forefinger of her free hand moving your head and ruffling your hair. \"<i>Hey stop it...  please</i>\", you says her and she smiled at you, freeing you holding the handle of her fingers and sitting you leaning on her palm. \"<i>Sorry for that... but we are progressing! Now you say please</i>\", she said giving you an innocent look and laughing.\"<i>Well, the way to get home is longer and...</i>\" She says picking you up from your shirt and taking you to her face level, \"I<i> think than my hand can be a bit tight for you and I not want carry you all the trip there so for now...</i>\" biting her lip, \u201c<i>you travel right here</i>\", putting you between her breasts. \"<i>If you bit me here again, I will just let you fall down to the forest, understand</i>?\u201d she warns raising an eyebrow at you. \"<i>O...Okay...</i>\u201d you said a bit afraid by the idea for falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two are flying over the forest around to 20 minutes until you can see in the horizon a large tree that stood in middle to the forest, when you were closest to him you noticed how big he was, he looked incredibly large, it did not know if it was for your shrink or if the tree always was enormous. Around him was a large garden with all kinds of plants, the smell was quite soft and pleasant, it seemed like if never humans had set foot there. Once enough you approached to the tree the fairy began to flying up. You feel the effects of altitude change in your stomach. She reached a very thick and firm branch where there was a sort of hut made of leaves, branches and other things that you might find in a forest. \"<i>We have reached, little one</i>\", she said as she landed, you felt how her breasts were stirred slightly when she subtly supported his toes in the branch.<br>\r\nFrom your perspective this house, in comparison with the other house which you had previously crushed not just looks being so much larger, also it seemed to be even more firm and solid. The branch from the big tree looks quite clean and smooth, like a real furniture made by nature. You looked up to the sheets of the tree and noticed that there were a lots of branch like this but separated by a great distance and each with the same houses like the you had in front to this branch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>So... you're not the only faerie here</i>?\" you asked while you lifted your neck to can talk to her, she looks down at you and she can\u00b4t help saying  <i>\"Awww, you look really cute between in there, giggle\", </i>she continues walking to open the door \"<i>On this branch i'm the only one, the other fairies come out from time to time although is rare see them</i>\" when you enter to her home you noticed that the place was quite enlightened, like it had an electric light or something, how? no matter.<br>\r\nThere were items that seemed to be some furniture made with leaves or small boughs and other objects made by humans like spools of threads. She's taken you out from between her breasts leaving you in a kind of desktop on her room. The room had a very pleasant herbal fragrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ahhh, I'm so tired now...\", </i>she said as she jumped on her bed. She lay down on the bed with her mouth down flapping their wings slightly as she begins to stretch while flexing and extending the fingers of his hands and his feet as if she was a kind of kitten. \"<i>Almost I forgot it</i>\" she got up suddenly and walked to a place of her room, you could say it was a closet. From there she took out a small box (but for you not so small) and she walks to you \"<i>This will be your new home</i>\", she said as she placed the box beside you.<br>\r\nHonestly you don't wish to become in her pet or something so you crossed on your arms, she noticed that you're not are very encouraged with the idea so added \"<i>And don't worry my little friend, maybe I can find something that can reverse the effect of the faerie dust</i>\", you don't know if what she said was true or just was to tranquilize you, but since you did not have many options you looked with a faint smile and said \"<i>fine, I'll stay here</i>\", when she hearing this her face lit up and says \"<i>Great!, but now ... </i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe..</span></div></div>",

You feel a tingling sensation all over your body and yell down at the fairy \"What the hell was that for?  I don't have to take this!  Get out of my way or i'm going to step on you.\"  You lift your foot up and the little pixie just laughs in a high pitched tone and screams up at you \"Go ahead!  Do it!  While you still can!\"  The weird feeling gets stronger as your vision tunnels outward.  You watch in shock as the ground you're standing on seems to expand.  The trees you're standing under shoot upwards into the sky.  And the fairy... she's not so tiny anymore.  She's actually becoming human sized to you!  Or so it seems... it's actually you who's shrinking down to her stature!  When she gets to be about knee high to you, her voice starts to reach normal levels as she giggles at your plight.  And it's at that point that the glow around the fairy's body has dimmed significantly, and you're able to get a better look at her.  She was undoubtedly beautiful, even at this size, with her long red hair covering her medium sized breasts and her slightly curvy frame standing defiantly in front of you.  Your miniaturization slows down when you get to about her size, and you stare in amazement as she winks one of her big blue eyes.  \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, isn't that better?  Now you see things from my point of view!\"  You are speechless as you look down at your hands then up at the fairy and ask her \"You... you made me the size of a fucking fairy?\"  She lets out a toothy smile and looks up with her hands behind her back, almost like a child being bashful.  \"Maybe... If you don't like it I could always change your size again!\"  You throw your arms up in frustration and say \"Yes!  Of course!  I don't want to be this fucking small!  Make me big again!\"  With a slight chuckle, the fairy gathers a collection of glowing dust from around her and says before blowing the contents all over you again \"Big?  Who said anything about making you Big?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even have time to react as the dust surrounds you and the tingling feeling returns.  The fairy expands in all directions in front of you and you can do nothing but wait for the shrinking to stop.  When you get to about waist high compared to her, she crouches down and rubs a hand over her crotch, moaning and licking her lips without breaking eye contact with you.  \"MMMmm... I JUST LOVE WATCHING YOU STUPID HUMANS GET SMALLER AND SMALLER... YOU'RE ALMOST THE PERFECT SIZE TO BE MY TOY...\"  The hand she was using to tease herself is lowered onto the ground at her feet and when you find yourself at about shin height, she whispers \"HOP ON, HUMAN... BEFORE I TRY TO STEP ON YOU LIKE YOU WERE PLANNING TO DO TO ME!\"  You were humbled by the evergrowing woman, and step over her middle finger, centering yourself in her palm as she lifts it up to eye level.  The soft skin continues to grow around you and you wonder just how much littler this bitter forest dweller was willing to make you.  The now gigantic creature bites her lip and cocks her head as you dwindle down further in her hand.  You finally stop shrinking and look around the humongous palm, knowing that you can't be any bigger than a flea to the pixie.  Her giggling laughter shakes you to the core and you look up to see the giant face of your captor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOOPS!  I ONLY MEANT TO MAKE YOU INTO A LITTLE DOLL FOR ME TO PLAY WITH.  I GUESS I USED A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF THE DUST, I'VE NEVER MADE A PERSON AS ITTY BITTY AS YOU!\"  \"What the fuck did you do to me!  I'm like a bug!\"  She just laughs in your face and says \"NO YOU'RE NOT!  REMEMBER, YOU'RE THIS TALL COMPARED TO ME!  BUGS WOULD TOWER OVER YOU, YA LITTLE SPECK!  NORMAL SIZED HUMANS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE YOU AT ALL! \"  It's true.  The size was all relative.  Although she was an imposing giantess in and of itself, the truth was she was just a couple of inches tall in the real world.  You were truly insignificant standing in the palm of a fairy's hand.  She wipes the windswept red hair away from her face with her free hand and you find yourself getting lost in her pretty eyes yet again.  She extends the index finger of her free hand and you are genuinely terrified that she's going to crush you under her fingertip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's when she stops the finger's descent relatively close to you and angrily points saying \"YOU HUMANS THINK YOU'RE SO SPECIAL, DON'T YOU.  POLLUTING AND TEARING DOWN OUR PRECIOUS FOREST AND DESTROYING OUR HOMELANDS!  NOT ANYMORE.  NOW YOU BELONG TO ME AND THE REST OF THE FAIRIES.  AND SINCE YOU'RE TOO TEENY TINY TO BE MY TOY, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING I'M WONDERING ABOUT...\"  </span></div></div>",

You complied, licking along her slick fleshy folds, the taste of peppermint was strong. For some reason this aspect of fairy anatomy made sense. Soon you found yourself face to face with her massive clitoris, taking the initiative you began to nibble on it, in turn taking your new fairy goddess by surprise and turning up her sex drive ten-fold. Before you knew it, you were shoulders deep inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it up.\" she moaned. \"keep it up. keep it up!\" as she sat on a tree branch, pushing you further inside her. Not wanting to end up a stain on her foot, you keep licking and rubbing your face against her vaginal walls.

Your pause for observation was immediately interrupted by your mistress shoving you DEEP inside her, her fingers helping your task as she began to pump them in and out of her dripping sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy. Goooood boy....\" she gushed as she rubbed her burning sex upon the bark of the tree branch. The intensity kept increasing, along with the pressure, the smell of flower petals and peppermint was overpowering as the walls of her moist sex began to close upon you. The fairy was panting now, moaning in ecstasy as she approached climax. She bit her bottom lip, and fondled her large (to her and especially you) breasts as she continued to hump against the branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scream of orgasm soon heralded her release as a flood of fluids pushed you out of her dripping cunny. Finally having fresh air in your lungs, you scream as you ride the wave of sweet-tasting fairy cum, falling out...</span></div></div>",

Your whole body hurts and after taking a few gasps of air, you spit the rest of her juice out. A few mouthfuls that you had to drink while being inside her was more than enough. You look around and notice she is still laying back, eyes still closed and mouth part opened in a bliss - the gigantic fairy is ignoring you for now. Or at least gigantic to you - which makes any escape attempts pointless, there is simply nowhere you can go at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah..\" - she half-exclaims and half-moans after a while. \"Best orgasm I had.. ever...\" - you consider that strange, as you haven't done much, at this ridiculously small size.. - \"I should've gotten myself some human sex toys long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the fairy brings the hand you are on towards her face and then licks it slowly and sensually. Which is very scary to you as you think she's going to swallow you - but thankfully you are stuck to her hand after the tongue passes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best..\" - another lick, this time quicker, \"toy..\", and another, \"ever!\" - she finally exclaims. Your ears hurt a little and there's this ringing, but this time you prefer not to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy finally opens her eyes and just stares at you, smiling and even grinning over time. There's a million thoughts going through your head - should you talk? Plead for your life? Apologize more sincerely? Ask to be returned to normal? Promise never to hurt fairies.. or life again? It all seems so.. strange, that you have no idea what you should do in this absurd situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better get you somewhere more safe\" - the fairy finally adds and you half expect her to hide you somewhere on her clothing - skimpy as it is, but surely there must be some pocket or another 'safe' spot, but she just closes her hand and you are plunged in darkness created by the cavern of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything starts moving - she must be flying somewhere, you realize. You fear being thrown around her closed hand, but luckily you are still glued to her palm - by the sweet cum and some flowery scented spit.. it actually wouldn't be too bad, if it wasn't for the fact that your life is completely at the mercy of some horny magical forest creature. Magical creature? No more that ten minutes ago you wouldn't believe that 'magic' existed anywhere in the world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What if she doesn't change me back' you wonder. On one hand, becoming a dust sized sex toy for a tiny fairy wasn't one of your life plans, but it's not like you can help it at this point.. and come to think of it, it wouldn't be the worst way to go. The gipsy might have been hot, in a way.. but this fairy is an absolutely angelic beauty. The whole ordeal was so shocking that you weren't paying much attention to her shapely body and superhuman look... Come to think of it, she's not exactly human so... With the wings and this whole nature thing. If only she wasn't so feisty and.. angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you finally conclude that you have no idea what to do. Shortly after that though the flight seems to come to an end, as the movement eases a lot and you hear gentle footsteps, followed by something like.. a door opening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand you are in opens and she proclaims: \"Here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the light after being in her fist for a couple minutes, but as you look around, it appears to be some kind of small house.. or flat maybe? No, more like a single room - wooden walls with some holes for windows and simple furniture. Or rather, it seems to be a simple hole - maybe a nest hollowed inside a tree or something. You try to pull and sit up to examine it more closely, but find yourself fixed in this position, glued to her smooth skin by the sticky mix, which has almost dried up by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'giant' fairy must have noticed your attempts: \"Aww, you are so cute struggling to get off my hand\" - she comments. \"You know, all humans should be this size, maybe you wouldn't be so problematic then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou definitely do not appreciate this line of thinking, but she brings the hand back to her face, this time putting it vertically - you expect to be licked off it, but she just examines you and giggles. \"Stuck, aren't we?\" - she asks and before you can answer, she rotates the hand so it forms a ceiling above you. This time you are thankful that you are glued to the hand, as at your relative size it feels like you are a thousand feet above ground, if not more... \"Wellll... it makes it kinda 'handy' to play with you again...</span></div></div>",

YOU TRESPASSERS ARE ALWAYS SO PUNY TO BEGIN WITH, BUT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A TINY LITTLE CREATURE AT MY FEET!  SHRINK, LITTLE MAN!  SHRINK AWAY!\"  At your regular height, you only came up to just underneath her ample chest, but now she was shooting higher and higher into the skies!  She stood imposingly proud of her work as your body continued to dwindle next to her already massive body.  You finally stop shrinking and look straight ahead to see just how small you've become in relation to the powerful amazon!</span></div></div>",

You hear a feminine voice say to you \"Thank you for accepting our invitation.  Let's hear it everyone for our volunteer!\"  You are startled by the sound of applause all around you as the hand leads your woozy body up a small flight of stairs through the fog.  When you reach a flat platform, the smoke disappates completely, and you come face to face with a tall, bright eyed girl in a revealing red dress.  She holds out her hands and whispers \"Okay, stay right where you are until you hear Mrs. Rivers talk to you.  Got it?\"  You don't have time to respond before the girl faces away from you and you are shocked to see a sea of people sitting down facing you.  Are you on stage somewhere?  You must be because the girl's voice seems to be a lot louder as if being transmitted through a speaker.  \"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M PLEASED TO BRING OUT THE STAR OF OUR SHOW, THE QUEEN OF ILLUSION, THE MAGICAL MISTRESS OF MANCHESTER... PLEASE WELCOME TO THE STAGE, THE SENSATIONAL ALEX RIVERS!\"  In an explosion of confetti and streamers, a woman's body appears directly in front of you.  The crowd goes wild upon seeing their entertainment for the evening, and you wait for her to talk before moving, just like her assistant said.  She had a powerful but pleasant voice that sang in a thick british accent \"Hello, ladies and gentlemen.  How are you all doing tonight?\"  The crowd cheers again and she begins to pace around the stage.  Her footsteps were powerful and sexy, as she strutted around in her tall black high heels, pushing up her sexy fishnet covered legs.  \"Every single one of you is here because you are interested in the unusual.  The unexplained.  The... mysterious.  Well, that and some of you just came to see my outfit.\"  Some of the men in the crowd whistled at this comment, and you could see why.  Her top was a sleeveless black and white corset with a short miniskirt attached.  The outfit did little to hide her voluptuous figure, and when she turned around to face you, her huge breasts shook freely within the material.  Her pretty green eyes opened up with delight as she spotted her next helper.  She blew you a kiss and walked over to you, her frizzy blonde curls bouncing up and down just as much as her ample cleavage trying to escape out the top of the corset.  \"Hello, Sweetie.  Is it your first time in Vegas?\"  You are still a little startled from the trip and you manage to get out \"I... guess so?\"  She laughs and motions to the crowd saying \"I'll bet he's not the only one who's had a little too much to drink tonight, huh?\"  A few small cheers from the audience and then the woman goes back up next to you.  She shoots you a quick smile and says \"Tell me, stranger.  Do you believe in magic?\"  More than she could ever know.  But then again... you've seen REAL magic.  An actual being of strange mystical powers.  Her?  She was just a street magician.  She knows some tricks, sure but she can't possibly have any real power over you.  So to play along, you shake your head and say \"No.  Not really.\"  She smirks and looks back at the crowd saying \"They all say that.  Until I bring out this little baby...\"  She motions to her pretty assistant who brings over a thin, long pine box and holds it open for her employer.  The magician makes a small appreciative nod as she reaches in with two fingers and pulls out a thin black rod with a solid white tip.  She waves it around for a second and says \"Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the very magic wand that belonged to my grandfather, the great Horatio Rivers!\"  The crowd oos and ahs for some reason at hearing that name.  You've never heard of any great magician named Horatio, so you just continue to stand dumbfounded until something interesting happens.  Rivers points the wand at you and sizes you up, closing one eye in concentration as she says \"Are you ready to see some real magic, my skeptical volunteer?\"  You just sigh and nod up and down, waiting to see what she's got in store for you.  She stands right next to you and looks out at the crowd, saying \"Ladies and Gentlemen, watch and be amazed as I take this man and make him...</span></div></div>",

You smiled a bit from the sensation, but that smile quickly turned into a gasp of surprise when the magician appeared to get taller and taller before your eyes.  The crowd gasped in amazement as well, as they watched the skeptical volunteer on stage turn into a midget right before their eyes.  The tall woman smirks and lowers her wand, allowing the magic spell she held over you to cease.  When all was said and done, you were a paltry three feet tall!  You couldn't move out of fear, knowing that this woman was truly magical and could do anything to you at that size!  You were nothing but a child in her presence, and she laughed out loud, obviously basking in the success of her trick.  The audience roared with applause as you stood dumbfounded in the presence of an amazon.  She stood right up next to you and motioned to the crowd saying \"WELL, WELL, LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S A LITTLE BIT SHORTER THAN WHEN THE WALKED IN HERE, AREN'T THEY?\"  She lowers a hand down on top of your head and lets out a tisk tisk sound saying \"I KNOW A LOT OF GIRLS SAY THAT SIZE DOESN'T MATTER, BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A LIMIT, AM I RIGHT?\"  The crowd laughs out loud and you try to push her hand away, embarrassed at your current situation.  She puts her hands on her hips and says \"AWW, HE'S A GRUMPY LITTLE SHRIMP, ISN'T HE?  MAYBE WE SHOULD TEACH HIM ANOTHER LESSON IN TREATING BIG PEOPLE WITH RESPECT!\"  Your heart jumps up into your throat as you see her whip the wand out again and point it at you.  She continues to tease and berate you as she waves the wand around again.  \"PITY.  MY ASSISTANT OVER THERE SAID YOU WERE PRETTY CUTE, AND AT THAT SIZE, I THINK YOU\"RE JUST THE RIGHT HEIGHT TO GIVE HER A... SPECIAL KISS?\"  Her pretty assistant starts to blush a bit, but plays it off for the crowd and giggles at the joke.  \"BUT I THINK THESE GOOD PEOPLE CAME TO SEE A SHOW THEY'D NEVER FORGET, AND IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE EVEN SMALLER!\"  You turn your attention back to the imposing magician, who's hair began to blow back behind her head as she winked down at you.  With a slight satisfied chuckle in her voice she whispered down to you \"YOU'RE DOING GREAT, SWEETIE!  HERE COMES THE FINALE!\"  How small does she make you this time?!</span></div></div>",

You couldn't have been more than 5 inches tall!  The sandal-clad feet of the giant woman re-positioned so your shrunken body was in between them, and a shadow cast down on you which could only mean that Alex was bending down to pick you up.  Over the roaring applause of the audience, you could make out the giantess's booming voice as she giggled in delight saying \"STAY STILL HONEY.  I DON\"T WANT TO SQUEEZE YOU TOO HARD WITH MY FINGERS.\"  Not wanting ANYTHING like that to happen, you juts allowed yourself to be picked up by the oversized hand of the magician, and you soon found yourself being lifted up towards her pretty (if not incredibly magnified) face.  Her grip was much gentler than you were expecting and found yourself almost secure being doll sized in this woman's soft hands.  With a quick smirk she whispered down onto you, her minty breath washing over your tiny body between her thumb and forefinger.  \"MOST LITTLE MEN FAINT THE FIRST TIME THEY ARE EXPOSED TO MY MAGIC.  YOU'RE A SPECIAL LITTLE GUY, AREN'T YOU?\"  You just shrugged your shoulders at the giant, taking into account that maybe your experiences with the gypsy have rendered you a bit more experienced to the \"strange and unknown\" that Alex made a living off of.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says louder now so the audience can hear her, \"THANK YOU, SWEETIE!  YOU HAVE BEEN AN EXCELLENT VOLUNTEER!\"  She brings you up to her giant mouth and puckers her lips together, covering your whole top half in a quick, wet kiss.  You spit some of her lipstick and saliva out of your mouth and try to wipe off your face as you dangle helplessly from between her fingers, when she lifts you up a little higher to present to the audience.  \"NOW, I CAN THINK OF MORE THAN A FEW THINGS THAT I'D LIKE TO DO WITH A SIX INCH MAN, BUT MAYBE SOMEONE OUT THERE WOULD RATHER GO HOME WITH MY LITTLE HELPER?

When the shrinking had finally stopped, you were slightly smaller than an inch tall, running for your life from the curly haired goddess!  Her laughter booms through the air as she stomps behind you, giving chase.  \"FEE, FI, FO, FUM!  THINK YOU CAN ESCAPE?  DON'T BE SO DUMB!\"  You almost run out of breath when her giant foot slams down right in front of you, knocking you backwards.  You find yourself looking up at the absolute goddesses that are Alex Rivers and her assistant Anna, and can do nothing but put your arms up in a feeble attempt to protect yourself when Alex reaches down for you with her thumb and forefinger.  \"COME HERE, MY MICROSCOPIC ASSISTANT!  MAMA ALEX WILL PROTECT YOU!\"  The crowd oo's and ahs as you are lifted up into the air, in full view of the camera, with your tiny body wriggling between Alex's huge fingers being displayed for all to see on the projection screen behind you.  Alex motions for her assistant to come by, who produces a small glass jar.  Alex drops you gently into it's tilted side, letting you slide softly to the bottom.  Alex lifts her arms up one more time and says \"LET'S HEAR IT FOR OUR PINT SIZED VOLUNTEER!\"  The crowd cheers again as Alex takes a bow before her audience.  You are held safely in the jar kept by her equally giant assistant, who up close is still just as beautiful and cute as you remember before your size changing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex goes into her exit schpeal, asking \"DID EVERYONE HAVE A GREAT TIME TONIGHT?\"  The crowd answers with another round of applause, and Alex says \"THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH, I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME.

To the audience's amazement, Alex begins to dwindle in a manner similar to you, ending up at about your size on the ground.  Anna gently bends down and picks up the older woman, dropping her into the jar alongside you.  The miniaturized woman brushes herself off as the giant girl holding your container takes a final bow before walking behind the curtain.  You both sway in the jar to the motions of Anna's legs pumping with each step, but you are taken off guard by Alex walking right up to you and giving you a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kisses you on both cheeks and says \"Well done, my friend!  You were wonderful out there!  You've been in showbusiness before, haven't you?\"  You just respond \"Umm, no not really.  But you're... you're real.  This isn't a trick.\"  She just winks and says \"As far as anyone else is concerned it's just an elaborate show with mind blowing special effects.  But the truth is that me and my assistant have been studying the mystical arts for some time now.  There's no limit to what we're cabaple of!\"  You look up and see her lovely assistant still staring straight ahead while carrying the two of you and you admit \"Yeah... i can see that... how did you get these powers?\"  Alex just stands with her arms crossed and says \"First rule of stage shows, dear.  A good magician never reveals her secrets.  Just use your imagination.\"  You know for a fact there's a variety of ways she could have come across these powers.  For example, you've already been introduced to similar magic from the gypsy at the fair.  Which could be hundreds of thousands of miles away from where you are right now!  You decide to just lay back and accept it for now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glass containing you is lifted up to Anna's pretty face as she looks in on the two of you.  She focuses on her employer however and says \"WE'RE ALMOST AT THE DRESSING ROOMS.  WE SHOULD BE IN THE CLEAR IN A MINUTE OR TWO.\"  She covers the jar up again with her hands, and within a few minutes you make it to Alex's dressing room. You are shaken around slightly as Anna closes the door to the dressing room behind her, placing the jar gently on the end of the bed.  She gets on her knees to look at the two of you and says \"I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WORKED.  LOOK AT THE TWO OF YOU, YOU'RE SO TINY!\"  Alex smiles and shouts up at her \"You did wonderfully, Anna!  You'll be doing this show by yourself in a few years.\"  Anna blushes a bit and pulls out the famous magic wand from her dress.  \"ALRIGHT.  I GUESS YOU'LL WANT TO GET BIG AGAIN.

Don't squish me now!\"  You are amazed at how lighthearted and casual Alex is taking the entire being tiny thing, even if she had done it before.  Anna slowly lifts her out of the jar and places her gently on the ground at her feet.  When she stands up she stares at the magic wand from before and says something in foreign gibberish before pointing it at the ground.  Slowly but surely, you watch in amazement as the magician Alex Winters rises back to her former height, towering over the jar containing you.  She brushes herself off and measures herself against a wall, saying \"THAT'S MORE OR LESS THE RIGHT HEIGHT.  WELL DONE, ANNA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giants embrace in a big hug as Alex says \"I FORGOT HOW MUCH ALL THAT SIZE CHANGING TAKES OUT OF ME.  DO YOU HAVE A CIGARETTE, DEAR?\"  Her assistant searches through her pockets pulling out a pack and handing her one and a lighter.  As she lights it up and takes the first drag, the assistant begins going over the specifics of the show with her.  \"WE HAD A DECENT CROWD TONIGHT.  ESPECIALLY FOR THE HOLIDAY THIS WEEKEND.  WORD MUST BE GETTING AROUND THAT WE HAVE THE BEST SHOW IN TOWN.\"  Alex laughs and says \"IS IT ANY WONDER?  WE'RE THE GENUINE ARTICLE.  AND I THINK TO AN EXTENT PEOPLE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ILLUSION AND REALITY.\"  To your surprise, her attention turns down to you as she kneels down next to the bed to look at you face to face yet again.  At her normal size, she was a fairly attractive older woman, but now that she's huge again, she is an imposing, dominant goddess.  She lets out a big toothy grin and strokes the container with her index finger.  It is truly a surreal sight as the distortion of the glass and the smoke from her cigarrette create the illusion that her face is floating in midair, almost like a special effect come to life.  She takes another puff,  saying \"HELLO DOWN THERE, SWEETIE.  YOU WERE A LOT OF HELP TO ME OUT THERE, BUT I'M AFRAID THIS IS WHERE WE TELL YOU THE BAD NEWS.\"  You had a feeling where this was going, and look up to try and get some help from Anna, but her face shows that she's seen this happen several times before.  It was nothing new to her.  \"YOU'VE HAD A GLIMPSE INTO SOMETHING WONDERFUL AND MAGICAL DARLING, BUT I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T HAVE YOU BLABBING ABOUT MY POWERS... OR MY ASSISTANT'S FOR THAT MATTER.  SO WE WON'T BE MAKING YOU BIG AGAIN.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are speechless and drop to your knees.  You bang on the walls of your glass prison and shake your hands up, pleading for her to make you your normal size.  Your efforts are met with nothing but a thunderous giggle and a condescending whisper \"THEY'RE ALWAYS SO CUTE WHEN THEY BEG.\"  She blows you a kiss and rises back up to her full height, leaving you trapped and alone in the jar.  Her pretty face hovers above the opening as she grabs something from the bed next to you.  \"DON'T WORRY, YOU WON'T BE IN THAT JAR FOR MUCH LONGER.  BYE BYE, LITTLE MAN!\"  She slowly places a lid on top of the jar, leaving you in relative silence.  It's hard for you to hear anything but the sound of your own breathing from within the glass container, with the exception of the vibrations from Alex's giant feet stomping across the room towards the door.  You are terrified that you are not only going to be trapped forever, but that you'll suffocate from the lack of air holes.  You press yourself up against the glass trying to hear Alex as she talks to her assistant.  You faintly hear Anna say \"WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO WITH THE LITTLE GUY?\"  To which Alex replies \"WE WON'T HAVE A SHOW FOR A FEW DAYS, SO WE DON'T NEED HIM FOR ANY MORE TRICKS...\"</span></div></div>",

I'VE GOT A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS ONE.\"  Before you can react to discovering that the girl is actually the magician's daughter, the jar is shaken and gracelessly carried as Anna runs from her mother's dressing room to her own.

You leave the glass container with great velocity, plummeting down onto a soft, smooth surface that you can only determine is Anna's palm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up in her hand and look at her pretty blue eyes and flawless white teeth as she cracks a joyous, malicious smile.  \"HELLO, LITTLE VOLUNTEER.

Anna, I know what you're thinking...\"  But she responds to your attempts at communication by simply inhaling and blowing a small gust of air through her puckered lips.  The wind is too strong for you to continue and you are knocked over in her palm.  Anna giggles with delight at the sight of you stumbling and says \"DOWN YOU GO!  ALL YOU LITTLE SHRINKEES ARE ALWAYS SO UNBALANCED.\"  You climb back up to your feet and point up at the giantess, not so sure how to appear intimidating when you're only an inch or two tall.  \"Listen here Anna... you and your mother made me this small, which must mean you can make me big again.  So you change me back right now!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna sighs and says  \"LOOK, EVEN IF I WANTED TO CHANGE YOU BACK, I CAN'T.  I DON'T HAVE THE WAND, AND I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO USE THAT KIND OF MAGIC WITHOUT IT.  I CAN DO OTHER THINGS THOUGH, LIKE I COULD MAKE YOU SMALLER.  IN FACT, SINCE YOU KEEP REFERRING TO ME BY NAME, MAYBE  I'LL SHRINK YOU REEEEAL SMALL.  TO LIKE GERM SIZE.\"  You can see her crack a wicked grin as her index finger starts to glow.  You hold your arms up as she slowly and methodically moves it woards you and you scream \"No, please!  I'm small enough... Goddess!\"  She recoils her finger and tilts her head saying in a sing-songy voice \"LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE FINALLY GOT WHO'S IN CHARGE, HUH?\"  You walk around the surface of her palm trying to ignore the crazy woman's taunting.  But it gets harder when she takes the nails of her forefinger and thumb and clenches the back of your shirt, saying \"AND SINCE YOU'RE MY PET NOW, YOU WON'T BE NEEDING THESE CLOTHES ANYMORE.\"  In one swift jerk, she rips the shirt off of your back, exposing your upper body.  She rolls the ripped fabric into a ball between her fingers and says \"NOW, ARE YOU GONNA TAKE OFF YOUR OWN PANTS, OR ARE YOU GONNA LET ME GRAB EM FOR YOU?\"  You are humilated but don't want to have her strip you forcefully again, so you quickly take off your pants, standing there in nothing but your underwear.  She squints a bit and says as she picks up the discarded pants \"HMMM... YOU'RE NO FUN.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carries you over to a dresser, and opens up a drawer near the top.  Among the varying colors of panties and bras, she also has in this drawer a shoebox, which she uncovers with her free hand.  She drops the clothing into the shoebox, and when you peek over the edge of her hand, you see something you're not quite prepared for.  Hundreds... maybe THOUSANDS of discarded clothing items of all shapes, sizes, and styes.  You slowly look back up at Anna's face, which is unyieldingly chipper as she closes the box and says \"JUST KEEPING A SOUVENIR OF OUR TIME TOGETHER.\"  You are almost too stunned to ask, but you decide to go for it anyway, managing to stammer out \"Are... Are those clothes from... other...\"  Anna nods and says \"MMHMM.  OTHER LITTLE MEN.  YOU GUYS DON'T TEND TO LAST TOO LONG AROUND ME.  I CAN BE A LITTLE CLUMSY SOMETIMES.\"  You can't believe how casually she's going about this, acting like this is the most normal thing in the world.  \"You're so cruel... how can a person be like this?\"  Anna just puts on a fake frown and says \"D'AWWW, SOMEONE'S A LITTLE GRUMPY PANTS AREN'T THEY?\"  Her expression immediately changes into one of stern confidence as she says \"LOOK.  YOU'RE TINY, I'M BIG.  THAT'S JUST THE WAY THINGS ARE FROM NOW ON.  SO JUST ACCEPT YOUR NEW POSITION IN LIFE, AND TRY NOT TO GET SMUSHED, KAY?\"  You are dumbfounded by this girl's psychotic attitude towards you at this size.  All you can do is look up at her and ask solemnly \"How can you do this to other people?\"  She smiles and says \"BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT PEOPLE.  NOT ANYMORE.  YOU'RE MY LITTLE PET.  JUST LIKE ALL MY OTHER PETS, YOU'RE GOING TO DO WHAT YOU LITTLE PEOPLE DO BEST.  AND THAT'S...\"</span></div></div>",

And you're even more shocked with her response:  \"YES, MOTHER.  RIGHT AWAY.\"  Yes?!  No problems at all?!  MOTHER?!  You have so many questions but unfortunately you would probably never recieve them as Alex puts on a coat and gives her daughter a kiss on the cheek.  \"I'M OFF TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE NEXT PERFORMANCE.  MAKE SURE NOBODY SEES YOU WHEN YOU DO THE DEED, UNDERSTOOD?\"  Anna nods and says \"OF COURSE.  HOW WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO IT?\"  Alex looks over at you and laughs for a bit before putting her hand on Anna's shoulder.  \"USE YOUR IMAGINATION.  I THINK HE DESERVES TO GO IN A BIT OF A CREATIVE FASHION, DON'T YOU?\"  You don't know whether you should be furious or flattered or both, but it's all coming to a head as Alex spins her body and leaves, closing the door behind her.  Anna slowly walks over to the bed and reaches a hand out to grab the jar you're in.  She effortlessly lifts up your prison with one hand and slowly tilts it while whispering \"COME ON, LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come sliding out onto Anna's waiting palm, and immediately spin yourself around to face her.  She is undoubtably beautiful even at her gigantic form, but you can't let your emotions get in the way of pleading for your life!  You beg with your hands clasped at her \"Please, Anna!  Don't do this!  Let me go and i'll give you anything!\"  Anna nonchalantly places the jar back onto the bed and closes the lid, her face unshaken by your pleas.  \"SORRY, BUT MOTHER WANTS ME TO GET YOU OUT OF THE WAY, SO THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.  IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.\"  You can tell this is absolutely not new to her.  You can't imagine how many people you'd have to snuff out yourself before you had that same look of eery disinterest in getting rid of a human being, albeit a shrunken one!  Anna holds you up to her face, just under her nose.  You can tell she's pondering her options as her eyes narrow in to focus on you.  \"LET'S SEE... SOMETHING CREATIVE.  HMM...\"  You can feel the giantess's steady breathing as she ponders what to do with the little life form in her palm.  You are only able to sit back and wait for her to pass judgement on you, as her skin is too smooth and damp for you to gain any footing, and moving around is pretty much worthless.  Her eyes light up as if she's got the greatest idea in the world, and a wicked smile forms on her face.  It's eerily similar to the one that her mother had plastered on her face when she told her to dispose of you.  It must run in the family.  \"I KNOW JUST WHAT TO DO WITH YOU.  IN FACT, I'M AMAZED I NEVER THOUGHT TO TRY IT BEFORE...\"  She raises the wand up to the side of her face and giggles, which sends shockwaves down your body.  You are surprised to see her holding the wand, you thought for sure Alex would have taken it with her!  But before you can think of anything else, Anna points it directly at you, and with pinpoint accuracy shoots a bolt of blue energy into your miniature chest.  She squeals with delight as your arms go out to your sides, and you can only wonder... just what is happening to you?!</span></div></div>",

But you can't find anything, just the normal wooden floor of the stage.  Just when you think it can't possibly get any weirder, the assistant takes a step away from you, as if to protect herself from what's happening.

You are about to say something when she waves the wand harshly shouting something in another language.  Before you can react, you are blinded by a bright white light and you feel a rushing sensation all throughout your body.

The first person to come through the curtain is the magician's assistant.  She caught your eye and smiled, giving you a hug.  \"Good job out there!  I know it must have been a little weird to be put through the trick like that.\"  You are still a little dumbfounded and say \"Uh... yeah.  I guess.  It's almost like... was that real?\"  The girl giggles and says \"I don't know what you mean by \"real\" but it's definitely amazing.  I've been learning from Miss Rivers for the past few years, and I'm still impressed by her tricks.  I have no idea how the hell she does half of the stuff on stage, and I'm right there next to her every night!\"  You two continue to have a pleasant conversation, and after a few minutes, the girl says \"By the way, I don't know how long you're in town, you said you weren't from here... but I'd like to give you my number.  Call me if you aren't doing anything tonight?\"  You take a piece of paper from her with her number scribbled on it, and she gives you a wink as the great Alex Rivers comes through the curtain.  The crew members all give her a light round of applause, which she takes a half-joking bow for.  \"Excellent work on the lighting and smoke tonight, gentlemen.  The show was a complete success.\"  She walks over to the two of you and gives her assistant a hug.  \"Anna, great job as usual.

After a second or two, the entire world around you seems to fade away, leaving only Alex River's body in focus.  \"Look into my eyes and tell me that again.\"  You find your gaze drifting towards her eyes subconciously, and although you try to respond to her, you can barely get a word out.  You don't know what she's doing to you, but you are unable to talk, or move any one of your limbs for that matter.

I'm sure you and Anna would have made a wonderful couple, but it's so hard to find a good looking man in my line of work.

All you could do was shift your eyes around in your motionless body, screaming silently for help from anybody who was around and working on the show.  Alex caught wind of this and looks in the direction of your gaze, at a construction worker taking apart her set.  \"Sir, if you could continue on that section later, that would be great.  I need to get past there for the moment.\"  The guy just shrugs his shoulders and walks away, and like that you're left alone with the powerful magician.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans in close to you and says \"You are now completely under my power.  Anything i command of you will be done without question.  Is that understood?\"  You can not stop your lips from opening and your voice from escaping your mouth as it shouts out \"Yes, Ma'am.  Whatever you say.\"  She smiles in delight at your compliance and says \"Please.  There's no need for brevity here.  You can call me Alex.\"  You immediately shoot back \"Yes, Alex.  I'm sorry.\"  She leans in close to you and says \"That's perfectly okay, my new lover.  Now let's get a little more comfortable, shall we?  Follow me into my room.\"  She kisses you quickly on your lips, and you can taste the strawberry flavoring from her lipstick.  It seems that although you can't control any of your body parts, you'll still be able to feel every sensation that goes through it.  \"Yes Alex.\"  You respond even though every inch of your inner thoughts are screaming at her to let you go and have control of your body again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs you by the hand and leads you through the sets to the other side of the backstage area, where you come across a door with her name spelled across it in fancy lettering.  There is a security guard posted outside the door and she whispers to him \"Nobody gets in for the next few hours.  Understood?\"  The guard blankly stares ahead and says \"Yes, Alex.\"  And that's when you realize that she's hypnotized pretty much every member of her staff as well!  But she obviously had different plans for you as she leads you into the dressing room and has a seat on the end of the bed.  She points at the door and says \"Shut that, would you?  I don't want any unexpected visitors.\"  \"Yes, Alex\".  You respond as you turn and quickly shut the door.  \"Latch it as well, dear!\"  You hear behind you and you shut the lock, keeping everything out.... and you in.  You turn back to face the curly-haired witch who's holding you against your will and She crosses her arms, biting her lip in thought as she says \"Well then... what should I have you do for me first?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she want your first job as her hypnotized lover to be?</span></div></div>",

The gaps and cracks in the giant woman's palm continue to get wider and longer, changing your terrain from a soft smooth bed into a rough, cracked landscape. When the light finally fades away, you are unfamiliar with your surroundings, although you know exactly where  you are.  A peach colored land mass surrounded by tall similarly colored pillars.  You can't be more than half an inch tall standing in this magical woman's palm.   You slowly lift your head up to see the massive head of this woman staring down at you.  Her bright blue eyes seem to be staring daggers in you as she keeps her hand steady, not wanting to lose her prize.  She licks her glorious lips and whispers down to you \"WELL THEN.  STILL LOOKING TO DATE MY DAUGHTER?  YOU'D BETTER HOPE SHE LIKES SHORTER GUYS, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BE ANY LARGER THAN HER LITTLEST TOE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scramble to the edge of her palm, hoping to get someone's attention, but you are far too small to be heard by anyone other than the giantess holding you.  And besides, nobody seems to be paying Rivers any mind, almost as if they've seen this thing a million times before.  You hear a loud chuckle overhead and look back up at the goddess gazing down at you.  \"NICE TRY, LITTLE THING.  BUT EVERYONE UNDER MY EMPLOY KNOWS BETTER THAN TO INTERFERE WITH ME WHEN MY MAGIC IS CONCERNED.  AND BESIDES, FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING UNUSUAL.  JUST CRUSHING AN ANT.\"  She raises her other hand above you, extending her pointer finger and slowly lowering it to your tiny frame.  You scream in fear, fully expecting her to squash you out of existance in her palm like a measley speck.  However, when the finger gets within a few feet (to your scale) of crushing you completely, it stalls.  Rivers' voice rings through the air as she whispers \"IT WOULD BE SO EASY, YOU KNOW.  LIKE WIPING AWAY A SPECK OF DIRT.  BUT I THINK YOU DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT.  YOU DESERVE A LONGER, MORE DRAWN OUT PUNISHMENT.\"  She raises the palm up to her piercing eyes, and with a long, drawn out smile she says \"YOU WANT TO BE CLOSE TO MY DARLING ANNA?...\"</span></div></div>",

You are momentarily awestruck by how clear and blue the water is, along with the pristine woodlands behind you.  This place is gorgeous!

That's when your eye catches a beautiful brunette woman sitting alone at a table.  She's reading a book and looking bored, so you decide to approach her.  \"Excuse me, miss, is this seat taken?\"  She looks up at you and lowers her eyeglasses, scanning you up and down.  With a pretty smile she says \"Sure, i don't mind.\"  You sit down and strike up a conversation with her, looking out on the other gorgeous people hanging out on the beach.  The girl scooches her chair up next to yours and continues talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Cali.  Is this your first time vacationing here?\"  You answer back \"Yeah but... i've gotta be honest I have no idea how i got here.  What is this place?\"  She cocks her head and says \"What did you just wash ashore?  This is Isl De Taille.  It's off the coast of Martinique.  Not a lot of people know about it, but it's quite the special place.\"  You can see why.  The water is crystal clear, the beaches are unpolluted and it's just all in all a gorgeous scene.  You are interrupted by a beautiful ebony woman in a bikini carrying a tray of fruit.  \"Sir, can I offer you a sample?\"  You are starving from your experiences the whole day long, and grab it from her politely.  \"Yes, please thank you.\"  As soon as she wanders away, you start to take piece after piece of the juicy sweet fruit pieces.  You are thrown off a bit by Cali's odd stare.  She's almost looking at you in amazement as you eat the snacks before you.  She raises an eyebrow and says \"Umm, are you sure you want to eat all that at once?\"  You don't think you're making that big of a spectacle of yourself and say \"Sorry, i mean it's not very filling.  And i've only had like four pieces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four p... oh my god... you don't know, do you?\"  Cali's laughter reverberates through your head and you start to feel a little funny.

She's right:  The fruit made you smaller!  You stand up in the chair, shocked at the fact that even standing up on the seat, you're still only a few inches taller than the girl and shrinking fast.  \"I'm getting smaller!  What the fuck am I supposed to do!\"  Cali holds her hands up and slowly brings them down, as if motioning for you to breathe, saying \"Just calm down.  It'll be over soon, but you did eat a lot of it.  Do yourself a favor and stand up on the table so you don't fall off the chair or something.\"  You nod your head in agreement and lean over the edge of the table, hopping over it like you were climbing atop a massive platform.  You step towards Cali on the table, marvelling at how big she's getting.  She has her elbows propped up on the table, with her hands supporting her head as she looks at you with a worried look on her face.  Her voice is getting deeper and louder as you continue to dwindle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW.  YOU'RE UH... YOU'RE GETTING PRETTY TINY THERE.\"  You roll your eyes and say \"I hadn't noticed.  Seriously, how small am i supposed to get?\"  Cali bites her lip and says \"UMMM... SEE THAT'S THE THING.  NOBODY'S REALLY SUPPOSED TO HAVE MORE THAN TWO.  AND EVEN THEN, THE SMALLEST I'VE EVER SEEN ANYONE WAS TWO FEET TALL.  YOU'RE WAYYYY SMALLER THAN THAT.\"  You continue to stare up at Cali, thinking that maybe you'll eventually shrink down to nothing on the table.  That feeling goes away however, when you see the giant girl stop growing.  She notices it too as she lifts her head off of her hands and says \"OH!  GOOD!  I THINK YOU STOPPED SHRINKING.\"  The girl looks absolutely enormous, but you're a terrible judge of how small you are just from her, so you ask her if she's got a ruler or a tape measure or something.  She looks at you like you're crazy and says \"YOU THINK I BROUGHT THOSE WITH ME ON VACATION?  NO, BUT I DO HAVE SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HELP.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches down below the table for a few seconds, and pulls up a humongous black pump.  She places it on the table and says \"OKAY, STAND RIGHT UP NEXT TO IT.\"  You stand next to the gigantic piece of footwear, smelling faint traces of the sand and sweat stuck to it over time.  Cali places her huge finger right above your head, which frightens you for a second, but her smile comforts you in this most unfortunate situation.  \"HMM.... YOU'RE TALLER THAN THE HEEL, WHICH IS THREE INCHES... BUT NOT BY MUCH.  I'D SAY YOU'RE ABOUT FIVE OR SIX INCHES TALL.  AT MOST.\"  You sigh vocally and say \"Great.  I'm the size of a friggin' ken doll.\"  Cali tilts her head and says \"WELL, NOT QUITE.  BUT STILL MOST MEN THINK SIX INCHES IS A PRETTY ACCEPTABLE SIZE.\"  You tried not to laugh at her silly joke, but her smile was just so inviting you couldn't help but feel alright with being doll-sized around this beautiful woman.  That is, until you heard another giantess approaching from behind Cali.  You didn't know how to respond so you just hid behind her shoe on the table, waiting to see what was going to happen.  The Waitress was a gorgeous asian woman with long black hair, dressed in a tight green bikini.  She spoke in broken english, but her voice was massive and domineering.  \"MA'AM.  YOU WANT ANOTHER DRINK?\"  Cali looks at the table quickly and sees you hiding, smirking at your little body under her hovering hand.  She gently reaches down for you and says \"OH, NO THANK YOU BUT...\"</span></div></div>",

HOW MUCH HE EAT?\"  Cali looks down at you and says \"WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU HAD?  THREE, MAYBE FOUR PIECES OF THE SHRINKING FRUIT?\"  You nervously hold up a hand and stick out four fingers, not wanting to lie to the waitress if it comes back to affect your re-growth in the end.  She holds a hand up to her mouth and says \"OH GOODNESS!  NOBODY EVER EAT FOUR BEFORE!  YOU LUCKY YOU DIDN'T SHRINK TO NOTHING!\"  That's a possibility?  Getting so small that  you just keep shrinking for all eternity?  You are glad it hasn't come to that but still want to fix yourself, so you wait for the waitress to leave her hand flat up against Cali's and you quickly hop from one gigantic person to the next.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCali giggles to herself as she feels you leave her fingers and puts her hand down to her side.  She looks up at the waitress and says \"TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM, AND WHATEVER FRUIT HE ATE, JUST PUT ON MY TAB.  I'LL COVER IT.\"  You start to blush a bit as you realize that the amount of fruit you ate was obviously not covered by the samples.  You don't have your wallet with you on this island, and you have NO idea what the currency is!  You say \"Uh... Thank you!  I owe you, i guess.\"  Cali blows you a kiss and says \"I'M IN ROOM 619.  WHY DON'T YOU COME BY WHEN YOU'RE A LITTLE TALLER AND WE CAN HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER!.\"  You sit down in the pretty Asian girl's palm as she curls her fingers around you to protect you and sit in a bit of an afterglow:  When this is all over you've got a date!  You are admittedly very comfortable in the waitress's hand.  Her skin is soft and smooth to the touch and there's a faint smell of soap and lavender coming off of her fingers.  She must have washed her hands quite recently.  The soft rocking of her hand from side to side as she carries you into her office is quite soothing as well.  You are almost lulled to sleep before the fingers re-open and you are brought before her pretty, gigantic face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOUR FRIEND.  SHE VERY PRETTY.\"  You agree, but don't want to seem rude so you say \"Yes, she is.  But you are very pretty yourself.\"  She smiles and says \"THANK YOU SIR!  YOU VERY CUTE IN MY HAND!  SO LITTLE!\"  You can tell that she is resisting the urge to play with you like a little doll as she sits holding you at her table.  She holds a hand up almost like she is teasing an attempt to stroke your little body with her finger, much like someone would do with a pet or a toy.  You clear your throat and say \"Uh, so.  I'm pretty small.  How do I get big again, is there a different piece of fruit I have to try in order to grow?\"  The waitress cracks a smile and replies... . </span></div></div>",

I LIKE YOU LITTLE.\"  You cross your arms in frustration and the giantess sighs.  \"ALRIGHT.  BUT YOU TOO SMALL TO EAT FRUIT.  YOU DRINK JUICE INSTEAD.  OPEN UP!\"  You see her other hand hover directly overhead, pinching the small piece of yellow and green tinted fruit directly over your tiny body.  You can see her pointer finger and thumb increase their pressure as the fruit starts to cave.  You open your mouth wide and let a torrent of sweet tasting juice wash down your throat.  After a few gulps, you feel your body start to tingle and heat up, almost like someone had placed a large heating pad on your chest.  The giantess lays you down on a chair in front of her and stands tall, watching in joy as you start to grow.  You don't make it that tall, just over a foot and a half tall standing on the chair, when the giant woman hands you a small slice of the fruit.  \"NOW YOU CAN EAT FRUIT.

You need company for tonight?\"  You politely decline her offer, saying that your friend Cali from before will be waiting for you, especially now that you've grown to your regular size.  Yumi smirks and says \"Aww, you sure?  We could have fun you and me.\"  She reaches down to the table in front of you and picks up a piece of the growing fruit, sensually licking it.  WIthin seconds, she grows slightly so that her eyes match yours, her enhanced features stretching out the fabric of her work uniform.

Room 619.\"  You make your way through an extravagent lobby and see a sign for the hallway Cali's room is in.  Before leaveing the lobby, you take a look around and notice that the size fruit is quite popular at this resort.  There are men and women of all different sizes enjoying the lounge area.  Women the size of small houses are crouched down over the checkin desk looking for their room keys.  Men are carrying foot-tall women out back towards a pool area.  And as you walk, you have to be careful to watch where you step, for fear that there may be a six-inch person scrambling around on the floor.  You finally make it to the \"600\" section and start walking down to room 619.  There is plenty of space between the doors, you can only imagine how big and comfortable the rooms must be.  You finally make it to Cali's room and clear your throat as you knock on the door twice.  While waiting for Cali to answer, you decide to look inside the bag and take stock of the fruit you grabbed.  Unfortunately in your haste you didn't ask Yumi what type of fruit she packed for you... and they all look different!  You're not sure what size you'll be if you eat any of them!  But then again you were never one to play things safe, so you decide to throw caution to the wind and take a piece in your mouth.  As soon as you bite into it, almost instantaneiously, you feel the world around you shift.  You hope for a second that you may be getting some extra height, but those hopes are dashed when you feel the towel around your waist loosen up.

She must have a permanent room in the hotel since she works at the cabana.  She walks you to her room and turns on the lights.  Almost as if she had planned this out for every single night, there are candles decorating the room, a full bottle of champagne on ice, and a table next to her bed that is just the right size for a tray of fruit.  She dumps the fruit out onto the tray, takes off her shirt and says \"Get naked and on the bed.  I go on top.\"  You are thrown back by her assertive nature but do what she says almost immediately.  within seconds you strip and lay down on the comfy bed, waiting for her to follow suit.  She takes off her clothing and climbs on top of you, her weight a little more than you originally expected since she had taken a sample of the fruit earlier at the club.  She stradles on top of you and says \"Are you ready for fun?\"  You nod excitedly, and she plucks a piece of the fruit off the table.  You ask her what she plans to do with it and she just giggles and says \"You'll see.\"  </span></div></div>",

Clearly she's not looking to end this quickly, and thinks a bit of foreplay is in order.  Yumi starts to trace her lips with the piece of fruit.  \"I'll tell you how this works\"  She says matter-of-factly as she waves the juicy fruit over your head.  \"I'll shrink for you.  Then you shrink for me.\"  You just nod in approval and she giggles, popping the sweet treat into her mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small trail of juice slides down her cheeks as she opens her mouth and takes in your rock hard dick.  She moans in pleasure as she feels the penis expand between her lips, only helped by the fruit shrinking her down inch by inch.  When it becomes too much to bear, she spits out the ever-growing appendage and lays forward, giving your chest and stomach a few teasing kisses.  She is losing height rapidly, and by the time you feel as though you're about to explode, she is just a half a foot tall, almost matching the length of your erect cock standing at full attention.  \"Such big man... with big cock...\"  You hear Yumi's tiny voice squeak out as she slowly traces her hand around the shaft and hugs it in close to her.  Using all her arm strength, she moves the shaft up and down, resting her face on the tip of your dick and running her tongue across it with the most minuscule of licks.  Her little legs are hard at work too as she is using one of her feet and rubbing it sensually against your balls.  \"Come for me big man, I so little for you.  You come for little me now!\", Yumi says as she tirelessly goes to work on your privates.  You've never felt a sensation like this as you release all your pent up arousal, and explode onto the tiny girl.  She squeals in delight as a fountain of cum shoots out and covers her body.  The two of you lay back in a moment of ecstasy, you having experienced one of the best orgasms of your life, and her having conquered the sexual desires of a living, breathing giant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay in the bed motionless from the experience, you feel her climb off of your thighs and pace across the bed, using a well placed hand towel to wipe your load off of her doll-sized body.   When she feels she has freshened up enough, she walks over to the bowl where she kept the fruit, and with great effort managed to lift a waist-high piece out of the container.  You instinctively go to grab it from her but she shouts up at you \"No!  No, i feed you!  It part of the game.\"  You put your hand back to your sides and can't help but laugh as she struggles to climb up your fingertips, down your arm and onto your chest.  The teeny tiny woman then holds the fruit above her head and in her high pitched voice demands \"Open your mouth now!\"  You comply and she launches the snack directly into your mouth.  You don't even hesitate to chew as you feel the juice shoot down your throat.  Yumi giggles as the ground beneath her shifts, your body already starting to shrink from the power of the juice.  The only thing you probably should have gone over with her is... how small was she looking to make you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The woman before you on the bed, as well as the bed and room itself, are steadily growing in size as you shrink on the bed.  You are a little more prepared for it this time around though, and actually get to enjoy the sensation of shrinking.  When you are only a foot or so tall, you stand up and walk over on the bed next to Yumi, who is looking up at you with a huge smile.  \"You still pretty big.  But you get close to my size soon.\"  Yumi holds you close and as you drop in size, she traces her hands against your shrinking thighs and backside, until you find yourself a little above eye level with her.  When you feel as close to normal as you can under the situation, you pull her in close and the two of you kiss.  The kiss is fantastic at first and you are both definitely into it, but you have to pull away when Yumi seems to gain a small height advantage over you.  You look at her and ask what's going on, not expecting to get any smaller than this.  Yumi playfully taps her chin and says \"Well, we both small now, but i have tell you... My fruit not as strong as your fruit.  You not done getting little.\"  You realize she's telling the truth as your eyes drop down below her chin level.  The girl who's normally only about 5 foot tall to normal scale is starting to look more and more like a legendary amazon.  She puts her hands on her hips and bites her lip, eyes glued to your ever-shrinking body.  She is enjoying every second of this as you realize you're only eye-level with her thighs.  \"It was fun have you giant.  But like i say before on the beach... i like being bigger one better.\"  You start to get a little nervous and back away a bit, but Yumi catches your small motion and lifts up a foot off the bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU STAY.  I WANT TO WATCH.\"  Without warning, she presses her foot hard into your chest, and your much smaller body goes right down into the soft blanket beneath you.  Yumi presses some of her body weight onto the leg holding you down, keeping you from escaping.  \"THIS MY FAVORITE PART\" Yumi whispers down at you as you feel the foot pressed into your chest get larger with each passing second  \"WHEN BIG MAN TURN INTO TINY LITTLE MAN.\"  Her foot doesn't budge as you attempt to get it off of you, her excitment growing as your body seems to slip under the length of her sole.  Soon you find your body trapped in place as she clenches down firmly, trapping your face between her big and second toes.  You are unable to change position but your body continues to shrink, and the sensation of your body getting smaller under Yumi's feet appears to tickler her a bit.  \"HEHE... YOU FEEL FUNNY UNDER MY FEET, I LIKE FEELING YOU SHRINK.\"  When you feel your body finally stop getting smaller, you are a bit scared of the woman, as you were the first time you were this miniscule in her presence.  And it doesn't help to remember that she shrunk down in size before you did, so you're even smaller than before.  She bends down and plucks your little body out from under her toes, slowly lifting you up off of the bedsheet.  You get a long, glorious look at her body as she raises up to her full height with you in tow, dangling you before her pretty face.  She giggles and leans in close to you, puckering her lips to give your little body a giant kiss.  The lips cover more than half your body height and you just lay helpless as she gives you a big smooch, leaving you speechless.  She raises her free hand underneath you and drops your body into it with a soft landing, and she coos over your tiny body in her palm.  \"YOU SO CUTE LIKE THAT.  AND JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO, I WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT IN YOUR HAND.  THIS MUCH BETTER.  AND NOW YOU PERFECT SIZE FOR ME.\"  You start to get a little worried as you sit up in her hand, staring up at her powerful, confident face.  You manage to squeak out \"P... Perfect for what?\"  Even though you know she's the size of a doll, her laugh is deep and her voice is powerful.  She smiles wickedly and says \"I SHOW YOU.\"  </span></div></div>",

So i'm stuck this small for a while, what should I do to pass the time?\"  With a slight, barely noticeable smirk, the giant asian holds you up to her eyes and says softly \"MY SHIFT OVER IN TEN MINUTES.  WHY DON'T YOU SPEND NIGHT WITH ME?\"  You are more than happy to take her up on her offer and say \"That sounds great.  Thank you.  What is your name by the way?\"  She introduced herself as Asuka, and you give her your name.  Ever the gentlemen, you walk over to the edge of her palm where her thumb is sticking up and give it a small hug, shouting up at her \"Nice to meet you!\"  She giggles at your antics and says \"AWW, YOU SO CUTE!  WE HAVE FUN TONIGHT!\"   She quickly collects herself and looks around, making sure her bosses aren't watching.  She leans in close and whispers \"I CAN'T LEAVE YOU ON TABLE.  SOMEONE MAY TAKE YOU.  YOU HAVE TO STAY CLOSE TO ME, OKAY?\"  You let your mind wander and look down below Asuka's chin, staring at the bountiful cleavage poking out of the top of her work jacket.  The green bikini she had on while you were on the beach is still visible under her jacket, and you can't help but gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka gives you a stern but playful look and covers her cleavage with her hand.  You blush a bit and hold your hands behind your back, saying sheepishly \"It was just a thought.\"  She laughs at your response and waves a massive finger before you.  \"TSK TSK, LITTLE MAN.  WE JUST MEET!  MAYBE YOU GO THERE LATER, BUT FOR NOW YOU SIT IN POCKET.\"  She holds her jacket pocket open with her free hand and tilts the palm you're sitting in towards her body.  You slide off the smooth skin and land safely in the pocket near her right breast.  It's not directly in the cleavage, but it's definitely close enough and it feels comfortably warm.  Her massive hand feels for you from the outside, softly patting you against her body through the cloth as she says \"YOU BE SAFE THERE.  YOU BE COMFY?\"  You can barely answer, you're smiling so hard.  You nod up and down at the giantess peering down at you, who lets out a hearty laugh that gives you shivers from your position.  She closes the top flap and says \"DON'T TICKLE TOO MUCH, TINY.  I FINISH UP HERE, THEN WE GO...\"</span></div></div>",

YOU EAT TOO MUCH OF FRUIT THAT MAKE YOU LITTLE.  GROW FRUIT NO WORK ON YOU NOW.\"  You can't believe this!  She's saying you'll be small forever?!  But she's still playing with you, toying with your little body in her hand.  You try and push her massive fingertip away from your torso, but she just pushes gently, causing you to fall backwards into her palm.  You scream up at her \"Wait!  Stop it right now!  Why are you smiling like that, if I'm stuck like this forever?\"  She tilts her head slightly and reaches down below her desk with one hand, revealing a small, handmade mouse cage.  \"BECAUSE NOW YOU STAY WITH ME.  NOW GET IN CAGE!\"  The fingers of her hand tighten around you, giving you very little room to breathe, let alone move.  She compresses tightly on all sides, not allowing you to escape as she opens the top of the cage with her free hand, slowly depositing you inside.  When you hit the bottom of the cage, she wastes no time in locking the top door yet again, sealing you in her small metal prison.  The giantess peeks in on you through the bars, giving you an even deeper sense of dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AWW, YOU SO CUTE AND HELPLESS.  JUST LIKE THE OTHER MEN I FIND.\"  You bang on the bars of the cage and look up at the beautifully evil captress holding you in her hand.  \"You said you never saw anyone as small as me!  You said you could help!\"  She just runs her nails across the side of your cage, clanging every bar along the way.  She is clearly toying with you and relishing your current situation.  \"OH, THAT JUST A LIE.  I SEE LOTS OF TINY MEN LIKE YOU.  I JUST WANT YOUR PRETTY FRIEND OUT OF MY WAY.\"  She gently places the cage down on the table, keeping a small cloth over the cage which hides you from view.  You sit down on the floor of the cage and cross your legs indian style, thinking of how you can possibly get out of this situation.  You stay that way for what seems like hours until light floods back into your prison.  The waitress's giant face comes back into view and with a warm toothy smile she says \"MY SHIFT OVER.  TIME TO TAKE YOU WITH ME!\"  She places a single hand around the container and effortlessly drops it into her waiting purse.  Before she closes the bag up, you scream up at her \"Where are you taking me?\"  She looms over you and smiles as she says...</span></div></div>",

You are plucked out of the relative safety of the giant's purse and deposited softly into the palm of her hand.  She smiles down at you as you look around and see a basic beachfront hotel room, only massively magnified.  She is sitting on her bed indian style holding you out in front of her. \"YOU IN MY ROOM NOW LITTLE MAN.  YOU NEWEST PET IN MY COLLECTION.\"  You nervously manage to stammer out while looking up at her deceptively innocent smile \"C... Collection?\"  She points down next to her on the bed, and right beside her is a small shoebox.  The box has some strange Japanese writing on the top in red marker, and the sides look old and beat up.  She lowers her hand down to it and starts moving it around slightly with the tips of her fingers.  With every tap and stroke she gives the box, you can hear a faint sound of miniature voices, just as puny as yours, screaming to be released.  You gulp hard thinking of how long she's been keeping people for herself from the beach, and why nobody has caught her yet.  \"I HAVE SO MANY PETS.  YOU DEFINITELY ONE OF THE SMALLEST THOUGH.\"  She takes her hand off the box and brings it up to your face, poking and prodding at you with her index finger.  \"YOU SO SMALL, BUT I FIND GOOD JOB FOR YOU WHILE YOU WITH ME.  MAYBE YOU CLEAN MY SHOES!  THEY GET SO DIRTY ON THE BEACH AND YOU SO SMALL YOU GET IN CRACKS AND CLEAN THEM REAL GOOD!\"  You have just about had enough and strike with your forearm at the giant woman's invasive finger.  She recoils in surprise more than pain and tilts her head as you unload on her.  \"I'm not going to be your pet!  I'm a fucking person!  Now either you change me back to normal or take me to my friend from the beach, you giant crazy bitch!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faux innocence that once plastered her face shifted suddenly into an annoyed, angry expression.  As quick as you can imagine, her extended pointer finger knocks you over effortlessly.  She presses it on top of your body and you scream as you feel the pressure increase as she pushes down on your torso.  Her head looms in overhead and she narrows her gaze as she whispers \"YOU... CALL ME.... BITCH?\"  You are petrified as you lay helpless under her finger, watching in horror as she brings you closer to her face, breathing heavily onto your little body.  Then to your surprise, her mouth breaks into a perverse smile.  A wicked, sadistic grin.   \"YOU SO SMALL, BUT YOU HAVE SUCH BIG MOUTH.  MAYBE... YOU NOT SMALL ENOUGH.\"  She releases the pressure on you and you gasp for air in her palm as she digs through her bag's front pockets.  She pulls out a familiar green shape... the fruit that got you this small in the first place.  You start to push yourself backwards in fear as she dangles it over your little body.  You hold your hands up and scream up at her \"You said the fruit couldn't change my size anymore!\"  She laughs at your pathetic squirming and says \"HEHE, NO LITTLE MAN.  I SAY YOU CAN'T GET BIG.  YOU CAN STILL GET SMALL.  I SQUEEZE THIS FRUIT ON YOU, YOU GET COVERED IN JUICE.  YOU SHRINK SO SMALL I CAN'T SEE YOU.\"  You can't imagine the horror of shrinking down to the size of a speck in this crazy woman's hands, and you see a small drop of juice fall off of the sliver of fruit and land on the bed between the giant's legs on the bed.  You switch positions so that you are on your knees and clasp your hands in front of your body and say \"No!  Please don't shrink me again!  I'm sorry!\"  She pulls the piece of fruit back towards her own body and \"YOU SORRY YOU CALL ME BITCH?\"  You nod your head up and down shouting Yes as loud as you can.  She lowers the fruit back down to her bag and holds you in front of her eyes.  With the utmost seriousness she says \"I NO BELIEVE YOU.  KISS MY HAND.  CALL ME GODDESS.  YOU DO THAT, I FORGET YOU CALL ME NAMES.\"  She eagerly waits to see what you do as you bend down on all fours and lower your lips to the soft, warm skin of her hand.  A loud chuckle indicates that she is pleased by watching the tiny man submit to her, just like all the others do... Or do you have a little fight left in you?</span></div></div>",

YOU SO CUTE KISSING MY HAND.  I TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU.  MAYBE WE HAVE FUN TONIGHT, AND I LET YOU SLEEP IN MY SHIRT.  WOULD YOU LIKE THAT?\"  As tempting as that offer is, you really don't feel like living the rest of your life under a giant Asian woman's thumb, and decide to take action.  The next time she places her finger near your head, you reach for it with two hands, which elicits a giggle from your captor.  \"HEHE, OKAY.  YOU KISS MY FINGER TOO.  SO CUTE.\"  With the giantess' guard down, you assert yourself by sinking your teeth into the extended finger, biting down hard.  You don't expect it to do much, but the finger snaps back almost immediately, with a booming \"OW!\"  piercing your ears.

I CRUSH YOU!\"  Everything starts to move in slow motion as the giantess's massive free hand flattens above you and starts to shoot towards you.  She's going to smash your insignificant body between her palms unless you do something drastic!

The fall takes a lot out of you and you lay flat on your back trying to regain just a little bit of stamina.  You don't have long to catch your breath though, as your sky is overcast by a massive shadow.  Yumi's large head blocks out the light from the ceiling fan above, casting a dark presence down on your minuscule body.  She shakes her head slowly in disapproval as her hand raises just above you.  \"YOU BITE ME LIKE A BUG.  MAYBE YOU NEED TO BE MORE LIKE BUG.  LITTLE LIKE BUG.\"  Before you can even react, the hand moves in close to you and you can see that she is holding on to something small and dripping wet.  She presses her massive fingers together, closing in around the piece of fruit she was holding, causing a cascade of brightly colored juice to drop down on your tiny body.  With your mouth still open in an attempt to take in some air, you can't close it in time before a large amount goes through your lips and shoots down your throat without any sort of resistance.  You instinctively roll out of the way of the sweet flavored waterfall, but you realize as your vision shifts that it's too late.  The grain in the wood you're standing on becomes more detailed and vivid.  The space you're occupying seems to spread outward at a rapid pace.  You know for a fact she's shrunk you a second time.  And you don't really get a good view of just how insignificant you've become until the gigantic woman places a finger down next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's pressed her finger down onto the desk next to you, with her unpainted nail facing you.  The jagged edges by the tip indicate that she bites her nails, and ever impression is just about as large as you are.  The nail itself is almost twice  your size.  You figure she can't have made you more than a quarter of an inch tall.  Just an ant on her countertop.  You can barely bring yourself to turn your body slightly as her planetary head makes it's way down towards you, eyes wide in response to what she's just done.  \"WOW... YOU GET SO TINY...\"  Every sound she makes reverberates in your head like a drum, and every breath she takes blows you back slightly in her wake.  She is truly a goddess and you are a speck compared to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it\u2019s almost as if she doesn\u2019t know what to do.  A man roughly the size of a flea stands before her, completely powerless to stop her whims.  To your horror though, she snaps out of her stunned look, and instead changes her expression to one of pure joy.  She smiles wide with a cockiness that shakes you to your very core.  It seems to be hitting her now just how much strength she has over you.  \"I NEVER MAKE SOMEONE AS SMALL AS YOU.  YOU ARE LESS THAN A BUG\u2026 I NEVER FEEL THIS BIG COMPARED TO ANOTHER PERSON\u2026\u201d  She bites her lip as she starts to sway a bit, keeping her finger glued to the table in front of you.  You feel it\u2019s for fear of accidentally knocking you over, but you also think she may just love taking in the sight of seeing someone so pitiful standing next to her fingernail.  She narrows her gaze on you and says \u201cTHIS PUNISHMENT SUITS YOU.  YOU ACT ALL BIG WHEN I HAVE YOU IN MY HAND, BUT NOW YOU SMALLER THAN ANYONE ON THE ISLAND.  MAYBE EVEN THE WHOLE PLANET.  NOW I THINK YOU RESPECT ME.\"  She glances down at the hand clutching the dehydrated piece of fruit, some of it still dripping from her fingertips and she lets out an earth shattering giggle.  \u201cIF NOT\u2026 I JUST GET MORE FRUIT.  SHRINK YOU TO NOTHING.\u201d  As if the words weren\u2019t powerful enough, She gently lifts her finger off the countertop and slams it back down with minimal force.  The simple action was enough to cause a wall of force to come flying at you, almost knocking you off your feet.  The goddess above you grins at how insignificant you are, and she lowers her whole body down to get a better look at you.  It\u2019s like watching  amountain cave in on itself as she presses her face against the edge of the counter, and your miniscule form still has to force itself to stare upwards to look at her eyes.  The asian behemoth shows her teeth with a wide smile before a deafening whisper covers you\u2026 \u201cI\u2019M YOUR GOD NOW.  WORSHIP ME.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

THE BIG BAD FIVE-FOOT-TALL WAITRESS IS GONE NOW.\"  You are a bit embarassed and say \"Sorry, I just didn't know how to handle that.  She was so big!\"  Cali rests her hands on top of each other, laying her chin atop them both to look at you closer to your level.  \"WELL, THAT'S WHY PEOPLE COME TO THIS ISLAND.  IT'S FUN SEEING PEOPLE AT ALL DIFFERENT SIZES.  I DON'T THINK I'D WANT TO SEE THINGS FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, THOUGH.  I PREFER LOOKING DOWN ON MY GUYS.\"  You sit indian style, half-amazed that you're still talking to this gorgeous woman who's the size of a skyscraper.  Every movement she makes turns you on.  Every turn of her head followed by a cascade of red hair.  Every word that she speaks in a deep, powerful voice.  And every smile she makes that just warms your heart.  You can't help but say out loud \"I kind of like things from down here.  There's a lot to admire.\"  Cali smiles and says \"SUCH A TEENY LITTLE GENTLEMAN.  WELL, IF YOU STICK AROUND WITH ME I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND PLENTY OF THINGS TO STARE AT.  BIG AND SMALL ALIKE.\"  You knew it now.  You were completely in love with this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCali's eyes widen a bit as she raises a massive hand over you, softly covering you in one quick motion.  You hear commotion on the table around you, but the sound is muffled by the soft skin of Cali's hand which is covering your ears.  You are so comfortable and protected in this state, you almost hate when she removes her hand a few seconds later.  She makes a guilty face and says \"SORRY, I DIDN'T NOTICE HER COME BY WITH THE CHECK... BUT SHE ALSO BROUGHT SOME GROW FRUIT, CHECK IT OUT!\"  You walk over to her plate, and see a massive, multicolored fruit cut into convenient slices.  Well, they'd be convenient for a normal sized person.  Each sliver seems to be longer and wider than the height of your entire body.   You shout up to Cali incredulously \"How big can this make someone?\"  Cali scrunches her nose and says \"I'M NOT REALLY SURE.  THE TALLEST I SAW ANYBODY HERE WAS ABOUT FIFTY FEET TALL.  THEY WERE STOMPING ON BEACH CHAIRS AND TREES AND EVERYTHING.  BUT I THINK YOU CAN GET EVEN BIGGER THAN THAT.\"  Wow, there were a lot of possibilities on this island, and you wanted to try them all!  You approach Cali and say \"Not that i haven't enjoyed being small or anything, but my neck kind of hurts from looking up at your face this whole time.  Could i have some of that fruit now?\"  Cali lets out a low belly laugh and says...</span></div></div>",

The water is crystal clear, and while the jungle behind you is definitely vast and dark, there is easily enough room on the shore for you to avoid it for the time being.  So you just sit down in the sand and stare out into the ocean, enjoying the breeze.  You close your eyes and breathe in the fresh air thinking \"Okay... this is kind of nice and all but... how the hell am I going to get home?\"  You hold your arms out to the world expecting some sort of sign, but instead you are greeted with a sharp pain to your foot.  You immediately look down and see some movement.  Expecting a bug or a crab of some kind down there, you sweep your hand down to knock it out of the way.  But upon touching the offending object, you realize that the small creature is warm and soft to the touch.  You pinch at it with your thumb and forefinger, and bring it up to your face.  Your jaw drops as you see that the creature attacking you is not some bug or rodent... it's a woman!  A tiny naked woman, no more than three inches tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl is admittedly very cute at that size, with long, black hair and smooth brown skin.  She is obviously indiginous to the island, and you wonder if everyone else is this tiny to you.  You also see that she's clutching a long hand-made spear, which you effortlessly flick out of her puny hands.  She is furious at the loss of her weapon and screams at you in the most adorable high pitched screech her little lungs can muster.  \"Put me down, you giant, ugly beast!  Release me at once!\"  You laugh at her bravado as she visiously swipes at your face even from her position dangling between your fingertips.  You shake her around for a minute, momentarily disorienting her as you say \"Oh yeah?  Well I didn't appreciate Why don't you make me.\"  You are enjoying the power you have over the tiny girl, when all of a sudden you hear a faint chant grow closer.  Other, similarly miniscule voices are singing in unison \"Kill the beast!  Kill the beast!  Kill the beast!\"  You look around you to see that you are surrounded on all sides by tiny women!  All of them are brandishing small, primitive weapons and aiming at you.  You look at the girl in your hands and say \"Oh, you've got to be kidding me.\"  The girl just smiles and says \"You asked for it... Get him, girls!\"  </span></div></div>",

You're asking for it, you little nothings!\"  You raise your foot to step on some of the women, just to scare the rest into letting you escape, when you realize the girl in between your fingers seems to be growing in size.  Can the women here change their height whenever they want?  No, it can't be because the surrounding area, the trees, even the grass appear to be rising up around you.  The woman in your hands giggles and says \"Well, well.  Looks like someone should have been nicer to the little 'nothings' by his feet... How does it feel to lose your height so quickly?\"  The woman has grown to the size of a large doll now, and you hold her tightly in between two hands.  \"What is going on?  Why am I shrinking?  Answer me or i'll squeeze the life right out of you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amazon dismisses your threats and brushes her hair aside, confidently shouting up at you as you dwindle down \"Just because we are smaller than you, did you think we are so helpless?  We have survived here for hundreds of generations because we know the secrets of this island!   The fruit that grows from these trees has the power to turn even the mightiest of warriors into the smallest of ants!  And we have coated all of our weapons in the juices that these fruits contain!  So every stab you took on your foot while you were a giant is taking its' toll on your size right now!!\"  After a while, the shrinking rapidly occurs, and you find yourself unwilling to hold the amazonian woman growing in your arms.  You drop her, watching in amazement as a trio of equally scaled women rush to formation, catching her effortlessly.  You look at the cheering group of women, hoping you'll stop shrinking soon.

Realizing you're on a beach, you take advantage of your size while you still have it and dig your toes deep into the sand.  In one swift motion, you kick up a flurry of dust, temporarily blinding the girls as they raise their hands up to block the infiltrating dirt and dust from entering their eyes.  In the whirlwhind, you sink slowly into the cloud, hoping to run away from the mob in their confusion.  Still disoriented from the feeling of shrinking, you attempt to walk through the crowd, only to stop just short of a horrifying site.  A set of five brown toes half buried in the sand.  They are clenched into each other, as the giant woman before you attempts to stand her ground amidst the dust storm she's battling.  The shrinking didn't take very long:  You are only a few inches tall compared to this woman.  Which is pretty amazing considering she was the size of a doll not more than a minute ago.  You don't even dare think of what a normal sized human would look like from your scale.  The nubian giant before you looks around confused and says \"DID HE GET AWAY?  OR DID HE SIMPLY SHRINK INTO NOTHINGNESS BEFORE US?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and run in the opposite direction, and just as before find yourself face to face with a wall of flesh.  This time though, you fail to stop before hitting it, and make contact with the dry, sandy skin of a similarly dark skinned foot.  Faster than you can comprehend, It instinctively moves out of the way and you see a large five-pronged shadow raised overhead.  You scream in terror and dash quickly to the side as the woman's massive hand slams down onto the sand where you were just standing.  \"DAMN!  I FELT SOMETHING SMALL RUB UP AGAINST MY TOES!  HE MUST BE TRYING TO ESCAPE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudging through the sand amongst a forest of darkened skin, you attempt to maneuver between the massive feet of these miniscule women, as a familiar voice booms out behind you.  The woman who you were just holding in your hand, now standing as tall as a downtown skyscraper, gives out a mighty laugh and shouts \"AHAHA!  LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A RUNNER!  LOOK TO YOUR FEET, SISTERS... YOU MAY FIND A BUG OF A MAN UNDER YOUR HEELS!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the women are all looking down, you know your next action has to be a smart one.

It was so far away and you would get caught. What other options do you have? Looking around up to them, they were so big and the dust was coming down. Climbing them and hiding there would not be an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne long time, you think about it and decide to bury yourself in the sand. Getting down and moving some around. Only for another problem to arise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, it was grains of sand. Their size it was pebbles of sand. At yours, it was rocks of sand. So you had more trouble moving them out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing heavy rocks over you and covered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it was over, as you were hidden ant the dust was gone. Holding your breath, you could hear all of them talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, where is he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s that man beast!

You understand though, given your size that you are so small compared to her and you were carrying. Fantasy revenge right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you stayed there and heard massive footfalls around you. They were all looking for you, but you were not moving. You would rather get stepped on them running and being found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich funnily is how it goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the giantess woman was searching for you, and stepped down onto the place you were hiding!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not ready for this, as you could not see it. Not even when it hit you for a long while as you get destroyed. Her foot powered over you as you feel yourself go out in a second. It was like a piano dropping on you, and you could not hope to stay conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, your body ached and hurt. You feel pain surge through your body as you had to lift yourself up. Lifting yourself up as you get the rocks over you, until you remember the giantess situation and jumped back down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhiding and being afraid, wondering if they were still searching for you. None of them were though, as you heard no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising you looked around at the beach that you8 once towered over. They were all gone. It must of been later in the day or something, cause no one was on the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief about it, a smile on your face as you were very happy about it. You somehow survived, your buried idea not only worked, but worked we-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw!\u201d you cut yourself off, gripping your back. That was maybe not the best plan, but you survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow what? What can you really do at the moment. Small, on an island you\u2019ve never been as public enemy number one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is more accurate than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear footsteps and get down, hiding under the rocks of sand even more as you see more giant woman come into view. Two of them if you were being exact. One had long blonde wild unkept hair, and was wearing old fashion garb. If you were being hones it was more like a bikini rather than the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman had darker skin, and black hair which looks like to be combed. It wasn\u2019t long hair, but it was down to her neck. She wore the same outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the girls looked so giant, and you were a little scared. The blonde was holding a spear, so that worried you some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she going to be hunting for fish? That seems really stupid, they would be big compared to her, even the guppies. On the other side, her size would make sure she would get plenty of food from even the smallest of fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for coming Aisha, can\u2019t carry my catches by myself.\u201d The blonde said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Toka. I\u2019m not going in though, I still remember last time I went in and a crab almost got me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, I shrunk and stepped on that crab. I had it handled.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t feel handled, I can tell you that.\u201d Aisha laughed and joked. They seem to be good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of shrinking, did you hear. The warriors shrunk a giant man on the beach recently.\u201d Toka the blonde said, as you interest went up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I heard about that. What was a man doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno, but they shrunk that bastard down. Wish I could see it.\u201d Toka said as you were not liking her. \u201cI love it when big things get shrunk down to nothing, it\u2019s always so great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink about it. They are so big, and now they are nothing. Same thing would be going for the man. You know... they said they didn\u2019t catch him. He might be scurrying around the ground under us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be honest, I hope. I mean, it\u2019s the first man to be here in so long! I kind of hope to meet him, and well, who knows. Maybe the warriors were wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you have such a weird thing with them. Remembering when that giant monitor attacked the village. They shrunk it down and you insisted! You insisted on keeping it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well... I just think if we are bigger, we shouldn\u2019t be mean.\u201d Aisha said as Toka rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, I\u2019m gonna go get some fish.\u201d And with that, she walked away as you knew what you were going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAisha is the girl you want. not only does she seem nice, she has a very caring attitude. Not to mention her friend was walking to the ocean at the moment, and she was by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting the rocks out, you carry your hurt body over and closer to the giant girl.</span></div></div>",

The one on the left with the nametag \"E. DeWinn\" is taller and skinnier, with long blonde hair down to her waist.  The girl on your right with the nametag \"N. Serra\" is shorter and heavier, with short brown hair.  Both of them seem to be staring at you intently, waiting for some sort of response.  But you still have no idea where you are so you just ask what comes naturally.  \"What... are you talking about?  Who are you?\"  Both of them sigh and the taller girl says \"Did you hear that, Nella?\"  The other nods and writes down a note into her phone.  \"Sure did, Eliza.  Looks like the new compound can lead to some short term memory loss.  We'll have to scan it for future tests.\"  Eliza readjusts her glasses and says \"Well, let's see if the rest of the procedure has any negative effects.\"  You are still confused and say \"Procedure?  What procedure?\"  Nella pats you on the shoulder and says \"Here's the deal, because you don't remember.  You signed up for our three week study on mass degeneration and matter reduction.\"  You start to get frustrated and say kind of snappily \"English, please?\"  And that's when you realize that the shirt you're wearing suddenly feels a size too large.  As do your pants.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a raise of an eyebrow, this catches Eliza's attention as she says \"Nella, I hope you're taking notes again.\"  Nella types away at her phone and says \"Finally, we may have a success on our hands!\"  You are still trying to understand exactly what's going on when Eliza leans in towards you and you become aware that she's now taller than you.  \"In layman's terms, the compound  you took is going to miniaturize you.  We'll be monitoring you for the whole process, we just don't know when it will stop.\"  As you stand there amazed, your clothes get larger and larger around you, as do the two scientists staring at you with enormous grins.  Their voices get louder as you continue to shrink.  \"I BELIEVE THIS IS GOING EXACTLY ACCORDING TO OUR HYPOTHESIS, NELLA.\"  \"WELL, SO FAR I DON'T SEE ANY ADVERSE AFFECTS.  BUT WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE HIM IN HIS SHIRT.  PICK HIM UP AND PUT HIM ON THE TABLE.\"  You're only about a foot tall now, standing in the neck-hole of your shirt, and you feel paralyzed from the experience.  Not so much that you are unable to move due to the chemistry, but rather that your mind is unwilling to work on anything else until it figures out exactly what's happening as you get smaller and smaller.  The blonde crouches down over you and reaches out with a hand shielded by a blue latex glove.  You feel her fingers slip easily under your arms and lift your now naked body off of the ground and up to her chest level.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza's hand continues to grow slightly around you as it places you gently onto a metal table on the side of the girls.  They crowd around you again, their presence never losing it's impact on your diminishing body.  Eliza gets onto her knees to look at you closer, and cracks a smile when your eyes meet.  Her warm breath washes over you as she speaks, \"HE'S SO TINY ALREADY, BUT HE'S STILL SHRINKING.  HOW MUCH LONGER WILL THE PROCESS TAKE?\"  Nella gets down on Eliza's level and now you've got four massive eyes enhanced by thick eyeglasses gazing down upon you.  Nella seems to be taking a lot more precautions to hide her excitement, and says with a very stearn voice \"WELL, HE'S ONLY ABOUT 8 INCHES TALL AT THE MOMENT.  HE'LL CONTINUE TO SHRINK UNTIL HE'S SMALL ENOUGH UNTIL HE CAN FIT COMFORTABLY INTO THAT.\"  She points behind you with a massive index finger, and you follow the intended direction behind you.  You turn around to find what she is talking about and are stunned at what's waiting for you when you finally get small enough...</span></div></div>",

The girl looks to be about 19 or 20, is very skinny and has very pale skin.  She has long black hair, and a few piercings around her lips and nose.  Her arms are crossed over her black half-shirt, barely blocking your view of her decent sized breasts.  You can barely focus on that, however as you're still struggling to adapt to being transported here against your will.  You are stumbling a bit and trying to keep yourself from being too nauseous.  \"Please, I...

This place looks like a Hot Topic or something, and you've been transported right into the middle of it.  You can see where the raven-haired beauty is a bit concerned, as she thinks you're just some drunk guy who stumbled in and is looking to cause trouble.  You hold your arms up in protest and say \"Please, I just... i need a minute to think... I don't know how I got here...\"  But she isn't having any of it, and grabs you hard by the arm and twists it, saying \"I said leave right now!  Or you're going to get hurt\"  You are so out of it, you barely even realize it's happening, but almost out of instinct, you throw your arm up and send the girl flying backwards, screaming \"Don't fucking touch me!\"  You almost immediately snap back to reality in time to see the girl knocked over a clothing display.  She lets out an aggrivated scream and stands up on her own, screaming \"That's it!  I warned you!\"  You try to apologize, but you get an awful feeling brewing deep inside your gut.  You feel sick as you drop to your knees and see a strange black aura surrounding your hand and arm as you hold it in front of your face.  You look up for a second and see the girl looking deeply into your eyes with a wicked look as she holds up her hand aggressively.  Her hair is flowing freely behind her, almost as if it's being held up by some unknown force, and when she twists her hand slightly, you feel the pain in your stomach getting stronger.  She walks right up next to you and says in a booming voice \"YOU LIKE TOSSING WOMEN AROUND?  I'M GOING TO ENJOY WATCHING YOU SHRIVEL AND SHRINK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel her black magic surrounding you as you feel it taking hold on you.  You wonder how it is that everyone you manage to accidentally upset turns out to be an all-powerful practitioner of the dark arts, but you're too terified to think about it too much.  You look up from your panicked state to find that you're eyes only come up to her breasts and you're sinking to the ground at an alarming rate!  \"THAT'S RIGHT, WORM.  SHRINK FOR ME.  FEEL MY MAGIC INVADE YOUR BODY AS YOU GET SMALLER AND SMALLER.\"  You can't do anything against this ever-growing woman except recoil in pain and wait for the shrinking to stop.  When you finally do, you look straight ahead to see her gigantic black boots tapping against the hardwood floor, each movement sending a frightful shockwave through your little body.  You slowly trace her long legs up to her face, which is almost obstructed by her massive breasts and crossed arms, but she leans forward to get a better look at you, casting a shadow overhead as she does so.  With an uncaring smirk, she bends her knees a bit and whispers \"JUST WHERE YOU BELONG.  LESS THAN THREE INCHES TALL, COWERING BENEATH ME.  GET USED TO THAT VIEW, SHRIMP... BECAUSE I'M NEVER MAKING YOU BIG AGAIN.\"  You try to run away in an opposite direction, but in one swift motion she stomps her foot in front of you, blocking your path.  The impact of the massive foot crashing down in your way is enough to throw you several feet and you land hard on your back, looking up at the giant goth girl who's got you right where she wants you.  \"ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?  YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME, I'M TOO BIG!  YOU'RE NOT GETTING AWAY FROM ME THAT EASILY, YOU FUCKING RAT.\"  You are right where she wants you, frightened and tiny underneath her magnificent, powerful body.  What will she do to you?</span></div></div>",

BEG.  JUST LIKE ALL THE REST.\"  Your life flashes before your eyes as the girl's massive black boot raises up off of the ground and positions itself directly over you.  Acting on instinct alone, you saw the giant foot descend upon your location, and you took a running start to the side of the shoe.  Jumping out of the way, you feel the impact shake through your body as she steps down HARD.  You immediately get up and run some more, knowing that you only have a few seconds to recover as the goth girl notices she's missed her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH!  YOU LITTLE PEST!  JUST TAKE YOUR PUNISHMENT WITH DIGNITY AND DIE UNDER MY BOOT!\"  You manage to squirm your little body up behind a rack of clothes, taking a quick breather behind the stainless steel leg.  When you finally regain your composure, you take a peek behind you and see that the rack you're hiding behind is just a few feet away from the entrance to her store.  If you can manage to sneak past her, you may be able to make it out into the open where there's at least an OPPORTUNITY for you to be spotted by somebody else and taken to safety... or trampled in seconds by shoppers.  Either way, it's the better option than waiting to be stepped on by the creepy witch looking to kill you where you stand.  You are about to throw caution to the wind and make a run for it, when you notice the air around you begin to get more... humid than normal.  And an overpowering stench of sweat and leather is distracting you from your goal.  And that's when it hits you that you're not alone as you turn and face the largest pair of bare feet you've ever seen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's big toe was almost half as large as you were, and the other nine of them were wiggling in anticipation as you stared on in horror.  You panned up her gigantic legs to see that she was standing with her arms crossed, obviously amused by your shock as she chuckled deeply.  \"HEHE... I WAS WONDERING HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE YOU TO NOTICE ME.\"  You fall onto your bottom and scoot backwards, desperately trying to get some distance between you and the pale-skinned goddess that stands before you.  She didn't move any closer to you, instead merely tapping her foot, creating a powerful slapping noise as her sweaty soles hit the linoleum floor.  You were almost mesmerised by the girl's powerful feet, each toenail glistening in dark black polish.  \"DO MY FEET SMELL?  SORRY BUT I FIGURED I'D RATHER NOT SCUFF UP MY NEW SHOES WITH YOUR GUTS.  BESIDES... I THINK I'LL LOVE FEELING YOUR LITTLE LIFE END BETWEEN MY BARE TOES!\"  Your face goes almost as pale as the giantess's skin as you see the humongous foot raise up into the air, aiming directly for your puny body. You hold your arms up in vain as the huge sole comes crashing down on top of you!  </span></div></div>",

It is almost unbearable.  Yet fear keep you pinned to the ground.  Realizing you weren't running, her foot slows down as she takes her time with it.  You feel the soft skin of her arch hit your head and push you down onto the ground.  Her sole is now your entire world as the balls of her feet begin to press down on you.  The pressure is intense.  The last thing you hear before blacking out is her laughter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goth girl lifted her foot, seeing a red streak slathered over her foot.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A shadow overcomes you that is far too massive for you to escape. You turn your insect head up and all you can see is Madame Rosella's enormous foot speeding toward you. You catch a glimpse, between toes wiggling with anticipation for your demise, of a delighted grin on her face right before the gargantuan foot crushes your body.You hear and feel a sickening crunch throughout your whole being as you flatten. Your whole world becomes darkness as you're engulfed by the gypsy's sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel different. You expected to feel dead, whatever that should feel like. Yet things somehow feel more normal than before Madame Rosella stomped on you. Immediately after this change, you're overwhelmed with other sensations. The indescribable surrealness of being paper-flat. The overpowering, yet intoxicating smell of the foot flesh that surrounds you. The distinct lack of excruciating pain you would have expected to feel after getting squashed underfoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain in darkness for a moment, though the vibrations you can feel through the sole of the gypsy's foot that can only be her gleefully wiggling toes tell you she must be savoring how thoroughly she just crushed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the whole world moves and carries you along with it. The floor that you were just smashed against flies away from you as you realize Madame Rosella must be lifting her foot, with you stuck flat against it, to inspect her work. She doesn't find your remains on the floor, and then deduces the only place you could be. The floor disappears from view as the soft stinky world you're attached to rotates until your entire sky becomes Madame Rosella's, admittedly beautiful, face. At first she looks surprised, but then after a moment her head rolls back and your ears are assaulted with thunderous laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOKS LIKE I OVER DID IT,\" she cackles, \"I SQUASHED YOU SO HARD THAT IT BROKE THE SPELL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat must have been the change you felt before! You couldn't turn your head to look at yourself, but now that you thought about it, it felt like you had all your human parts back. The only difference being that you were the size of an ant, and were spread flat across the smelly foot of an attractive gypsy woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW LET'S SEE... YOU'RE NOT AN ANT ANYMORE, BUT YOU'RE AN ANT-SIZED MAN. AND...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly everything becomes a blur! You can barely register that you're seeing the ground again before the monstrous foot that's holding you captive is stomping you back into it. You're trapped in darkness again. your head spinning, but only for a moment. Before you can collect yourself or even process what's happening, the colossal gypsy's face comes back into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU APPEAR TO BE FAR, FAR MORE DURABLE THAN I INTENDED. OH, THIS IS INTERESTING,\" Madame Rosella muses, dragging out every syllable. A devilish grin spreads across her face. \"I THINK I'M REALLY GOING TO ENJOY THIS...\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">(Originally a chapter in my story \"Shrunken By Your Nerdy Friend\", but i felt it would work stronger as it's own story.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are walking through a carnival with your girlfriend, when you come across a tent for the fortune teller:  Madame Rosella.  The short gypsy woman is insulted by your comments towards her, and decides to make you feel small... in one way or another.  You are shocked to find out that she has some unusual powers... among them are the power to shrink anything down to the size of a grain of sand, and the power to grow herself several miles tall!  You should have watched your tongue, because before you know it you're going to find yourself under the gypsy woman's big toe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is mostly a size-changing story focused on either the gypsy growing huge or making another woman grow instead, or shrinking you to tiny size.  There are however options for femdom and mind control deviations as you see fit.  Just keep the toilet stuff to a minimum and the rest is up to you.  Have fun!  GP's for good additions!</td>",
